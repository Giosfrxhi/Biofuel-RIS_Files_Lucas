AB  - Since an understanding of how runoff is generated is of great importance to soil conservation, to water availability and to the management of a watershed, the objective of this study was to understand the generation of surface runoff in a watershed covered by sugarcane and riparian forest. Nine surface runoff plots were set up, evenly distributed on the lower, middle and upper slopes. The lower portion was covered by riparian forest. We showed that the average surface runoff coefficient along the slope in the present study was higher than in other studies under different land uses. Furthermore, the surface runoff was higher under sugarcane compared to the riparian forest, especially after sugarcane harvesting. Besides land cover, other factors such as the characteristics of rainfall events, relief and physical soil characteristics such as soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity influenced the surface runoff generation.

AB  - Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) are key for woody-biomass production and management systems because they constitute renewable energy feedstocks for biofuels, bioenergy, and bioproducts that can be strategically located in the landscape. This study evaluates the potential biomass production of Paulownia elongate x fortunei and two of their clones (Cotevisa 2 and Suntzu 11) under short-rotation management in six different locations in Andalusia (S Spain). According the findings, Cotevisa 2 appeared to be most productive (1.8 fold higher) in terms of biomass than Suntzu 11. Also, significantly higher woody-biomass yield was registered for both clones ranging between 7.2 and 14.0 t ha-1 d.m. in Villanueva del Río y Minas (Sevilla province). By contrast, significantly lower paulownia biomass production was found at Palma del Río (Córdoba province) between 1.7 and 2.3 t ha-1 d.m. As with biomass yield, both Cotevisa 2 and Suntzu 11 paulownia clones at Villanueva del Río y Minas (Sevilla) registered significantly higher carbon amounts (7.4 and 3.2 t C ha-1 d.m., respectively). These findings highlight that these renewable-energy sources offer important advantage in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, and thus attention has been drawn to other environmental benefits and impacts associated with these systems that may offer other potential public benefits.

AB  - Background: Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic prokaryotes that exhibit robust growth under diverse environmental conditions with minimal nutritional requirements. They can use solar energy to convert CO2 and other reduced carbon sources into biofuels and chemical products. The genus Cyanothece includes unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria that have been shown to offer high levels of hydrogen production and nitrogen fixation. The reconstruction of quality genome-scale metabolic models for organisms with limited annotation resources remains a challenging task.Results: Here we reconstruct and subsequently analyze and compare the metabolism of five Cyanothece strains, namely Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424, 7425, 7822, 8801 and 8802, as the genome-scale metabolic reconstructions iCyc792, iCyn731, iCyj826, iCyp752, and iCyh755 respectively. We compare these phylogenetically related Cyanothece strains to assess their bio-production potential. A systematic workflow is introduced for integrating and prioritizing annotation information from the Universal Protein Resource (Uniprot), NCBI Protein Clusters, and the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) method. The genome-scale metabolic models include fully traced photosynthesis reactions and respiratory chains, as well as balanced reactions and GPR associations. Metabolic differences between the organisms are highlighted such as the non-fermentative pathway for alcohol production found in only Cyanothece 7424, 8801, and 8802.Conclusions: Our development workflow provides a path for constructing models using information from curated models of related organisms and reviewed gene annotations. This effort lays the foundation for the expedient construction of curated metabolic models for organisms that, while not being the target of comprehensive research, have a sequenced genome and are related to an organism with a curated metabolic model. Organism-specific models, such as the five presented in this paper, can be used to identify optimal genetic manipulations for targeted metabolite overproduction as well as to investigate the biology of diverse organisms. © 2013 Mueller et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Biochars produced from meat and bonemeal (MBM) waste materials contain large amounts of calcium phosphate and are potentially useful sorbents for the remediation of metals. Because the reactivity of biochars depends strongly upon the conditions used in their production, the objective of this study was to evaluate the rates and mechanisms of Zn sorption onto a commercially supplied MBM biochar prior to its application in a field-scale revegetation project. Sorption experiments varying pH, time, and Zn concentration found that, above pH 6.1, Zn adsorbed to MBM biochar quickly (within 5 h) with a maximum adsorption capacity of 0.65 mmol Zn g-1. Synchrotron-based Zn K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was consistent with a tetrahedral Zn bound to phosphate groups in a monodentate inner-sphere surface complex for all conditions tested. With an acidification pretreatment and at more acidic pH, MBM biochar causes precipitation of a ZnPO4 phase. On the basis of these results, this MBM biochar has a high capacity to rapidly adsorb Zn in adsorption experiments and can be considered a promising sorbent for Zn remediation of contaminated soils. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The increasing global demand for food, fibers, and biofuels has made investments in agriculture a priority for some governments and corporations eager to expand their agricultural production while securing good profits. Here we calculate the water appropriation associated with land deals at different negotiation and implementation stages. Using estimates of actual and potential evapotranspiration for the crops planted in the acquired land, we calculate the green and blue water appropriated by land investors under a variety of irrigation scenarios. We also determine the grey water footprint as the amount of water required to dilute to allowable standards the pollution resulting from fertilizer applications. We found that about 380 × 109 m 3 yr-1 of rainwater is appropriated with the 43 million ha of reported contract area acquired by agri-investors (&gt;240 × 10 9 m3 yr-1 in the 29 million ha of foreign acquisitions only). This water would be sufficient to feed ≈ 300-390 million people. Key Points Land and water grabbing are occurring at alarming rates. Grabbed water would be sufficient to improve food security in grabbed countries. Water grabbing is associated with water withdrawals increase ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The formation and development process of fuel spray has a great influence on fuel atomization, fuel evaporation, fuel-air mixing, and combustion, which can further influence the properties of a diesel engine. The atomization process and its quality are affected not only by the mutual friction between the fuel spray and ambient air, but also by the flow behavior in the nozzle orifice such as the cavitation effect and the turbulent flow among which the flow disturbance induced by the cavitation is the first important factor effecting the atomization of fuel spray. A lot of research studies on an alternative fuel, Jatropha curcas oil (JCO), for diesel fuel have been carried out by both domestic and international scholars with the focus mainly on the preparation methods, and physical and chemical properties as well as the performance and the pollutant emissions of a diesel engine fueled with JCO. Nevertheless, the issues related to a systematic study of the cavitation flow and the spray outflow characteristics, which have a great influence on the injection and atomization of JCO, are seldom reported. In the present paper, a three-dimensional gas-liquid two-phase model of cavitation flow was developed, which took the influence of injection conditions on fuel viscosity, fuel density, and bubble number density into consideration. After the validity of the model was verified, a three-dimensional numerical simulation that was about the influences of injection pressure, injection back pressure and fuel temperature on the cavitation flow of JCO in a diesel nozzle was carried out. The results showed that: the mean flow velocity at outlet (MFVO) and the mass flow rate is enhanced gradually with the increment of injection pressure, and the discharge coefficient decreases simultaneously. However, the cavitation effect does not change significantly. The injection backpressure has little influence on the flow characteristics of JCO in the diesel nozzle. MFVO, mass flow rate, and discharge coefficient raise remarkably with the increment of JCO temperature, and at the same time, the cavitation effect is significantly enhanced. The cavitation effect and MFVO of JCO are lower than those of diesel fuel under the same injection condition, but whether the mass flow rate and the discharge coefficient of JCO are higher than those of diesel fuel also depends on the fuel temperature. The results obtained indicate that the increment of JCO temperature will remarkably enhance the cavitation effect, strengthen the flow disturbance, and improve MFVO and the cycle fuel injection quantity, which are beneficial for the fuel injection, atomization, and the performance of a diesel engine. The research can provide references for in-depth analysis on the working process of diesel engine fueled with JCO.

AB  - A substantial part of European lowland woodlands was managed as coppices or wood pastures for millennia. However, traditional management forms were almost completely abandoned in Central Europe by the middle of the 20th century. Combined with the effects of nitrogen deposition and herbivore pressure, shifts in management resulted in biodiversity loss affecting particularly light-demanding oligotrophic plant species. Experimental thinning was applied in a former oak coppice-with-standards in an attempt to restore vanishing understorey plant communities. Two levels of thinning intensity and zero management as control were used on 90 plots. Ten years after the treatment, significant changes in species composition and diversity were observed in heavily thinned plots, while moderate thinning had mostly insignificant effects. Light-demanding oligotrophic species significantly increased, indicating positive consequences of restoration. However, heavy thinning also brought about the expansion of native ruderal species. Alien species remained unchanged. We conclude that the restoration of coppice-with-standards can be an efficient tool to support vanishing light-demanding woodland species. Combined with biodiversity benefits, the increasing demand for biofuel may contribute to the renaissance of traditional management forms in forestry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coal, natural gas and petroleum-based liquid fuels are still the most widely used energy sources in modern society. The current scenario contrasts with the foreseen shortage of petroleum that was spread out in the beginning of the XXI century, when the concept of "energy security" emerged as an urgent agenda to ensure a good balance between energy supply and demand. Much beyond protecting refineries and oil ducts from terrorist attacks, these issues soon developed to a portfolio of measures related to process sustainability, involving at least three fundamental dimensions: (a) the need for technological breakthroughs to improve energy production worldwide; (b) the improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of modern society; and (c) the increase of the social perception that education is a key-word towards a better use of our energy resources. Together with these technological, economic or social issues, "energy security" is also strongly influenced by environmental issues involving greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity in environmentally sensitive areas, pollution and poor solid waste management. For these and other reasons, the implementation of more sustainable practices in our currently available industrial facilities and the search for alternative energy sources that could partly replace the fossil fuels became a major priority throughout the world. Regarding fossil fuels, the main technological bottlenecks are related to the exploitation of less accessible petroleum resources such as those in the pre-salt layer, ranging from the proper characterization of these deep-water oil reservoirs, the development of lighter and more efficient equipment for both exploration and exploitation, the optimization of the drilling techniques, the achievement of further improvements in production yields and the establishment of specialized training programs for the technical staff. The production of natural gas from shale is also emerging in several countries but its production in large scale has several problems ranging from the unavoidable environmental impact of shale mining as well as to the bad consequences of its large scale exploitation in the past. The large scale use of coal has similar environmental problems, which are aggravated by difficulties in its proper characterization. Also, the mitigation of harmful gases and particulate matter that are released as a result of combustion is still depending on the development of new gas cleaning technologies including more efficient catalysts to improve its emission profile. On the other hand, biofuels are still struggling to fulfill their role in reducing our high dependence on fossil fuels. Fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) from vegetable oils and ethanol from cane sucrose and corn starch are mature technologies whose market share is partially limited by the availability of their raw materials. For this reason, there has been a great effort to develop "second-generation" technologies to produce methanol, ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, biogas (methane), bio-oils, syngas and synthetic fuels from lower grade renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic materials whose consumption would not interfere with the rather sensitive issues of food security. Advanced fermentation processes are envisaged as "third generation" technologies and these are primarily linked to the use of algae feedstocks as well as other organisms that could produce biofuels or simply provide microbial biomass for the processes listed above. Due to the complexity and cost of their production chain, "third generation" technologies usually aim at high value added biofuels such as biojet fuel, biohydrogen and hydrocarbons with a fuel performance similar to diesel or gasoline, situations in which the use of genetically modified organisms is usually required. In general, the main challenges in this field could be summarized as follows: (a) the need for prospecting alternative sources of biomass that are not linked to the food chain; (b) the intensive use of green chemistry principles in our current industrial activities; (c) the development of mature technologies for the production of second and third generation biofuels; (d) the development of safe bioprocesses that are based on environmentally benign microorganisms; (e) the scale-up of potential technologies to a suitable demonstration scale; and (f) the full understanding of the technological and environmental implications of the food vs. fuel debate. On the basis of these, the main objective of this article is to stimulate the discussion and help the decision making regarding "energy security" issues and their challenges for modern society, in such a way to encourage the participation of the Brazilian Chemistry community in the design of a road map for a safer, sustainable and prosper future for our nation.

AB  - Biofuels, liquid fuels derived from biological materials such as crop plants, forest products, or waste materials, have been widely promoted as a means to reduce dependence of our transportation systems on fossil fuels and to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming. The primary forms of biofuels are ethanol, made from sugars, starches, cellulose, and other plant structural components, and biodiesel, made from oils produced by plants. Many countries, including the United States and members of the European Union, have adopted production and use targets for biofuels. The promise of biofuels as a renewable, environmentally friendly energy source, combined with these mandates, has driven a worldwide expansion in their production. However, many questions remain about how to produce biofuels without causing new and unanticipated environmental impacts. In this report we summarize the environmental effects of biofuels, illustrate some uncertainties about these effects, and identify topics for an integrated research program aimed at clarifying tradeoffs and reducing uncertainties in planning for sustainable biofuels production. Our considerations include effects on GHG emissions, soil carbon, water supply and quantity, land use, and biodiversity. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Energy shortfalls are becoming more and more serious all over the world, and worldwide governments have tried to promote the development of biofuels in order to mitigate the climatic impacts of massive fossil fuel consumption. Since the land is the main input factor of the bioenergy production, the development of biofuels will inevitably lead to change of the land use structure and allocation and thereby affect the climate system. With Central Europe as the study area, this study explored the impacts of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on climate under the influence of demand of bioenergy production for land resources. First, the land use structure from 2010 to 2050 is simulated with the Agriculture and Land Use model in MiniCam. The result indicates that the main conversion will be mainly from grassland and forest to cropland and from cropland to grassland. Then the Dynamics of Land System model was used to spatially simulate the LUCC in the future. The impacts of LUCC on the climate were analyzed on the basis of simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The climate change will be characterized by the increase of latent heat flux and temperature and the decrease of precipitation. © 2013 Fang Yin et al.

AB  - Increasing demand for agricultural commodities such as grain for feed and feedstocks for biofuels are driving rapid land use change. We studied the effect of agricultural land-use change on two historical land use types for three different cropping systems using eddy covariance and ecosystem carbon balance approaches. We quantified the consequences of establishing corn, switchgrass, and mixed prairie species on cropland under a recent corn-soybean rotation and on set-aside land planted for 20 years to smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) enrolled in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We converted three CRP and three cropland fields to no-till soybeans in 2009 (conversion year) and then established fields of corn, switchgrass, and mixed prairie species in fields formerly cropland or CRP. In addition, one CRP perennial grassland site was kept undisturbed as a reference. We measured the harvestable biomass during the conversion and over the two following years. To account for C removed in harvestable biomass we calculated adjusted Net Ecosystem Production (NEPadj; gCm-2yr-1) as NEP measured by eddy covariance plus harvested biomass. During the conversion year, fields converted from historical CRP grassland exhibited net C emissions between 261 and 340gCm-2yr-1. The sites established on recent cropland emitted 37-42gCm-2yr-1. The undisturbed reference site sequestered (rather than emitted) 35gCm-2yr-1. Cumulative NEPadj over the entire 3-year period at the sites converted from CRP grasslands was 170, 740, and 885gCm-2 for switchgrass, corn, and mixed prairie systems, respectively. At the former cropland sites, cumulative NEPadj was 214, 364, and 446gCm-2 for mixed prairie, corn, and switchgrass systems, respectively. Over this period the reference site had an NEP of -260±30gCm-2. Land use change to biofuel crops thus induced large C emissions, even when renewable energy production was included as a fossil fuel carbon offset. The most productive perennial systems had lowest overall C losses. Accounting for fossil fuel offset credits generated from harvested biomass completely attenuated CO2 emissions in the CRP site converted to switchgrass and partially attenuated emissions in all other converted sites. These results can be readily incorporated into management recommendations for future establishment of biofuels feedstock and row agriculture systems with different management intensities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Similarly to other EU countries, Italy began subsidizing electric energy production from renewable sources such as biogas. This proved to be an inefficient way of using available resources. In the Po Valley-the most productive agricultural area in Italy-the share of corn area used for biogas production increased from 0.4% in 2007 to more than 10% in 2012, reaching 18.2% in Lombardy. This, in a framework of declining acreage due to Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, increases demand, competition for land, and agricultural prices, therefore pushing up production cost for livestock and, consequently, famous Italian quality products. Italy has started reforming its energy policy by incentivizing the construction of small manurebased biogas plants but more can and has to be done to promote a more efficient utilization of biogas, which, for example, can be upgraded into biomethane (with relatively low energy requirements) and injected into the natural gas grid. © 2014 AgBioForum.

AB  - Energy is essential for economic development of the world. The global economy runs on the energy. The global economy depends on the fossil fuels but due to limited availability, land and water degradation and highly polluted limited the use of fossil fuels. Biofuel can be an alternative to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel and assist to maintain environment pollution free and economic suitability. Microalgae appear to be the source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global energy demands. Microalgae use sun light and CO2 for their growth. Oil productivity of many microalgae greatly exceeds the oil productivity of the other crops. In a large scale plant, release of solvent contributes to the production of atmospheric smog and to global warming and is classified as a hazardous air pollutant. Thus, in order to reduce the waste water pollutant, increasing the FAME yields, reducing the production cost some more production technique should be introduced. This papers review the various production methodology for biodiesel production from microalgae. © Research India Publications.

AB  - For forest soils, which are naturally acidic, there is only a limited number of reports, concerning their cation exchange capacity (CEC) controlling mechanisms and on the possible impacts of acidic deposition, climate change and increasing harvesting pressure for biofuels. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to characterise the cation exchange capacity of forest soils (Dystric and Eutric Cambisols) under beech stands (Fagus sylvatica L.) from the Central range of the Balkan mountain and from the Osogovo Mountain. The cationexchange properties have been analyzed following the methodology of Ganev and Arsova (1980). The cation exchange capacity (T8.2) in the surface horizons of soil samples from the Balkan mountain vary within a wide range of 10.6 cmol.kg-1 to 20.9 cmol.kg-1. For the soil from the Osogovo Mountain, the total cationexchange capacity was higher ranging from 18.4 cmol.kg-1 - 34.4 cmol.kg-1. The concentrations of negatively charged strongly acid exchangeable sites (TCA) were from 6.0 to 15.5 cmol.kg-1, for the soil from the Balkan mountain, while for the Osogovo Mountain - they were about two times higher - from 12.0 cmol.kg-1 to 27.1 cmol.kg-1. A similar trend for the exchangeable aluminium (Ale) values for the surface horizons of the Balkan mountain soil (from 1.0 cmol.kg-1 to 2.5 cmol.kg-1) and of the Osogovo Mountain, soil (from 1.6 cmol.kg-1, to 5.9 cmol.kg-1) was established. The slight increase in the content of Ale in the soil from Osogovo Mountain suggests a stronger destruction of Al-bearing minerals, most probably due to isomorphic substitutions. It was found that podzolization was occurring more pronouncedly in the soils of the Balkan mountain. The base saturation (BS) in the studied soils varies from 33.0 to 75.0% of the total cation exchange capacity. For all studied sampling sites, the negative charges of soil colloids which behave as strong acids (TCA) exceed the BS values, due to the additional proportion of H+ and Al3+ acidic cations.

AB  - Moringa oleifera is becoming increasingly popular as an industrial crop due to its multitude of useful attributes as water purifier, nutritional supplement and biofuel feedstock. Given its tolerance to sub-optimal growing conditions, most of the current and anticipated cultivation areas are in medium to low rainfall areas. This study aimed to assess the effect of various irrigation levels on floral initiation, flowering and fruit set. Three treatments namely, a 900mm (900IT), 600mm (600IT) and 300mm (300IT) per annum irrigation treatment were administered through drip irrigation, simulating three total annual rainfall amounts. Individual inflorescences from each treatment were tagged during floral initiation and monitored throughout until fruit set. Flower bud initiation was highest at the 300IT and lowest at the 900IT for two consecutive growing seasons. Fruit set on the other hand, decreased with the decrease in irrigation treatment. Floral abortion, reduced pollen viability as well as moisture stress in the style were contributing factors to the reduction in fruiting/yield observed at the 300IT. Moderate water stress prior to floral initiation could stimulate flower initiation, however, this should be followed by sufficient irrigation to ensure good pollination, fruit set and yield.

AB  - Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is an anaerobic thermophilic bacterium of special interest for use in the consolidated bioprocessing of plant biomass to biofuels. In the course of experiments to engineer pyruvate metabolism in C. bescii, we isolated a mutant of C. bescii that contained an insertion in the l-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldh). PCR amplification and sequencing of the ldh gene from this mutant revealed a 1,609-bp insertion that contained a single open reading frame of 479 amino acids (1,440 bp) annotated as a hypothetical protein with unknown function. The ORF is flanked by an 8-base direct repeat sequence. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that this ORF is part of a novel transposable element, ISCbe4, which is only intact in the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, but has ancient relatives that are present in degraded (and previously unrecognized) forms across many bacterial and archaeal clades.

AB  - Promoting sustainability by boosting projects enhancing biomass utilization turned out to be a nested type of a wicked problem for the EU, if only for the unbalanced competition for (productive) land and diverse biomasses. Within the EU-scheme of Interregional collaboration it boiled down to develop a coherent set of very regionally specific projects each with a lasting sustainable impact. How to manage it? The EU promoted project development by using a combination of first top-down stratified invitations, and second bottom-up self-organization by the interested parties, backed up with light EU-coaching and basic facilitation, while requiring regional co-funding. It resulted in the ARBOR-project, which comprises of 15 actions, ranging from the realization of gas-grid injection from highroad-verges grass biogas-plants, via synergy park development, till of a city center biomass hub for woodstoves heating system. © 2013 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

AB  - Research addressing the implications of forest harvesting for mammals has focused on different categories of silvicultural prescriptions. However, the effects of these prescriptions on forest structure can vary considerably, and categories of prescriptions rarely incorporate the market for which timber is being harvested. The latter information is important given the recent shift from conventional round-wood harvesting to wholetree removal for biofuels production, and corresponding reductions in post-harvest woody biomass left on-site. Our goal was to assess the effects of forest harvesting for biofuels on mammal species. Objectives included 1) evaluating how structural components influenced mammals, and 2) assessing the role of scale on species-habitat relationships. We sampled mammals in a 97-ha area of hardwood forest in the Adirondack Mountains in New York that had been partially harvested for biofuels in 2010. We used Sherman traps and track plates to assess the distribution of mammals. We captured 6 species of mammals in Sherman traps and identified 8 species using track plates. Mammalian species varied in their sensitivity to changes in habitat characteristics associated with biofuels harvest (coarse woody debris and slash). Our study reveals a complex suite of factors driving the response of mammals to variation in forest structure as a result of biofuels production. The harvesting practices used in the focal region are unlikely to lead to dramatic changes in the abundance and distribution of individual species of small mammals, but may influence the occurrence of common species including deer-mice and voles.

AB  - Scarcity and non-renewable nature of petroleum based liquid fuels have made them an un-reliable source of energy. Excessive greenhouse gas emissions and the associated effects on global warming have become noteworthy environmental, economic and social threats. In this milieu, the development of renewable, carbonneutral and sustainable alternative energy sources has become inevitable. Biofuels have been found a promising alternative and a driving force for modern world. Different feed-stocks have been evaluated for biofuels production to date but microalgae have been found the most attractive due to their higher growth productivity, higher lipid contents, non-competitive nature with human food and their ability to grow on non-arable land using brackish or waste water. However, there are a number of technological barriers that are still questioning the economic feasibility and competitiveness of such biofuels. On the other hand, there are also a number of trade opportunities if we pay attention to the use of integrated system following the bio-refinery concept. Bio-refinery concept reflects the production of value added by-products along with the biofuels, contributing to an overall escalation of the economic feasibility of the whole system. These types of systems may help to progress the competitiveness of biodiesel production using microalgae as a potential feedstock. This paper reviews the most recent and relevant information on such integrated systems. Several aspects related to the treatment of municipal and animal wastewater with simultaneous recovery of microalgae and the potential of biodiesel production are discussed. Bio-refinery concept also presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective production of biodiesel coupled with valuable non-fuel by-products.

AB  - A concern of many environmentalists is that the use of biomass energy will decimate the forests. Searchinger et al. examined this issue related to corn ethanol and suggested that substituting corn ethanol for petroleum would increase carbon emissions associated with the land conversion abroad necessary to offset the decline in corn availability.1,2 Associated with these concerns is the overall issue of climate change.3 This issue is broader than simply corn. If agricultural croplands are drawn into the production of biofuel feedstocks, commodity prices are expected to rise, triggering land conversions overseas, releasing carbon emissions, and offsetting the carbon reductions expected from bioenergy. Using a general stylized forest sector management model, our study examines the economic potential of traditional industrial forests and supplemental dedicated fuelwood plantations to produce biomass on submarginal lands. It finds that these sources can economically produce large levels of biomass without compromising crop production, thereby mitigating the land conversion and carbon emissions effects posited by the Searchinger Hypothesis. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

AB  - Global attention on biofuels and the potential for Jatropha curcas to produce biodiesel from marginal land with low inputs has recently created world-wide interest in this species. This paper reports on the water dynamics and productivity of J. curcas in a silvopastoral experiment with Pennisetum clandestinum at the Ukulinga research farm of the University of KwaZulu-Natal near Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Measurements of daily total evaporation rates during December-February (summer) on clear hot days ranged between 3 and 4mmd-1. However, due to the deciduous nature of the species, water use was negligible (&lt;1mmd-1) during winter (May-August). The results have shown that two- to four-year-old J. curcas trees were conservative water users. High oil yields are unlikely due to the low seed production. The best seed yield was in 2009 (348.8kgha-1) in the J. curcas only plots. The other treatments (where pasture competition was a factor) ranged between 77.8 and 166kgha-1. Data collected on the time taken by labourers to harvest and dehusk the seeds, showed that 1kg of seed took approximately 3h to process, suggesting that mechanical harvesting would be necessary to make seed production economically viable. J. curcas showed a low tolerance to pests and was prone to diseases. This significantly increased the input costs for insecticides and fungicides. The South African results are so unequivocal that J. curcas under the experimental conditions does not fulfil the claims that it is a wonder biodiesel plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel expansion is happening rapidly within Southern Africa, and already tens of thousands of hectares have been planted, with millions more being contemplated. As is expected with such a new and dynamic industry, this development has taken place in a relatively ad hoc fashion with the various role-players adapting as they respond to lessons learnt from experience, a changing policy environment and other external factors such as the global recession of 2008/2009. This emerging industry is extremely diverse and it is clear that biofuel projects differ enormously in their intent, feedstock choice and management practices. Some projects aim at satisfying local fuel self sufficiency whilst others focus on national and export markets driven by mandatory blending targets. In addition the area planted by a single farmer or company can range from under 1ha intercropped with food crops to monocropped plantations of tens of thousands of hectares. In attempting to understand the potential sustainability of the industry there is a clear need for a typology which groups projects with common sustainability issues and concerns. Comparing like with like can greatly reduce the complexity of the biofuel debate; help identify areas of most concern and assists in identifying strategies for enhancing sustainability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Through careful management and policy formulation, modern bioenergy programmes could be important for rural development globally. Discussions over sustainable bioenergy use are focused on high level mechanisms (e.g. certification and legislation), led by developed world institutions. Full stakeholder participation, involving all relevant groups, is vital to successfully incorporating sustainability into planning. Getting equal engagement in multi stakeholder consultation (MSC) is challenging, but a structured approach to analysing stakeholder dynamics to improve this situation has been trialled; summed up as: (1) Context analysis; (2) Identification of feedstock production models; (3) Mapping according to land size and ownership, market end use and scale; (4) Typology of production models; (5) Social mapping. Learning from Social Impact Assessment and Sustainability Assessment methodologies has been used in developing this approach. Five models of Jatropha curcas L.-based seed production in the Indian State of Chhattisgarh were identified and stakeholders from relevant groups at all levels consulted. The significant distinctions separating feedstock production models were found to be: land ownership and value chain; and market end use and route. When analysing social impacts locally it was important to consider risks and responsibilities of different groups. Local- and context-specific assessments, such as those undertaken here, are essential in planning for sustainable bioenergy production; although not at the expense of higher level mechanisms. A priori, informed stakeholder interrogation and social mapping, building on detailed context analysis, are presented as practical approaches to increase the likelihood of successful MSC and sustainability analysis, making it a more viable policy making tool. © 2013.

AB  - There is potential for Jatropha curcas production in South Africa especially in silvopastoral systems where the co-occurrence of oil production and grazing results in the optimal use of increasingly limited land. However, in South Africa there is a moratorium on J. curcas cultivation due to insufficient information on this species. The aim of this study was to assess the potential growth and suitability of J. curcas in silvopastoral systems. For such systems to succeed there needs to be limited competition between J. curcas and the forage component and the former must not be at risk to defoliation by livestock. The effect on the growth of 15-month old J. curcas trees by neighbouring forage species was addressed by removing planted pastures at 0, 60, 120 and 300cm from the base of J. curcas individuals. Final height, basal diameter and percentage leaf abscission of trees with pasture removed up to 60 and 120cm away did not differ significantly from treatments with the greatest and least amount of competition. Therefore, removing up to 60cm will allow for growth similar to that of trees with 300cm of pastures removal while still providing sufficient pasture for grazing. The palatability of J. curcas was determined through two two-choice and three-choice trials. Since goats spent <3.77% of their time browsing J. curcas it is a suitable candidate for silvopastoral systems provided that surrounding vegetation is removed at a recommended distance of 60cm from the base of the tree. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different economic and environmental theories and approaches have been used to date to evaluate effectiveness of biofuels policies, efficiency of biofuels production or sustainability of different biofuels technologies. The most commonly known approaches include, e.g., Life Cycle Analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, contingent valuation, GIS-based models, and market and price related analysis. This paper is focused on a multi-objective decision analysis that, although well established in economic and environmental evaluation theory, has not been widely used yet to assess biofuels production or policies.The paper presents a fuzzy set theory based multi-objective framework for evaluating conventional and advanced biofuels feedstocks in the US; considering uncertainties of decision-making processes. It incorporates fuzzy set theory, expert elicitation and the PROMETHEE approach to determine the sustainability potential of the feedstocks in terms of multiple economic, environmental and social policy objectives. The study shows algae and switchgrass to be the most sustainable feedstocks, while corn that is currently the most important feedstock for ethanol production in the US, has the lowest sustainability potential among the analyzed feedstocks.The study presents an example of a participatory approach and recommends its application for designing policy measures in an interactive process with policymakers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil is a major sugarcane producer and São Paulo State cultivates 5.5 million hectares, close to 50% of Brazil's sugarcane area. The rapid increase in production has brought into question the sustainability of biofuels, especially considering the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated to the agricultural sector. Despite the significant progress towards the green harvest practices, 1.67 million hectares were still burned in São Paulo State during the 2011 harvest season. Here an emissions inventory for the life cycle of sugarcane agricultural production is estimated using IPCC methodologies, according to the agriculture survey data and remote sensing database. Our hypothesis is that 1.67 million hectares shall be converted from burned to green harvest scenarios up to years 2021 (rate 1), 2014 (rate 2) or 2029 (rate 3). Those conversions would represent a significant GHG mitigation, ranging from 50.5 to 70.9 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2eq) up to 2050, depending on the conversion rate and the green harvest systems adopted: conventional (scenario S1) or conservationist management (scenario S2). We show that a green harvest scenario where crop rotation and reduced soil tillage are practiced has a higher mitigation potential (70.9Mt CO2eq), which is already practiced in some of the sugarcane areas. Here we support the decision to not just stop burning prior to harvest, but also to consider other better practices in sugarcane areas to have a more sustainable sugarcane based ethanol production in the most dense cultivated sugarcane region in Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - China's forest bioenergy policies are evolving against the backdrop of pressing national energy challenges similar to those faced by OECD countries, and chronic rural energy challenges more characteristic of developing countries. Modern forest bioenergy could contribute to solutions to both of these challenges. However, because of limitations in current technologies and institutions, significant policy and resource commitments would be required to make breakthroughs in either commercializing forest bioenergy or modernizing rural energy systems in China. Given the potential attention, funding, and resource trade-offs between these two goals, we provide an argument for why the focus of China's forest bioenergy policy should initially be on addressing rural energy challenges. The paper concludes with a discussion on strategies for laying the groundwork for a modern, biomass-based energy infrastructure in rural China. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This special issue has presented some of the specific findings of the RE-Impact Project which was commissioned and funded by the EuropeAid Cooperation Office from 2007 until its conclusion in 2010. The project aimed to provide impact assessment frameworks and influence relevant policies through direct involvement in bioenergy projects and policy analysis in South Africa, Uganda, India and China. The papers summarised here have covered issues related to Jatropha curcas and forest-based bioenergy in these countries. Taking an overall look at the project findings we can identify a number of general conclusions relevant for the future of bioenergy and rural development in Africa and Asia. First, only local and context-specific sustainability assessment can identify the risk and responsibilities of the different groups and the exact impact on the environment. Second, many initiatives both in biofuels and forest-based bioenergy are marred by a lack of understanding of the life-cycle financial analysis. Third, careful consideration of local physical and social conditions and the economics of the production chain can identify real opportunities for rural development using bioenergy. The current global impasse in bioenergy policies could actually be advantageous to the development of bioenergy in developing countries. Without the pressure from America and Europe to develop bioenergy systems for climate change mitigation, countries in Africa and Asia may have the breathing room to shape bioenergy systems for their own internal energy supply in an orderly fashion. However, in order to avoid environmental and social impacts it will be necessary to articulate together elements of a number of measures including market-based certification, national policy formulation, national legislation, impact assessments, sustainability planning, land use planning, research, monitoring and evaluation taking into account country and project specific sustainability criteria. Unfortunately, many of the countries in Africa and Asia where bioenergy can play an important role still lack institutional structures able to articulate this sustainable development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To identify more effective but less toxic compositions of organic solvent mixtures for biodiesel production from Chlorella vulgaris, 15 different organic solvents were examined and compared for their power of lipid extraction from algal biomass. When solvents were individually examined, methanol showed the best efficiency for the extraction of fatty acids, followed by dichloromethane. Although chloroform resulted in yields which were equal to or greater than those of other solvents, it showed a very low fatty acid content and a high level of unknown impurities when analyzed by gas-chromatography (GC). Furthermore, solvent mixtures were applied in order to determine the optimal composition for a high lipid extraction efficiency, using chloroform, methanol and dichloromethane. Through comparison of compositions using the Bligh and Dyers method, the best composition was to be methanol:dichloromethane (1:1). Our findings resulted in a 25% increase of lipid extraction yield, together with C16, C16:2, C18:2 as major components from C. vulgaris. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dramatic increases in liquid biofuel production have led to concerns about associated impacts on food prices, with many modeling studies showing significant biofuel-related price inflation. In turn, by changing patterns of food demand, biofuel production may indirectly influence greenhouse gas emissions. We estimated changes to dietary energy (calorie) demand and greenhouse gas emissions embodied in average diets under different biofuel-related food-price scenarios for Brazil, China and the United States, using food-price projections and food-price elasticities. Average energy demand decreased in all countries, from about 40. kcal per person per day in Brazil under a moderate price inflation scenario - a reduction of 1% relative to the (2009) reference scenario - to nearly 300 per day in the United States with high price inflation - almost 8% of reference levels. However, emissions per calorie increased slightly in all three countries. In terms of total greenhouse gas emissions, the results are suggestive of overall reductions only in the United States, where average reductions ranged from about 40 to 110. kg of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per person per year. In China, the direction of impact is unclear, but the net change is likely to be small. Brazilian results were sensitive to parameter values and the direction and magnitude of impact is therefore uncertain. Despite the uncertainty, even small changes (positive or negative) in individual dietary emissions can produce large changes at the population level, arguing for the inclusion of the dietary pathway in greenhouse gas accounting of liquid biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel production, while highly contested, is supported by a number of policies worldwide. Ethiopia was among the first sub-Saharan countries to devise a biofuel policy strategy to guide the associated demand toward sustainable development. In this paper, I discuss Ethiopia's biofuel policy from an interpretative research position using a frames approach and argue that useful insights can be obtained by paying more attention to national contexts and values represented in the debates on whether biofuel production can or will contribute to sustainable development. To this end, I was able to distinguish three major frames used in the Ethiopian debate on biofuels: an environmental rehabilitation frame, a green revolution frame and a legitimacy frame. The article concludes that actors advocating for frames related to social and human issues have difficulties entering the debate and forming alliances, and that those voices need to be included in order for Ethiopia to develop a sustainable biofuel sector.

AB  - Liquid fuels will remain valued energy carriers well into any upcoming period when CO2 reductions are sought. Biofuels are the presumed replacement for the petroleum-based transportation fuels that dominate liquid fuel use. Lifecycle analysis embeds a closed-loop model of biofuel-related carbon flows, making net CO2 uptake an assumption to be refuted. However, evaluating net CO2 uptake through dynamic industrial and agriforestry supply chains at real-world commercial scales is extremely difficult. All such estimates carry a great deal of doubt and cannot be verified empirically. A different perspective follows by anchoring analysis in the certainty that end-use CO2 emissions from biofuels are essentially the same as those of the petroleum fuels they replace. A first-order model of the globally coupled bio- and fossil-fuel system reveals conditions for biofuel use to provide an atmospheric benefit. No benefit occurs in the energy sectors where biofuels are used, but rather must be found elsewhere in locations of carbon absorption or retention. The implication is that climate mitigation efforts should focus on such locations and include any mechanisms through which net uptake (an enhanced sink or verifiable offset) can be achieved by biological, chemical, geological or other means. Although biofuels can play a mitigation role when certain conditions are met, deemphasizing biofuel production in favor of terrestrial carbon management may offer more immediate and effective ways to counterbalance the CO2 emitted when using carbon-based liquid fuels of any origin. Climate policies for transportation fuels should be reconsidered accordingly. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding the success of habitat generalist species requires knowledge of how individuals respond to stressors that vary across habitats within landscapes. Habitat structure can affect stress by altering predation risk, conspecific densities, and densities of heterospecific competitors. Increased demand for biofuels will alter habitat structure for species in agroecosystems worldwide. We measured stress responses of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)), a widespread habitat generalist, in a biofuels landscape. We quantified fecal corticosterone concentrations for individuals in four biofuel crops: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef&Deuter ex Hodkinson&Renvoize), mixed prairie, and corn (Zea mays L.).Wealso evaluated stress responses of deer mice to the annual harvesting of corn. Deer mice inhabiting switchgrass and mixed prairie had higher fecal corticosterone concentrations compared with mice in corn and miscanthus. Fecal corticosterone concentrations correlated positively with abundances of conspecifics and behaviorally dominant voles (prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster (Wagner, 1842); meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus (Ord, 1815)) across habitats.

AB  - Key message; Our study has identified pathways and gene candidates that may be associated with the greater flexibility and digestibility of the poplar cell walls. With the goal of facilitating lignin removal during the utilization of woody biomass as a biofuel feedstock, we previously transformed a hybrid poplar clone with a partial cDNA sequence encoding a tyrosine- and hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein from parsley. A number of the transgenic lines released more polysaccharides following protease digestion and were more flexible than wild-type plants, but otherwise normal in phenotype. Here, we report that overexpression of the tyrosine-rich peptide encoding sequence in these transgenic poplar plants did not significantly alter total lignin quantity or quality (S/G lignin ratio), five- and six-carbon sugar contents, growth rate, or susceptibility to a major poplar fungal pathogen, Septoria musiva. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed a total of 411 differentially expressed transcripts in transgenic lines, all with decreased transcript abundance relative to wild-type plants. Their corresponding genes were overrepresented in functional categories such as secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism. Transcript abundance was decreased primarily for five types of genes encoding proteins involved in cell-wall organization and in lignin biosynthesis. The expression of a subset of 19 of the differentially regulated genes by qRT-PCR validated the microarray results. Our study has identified pathways and gene candidates that may be the underlying cause for the enhanced flexibility and digestibility of the stems of poplar plants expressing the TYR transgene. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Carbon (C) conservation and sequestration in many developing countries needs to be accompanied by socio-economic improvements. Tree crop plantations can be a potential path for coupling climate change mitigation and economic development by providing C sequestration and supplying wood and non-wood products to meet domestic and international market requirements at the same time. Financial compensation for such plantations could potentially be covered by the Clean Development Mechanism under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) Kyoto Protocol, but its suitability has also been suggested for integration into REDD + (reducing emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and enhancement of forest C stocks) currently being negotiated under the United Nations FCCC. We assess the aboveground C sequestration potential of four major plantation crops - cocoa (Theobroma cacao), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), and orange (Citrus sinesis) - cultivated in the tropics. Measurements were conducted in Ghana and allometric equations were applied to estimate biomass. The largest C potential was found in the rubber plantations (214 tC/ha). Cocoa (65 tC/ha) and orange (76 tC/ha) plantations have a much lower C content, and oil palm (45 tC/ha) has the lowest C potential, assuming that the yield is not used as biofuel. There is considerable C sequestration potential in plantations if they are established on land with modest C content such as degraded forest or agricultural land, and not on land with old-growth forest. We also show that simple C assessment methods can give reliable results, which makes it easier for developing countries to partake in REDD + or other payment schemes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study introduces and analyzes a novel system for algal biofuel production that synergistically integrates algal wastewater treatment with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wastewater biosolids and algae into bio-crude oil. This system maximizes the biofuel potential of wastewater inputs by internally capturing and recycling carbon and nutrients-a powerful concept referred to as multi-cycle nutrient reuse, which amplifies waste nutrients into multiple cycles of algal biomass and bioenergy production. We call this system "Environment-Enhancing Energy" (E2-Energy) because it can simultaneously improve conventional wastewater treatment by nutrient removal and production of a large amount of biofuel co-products. Moreover, E 2-Energy resolves several key bottlenecks commonly associated with large-scale algal biofuel production including: contamination of target high-oil algal cultures, high nutrient costs/usage, unsustainable fresh water usage, and large energy inputs for dewatering/extraction. A series of algal cultivation and HTL experiments were conducted to confirm the primary steps and performance characteristics of the E2-Energy system. These experiments showed: (1) low-oil, mixed algal-bacterial biomass can be successfully cultured with the recycled HTL aqueous product; (2) both organics and nutrients are removed from wastewater during algal-bacterial biomass production (63-95% reduction); (3) this low-oil, algal-bacterial biomass can be converted into bio-crude oil via HTL with a high yield (∼50%) and a net positive energy balance; and (4) the HTL step re-releases nutrients to an aqueous phase product that can be recycled back to step (1). This repeating loop of steps 1-4 facilitates multi-cycle reuse of nutrients and thus provides biomass amplification. A mathematical model was also developed using STELLA® to simulate mass balances for long-term E 2-Energy operations with internal recycling of nutrients and carbon. The model results showed that E2-Energy can amplify the biomass and biofuel production from wastewater by up to 10 times, which gives it the potential to replace all US petroleum imports using only current wastewater feedstocks and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or point sources. Thus, E 2-Energy represents a major paradigm shift - where wastewater treatment systems become optimized biofuel producers with enhanced effluent quality, which provides a viable and advantageous pathway to sustainable, carbon-neutral energy independence. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Aims: The emergence of second generation (2G) biofuels is widely seen as a sustainable response to the increasing controversy surrounding the first generation (1G). Yet, sustainability credentials of 2G biofuels are also being questioned. Drawing on work in Science and Technology Studies, we argue that controversies help focus attention on key, often value-related questions that need to be posed to address broader societal concerns. This paper examines lessons drawn from the 1G controversy to assess implications for the sustainability appraisal of 2G biofuels. Scope: We present an overview of key 1G sustainability challenges, assess their relevance for 2G, and highlight the challenges for policy in managing the transition. We address limitations of existing sustainability assessments by exploring where challenges might emerge across the whole system of bioenergy and the wider context of the social system in which bioenergy research and policy are done. Conclusions: Key lessons arising from 1G are potentially relevant to the sustainability appraisal of 2G biofuels depending on the particular circumstances or conditions under which 2G is introduced. We conclude that sustainability challenges commonly categorised as either economic, environmental or social are, in reality, more complexly interconnected (so that an artificial separation of these categories is problematic). © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Nigeria's Biofuels Policy introduced in 2007 mandates a 10% blend (E10) of bioethanol with gasoline. This study investigates the potential for the development of a cellulosic ethanol industry based on the availability of agricultural residues and models the number of commercial processing facilities that could be sited in the six Geo-political zones. The potential for cellulosic ethanol production from agricultural residues in Nigeria is 7556km3 per annum exceeding the mandate of 10% renewable fuel required and providing the potential for 12 large- and 11 medium-scale processing facilities based on the use of a single feedstock. Cassava and yam peelings provided in excess of 80% of the process residues available with enough feedstock to supply 10 large-scale facilities with a fairly even distribution across the zones. Sorghum straw, millet straw and maize stalks represented 75% of the potential resource available from field residues with the potential to supply 2 large- and 7 medium-scale processing facilities, all of which would be located in the north of the country. When a multi-feedstock approach is used, this provides the potential for either 29 large- or 58 medium-scale facilities based on outputs of 250 and 125km3 per annum respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transport biofuels are currently the subject of heated debate in the EU. In the past decade the deployment of these technologies has been justified by claims of attractive environmental, geopolitical and rural development benefits. However, expectations have rapidly turned into deep criticism regarding the sustainability of these technologies and the desirability of pursuing the biofuel path. This situation has generated an on-going controversy and policy deadlock at EU level. This study explores these issues from a governance perspective. Employing the concept of system governability, derived from interactive governance theory, it attempts to shed some light on the problems facing the governance of biofuels and on how the quality of the governance system could be improved. The analysis showed that the governability of the system decreased substantially in the period 2003-2012 due to increasing governing needs and decreasing governing capacity. The quality of the governance system can be improved by (i) improving governing capacity by reducing conflicts among governing actors, advancing consistency among institutions and creating capacity at international and global level; and (ii) promoting advanced technologies and adjusting societal ambitions and expectations regarding biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass is a renewable feedstock for producing modern energy carriers. However, the usage of biomass is accompanied by possible drawbacks, mainly due to limitation of land and water, and competition with food production. In this paper, the analysis concerns so-called second generation biofuels, like Fischer-Tropsch fuels or Substitute Natural Gas which are produced either from wood or from waste biomass. For these biofuels the most promising conversion case is the one which involves production of syngas from biomass gasification, followed by synthesis of biofuels. The thermodynamic efficiency of biofuels production is analyzed and compared using both the direct exergy analysis and the thermo-ecological cost. This analysis leads to the detection of exergy losses in various elements which forms the starting point to the improvement of conversion efficiency. The efficiency of biomass conversion to biofuels is also evaluated for the whole production chain, including biomass cultivation, transportation and conversion. The global effects of natural resources management are investigated using the thermo-ecological cost. The energy carriers' utilities such as electricity and heat are externally generated either from fossil fuels or from renewable biomass. In the former case the production of biofuels not always can be considered as a renewable energy source whereas in the latter case the production of biofuels leads always to the reduction of depletion of non-renewable resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is world-wide interest in the search for alternatives to petroleum derived fuels for diesel engines. Key driving factors are depleting fossil-fuel reserves all over the globe as well as the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels that cause pollution and global warming. Bio-diesel derived from edible oils, non-edible oils and animal fats can be used in diesel engines with little or no modification. Non-land-based renewable sources are becoming important for the production of biodiesel due to limited availability of land. Under these circumstances, fish oil extracted from wastes of processed marine fish and refined through transesterification becomes an attractive alternative for the production of biodiesel. In this work, performance and emission characteristics of FOME (fish oil methyl ester) and its blends are evaluated in a direct-injection single-cylinder constant-speed diesel engine primarily used in the agricultural sector. It is seen that 20% FOME blend gives almost the same brake thermal efficiency with lower unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and soot emissions but higher NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions compared to diesel fuel. EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) is used to control NOxemissions. Percentage of EGR is varied to determine optimum EGR for 20% FOME blend. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that biobutanol can play a significant role in a sustainable, non-petroleum-based, industrial system. About the use in spark-ignition engines, butanol blended with conventional hydrocarbon fuels can increase fuel octane rating and power for a given engine displacement and compression ratio. Several reference studies measured performance, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for spark-ignition engines fuelled with butanol-gasoline blends. Very few experiments have been performed on in-cylinder butanol-gasoline combustion process. In this paper, an experimental investigation was carried out in a port fuel-injection, spark-ignition engine with an external boosting device. A blend of 20% of n-butanol in volume with commercial gasoline was used for the experiments. The optical engine was equipped with the head of commercial SI turbocharged engine with the same geometrical specifications as the research engine. The engine worked under stoichiometric mixture at 2000rpm, medium boosting and wide open throttle. Knocking condition was realized advancing the spark timing. In cylinder UV-visible natural emission spectroscopy was applied to follow the formation and the evolution of the principal compounds and radical species that characterize the normal and abnormal combustion process from the spark ignition until the exhaust. Particular interest was devoted to OH evolution. © 2013 .

AB  - Photosynthetic microorganisms are able to produce a diverse array of renewable biochemical commodities. Although promising platforms for the accumulation of targeted products, these organisms must be optimized in solar energy conversion, carbon capture and utilization, and the partitioning of metabolic flux to the requisite biosynthetic pathways. Metabolic engineering efforts are systematically addressing these obstacles and demonstrate the potential to develop consolidated bioprocessing organisms that are able to efficiently transform the energy in sunlight directly to refined chemicals of economic value. Particularly intriguing are mechanisms to synthesize and secrete bioproducts of interest from cyanobacteria, thereby eliminating the need to dewater and process cellular biomass. Significant advances in more classical approaches to triacylglycerol and carbohydrate accumulation in algae have also recently been realized. Importantly, genetic tools and sequenced genomes are emerging for some of the most biotechnologically relevant strains. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 989-1001, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Holistic evaluation via a life cycle based approach is critical for guiding the environmentally conscious development of emerging microalgal biofuel pathways. This study models the energy return on investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing algal derived biodiesel and renewable diesel under different production pathways - consisting of a combination of algal cultivation, harvesting, extraction, and coproduct utilization scenarios. The results indicate that in the base-case scenario(s) the EROI for microalgae fuels range from 0.26 to 1.20 with GHG emissions ranging from 50 to 240 gCO2 equivalent/MJ-fuel depending on the choice of cultivation variables, coproduct utilization options, and processing technologies. In the improved scenario(s), algal fuels have an EROI ranging from 0.81 to 2.01 and GHG emissions ranging from 30 to 90 gCO2 eq./MJ-fuel. Furthermore, improved scenarios with favorable EROI and GHG emissions profile for microalgal biofuels are plagued with high technological uncertainty. This suggests that broad advances in algal technologies are required if algal fuels are to be competitive with other leading second generation and advanced biofuels. The choice of fuel conversion technology was found to have a comparatively small impact on overall life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions. Therefore, the choice of fuel product may be based on other criteria such as fuel storage stability and compatibility with transportation fuel infrastructure. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 926-936, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Aquatic biomass, in general, and algae, in particular, are gaining attention for wastewater treatment and as a feedstock for renewable fuels. Research into algae biofuels is receiving significant attention because of the potential for providing high amounts of fuel with low land use. Several obstacles still remain especially in the area of algae selection, bioreactor choice, conversion to fuel precursors, and ultimate fuel production. This special issue of Environmental Progress and Sustainable Energy focuses on these issues and recent work that moves the field toward environmentally sustainable algae production. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 32: 877-883, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - By dedicating food to fuel, recent biofuel policy developments in the European Union have become part of the substantial substitution of existing land use patterns around the globe. This process has had various environmental and social consequences, commonly discussed under the topic of 'indirect land use changes' (iLUC). Although the European Commission has strived to mitigate the indirect biofuel related land use impacts, in this paper we show that the recent directive proposal on iLUC is rather a quick fix than a delicate attempt to grasp the topological and ontological polymorphism of the phenomenon. We will demonstrate this, firstly, by showing how the iLUC policy development of the Commission has been intertwined with the iLUC models that have quantified the indirect GHG impacts of various biofuel feedstocks. Secondly, we will examine how these calculative models have created a problematic ontological framing of the iLUC by concealing the manifold spatialities of this elusive phenomenon. Finally, the calculative models have not only posited iLUC into calculative nexuses of ordering; such calculations have also remained unable to explicate the heterogeneous topologies of actual biofuel production. We illustrate this crucial point by explicating three types of topological mediation - the fluid, the parasite and the fire - that cannot be acknowledged with the iLUC models or contemporary policies of European Union. In sum, by combining and rethinking the ideas of Heidegger, Latour and Serres, we argue for an onto-topological approach capable of taking into account manifold and complex topologies and ontologies of biofuel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar is a useful material for carbon storage in soils. In this report, we explored conversion of water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) to biochar as a sustainable weed management strategy, as it also has potential for improving soil quality. Eichornia biomass samples were carbonised with limited supply of air in a muffle furnace at varied temperature (200 to 500. °C) and residence time (30 to 120. min). The biochar yield decreased with temperature and time, but biochar carbon stability increased with temperature. The optimum condition for obtaining maximum stable carbon in Eichornia biochar (EBC) is 300-350. °C temperature with 30-40. min residence time. TGA and FTIR studies showed that EBC has increased aromaticity and carbon stability compared to the starting biomass. Impact of the EBC on soil quality was studied using a red soil, from Dhanbad, India. Soil biochemical properties (dehydrogenase, fluorescein hydrolases, catalase, respiration, active microbial biomass) and maize seedling growth were used to investigate the effects of biochar addition to the soil. Maize seedling vigour index increased from 1.0 at control to 1.61 in 20. g/kg EBC treatment. The maximum increase in soil enzymes like acid phosphatase activity (+. 32%), alkaline phosphatase activity (+. 22.8%), and fluorescein hydrolases activity (50%) occurred at the EBC dose of 20. g/kg. EBC significantly enhanced the soil biological activity particularly the active microbial biomass which has increased by 3 times and soil respiration by 1.9 times. The study shows that the waste Eichornia weed could be gainfully utilised as a soil quality amendment material by converting it to EBC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study is to improve evaluations of the future use of biomass sources in Sweden and France by representing the high spatial variations of the supply and cost of biomass sources in energy system models. The proposed methodology considers a high spatial disaggregation of biomass supply sources, as well as detailed biomass cost-supply curves, and is thereby able to account for spatial differences in heterogeneous land qualities, management strategies, and possible adaptation rates. Integrating the methodology into national or regional energy system models will enhance cost-effective evaluations of biomass sources as well as the development of the bioenergy sector. A TIMES energy system model was used to evaluate bioenergy production potential for France and Sweden based on domestic biomass sources and under the assumption that bioenergy production should not be at the expense of domestic food and forestry supply. Results show that by 2050, the biomass sources considered could provide as much as 250PJ of bioenergy in Sweden, and 1470PJ of bioenergy in France. Results further showed that 1st generation biofuels are likely to continue to play a substantial role in the biofuel mix. While 2nd generation biofuel production in Sweden is likely to be low, larger amounts of 2nd generation biofuels could be produced in France. However, the amount and type of 2nd generation biofuel produced in France was found to be highly dependent on the bioenergy demand level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Bamboo is potentially an interesting feedstock for advanced bioethanol production in China due to its natural abundance, rapid growth, perennial nature and low management requirements. Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment was selected as a promising technology to enhance sugar release from bamboo lignocellulose whilst keeping economic and environmental costs to a minimum. The present research was conducted to assess: 1) by how much LHW pretreatment can enhance sugar yields in bamboo, and 2) whether this process has the potential to be economically feasible for biofuel use at the commercial scale. Pretreatments were performed at temperatures of 170-190°C for 10-30 minutes, followed by enzymatic saccharification with a commercial enzyme cocktail at various loadings. These data were then used as inputs to a techno-economic model using AspenPlus™ to determine the production cost of bioethanol from bamboo in China. Results: At the selected LHW pretreatment of 190°C for 10 minutes, 69% of the initial sugars were released under a standardised enzyme loading; this varied between 59-76% when 10-140 FPU/g glucan of commercial enzyme Cellic CTec2 was applied. Although the lowest enzyme loading yielded the least amount of bioethanol, the techno-economic evaluation revealed it to be the most economically viable scenario with a production cost of $0.484 per litre (with tax exemption and a $0.16/litre subsidy). The supply-chain analysis demonstrated that bioethanol could be economically competitive with petrol at the pump at enzyme loadings up to 60 FPU/g glucan. However, in a prospective scenario with reduced government support, this enzyme loading threshold would be reduced to 30 FPU/g glucan. Conclusions: Bioethanol from bamboo is shown to be both technically and economically feasible, as well as competitive with petrol in China. Alternative approaches to reduce bioethanol production costs are still needed however, to ensure its competitiveness in a possible future scenario where neither tax exemptions nor subsidies are granted to producers. These measures may include improving sugar release with more effective pretreatments and reduced enzyme usage, accessing low cost bamboo feedstock or selecting feedstocks with higher/more accessible cellulose. © 2013 Littlewood et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Historically, the central Midwestern US has undergone drastic anthropogenic land use change, having been transformed, in part through government policy, from a natural grassland system to an artificially drained agricultural system devoted to row cropping corn and soybeans. Current federal policies are again influencing land use in this region with increased corn acreage and new biomass crops proposed as part of an energy initiative emphasizing biofuels. To better address these present and future challenges it is helpful to understand whether and how the legacies of past changes have shaped the current response of the system. To this end, a comparative analysis of the hydrologic signatures in both spatial and time series data from two central Illinois watersheds was undertaken. The past history of these catchments is reflected in their current hydrologic responses, which are highly heterogeneous due to differences in geologic history, artificial drainage patterns, and reservoir operation, and manifest temporally, from annual to daily timescales, and spatially, both within and between the watersheds. These differences are also apparent from analysis of the summer low flows, where the more tile-drained watershed shows greater variability overall than does the more naturally drained one. In addition, precipitation in this region is also spatially heterogeneous even at small scales, and this, interacting with and filtering through the historical modifications to the system, increases the complexity of the problem of predicting the catchment response to future changes.©Author(s) 2013 CC Attribution 3.0 License.

AB  - The sharp increase in global food prices during 2007-2008 has triggered the awareness of food insecurity problems and their impacts on the low-income, food-deficient countries, many of which are located in East Asia. Protein and fat consumption are higher in East Asia than that of other regions, although the percentage of carbohydrates consumed is slightly lower than the world's average. Nevertheless, the food security situation in East Asia was good relative to other countries in the world. The food security in East Asia is largely contributed by domestic production. Despite of a doubled import of foods over the last decade to meet its ever-growing population, Asia remains the least dependent among all regions on food imports. However, the raised energy costs and grain prices due to increasing grain demand for biofuel purposes appeared to exacerbate the undernourishment of poor households in the region. While most of the government interventions focus on short-term measures such as reducing domestic food prices through trade or price control, the risk of facing a long-term food insecurity still exists, which may render national action inadequate and require multilateral cooperation. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Based on the observation, the analysis and the comparison of four smallholder based jatropha projects developed by Eco-Carbone, located in distinct climatic and socio-economical conditions, this paper aims at drawing on the operator's experience to show what are the social, technical and economical prerequisites and the necessary management strategies, for such projects to be a success, both for the project operator and the farmers. Beyond the climatic and soil conditions which need to be present, the existing dynamics of the farming system should be assessed in order to establish whether and how, jatropha can be integrated in the existing farming system. Jatropha shall represent only a complementary income to farmers' existing agriculture income; therefore, the time, capital and land that farmers will be ready to dedicate to this crop will be proportionate to the revenue they yield. It is also necessary to assess the government's energy policy in terms of subsidies and tax. The sale price of the oil and fertiliser will define the purchasing price of the grain from the farmers and therefore, the profitability of establishing jatropha plantations for the farmers and developing the whole project for the operator. A jatropha project will thrive if the mass of grains purchased from the farmers reaches the expected targets. Adapted cultivation practices and improved genetics shall be introduced to optimise the technical potential of jatropha. However, once the trees start producing, the purchasing price is a fundamental variable in the success of a jatropha project. It needs to be interesting enough for farmers to harvest, shell, dry and sell their grains. However, this level of price can be maintained as long as the project developer can ensure or anticipate sufficient value extraction from both oil and seedcake commercialization on the market. Until the trees reach full production, short-term revenue strategies need to be devised for the farmers and for the project operator. These include the production of annual cash crops intercropped with the jatropha which provide an income for the farmers and in some cases, they would also benefit from a share on the sale in advance of sequestration carbon credits generated by jatropha plantations that the project developer will conduct in order to finance the first years of the project. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - The use of biofuels in the aviation sector has economic and environmental benefits. Among the options for the production of renewable jet fuels, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) have received predominant attention in comparison with fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), which are not approved as additives for jet fuels. However, the presence of oxygen in methyl esters tends to reduce soot emissions and therefore particulate matter emissions. This sooting tendency is quantified in this work with an oxygen-extended sooting index, based on smoke point measurements. Results have shown considerable reduction in the sooting tendency for all biokerosenes (produced by transesterification and eventually distillation) with respect to fossil kerosenes. Among the tested biokerosenes, that made from palm kernel oil was the most effective one, and nondistilled methyl esters (from camelina and linseed oils) showed lower effectiveness than distilled biokerosenes to reduce the sooting tendency. These results may constitute an additional argument for the use of FAME's as blend components of jet fuels. Other arguments were pointed out in previous publications, but some controversy has aroused over the use of these components. Some of the criticism was based on the fact that the methods used in our previous work are not approved for jet fuels in the standard methods and concluded that the use of FAME in any amount is, thus, inappropriate. However, some of the standard methods are not updated for considering oxygenated components (like the method for obtaining the lower heating value), and others are not precise enough (like the methods for measuring the freezing point), whereas some alternative methods may provide better reproducibility for oxygenated fuels. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Purpose: Second-generation biofuel is regarded as a sustainable alternatives to fossil energy in transportation where electricity is not feasible. The main purpose of this study is to analyze how large-scale second-generation biofuel based on wood may affect the competitiveness of more mature bioenergy technologies such as bioheat through competition in the biomass market. The impacts on forest industries are also included. Design/methodology/approach: An economic model for the energy and forest sectors based on partial equilibrium modeling is used to quantify the impacts of four different locations of biofuel production in Norway. Findings: The results show that there are regional variations in biomass price effects depending on local raw material availability and costs of transport and import. Technologies allowing for a larger variety of wood biomass qualities will face lower biomass prices than technologies using only one species as raw material, causing less reduction in the production of bioheat and forest industrial products. For Norway specifically, the paper concludes that even if there is a potential for both increased bioheat generation and large-scale biofuel production, the production of second-generation biofuels based on domestic wood resources will cause a 5-20 percent reduction in bioheat generation depending on the scale of biofuel production. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates how impacts on biomass markets from establishment of biofuel production vary quite substantially with location, production level and choice of feedstock. One main finding is the quite large biomass cost impact that is seen in the model runs when introducing large-scale biofuel production. Increased biomass costs reduce the profitability and this must be taken into account when establishing a biofuel installation. Originality/value: The originality of the paper is the analyses of biofuel impacts with a detailed model for biomass supply as the bioenergy and forest sectors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is among the cornerstone policies created to increase U.S. energy independence by using biofuels. Although greenhouse gas emissions have played a role in shaping the RFS, water implications are less understood. We demonstrate a spatial, life cycle approach to estimate water consumption of transportation fuel scenarios, including a comparison to current water withdrawals and drought incidence by state. The water consumption and land footprint of six scenarios are compared to the RFS, including shale oil, coal-to-liquids, shale gas-to-liquids, corn ethanol, and cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass. The corn scenario is the most water and land intense option and is weighted toward drought-prone states. Fossil options and cellulosic ethanol require significantly less water and are weighted toward less drought-prone states. Coal-to-liquids is an exception, where water consumption is partially weighted toward drought-prone states. Results suggest that there may be considerable water and land impacts associated with meeting energy security goals through using only biofuels. Ultimately, water and land requirements may constrain energy security goals without careful planning, indicating that there is a need to better balance trade-offs. Our approach provides policymakers with a method to integrate federal policies with regional planning over various temporal and spatial scales. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Middle distillate (MD) transportation fuels, including diesel and jet fuel, make up almost 30% of liquid fuel consumption in the United States. Alternative drop-in MD and biodiesel could potentially reduce dependence on crude oil and the greenhouse gas intensity of transportation. However, the water and land resource requirements of these novel fuel production technologies must be better understood. This analysis quantifies the lifecycle green and blue water consumption footprints of producing: MD from conventional crude oil; Fischer-Tropsch MD from natural gas and coal; fermentation and advanced fermentation MD from biomass; and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids MD and biodiesel from oilseed crops, throughout the contiguous United States. We find that FT MD and alternative MD derived from rainfed biomass have lifecycle blue water consumption footprints of 1.6 to 20.1 Lwater/LMD, comparable to conventional MD, which ranges between 4.1 and 7.4 L water/LMD. Alternative MD derived from irrigated biomass has a lifecycle blue water consumption footprint potentially several orders of magnitude larger, between 2.7 and 22 600 Lwater/LMD. Alternative MD derived from biomass has a lifecycle green water consumption footprint between 1.1 and 19 200 Lwater/LMD. Results are disaggregated to characterize the relationship between geo-spatial location and lifecycle water consumption footprint. We also quantify the trade-offs between blue water consumption footprint and areal MD productivity, which ranges from 490 to 4200 LMD/ha, under assumptions of rainfed and irrigated biomass cultivation. Finally, we show that if biomass cultivation for alternative MD is irrigated, the ratio of the increase in areal MD productivity to the increase in blue water consumption footprint is a function of geo-spatial location and feedstock-to-fuel production pathway. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Alternative methodologies for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crude palm oil (CPO) production by a wet extraction mill in Thailand were developed. The production of 1 t of CPO from mills with biogas capture (four mills) and without biogas capture (two mills) in 2010 produced GHG emissions of 935 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq), on average. Wastewater treatment plants with and without biogas capture produced GHG emissions of 64 and 47% of total GHG emission, respectively. The rest of the emissions mostly originated from the acquisition of fresh fruit bunches. The establishment of a biogas recovery system must be the first step in the reduction of GHG emissions. It could reduce GHG emissions by 373 kgCO 2eq/t of CPO. The main source of GHG emission of 163 kgCO 2eq/t of CPO from the mills with biogas capture was the open pond used for cooling of wastewater before it enters the biogas recovery system. The reduction of GHG emissions could be accomplished by (i) using a wastewater-dispersed unit for cooling, (ii) using a covered pond, (iii) enhancing the performance of the biogas recovery system, and (iv) changing the stabilization pond to an aerated lagoon. By using options i-iv, reductions of GHG emissions of 216, 208, 92.2, and 87.6 kgCO2eq/t of CPO, respectively, can be achieved. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The article describes how the green credentials of wood-based biofuels may pave the way for biomass-to-liquid applications, as well as biochemicals and biomaterials. A key concern with biofuels has been the food vs. fuel issue, where first generation ethanol made from corn competed directly with food crops and arable land use. Second generation, or advanced biofuels, made from non-food sources of cellulose largely circumvent these concerns. Both Canada and the US have energy policies that support the biofuel industry. The Canadian government has the Renewable Fuels Regulations, which requires that all fuel produced in, or imported to, Canada contain a certain percentage of renewable fuel. The US government has the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain volume of renewable fuels be blended into gasoline.

AB  - The tree legume Pongamia {Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre [syn. Millettia pinnata (L.) Panigrahi]} is emerging as an important biofuels feedstock. It produces about 30 kg per tree per year of seeds, containing up to 55% oil (w/v), of which approximately 50% is oleic acid (C18:1). The capacity for biological N fixation places Pongamia in a more sustainable position than current nonlegume biofuel feedstocks. Also due to its drought and salinity tolerance, Pongamia can grow on marginal land not destined for production of food. As part of the effort to domesticate Pongamia our research group at The University of Queensland has started to develop specific genetic and genomic tools. Much of the preliminary work to date has focused on characterizing the genetic diversity of wild populations. This diversity is reflective of the outcrossing reproductive biology of Pongamia and necessitates the requirement to develop clonal propagation protocols. Both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Pongamia have been sequenced and annotated (152,968 and 425,718 bp, respectively), with similarities to previously characterized legume organelle genomes. Many nuclear genes associated with oil biosynthesis and nodulation in Pongamia have been characterized. The continued application of genetic and genomic tools will support the deployment of Pongamia as a sustainable biofuel feedstock. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - This paper evaluates GHG emissions and energy balances (i.e. net energy value (NEV), net renewable energy value (NREV) and net energy ratio (NER)) of jatropha biodiesel as an alternative fuel in Tanzania by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The functional unit (FU) was defined as 1tonne (t) of combusted jatropha biodiesel. The findings of the study provewrong the notion that biofuels are carbon neutral, thus can mitigate climate change. A net GHG equivalent emission of about 848kgt-1 was observed. The processes which accountsignificantly to GHG emissions are the end use of biodiesel (about 82%) followed by farming of jatropha for about 13%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that replacing diesel with biodiesel in irrigation of jatropha farms decreases the net GHG emissions by 7.7% while avoiding irrigation may reduce net GHG emissions by 12%. About 22.0GJ of energy is consumed to produce 1t of biodiesel. Biodiesel conversion found to be a major energy consuming process (about 64.7%) followed by jatropha farming for about 30.4% of total energy. The NEV is 19.2GJt-1, indicating significant energy gain of jatropha biodiesel. The NREV is 23.1GJt-1 while NER is 2.3; the two values indicate that large amount of fossil energy is used to produce biodiesel. The results of the study are meant to inform stakeholders and policy makers in the bioenergy sector.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a highly rigid and recalcitrant structure which requires pretreatment to loosen chemical bonds to make accessible monomeric sugars for biofuel production. In this study, locally available biomass, that is hemp (Cannabis sativa), a low cost feedstock for ethanol production, has been used for the production of fermentable sugars. Hemp hurd biomass (HHB) was exposed to five different pretreatments which included dilute acid (H2SO4), alkaline (NaOH), alkaline peroxide, hot water and one stage dilute acid (H2SO4). Different pretreatments resulted in loosening and degradation of HHB structure thus facilitating enzymatic saccharification at optimized parameters (pH-4.8 and 50°C). The changes in the reactive groups (hydroxyl or acetyl) of the HHB were confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the surface morphology of untreated and treated HHB. Finally, enzymatic saccharification demonstrated maximum yield of total sugars (743mgg-1) that are suitable for biofuel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of perennial biomass crops is expected to increase and will likely be part of a diversified approach to cropping system design that focuses on multiple economic, ecological, and environmental benefits. Field experiments were conducted from 2006 to 2011 at three locations in Minnesota to quantify biomass production across a diverse set of perennial herbaceous and woody crops. Herbaceous crops were harvested annually in the fall while the woody crops were harvested once following five years of growth. Willow produced more total biomass than all other woody and herbaceous biomass crops across all locations. However, miscanthus biomass yield was similar to 'SX67' willow at St. Paul and Waseca, but was dependent on the cultivar of miscanthus. Prairie cordgrass cultivars were among the highest and most consistent yielding herbaceous biomass crops across locations. Miscanthus cultivars produced the highest annual dry matter yield of 35Mgha-1yr-1 biomass, but only during the final year of the study. Other herbaceous crops such as switchgrass performed well in certain locations and may offer flexibility in cropping choice. This unique information on comparative biomass yield across a diversity of perennial crops will inform the overall decision-making process in a way that reduces risk and optimizes productivity in specific environments. This study shows that several biomass crop species can be successfully grown as part of a diversified biomass cropping enterprise.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to study the impacts of bioenergy crop expansions on stream health the adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to simulate three macroinvertebrate and one fish stream health measure. Macroinvertebrate measures considered were the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Family Index of Biological Integrity (Family IBI), and Number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT taxa) and the fish measure used was the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI). Water quality and quantity variables obtained from a high-resolution biophysical model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) were considered as inputs to the stream health predictive models. In order to examine the potential impacts of bioenergy crop expansions on stream health measures, 20 different rotations were examined in the Saginaw Bay basin. Overall, for the second-generation of biofuel crops, improvement in water quality was associated with less intensive agricultural activities, while traditional intensive row crops generated more pollution than current landuse conditions. Regarding the impacts of landuse changes on stream health measures, all three macroinvertebrate measures were negatively impacted under intensive row crops scenario while these measures were improved under perennial crops. However, for the fish measures, the expansion of native grass, switchgrass, and miscanthus resulted in negative impacts on IBI compared to first-generation row crops.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: In the context of progress of sustainability science, life cycle thinking and, in particular, life cycle sustainability assessment may play a crucial role. Environmental, economic and social implications of the whole supply chain of products, both goods and services, their use and waste management, i.e. their entire life cycle from "cradle to grave" have to be considered to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns. Progress toward sustainability requires enhancing the methodologies for integrated assessment and mainstreaming of life cycle thinking from product development to strategic policy support. Life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (sLCA) already attempt to cover sustainability pillars, notwithstanding different levels of methodological development. An increasing concern on how to deal with the complexity of sustainability has promoted the development of life cycle sustainability frameworks. As a contribution to the ongoing scientific debate after the Rio+20 conference, this paper aims to present and discuss the state of the art of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), giving recommendations for its further development in line with ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of sustainability science. Methods: Building on the review about the state of the art of sustainability science and sustainability assessment methods presented in part I, this paper discuss LCA, LCC, sLCA and LCSA against ontological, epistemological and methodological aspects of ongoing scientific debate on sustainability. Strengths and weaknesses of existing life cycle-based methodologies and methods are presented. Besides, existing frameworks for LCSA are evaluated against the criteria defined in part I in order to highlight coherence with sustainability science progress and to support better integration and mainstreaming of sustainability concepts. Conclusions and outlook: LCSA represents a promising approach for developing a transparent, robust and comprehensive assessment. Nevertheless, the ongoing developments should be in line with the most advanced scientific discussion on sustainability science, attempting to bridge the gaps between the current methods and methodologies for sustainability assessment. LCSA should develop so as to be hierarchically different from LCA, LCC and sLCA. It should represent the holistic approach which integrates (and not substitutes) the reductionist approach of the single part of the analysis. This implies maintaining the balance between analytical and descriptive approaches towards a goal and solution-oriented decision support methodology. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The global land use implications of biofuel expansion have received considerable attention in the literature over the past decade. Model-based estimates of the emissions from cropland expansion have been used to assess the environmental impacts of biofuel policies. And integrated assessment models have estimated the potential for biofuels to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement over the coming century. All of these studies feature, explicitly or implicitly, competition between biofuel feed stocks and other land uses. However, the economic mechanisms governing this competition, as well as the contribution of biofuels to global land use change, have not received the close scrutiny that they deserve. The purpose of this article is to offer a deeper look at these factors. We begin with a comparative static analysis which assesses the impact of exogenously specified forecasts of biofuel expansion over the period: 2006-2035. Global land use change is decomposed according to the three key margins of economic response: extensive supply, intensive supply, and demand. Under the International Energy Agency's "New Policies" scenario, biofuels account for nearly one-fifth of global land use change over the 2006-2035 period. The article also offers a comparative dynamic analysis which determines the optimal path for first and second generation biofuels over the course of the entire 21st century. In the absence of GHG regulation, the welfare-maximizing path for global land use, in the face of 3% annual growth in oil prices, allocates 225 Mha to biofuel feed stocks by 2100, with the associated biofuels accounting for about 30% of global liquid fuel consumption. This area expansion is somewhat diminished by expected climate change impacts on agriculture, while it is significantly increased by an aggressive GHG emissions target and by advances in conversion efficiency of second generation biofuels. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - The world economy is under pressure for greater, more efficient and more sustainable use of natural resources to meet complementary and competing objectives in the food, water and energy sectors. Interactions between these three sectors have become increasingly affected by the bioeconomy-a concept that encompasses economic growth driven by the development of renewable biological resources and biotechnologies to produce sustainable products, employment and income. This article explores how water and the bioeconomy are interlinked, including how the constraints from growing water scarcity-in part caused by development of the bioeconomy-may influence bioeconomic growth. The article describes the impact of biofuel production on water quantity and quality and examines the potential for improved water use through the development of crop biotechnology and improved crop management. Then alternative scenarios for water in the bioeconomy are assessed, and policy conclusions are presented. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - In a world of high food and energy prices, Africa has an imperative to do a better job feeding itself and ensuring that its people are food secure. At the same time, there is a new business opportunity to work with the private sector in developing the continent's potential to produce significantly more food, raw materials, and biofuels for regional and world markets. A challenge for African policy makers is to find the right balance between a food security and a business agenda, and to ensure that the business agenda engages with large numbers of small farms. Agricultural development requires many things, but the fundamentals for Africa are developing markets, increasing agricultural productivity, and managing volatility. This cannot happen at sufficient scale and speed without strong public sector leadership, enabling policies and investments, and well-focused implementation strategies. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - New discoveries in life sciences and the challenge of climate change are leading to the emergence of the bioeconomy where basic methods of advanced biology are applied to produce a wide array of products while also improving environmental quality. The emergence of the bioeconomy is a continuing evolutionary process of transition from systems of mining nonrenewable resources to farming renewable ones. This transition benefits from the modern tools of molecular biology that have expanded the human capacity to breed new organisms and utilize them to increase productivity in agriculture and fisheries as well as produce a wide array of products that were extracted in the past. This transition is leading to the integration of the agricultural sector with the energy and mineral sectors. The introduction of biotechnology has already improved the productivity of medicine as well as agriculture but, in the case of agriculture, has encountered resistance and regulatory constraints. The evolution of the bioeconomy requires continuous public investment in research and innovation as well as the establishment of a regulatory framework and financial incentives and institutions that would lead to continuous private sector investment in the development and commercialization of new products. One of the biggest challenges is the development of a regulatory framework that would control possible human and environmental externalities from new biotechnology products and, at the same time, not stifle innovation. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as a climate-friendly energy alternative. However, their environmental sustainability is increasingly debated because of land competition with food production, negative carbon balances and impacts on biodiversity. Arid and semi-arid lands have been proposed as a more sustainable alternative without such impacts. In that context this paper evaluates the carbon balance of potential land conversion to Jatropha cultivation, biofuel production and use in arid and semi-arid areas. This evaluation includes the calculation of carbon debt created by these land conversions and calculation of the minimum Jatropha yield necessary to repay the respective carbon debts within 15 or 30 years.The carbon debts caused by conversion of arid and semi-arid lands to Jatropha vary largely as a function of the biomass carbon stocks of the land use types in these regions. Based on global ecosystem carbon mapping, cultivated lands and marginal areas (sparse shrubs, herbaceous and bare areas) show to have similar biomass carbon stocks (on average 4-8tCha-1) and together cover a total of 1.79billionha. Conversion of these lands might not cause a carbon debt, but still might have a negative impact on other sustainability dimensions (e.g. biodiversity or socio-economics). Jatropha establishment in shrubland (0.75 billion ha) would cause a carbon debt of 24-28tCha-1 on average (repayable within 30year with yield of 3.5-3.9tseed ha-1yr-1). Land use change in the 1.15 billion ha of forested area under arid and semi-arid climates could cause a carbon debt between 70 and 118t Cha-1. This debt requires 8.6-13.9tseed production ha-1yr-1 for repayment within 30 years. If repayment is required within 15 years, the necessary minimum yields almost double. Considering that 5tseedha-1yr-1 is the current maximum Jatropha yield, conversion of forests cannot be repaid within one human generation. Repayment of carbon debt from shrubland conversions in 30 years is challenging, but feasible. Repayment in 15 year is currently not attainable.Based on this analysis the paper discusses the carbon mitigation potential of biofuels in arid and semi-arid environments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cultivation is the most expensive step in the production of biodiesel from microalgae, and substantial research has been devoted to developing more cost-effective cultivation methods. Plant hormones (phytohormones) are chemical messengers that regulate various aspects of growth and development and are typically active at very low concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effect of different phytohormones on microalgal growth and biodiesel production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and their potential to lower the overall cost of commercial biofuel production. The results indicated that all five of the tested phytohormones (indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid, kinetin, 1-triacontanol, and abscisic acid) promoted microalgal growth. In particular, hormone treatment increased biomass production by 54 to 69 % relative to the control growth medium (Tris-acetate-phosphate, TAP). Phytohormone treatments also affected microalgal cell morphology but had no effect on the yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a percent of biomass. We also tested the effect of these phytohormones on microalgal growth in nitrogen-limited media by supplementation in the early stationary phase. Maximum cell densities after addition of phytohormones were higher than in TAP medium, even when the nitrogen source was reduced to 40 % of that in TAP medium. Taken together, our results indicate that phytohormones significantly increased microalgal growth, particularly in nitrogen-limited media, and have potential for use in the development of efficient microalgal cultivation for biofuel production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - To accelerate domestication of Miscanthus, an important energy crop, 244 replicated genotypes, including two different species and their hybrids, were analysed for morphological traits and biomass yield over three growing seasons following an establishment phase of 2 years in the largest Miscanthus diversity trial described to date. Stem and leaf traits were selected that contributed both directly and indirectly to total harvested biomass yield, and there was variation in all traits measured. Morphological diversity within the population was correlated with dry matter yield (DMY) both as individual traits and in combination, in order to determine the respective contributions of the traits to biomass accumulation and to identify breeding targets for yield improvement. Predictive morphometric analysis was possible at year 3 within Miscanthus sinensis genotypes but not between M. sinensis, Miscanthus sacchariforus, and inter-specific hybrids. Yield is a complex trait, and no single simple trait explained more than 33% of DMY, which varied from 1 to 5297 g among genotypes within this trial. Associating simple traits increased the power of the morphological data to predict yield to 60%. Trait variety, in combination, enabled multiple ideotypes, thereby increasing the potential diversity of the crop for multiple growth locations and end uses. Both triploids and interspecific hybrids produced the highest mature yields, indicating that there is significant heterosis to be exploited within Miscanthus that might be overlooked in early selection screens within years 1-3. The potential for optimizing biomass yield by selecting on the basis of morphology is discussed. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Economic and policy incentives for biofuel development differ in the USA and the EU, but indicators of environmental sustainability that have emerged from recent scientific literature transcend political boundaries. We classified these indicators according to six dimensions of environmental sustainability that have been previously identified, providing a description of each, and relating them to proposed international standards for advanced biofuels. Advanced biofuel development can be a step toward environmentally sustainable energy if optimal standards for feedstock selection, management, production, and fuel conversion are explicitly targeted. Tools for assessing environmental sustainability exist, but have not yet been put to task in a standardized way for advanced biofuels. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The use of marginal lands for biofuel production has been proposed as a promising solution for meeting biofuel demands while avoidingfood-feed-fuel conflicts. However, uncertainty surrounds whethermarginal lands can be reliably located, as well as their inherentbiofuel potential and the possible environmental impacts. Wedeveloped a quantitative approach that integrates high-resolutionland cover and land productivity to classify productive croplandsand nonarable marginal lands in a nine-county region in southernMichigan. The classified lands were then examined with the spatiallyexplicit modeling framework using the Environmental PolicyIntegrated Climate (EPIC) model to estimate net energy (NE) andsoil organic carbon (SOC) changes associated with the cultivationof different annual and perennial production systems. Simulationresults suggest that biofuel production systems underperform onmarginal lands when compared to productive croplands. However,we found perennial grasses could perform better than annual crops.Hence, when growing perennial bioenergy crops on marginallands instead of productive croplands, less additional land (about0.09 ha per each hectare planted) would be needed to achieve thesame NE than if growing annual bioenergy crops (additional 0.17ha per hectare planted). Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) andswitchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) can produce 112.43 and 74.61GJ ha-1 yr-1 NE, respectively, and have the potential to sequester, onaverage, 0.59 and 0.23 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 SOC, respectively. Notably,simulation results indicate substantial variability of the NE and SOC storage potential across the study region. Thus, althoughperennial energy crops are promising options for biofuel productionon marginal lands, given the large spatial variability, regional- andsite-specific management strategies are required for sustainable biofuel production. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Plant oils are a very valuable agricultural commodity. They are currently mainly used (>80%) for food and animal feed but, increasingly, they have utility as renewable sources of industrial feedstocks or biofuel. Because of finite agricultural land, the best way to increase availability (in order to match demand) is by improving productivity. To do this requires a knowledge of metabolism and its regulation. Various methods have been used to provide information but only systems biology can yield quantitative data about complete metabolic pathways. We have used metabolic control analysis to provide information about major oil crops such as oilseed rape, oil palm, olive, and soybean. Such knowledge has then been used to inform genetic manipulation for crop improvement. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Swainson is a medium tall, highyielding, stem and leaf rust resistant winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that is registered for production in western Canada. It is a hard red winter wheat cultivar that is eligible for grades of the Canada Western General Purpose (CWGP) wheat class, which was created in 2008 to encourage the development of cultivars to fill the high energy demands of the biofuel and livestock feed markets in western Canada. Its high yield potential has been particularly evident on dry land in Saskatchewan where its grain yield was 116% of CDC Buteo, the Canada Western Red Winter Wheat Class grain quality check cultivar, and 110% of Accipiter and 117% of CDC Falcon, the high-yielding check cultivars. High grain yield potential of low protein concentration grain and rust resistance make Swainson a good fit for the CWGP class.

AB  - Cell walls and lignin component disruption treatments are needed to enhance the hydrolytic phase and the overall biodegradability of lignocellulosics during an anaerobic digestion process. Given their abundant availability in nature, low impact on food market prices and low lignin content, aquatic plants result in being particularly suitable for biofuel conversion. A preliminary study on the effects of a Hollander beater mechanical pretreatment has been conducted in batch mode focusing on biogas yields from five different species of Irish seaweeds in co-digestion with sludge. A second experiment on Laminaria Digitata species has been carried out using a ResponseSurface Methodology (RSM) with treatment times (0-10min), mesophilic range of temperatures (35-39°C) and sludge amounts (100-300ml). Results from biogas yields of treated macroalgae have been found to be up to 20% higher when compared to untreated ones. A mathematical model of the biogas volume behaviour has been developed and the ideal conditions identified. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies on bioenergy opportunities available to New Zealand found wood from plantation forests is the largest biomass resource and the one with most potential to expand. The use of municipal solid wastes and industrial effluents for energy gave significant environmental benefits, but makes a small contribution to total energy demand. The potential of plantation forests to create a carbon store, garner environmental benefits, and create lumber and energy supplies are substantial. After considering several aspects, including domestic energy supply and demand, key to maximizing these benefits for New Zealand is the development of biomass to liquid fuels conversion technologies, focused on wood to drop-in liquid fuels. Establishment of large-scale woody biomass resources producing multiple products including energy could mitigate risks associated with other bioenergy options by Being based on an existing industry; Not impacting exports from arable and high-value pastoral land; Acting as significant long-term energy store; Providing carbon sequestration during establishment and growingphases and additional carbon stocks from new forest area; Providing environmental services, stabilizing erosion prone land, provid-ing low-input (fertilizer, pesticides) land use, and improving waterquality; Producing sustainable coproducts, traditional timber products, and high-value biomaterials and chemicals; Providing the forest industry with a significant alternative market for low-value log products; Stimulating regional development; Providing year round biomass supply. The opportunity to substitute fossil fuels with domestically produced biofuels could bring long-term economic and environmental benefits to the country through better utilizing New Zealand's natural capital. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rice straw can be used as a renewable fuel for heat and power generation. It is a viable mean of replacing fossil fuels and preventing pollution caused by open burning, especially in the areas where this residual biomass is generated. Nevertheless, the thermal conversion of rice straw can cause some operating problems such as slag formation, which negatively affects thermal conversion systems. So, the main objective of this research is studying the combustion behavior of rice straw samples collected from various regions by applying thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In addition, the thermal behavior of ashes from rice straw was also analyzed in order to detect their melting points, and ash sintering was detected at different temperatures within the range between 550 and 1000. °C. Since washing rice straw with water could reduce the content of undesirable inorganic compounds related to the ash fusibility, samples of washed rice straw were analyzed under combustion conditions to investigate its differences regarding the thermal behavior of rice straw. The results showed that rice straw washing led to a significant improvement in its thermal behavior, since it reduced the ash contents and sintering formation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The global gaseous emissions produced by landfilling the Mechanically Sorted Organic Fraction (MSOF) with different weeks of Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) was evaluated for an existing waste management system. One MBT facility and a landfill with internal combustion engines fuelled by the landfill gas for electrical energy production operate in the waste management system considered. An experimental apparatus was used to simulate 0, 4, 8 and 16weeks of aerobic stabilization and the consequent biogas potential (Nl/kg) of a large sample of MSOF withdrawn from the full-scale MBT. Stabilization achieved by the waste was evaluated by dynamic oxygen uptake and fermentation tests. Good correlation coefficients (R2), ranging from 0.7668 to 0.9772, were found between oxygen uptake, fermentation and anaerobic test values. On the basis of the results of several anaerobic tests, the methane production rate k (year-1) was evaluated. k ranged from 0.436 to 0.308year-1 and the bio-methane potential from 37 to 12Nm3/tonne, respectively, for the MSOF with 0 and 16weeks of treatment. Energy recovery from landfill gas ranged from about 11 to 90kWh per tonne of disposed MSOF depending on the different scenario investigated. Life cycle analysis showed that the scenario with 0weeks of pre-treatment has the highest weighted global impact even if opposite results were obtained with respect to the single impact criteria. MSOF pre-treatment periods longer than 4weeks showed rather negligible variation in the global impact of system emissions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The idea of using less productive or "marginal land" for energy crops is promoted as a way to overcome the previous land use controversies faced by biofuels. It is argued that marginal land use would not compete with food production, is widely available and would incur fewer environmental impacts. This term is notoriously vague however, as are the details of how marginal land use for energy crops would work in practice. This paper explores definitions of the term "marginal land" in academic, consultancy, NGO, government and industry documents in the UK. It identifies three separate definitions of the term: land unsuitable for food production; ambiguous lower quality land; and economically marginal land. It probes these definitions further by exploring the technical, normative and political assumptions embedded within them. It finds that the first two definitions are normatively motivated: this land should be used to overcome controversies and the latter definition is predictive: this land is likely to be used. It is important that the different advantages, disadvantages and implications of the definitions are spelled out so definitions are not conflated to create unrealistic expectations about the role of marginal land in overcoming biofuels land use controversies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates next generation biomass derived fuels for the transport sector, employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Eight different alternatives of fuels are considered in this paper: bio-hydrogen, bio-synthetic natural gas, bio-dimethyl ether, bio-methanol, hydro thermal upgrading diesel, bio-ethanol, algal biofuel and electricity from biomass incineration. The evaluation of alternative fuels is performed according to various criteria that include economic, technical, social and policy aspects. In order to evaluate each alternative fuel, one base scenario and five alternative scenarios with different weight factors selection per criterion are presented. After deciding the alternative fuels' scoring against each criterion and the criteria weights, their synthesis gives the overall score and ranking for all alternative scenarios. It is concluded that synthetic natural gas and electricity from biomass incineration are the most suitable next generation biomass derived fuels for the transport sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Malaysia is the world's second largest producer of palm oil and generates surplus palm biomass waste that can be used for bioenergy development. Malaysia aims to diversify its energy portfolio by investing into renewable energy mostly to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. This paper captures synergetic and conflicting interests of key stakeholders, who play an important role in shaping the regulatory and business environment in Malaysia's renewable energy sector. Particularly, this research analyses the perceptions of three stakeholder groups (government agencies, industry players, and non-governmental organisations) regarding palm-based biofuel and biomass utilisation in Malaysia by combining Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis with an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework. Overall, results show a greater sense of optimism among the three stakeholder groups for the development of palm-based biomass utilisation in Malaysia, compared to the development of first generation palm-oil based biodiesel. We discuss the findings in light of on-going debates and policy processes, highlighting some key issues that need to be addressed in order to meet oil-palm related targets set in Malaysia's ambitious renewable energy plan. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper uses a new approach of retro-analysis. Typically policy is informed by forward-looking analysis of potential for alternative energy technologies. But historical knowledge of energy and processing requirements and greenhouse effects is more reliable for engineering evaluation of biofuel production systems. This study calculates energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions for the most efficient biomass feedstocks in New Zealand if the policy had been implemented to maximize liquid biofuel production in the year 2004/2005. The study uses existing processing technologies and agricultural statistics. Bioethanol production is calculated from putrescible wastes and starch crops, and biodiesel production from rapeseed, tallow, wood and waste paper. Each production system is further evaluated using measures of land use, energy input, crop production related to the energy product, plus relative measures of efficiency and renewability. The research findings are that maximum biofuel production in 2004/2005 would have provided only a few per cent of demand, and would not have reduced dependence on foreign imported oil or exposure to fuel price rise. Finally, we conclude that demand management and efficiency are more effective means of meeting policy objectives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (jatropha) has recently received great attention for its utilization in biofuel production, rehabilitation of wasteland and rural development. Improvement of seed quality is an important breeding goal but jatropha seed quality has been investigated with sample sets comprising a small number of traits, accessions and environments. Our main goal was to investigate a large number of traits in a wide and geographical diverse collection of seed samples to have a comprehensive view on the phenotypic variation of seed quality in jatropha. Our objectives were to (i) assess phenotypic variation of jatropha seed quality traits, (ii) investigate the association among those traits (iii) group germplasm and (iv) examine the partition of the trait variation attributed to factors of geographical origin (world regions and countries) and sampling procedures (single seeds vs. seed samples). Phenotypic variation was larger than reported previously. We detected a strong positive association between seed weight and the contents of oil in seed and kernel. Oil content in seed was negatively associated with the ratio of shell weight to seed weight. Contents of oil and protein in kernel were also associated negatively. Accessions from Africa and Central and North America grouped together and separated of accessions from Asia and South America. Countries and accessions within countries contributed most to the total variance of seed quality traits. Determination of seed quality among accessions using seed samples is more efficient than using single seeds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Applying organic amendments including biosolids and composts to agricultural land could increase carbon (C) storage in soils and contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Although a number of studies have examined the potential value of biosolids as a soil conditioner and nutrient source, there has been only limited work on the impact of biosolid application on C sequestration in soils. The objective of this study was to examine the potential value of biosolids in C sequestration in soils. Two types of experiments were conducted to examine the effect of biosolid application on C sequestration. In the first laboratory incubation experiment, the rate of decomposition of a range of biosolid samples was compared with other organic amendments including composts and biochars. In the second field experiment, the effect of biosolids on the growth of two bioenergy crops, Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) and Helianthus annuus (sunflower) on a landfill site was examined in relation to biomass production and C sequestration. The rate of decomposition varied amongst the organic amendments, and followed: composts&gt;biosolids&gt;biochar. There was a hundred fold difference in the rate of decomposition between biochar and other organic amendments. The rate of decomposition of biosolids decreased with increasing iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) contents of biosolids. Biosolid application increased the dry matter yield of both plant species (by 2-2.5 fold), thereby increasing the biomass C input to soils. The rate of net C sequestration resulting from biosolid application (Mg C ha-1yr-1Mg-1 biosolids) was higher for mustard (0.103) than sunflower (0.087). Biosolid application is likely to result in a higher level of C sequestration when compared to other management strategies including fertilizer application and conservation tillage, which is attributed to increased microbial biomass, and Fe and Al oxide-induced immobilization of C. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Brazil, incorporating the environmental dimension to the planning process is a challenging process. Planning has historically been carried without considering environmental protection concerns. The country's large development projects have engendered a discussion on the feasibility of these works given the conflicts with environmental policies. The strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a tool that has the potential to integrate the sectoral, territorial and environmental perspectives to promote sustainable development, as shown by international experience. Its use has not yet been regulated in Brazil, only been voluntary initiatives, both public and private, have been implemented. This paper presents the structure and results of the SEA of the plans to expand silviculture of eucalyptus and biofuels in the Extreme South Region of Bahia state, in the Brazilian Northeast, in a context of sectoral planning dissociated from government guidelines for land use policy and environmental protection. It portrays a practical case of methodological proposal for the use of socio-environmental criteria to establish limits for land occupation by monocultures, for each of the municipalities of the study region, according to their specific climate, soil, relief and environmental preservation characteristics. Various alternatives were identified to ensure areas with greater productivity for small family farming and areas with potential for preservation. SEA helped to a better understanding of the effects of the expansion of the planting areas in each alternative, which was essential to help all stakeholders visualize the consequences of their strategies. Consequently, as results the SEA outlined a series of guidelines and restrictions for the various levels of government and the production sector. For instance, SEA suggested for Federal, State and Municipality governments that areas with better soil and climate conditions could be reserved for public policies to incentive the diversification of the uses of the territory, such as food production. SEA also suggests the adoption of incentive programs to establish multiple-use forests. The SEA recommended that the state government integrate its program for strengthening family agriculture with land-use planning criteria, based on cooperative systems The methodology employed has evidences to be replicable in other regions of Brazil and in developing countries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Against the backdrop of expanding commercial crop markets and private well expansion, market-oriented agriculture has developed in villages with access to abundant water resources in Tamil Nadu, India. On the other hands, the villages that have failed to secure sufficient irrigation water have experienced sharp decline in cropping. Such land has been rapidly invaded by Prosopis juliflora, a tree species that has wide adaptability of the different environments and high coppicing ability. This species has traditionally been harvested as a fuel for domestic use and small-scale businesses, and recognised as "a tree for the poor". However, since the establishment of the electricity act in 2003, which completely deregulated participation of private companies in the electricity generation industry, the new usage of Prosopis has been created: several small-scale electricity generating plants began to utilise this tree as an energy source. As a result, the demand for Prosopis tree rapidly increased and the real price of raw wood has more than doubled between 2003 and 2009. A census survey of household income revealed that income generated from Prosopis expansion compensated for the decrease of cropping, and contributed to an increase in the net household income, especially for the landless labourers and middle class land holders. This fact indicates that it is possible to reduce poverty in a semi-arid rural area without securing additional irrigation water, in case proper institutions and technologies are in place. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of forward scenarios to forecast the environmental implications of potential changes in climate and land use is a useful tool for policy development. In this paper, we projected the potential responses of bird communities to both climate and agricultural changes. We created four scenarios of agricultural changes (current trends, biofuel development, livestock extensification and agricultural extensification), each developed at national or regional level of policy-making. We further considered three climatic scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) from among the IPCC 4th Assessment Report scenarios. We assessed changes in bird communities based on the predicted changes in agricultural land use and climatic suitability using various indicators, including the European Farmland Bird Indicator (FBI) and the Community Specialisation Index (CSI). We found that trends in the different indicators differed greatly from each other depending on the agricultural scenarios and policy-making scale. Our results suggest that public policies that promote extensive agricultural practices are more appropriate for improving the fate of bird communities in agricultural landscapes, especially with the regionalisation of agricultural policy. These results provide a readily accessible visualisation of the potential impacts of land use and climate change on farmland bird communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As with other recent techno-science controversies, the controversy over biofuels has resulted in a drive for a more policy relevant bioenergy science in the UK. Whilst recognised as fundamental to the technological development of a modern bioenergy sector, publicly funded science is increasingly concerned with the delivery of a 'sustainable bioenergy'. However, the way in which science should engage with concepts such as sustainability is contested and the subject of much academic and political debate. This paper draws on the sustainability science literature and detailed empirical evidence to explore operational barriers encountered by two UK bioenergy research projects involved explicitly in contributing to the sustainability of bioenergy. Tensions within the two programmes are explored qualitatively using a simple model characterising the attributes of knowledge production for sustainability. It is argued that despite attempting to build a broad social accountability into the projects, a narrow focus on policy relevance and perceived scientific credibility potentially undermine these efforts. The implications of this are discussed in the context of a science for sustainability and future science policy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article addresses the life-cycle assessment of an energy conversion system for the coproduction of fuels and electricity from a gasification-based biosyngas feedstock via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis coupled with a combined-cycle process. Inventory data obtained mainly through process simulation are used to evaluate the environmental performance of the system in terms of abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification, and eutrophication. Furthermore, the cumulative non-renewable energy demand of the system is quantified and used in the calculation of the life-cycle energy balance of the system, which is found to be positive.Biosyngas generation arises as the main source of impact, with a much higher contribution than the rest of processes (production of catalysts, waste treatment, etc.). Electricity, diesel, gasoline and surplus hydrogen are the products of the system. The environmental profiles of these bioproducts are calculated and compared with those of fossil diesel, rapeseed biodiesel, soybean biodiesel, fossil gasoline, corn bioethanol, steam-methane reforming hydrogen, and the EU electrical grid. Overall, the bioproducts from the evaluated system are found to be promising alternatives to current energy products from a life-cycle environmental perspective. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass is emerging as one of the most important technologies for sustainable development. To use this biomass, it is necessary to circumvent the physical and chemical barriers presented by the cohesive combination of the main biomass components, which hinders the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. This study evaluated the hydrolytic capacity of enzymes produced by yeasts, isolated from the soils of the Brazilian Cerrado biome (savannah) and the Amazon region, on sugarcane bagasse pre-treated with H2SO4. Among the 103 and 214 yeast isolates from the Minas Gerais Cerrado and the Amazon regions, 18 (17.47%) and 11 (5.14%) isolates, respectively, were cellulase-producing. Cryptococcus laurentii was prevalent and produced significant β-glucosidase levels, which were higher than the endo- and exoglucanase activities. In natura sugarcane bagasse was pre-treated with 2% H2SO4 for 30 min at 150oC. Subsequently, the obtained fibrous residue was subjected to hydrolysis using the Cryptococcus laurentii yeast enzyme extract for 72 h. This enzyme extract promoted the conversion of approximately 32% of the cellulose, of which 2.4% was glucose, after the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, suggesting that C. laurentii is a good β-glucosidase producer. The results presented in this study highlight the importance of isolating microbial strains that produce enzymes of biotechnological interest, given their extensive application in biofuel production. © 2013 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Euphorbia characias has drawn much attention as a potential bioenergy crop given its considerable amount of latex, rich in hydrocarbon-like compounds, and its ability to grow in large areas of semiarid lands. Compositions of major constituents with an energy value have been determined for the three phenological stages of this plant (preflowering, flowering, and postflowering) and different irrigation treatments. Metabolites from both nonpolar and polar extracts have been identified and quantified by GC-MS, GC-FID, HPLC-ELSD, and UPLC-PDA-MS. The results highlight that the end of the flowering period is the optimal harvesting time to maximize the yields of E. characias as a potential energy crop. The total water requirements to obtain the maximum yields of hexane- and methanol-extractables were determined for its annual development cycle. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Climate change and global public health is a growing concern among the pulmonary care community. The Turkish Thoracic Society and the American Thoracic Society held special sessions during their 2013 annual conferences to discuss the impact of climate change on the environment and public health. These sessions are summarized in this review to illustrate the global consequences of climate change. Climate and its impact on air pollution and the relative incidence, timing and length of allergens in the atmosphere (pollen and allergen season) are presented. The influence of climate change on housing, indoor air quality and public health is discussed, along with how climate change is uniquely affecting low resource countries due to the process of desertification and its impact on water and food. The European and Caribbean perspectives of climate change on human vulnerability and adaption strategies are discussed, along with how federal and global policies might be implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change. © 2013 by Turkish Thoracic Society.

AB  - It is generally accepted as a fact in the biogas technology that protein-rich biomass substrates should be avoided due to inevitable process inhibition. Substrate compositions with a low C/N ratio are considered difficult to handle and may lead to process failure, though protein-rich industrial waste products have outstanding biogas generation potential. This common belief has been challenged by using protein-rich substrates, i.e. casein and precipitated pig blood protein in laboratory scale continuously stirred mesophilic fed-batch biogas fermenters. Both substrates proved suitable for sustained biogas production (0.447 L CH4/g protein oDM, i.e. organic total solids) in high yield without any additives, following a period of adaptation of the microbial community. The apparent key limiting factors in the anaerobic degradation of these proteinaceous materials were the accumulation of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Changes in time in the composition of the microbiological community were determined by next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic analyses. Characteristic rearrangements of the biogas-producing community upon protein feeding and specific differences due to the individual protein substrates were recognized. The results clearly demonstrate that sustained biogas production is readily achievable, provided the system is well-characterized, understood and controlled. Biogas yields (0.45 L CH4/g oDM) significantly exceeding those of the commonly used agricultural substrates (0.25-0.28 L CH4/g oDM) were routinely obtained. The results amply reveal that these high-energy-content waste products can be converted to biogas, a renewable energy carrier with flexible uses that can replace fossil natural gas in its applications. Process control, with appropriate acclimation of the microbial community to the unusual substrate, is necessary. Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community by next-generation sequencing allows a precise determination of the alterations in the community composition in the course of the process. © 2013 Kovács et al.

AB  - Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosic biomass offers an alternative route to renewable energy. The crop pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is a promising fungal biocatalyst because of its broad host range and innate ability to co-saccharify and ferment lignocellulose to bioethanol. A major challenge for cellulolytic CBP-enabling microbes is alcohol inhibition. This research tested the hypothesis that Agrobacterium tumefaciens - mediated transformation (ATMT) could be exploited as a tool to generate phenotypic diversity in F. oxysporum to investigate alcohol stress tolerance encountered during CBP. A random mutagenesis library of gene disruption transformants (n=1,563) was constructed and screened for alcohol tolerance in order to isolate alcohol sensitive or tolerant phenotypes. Following three rounds of screening, exposure of select transformants to 6% ethanol and 0.75% n-butanol resulted respectively in increased (≥11.74%) and decreased (≤43.01%) growth compared to the wild -type (WT). Principal component analysis (PCA) quantified the level of phenotypic diversity across the population of genetically transformed individuals and isolated candidate strains for analysis. Characterisation of one strain, Tr. 259, ascertained a reduced growth phenotype under alcohol stress relative to WT and indicated the disruption of a coding region homologous to a putative sugar transporter (FOXG_09625). Quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) showed FOXG_09625 was differentially expressed in Tr. 259 compared to WT during alcohol-induced stress (P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of putative sugar transporters suggests diverse functional roles in F. oxysporum and other filamentous fungi compared to yeast for which sugar transporters form part of a relatively conserved family. This study has confirmed the potential of ATMT coupled with a phenotypic screening program to select for genetic variation induced in response to alcohol stress. This research represents a first step in the investigation of alcohol tolerance in F. oxysporum and has resulted in the identification of several novel strains, which will be of benefit to future biofuel research. © 2013 Hennessy et al.

AB  - Oil palm tree residues are a rich biomass resource in Malaysia, and it is therefore very important that they be utilized for more beneficial purposes, particularly in the context of the development of biofuels. This paper described the possibility of utilizing oil palm tree residues as biofuels by producing bio-oil and bio-char via pyrolysis. The process was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature of 500 C, a nitrogen flow rate of 2 L/min and a reaction time of 60 min. The physical and chemical properties of the products, which are important for biofuel testing, were then characterized. The results showed that the yields of the bio-oil and bio-char obtained from different residues varied within the ranges of 16.58-43.50 wt% and 28.63-36.75 wt%, respectively. The variations in the yields resulted from differences in the relative amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, volatiles, fixed carbon, and ash in the samples. The energy density of the bio-char was found to be higher than that of the bio-oil. The highest energy density of the bio-char was obtained from a palm leaf sample (23.32 MJ/kg), while that of the bio-oil was obtained from a frond sample (15.41 MJ/kg). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Global warming predictions indicate that temperatures will increase by another 2-6°C by the end of this century. High temperature is a major abiotic stress limiting plant growth and productivity in many areas of the world. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a model herbaceous bioenergy crop, due to its rapid growth rate, reliable biomass yield, minimal requirements of water and nutrients, adaptability to grow on marginal lands and widespread distribution throughout North America. The effect of high temperature on switchgrass physiology, cell wall composition and biomass yields has been reported. However, there is void in the knowledge of the molecular responses to heat stress in switchgrass.Results: We conducted long-term heat stress treatment (38°/30°C, day/night, for 50 days) in the switchgrass cultivar Alamo. A significant decrease in the plant height and total biomass was evident in the heat stressed plants compared to controls. Total RNA from control and heat stress samples were used for transcriptome analysis with switchgrass Affymetrix genechips. Following normalization and pre-processing, 5365 probesets were identified as differentially expressed using a 2-fold cutoff. Of these, 2233 probesets (2000 switchgrass unigenes) were up-regulated, and 3132 probesets (2809 unigenes) were down-regulated. Differential expression of 42 randomly selected genes from this list was validated using RT-PCR. Rice orthologs were retrieved for 78.7% of the heat stress responsive switchgrass probesets. Gene ontology (GOs) enrichment analysis using AgriGO program showed that genes related to ATPase regulator, chaperone binding, and protein folding was significantly up-regulated. GOs associated with protein modification, transcription, phosphorus and nitrogen metabolic processes, were significantly down-regulated by heat stress.Conclusions: Plausible connections were identified between the identified GOs, physiological responses and heat response phenotype observed in switchgrass plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis in response to heat stress among four monocots - switchgrass, rice, wheat and maize identified 16 common genes, most of which were associated with protein refolding processes. These core genes will be valuable biomarkers for identifying heat sensitive plant germplasm since they are responsive to both short duration as well as chronic heat stress treatments, and are also expressed in different plant growth stages and tissue types. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas L. is an oil seed producing non-leguminous tropical shrub that has good potential to be a fuel plant that can be cultivated on marginal land. Due to the low nutrient content of the targeted plantation area, the requirement for fertilizer is expected to be higher than other plants. This factor severely affects the commercial viability of J. curcas. Results: We explored the feasibility to use endophytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are native to J. curcas to improve plant growth, biomass and seed productivity. We demonstrated that a novel N-fixing endophyte, Enterobacter sp. R4-368, was able to colonize in root and stem tissues and significantly promoted early plant growth and seed productivity of J. curcas in sterilized and non-sterilized soil. Inoculation of young seedling led to an approximately 57.2% increase in seedling vigour over a six week period. At 90 days after planting, inoculated plants showed an average increase of 25.3%, 77.7%, 27.5%, 45.8% in plant height, leaf number, chlorophyll content and stem volume, respectively. Notably, inoculation of the strain led to a 49.0% increase in the average seed number per plant and 20% increase in the average single seed weight when plants were maintained for 1.5 years in non-sterilized soil in pots in the open air. Enterobacter sp. R4-368 cells were able to colonize root tissues and moved systemically to stem tissues. However, no bacteria were found in leaves. Promotion of plant growth and leaf nitrogen content by the strain was partially lost in nifH, nifD, nifK knockout mutants, suggesting the presence of other growth promoting factors that are associated with this bacterium strain. Conclusion: Our results showed that Enterobacter sp. R4-368 significantly promoted growth and seed yield of J. curcas. The application of the strains is likely to significantly improve the commercial viability of J. curcas due to the reduced fertilizer cost and improved oil yield. © 2013 Madhaiyan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: The availability of feedstock options is a key to meeting the volumetric requirement of 136.3 billion liters of renewable fuels per year beginning in 2022, as required in the US 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of sorghum-based ethanol need to be assessed for sorghum to play a role in meeting that requirement. Results: Multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways show diverse well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and GHG emissions due to differences in energy use and fertilizer use intensity associated with sorghum growth and differences in the ethanol conversion processes. All sorghum-based ethanol pathways can achieve significant fossil energy savings. Relative to GHG emissions from conventional gasoline, grain sorghum-based ethanol can reduce WTW GHG emissions by 35% or 23%, respectively, when wet or dried distillers grains with solubles (DGS) is the co-product and fossil natural gas (FNG) is consumed as the process fuel. The reduction increased to 56% or 55%, respectively, for wet or dried DGS co-production when renewable natural gas (RNG) from anaerobic digestion of animal waste is used as the process fuel. These results do not include land-use change (LUC) GHG emissions, which we take as negligible. If LUC GHG emissions for grain sorghum ethanol as estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included (26 g CO2e/MJ), these reductions when wet DGS is co-produced decrease to 7% or 29% when FNG or RNG is used as the process fuel. Sweet sorghum-based ethanol can reduce GHG emissions by 71% or 72% without or with use of co-produced vinasse as farm fertilizer, respectively, in ethanol plants using only sugar juice to produce ethanol. If both sugar and cellulosic bagasse were used in the future for ethanol production, an ethanol plant with a combined heat and power (CHP) system that supplies all process energy can achieve a GHG emission reduction of 70% or 72%, respectively, without or with vinasse fertigation. Forage sorghum-based ethanol can achieve a 49% WTW GHG emission reduction when ethanol plants meet process energy demands with CHP. In the case of forage sorghum and an integrated sweet sorghum pathway, the use of a portion of feedstock to fuel CHP systems significantly reduces fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Conclusions: This study provides new insight into life-cycle energy use and GHG emissions of multiple sorghum-based ethanol production pathways in the US. Our results show that adding sorghum feedstocks to the existing options for ethanol production could help in meeting the requirements for volumes of renewable, advanced and cellulosic bioethanol production in the US required by the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard program. © 2013 Cai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Willows are one of the most important landscaping, biofuel, and raw timber tree species in the world. Cultivating fast-growing, salt-tolerant willow varieties is an effective way to balance wood supply and demand in China. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of the phenotypic development and physiological responses of two willow varieties, Salix L0911 (L0911) and Salix matsudana (SM), to salt stress. L0911 developed more biomass than SM and demonstrated higher tolerance to long-term exposures to NaCl-salinity. The two varieties demonstrated similar trends of physiological changes under salt stress, but the extent of the induced responses were higher in L0911, suggesting the involvement of specific responses in the salt-tolerant mechanism. Specifically, the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, soluble proteins and proline contents were higher in L0911 compared to SM, and the content of malondialdehyde and Na+ and Na+/K+ ratios were lower, demonstrating that the improved tolerance to salinity in L0911 is based on antioxidant response and improved ion selectivity. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Landcover change alters not only the surface landscape but also regional carbon and water cycling. The objective of this study was to assess the potential impacts of landcover change across the Kansas River Basin (KRB) by comparing local microclimatic impacts and regional scale climate influences. This was done using a 25-year time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and precipitation (PPT) data analyzed using multi-resolution information theory metrics. Results showed both entropy of PPT and NDVI varied along a pronounced PPT gradient. The scalewise relative entropy of NDVI was the most informative at the annual scale, while for PPT the scalewise relative entropy varied temporally and by landcover type. The relative entropy of NDVI and PPT as a function of landcover showed the most information at the 512-day scale for all landcover types, implying different landcover types had the same response across the entire KRB. This implies that land use decisions may dramatically alter the local time scales of responses to global climate change. Additionally, altering land cover (e.g., for biofuel production) may impact ecosystem functioning at local to regional scales and these impacts must be considered for accurately assessing future implications of climate change. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Giant miscanthus is under consideration as a biofuel crop in the United States; however, there is little information on weed management for the establishment and survival of this crop. Therefore, greenhouse and field studies using ornamental pots were conducted in summer 2011 at Tifton, GA, with the objective of screening potential PPI, PRE, and POST herbicides and herbicide combinations for giant miscanthus when establishing from vegetative rhizomes. For the POST treatments, giant miscanthus was established from rhizomes in 7.6-L containers in the field and treated with 27 POST herbicides to evaluate efficacy. Thifensulfuron, metsulfuron, tribenuron, chlorimuron, halosulfuron, rimsulfuron, cloransulam, pinoxaden, bentazon, and metribuzin did not significantly lower shoot height, reduce shoot dry weight, or increase injury compared with nontreated control (NTC) when evaluated at 4 wk after treatment. Nicosulfuron, trifloxysulfuron, sulfometuron, clodinafop, fluazifop, and pyrithiobac caused the greatest injury, reduced plant height, and reduced dry weights compared with the NTC. Sethoxydim, diclofop, flumioxazin, imazamox, imazapic, and imazethapyr decreased plant heights or resulted in increased injury. PPI and PRE treatments included 21 herbicides and herbicide combinations applied at two rates. Results indicated that most treatments containing atrazine, metribuzin, pendimethalin, acetochlor, metolachlor, and mesotrione did not injure or stunt growth; however, EPTC at 4.5 kg ai ha-1 significantly reduced height and dry weight and oxadiazon resulted in greater injury compared with NTC at both rates. These results indicate that PPI, PRE, and POST herbicides can be utilized for establishment of giant miscanthus from vegetative rhizomes. Considering the invasive potential of giant miscanthus, several POST herbicides evaluated in this study such as fluazifop, pyrithiobac, and sulfometuron may be viable options to control this species if it becomes invasive.

AB  - In 2009, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), established sustainability criteria for biofuels including legal thresholds for specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, expressed as g CO2eq per MJ of biofuel. Because biofuels are a major market for winter oilseed rape (WOSR), investigating the possible impact of the RED on WOSR cropping practices is prudent. This study analyses GHG emissions for WOSR cropping practices (namely N fertilization intensity, tillage method and crop rotation) basing on a 6-year field trial in a high yielding area of northern Germany. Using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology the field emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) are calculated from the nitrogen (N) inputs to the cropping system.Results showed that the predominant source of GHG emissions is the N related emissions from production of fertilizer and N2O field emissions. Specific GHG emissions are lowest without N fertilizer but rise continuously with increasing N rates. Yield per ha also responded to N fertilization resulting in lowered acreage productivity when reducing GHG emissions by reducing N fertilization level. Most calculated scenarios and cropping systems result in a drastic decrease of N fertilization to achieve thresholds, causing substantial yield losses. To a certain extent, the required drastic reduction of N fertilization in some scenarios is driven by using the IPCC methodology for calculating N2O emissions. Therefore characteristics of this methodology are also discussed within this study. To mitigate the impact of the RED on WOSR, peas (legumes) may be a possible preceding crop to WOSR. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phytoremediation of soils contaminated by heavy metals was tested by liming (CaCO3) or adding biochar (1%, 5% and 10%, mass fraction) and by growing rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), a common bioenergy crop. Bioavailable metal concentrations (0.01molL-1 CaCl2 extraction) decreased with increasing concentrations of biochar amendment. The reduction reached 71%, 87% and 92% for Cd, Zn and Pb respectively in the presence of 10% biochar. Twelve weeks after sowing, all plants cultivated on the untreated soil and on the soil amended by biochar at 1% had died, while the plants grew normally on the soil that had the other treatments. Compared to liming, treatment with 10% biochar proved equally efficient in reducing metal concentrations in shoots but the biomass production tripled as a result of the soil fertility improvement. Thus, in addition to C sequestration, the incorporation of biochar into metal-contaminated soils could make it possible to cultivate bioenergy crops without encroaching on agricultural lands. Although additional investigations are needed, we suggest that the harvested biomass might in turn be used as feedstock for pyrolysis to produce both bioenergy and new biochar, which could contribute further to the reduction of CO2 emission. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The United States has an abundant potential of biomass resources that can be used as bioenergy feedstocks; however, biomass in its raw, "as-harvested" form is not necessarily in a format (low bulk density and high moisture content) that meets theneeds for the biofuel or bioenergy industry. Both high production and niche crops must be used together to meet the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s goal to supply 36 billion gallons of renewable transportation fuels by 2022. To reach this goal, the United States must use more than just the common biomass sources such as corn stover, switchgrass, and other high production energy crops; it must also find ways to combine additionalfeedstocks as well. This study shows that the formulation of mixed feedstocks using niche and high production crops can produce feedstocks that meet the uniform format required by industry. Corn stover, switchgrass, lodgpole pine, and eucalyptus were combined during preprocessing followed by densification into pellets, resulting in a denser, higher energy value, more durable feedstock than the average of these fuels individually. This study also compares the energy consumption involved in preprocessing biomass. In the case of grinding energies for both Stage-I and Stage-II processes, corn stover and switchgrass consumed the least at about 19 and 34 kW hr/ton and 11 and 18 kW hr/ton, respectively, whereas the highest was both woody biomass types at about 94 and 43-49 kW hr/ton. The bulk density of pelletized blended feedstock is about 729 kg/m3 andis higher than what corn stover and switchgrass pelletized individually can achieve. The heating values are highest for woody biomass at about 18.37-19.30 MJ/kg and lowest for corn stover and switchgrass, which were both in the range of 16.74-16.97 MJ/kg. From these results, we can conclude that the physical and energy properties of blended feedstocks are better than just individually pelletized herbaceous biomass. © 2013 American Scientific Publishers.

AB  - This article examines the potential contribution of household scale off-grid renewable energy generation to the post-carbon economy. The large-scale focus of the green jobs agenda in high-income countries obscures how small-scale technologies can be a transformative source of employment in developing economies. Debates about what constitutes a green job and their value leaves out the everyday practice of green livelihoods carried out by the urban poor across the African continent in unfavourable institutional contexts where nonrenewable fuel is subsidised and renewable energy inputs are heavily taxed. The article presents experiences from field work in several countries, including Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya to provide practical examples of communities pursuing strategies of income generation, community empowerment and environmental preservation. We argue that scholars and practitioners concerned with both social justice and environmental preservation should embrace a definition of green jobs that is bottom-up or people-centred. The grassroots experiences highlighted illustrate the important role of non-governmental organisations in supporting transformative, locally sustainable green employment and livelihoods by piloting demonstration projects, fostering innovation, conducting research, forming coalitions and engaging in advocacy when local institutions and market conditions make both consumers and providers risk averse to off-grid renewable energy adoption. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The extensive land use conversion expected to occur to meet demands for bioenergy feedstock production will likely have widespread impacts on agroecosystem biodiversity and ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Although arthropod detritivores are known to contribute to litter decomposition and thus energy flow and nutrient cycling in many plant communities, their importance in bioenergy feedstock communities has not yet been assessed. We undertook an experimental study quantifying rates of litter mass loss and nutrient cycling in the presence and absence of these organisms in three bioenergy feedstock crops-miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and a planted prairie community. Overall arthropod abundance and litter decomposition rates were similar in all three communities. Despite effective reduction of arthropods in experimental plots via insecticide application, litter decomposition rates, inorganic nitrogen leaching, and carbon-nitrogen ratios did not differ significantly between control (with arthropods) and treatment (without arthropods) plots in any of the three community types. Our findings suggest that changes in arthropod faunal composition associated with widespread adoption of bioenergy feedstock crops may not be associated with profoundly altered arthropod-mediated litter decomposition and nutrient release. © 2012 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A cold-stress responsive protein was isolated from the freshwater alga Spirogyra varians and named SVCR1 (S. varians cold responsive protein). The protein was detected by comparing the protein profiles of plants grown at two different temperatures, 4 °C and 20 °C. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) showed that expression of the protein was reversibly regulated by cold stress. The full cDNA sequence of the protein was obtained using degenerate primers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity with early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs), a group of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins that are induced by high light stress in higher plants. The expression of svcr1 (S. varians cold responsive gene) responded more sensitively to cold than to high light. At temperatures over 10 °C, svcr1 was seldom expressed until light intensity reached 1,200 μmol photons m-2 s-1. At 4 °C, it was greatly up-regulated even in the dark. A sharp increase of svcr1 expression was observed when the algae were exposed to UV-A light for 1 h regardless of temperature. The addition of 5 % CO2 to the algal culture medium suppressed the expression of svcr1. The transcripts of svcr1 began to disappear as soon as 5 % CO2 was introduced to plants grown in the cold. The photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm and non-photochemical quenching induction) was measured at 4 °C and 20 °C using PAM. The decreased photosynthetic efficiency at 4 °C was recovered close to that of 20 °C when the 5 % CO2 was provided. These results suggest that the elevated carbon level in the solution may mitigate oxidative stress in photosystem caused by cold stress. The recovered photosynthetic efficiency with CO2 influx at 4 °C supported this hypothesis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Commercial fertilizer (particularly nitrogen) costs account for a substantial portion of the total production costs of cellulosic biomass and can be a major obstacle to biofuel production. In a series of greenhouse studies, we evaluated the feasibility of co-applying Gibberellins (GA) and reduced nitrogen (N) rates to produce a bioenergy crop less expensively. In a preliminary study, we determined the minimum combined application rates of GA and N required for efficient biomass (sweet sorghum, Sorghum bicolor) production. Co-application of 75 kg ha-1 (one-half of the recommended N rate for sorghum) and a modest GA rate of 3 g ha-1 optimized dry matter yield (DMY) and N and phosphorus (P) uptake efficiencies, resulting in a reduction of N and P leaching. Organic nutrient sources such as manures and biosolids can be substituted for commercial N fertilizers (and incidentally supply P) to further reduce the cost of nutrient supply for biomass production. Based on the results of the preliminary study, we conducted a second greenhouse study using sweet sorghum as a test bioenergy crop. We co-applied organic sources of N (manure and biosolids) at 75 and 150 kg PAN ha-1 (representing 50 and 100% N rate respectively) with 3 g GA ha-1. In each batch of experiment, the crop was grown for 8 wk on Immokalee fine sand of minimal native fertility. After harvest, sufficient water was applied to soil in each pot to yield ∼1.5 L (∼0.75 pore volume) of leachate, and analyzed for total N and soluble reactive P (SRP). The reduced (50%) N application rate, together with GA, optimized biomass production. Application of GA at 3 g ha-1, and the organic sources of N at 50% of the recommended N rate, decreased nutrient cost of producing the bioenergy biomass by ∼$375 ha-1 (&gt;90% of total nutrient cost), and could reduce offsite N and P losses from vulnerable soils. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Substantial improvements have been made to the Canadian Agricultural Nitrogen Budget model (CANB) for estimating residual soil nitrogen (RSN) and the indicator of the risk of water contamination by nitrogen (IROWC-N). These included new algorithms for manure, fertilizer and biological fixation inputs and losses as well as the incorporation of a versatile soil moisture model. The new semi-dynamic model (CANB v 3.0) was compared to the static model (CANB 2.0) for estimating both RSN and IROWC-N. Sensitivity analysis of the RSN component using 2006 land use practices was also conducted and crop yield and N uptake were found to be the most sensitive parameters, followed by biological N2 fixation and the addition of fertilizer N and manure N. Land use scenarios were evaluated to examine if increasing the proportion of biofuel crops grown in Canada would change RSN and IROWC-N appreciably. The analyses demonstrated that the area of canola and maize crops could be increased in Canada by up to 40% to meet biofuel production demands without significantly changing RSN and IROWC-N. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In an editorial of a recent issue of a known academic journal, Prof. Hartmut Michel affirmed that "...the production of biofuels constitutes an extremely inefficient land use... We should not grow plants for biofuel production.", after comparing the area occupied with plants for bioenergy production with the one required for photovoltaic cells to supply the same amount of energy for transportation. This assertion is not correct for all situations and this comparison deserves a more careful analysis, evaluating the actual and prospective technological scenarios and other relevant aspects, such as capacity requirements, energy consumed during the life cycle of energy systems and the associated impacts. In this communication this comparison is revaluated, presenting a different perspective, more favorable for the bioenergy routes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The possibility of economically deriving fuel from cultivating algae biomass is an attractive addition to the range of measures to relieve the current reliance on fossil fuels. Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favourable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty. By reviewing the status of this technology we suggest that the large uncertainties make it currently unsuitable as a priority for many developing countries. Using bibliometric and patent data analysis, we indicate that many developing countries lack the human capital to develop their own algae industry or adequately prepare policies to support imported technology. Also, we discuss the potential of modern biotechnology, especially genetic modification (GM) to produce new algal strains that are easier to harvest and yield more oil. Controversy surrounding the use of GM and weak biosafety regulatory system represents a significant challenge to adoption of GM technology in developing countries. A range of policy measures are also suggested to ensure that future progress in algae biofuels can contribute to sustainable development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the last decade Brazil has implemented a new and ambitious biofuel program: the National Program of Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB). When launching this program in 2004 the government stated that it wanted to avoid the same kind of geographical concentration, single crop focus, dominance of agribusiness, and exclusion of family farmers that have occurred with bioethanol production through the ProÁlcool policy since 1975. This paper compares the life histories of the bioethanol and the biodiesel policies of Brazil by analyzing their substantive policy content; the power and politics of actors that struggle for the design and implementation of the policies; and the polity in terms the organization and institutionalization of the policies. The paper concludes that both policies have become submerged by and dependent on the polity and politics of primarily the energy and agricultural sectors that operate as the two semi-autonomous governance fields. This submerging has shaped the substantive contents of biofuels policies, and explains why the 2004 biodiesel policy PNPB, in spite of its objectives for social inclusion and rural development, faces similar problems in implementation as its predecessor, the 1975 bioethanol policy ProÁlcool. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is considerable controversy about the impact of biofuels on food security in developing countries. A major concern is that biofuels reduce food security by increasing food prices. In this paper we use survey evidence to assess the impact of castor production on poor and food insecure rural households in Ethiopia. About 1/3 of poor farmers have allocated on average 15% of their land to the production of castor beans under contract in biofuel supply chains. Castor production significantly improves their food security: they have fewer months without food and the amount of food they consume increases. Castor cultivation is beneficial for participating households' food security in several ways: by generating cash income from castor contracts, they can store food for the lean season; castor beans preserve well on the field which allows sales when farmers are in need of cash (or food); spillover effects of castor contracts increases the productivity of food crops. Increased food crop productivity offsets the amount of land used for castor so that the total local food supply is not affected. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The global indirect land use change (ILUC) implications of biofuel use in the United States of America (USA) from 2001 to 2010 are evaluated with a dynamic general equilibrium model. The effects of biofuels production on agricultural land area vary by year; from a net expansion of 0.17. ha per 1000 gallons produced (2002) to a net contraction of -0.13. ha per 1000 gallons (2018) in Case 1 of our simulation. In accordance with the general narrative about the implications of biofuel policy, agricultural land area increased in many regions of the world. However, oil-export dependent economies experienced agricultural land contraction because of reductions in their revenues. Reducing crude oil imports is a major goal of biofuel policy, but the land use change implications have received little attention in the literature. Simulations evaluating the effects of doubling supply elasticities for land and fossil resources show that these parameters can significantly influence the land use change estimates. Therefore, research that provides empirically-based and spatially-detailed agricultural land-supply curves and capability to project future fossil energy prices is critical for improving estimates of the effects of biofuel policy on land use. © 2013.

AB  - Political agendas worldwide include increased production of biofuel, which multiplies the trade-offs among conflicting objectives, including food and fodder production, water quantity, water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Quantification of trade-offs among objectives in bioenergy crop production is most frequently accomplished by a comparison of a limited number of plausible scenarios. Here we analyze biophysical trade-offs among bioenergy crop production based on rape seed, food crop production, water quantity, and water quality in the Parthe catchment in Central Germany. Based on an integrated river basin model (SWAT) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), we estimated Pareto optimal frontiers among multiple objectives. Results indicate that the same level of bioenergy crop production can be achieved at different costs with respect to the other objectives. Intermediate rapeseed production does not lead to strong trade-offs with water quality and low flow if a reduction of food and fodder production can be accepted. Compared to solutions focused on maximizing food and fodder yield, solutions with intermediate rapeseed production even improve with respect to water quality and low flow. If rapeseed production is further increased, negative effects on low flow prevail. The major achievement of the optimization approach is the quantification of the functional trade-offs for the feasible range of all objectives. The application of the approach provides the results of what is in effect an infinite number of scenarios. We offer a general methodology that may be used to support recommendations for the best way to achieve certain goals, and to compare the optimal outcomes given different policy preferences. In addition, visualization options of the resulting non-dominated solutions are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The possibility of limiting the global warming is strictly linked to the reduction of GHG emissions. Renewable energy both allows reducing emissions and permits to delay fossil fuel depletion. The anaerobic digestion of animal manure and energy crops is a promising way of reducing GHG emissions. In Italy agricultural biogas production was considerably increased; nowadays there are about 520 agricultural biogas plants.The increasing number of biogas plants, especially of those larger than 500kWe (electrical power), involves a high consumption of energy crops, large transport distances of biomass and digestate and difficulties on thermal energy valorization.In this study the energetic (CED) and environmental (GHG emissions) profiles associated with the production of electricity derived from biogas have been identified. Three biogas plants located in Northern Italy have been analyzed. The study has been carried out considering a cradle-to-grave perspective and thus, special attention has been paid on the feedstock production and biogas production process. The influences on the results taking into account different plant sizes and feeding rate has been assessed in detail.Energy analysis was performed using the Cumulative Energy Demand method (CED). The climate change was calculated for a 100-year time frame based on GHG emissions indicated as CO2 equivalents (eq) and defined by the IPCC (2006).In comparison to the fossil reference system, the electricity production using biogas saves GHG emissions from 0.188 to 1.193kgCO2eq per kWhe. Electricity supply from biogas can also contribute to a considerable reduction of the use of fossil energy carriers (from -3.97 to 10.08MJfossil per kWhe). The electricity production from biogas has a big potential for energy savings and reduction of GHG emissions. Efficient utilization of the cogenerated heat can substantially improve the GHG balance of electricity production from biogas. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Calculations of dry tree, plot and regional aboveground biomass, M, and assessments of complex diverse forests remain key challenges in the implementation of conventional and sustainable projects. This study reports a set of robust regional equations and the application of several allometric tree and plot M equations in Mexican arid and semi-arid forest communities. The data were collected from 1084 tree M fitting models, and 195 arid and semi-arid and 206 mesquite trees and 55 plot datasets were used to validate the models. Theoretical, semi-empirical and empirical models with exogenous variables, as well as wood specific gravity, diameter, top height, and form-factor values, were used to evaluate aboveground biomass. Empirical computer-based equations projected more consistently similar tree M assessments than did semi-empirical or theoretical models. Therefore, empirical models are recommended for assessments of tree and plot M, and future allometry research should properly address independent variables in more theoretical models. The large sample size, model richness, economic and ecological importance, and wide coverage of this dataset make it useful for estimating several biogeochemical and bioenergy density parameters and contribute to the body of knowledge regarding heterogeneity in dry forest stand structures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a coupled modeling framework to capture the dynamic linkages between agricultural and energy markets that have been enhanced through the expansion of biofuel production, as well as the environmental impacts resulting from this expansion. The framework incorporates the interactions between agricultural and energy markets at the macro-level, and an assessment of production practices and environmental impacts at the micro (field)-level. For macro-level analysis, we use two existing modeling frameworks: the CARD U.S. agricultural markets model and the MARKAL energy systems model. The integrated modeling of agricultural and energy markets will be useful in analyzing a range of scenarios regarding the role of biomass feedstocks from the agricultural sector in an expanding market for biomass-based fuels and energy. Moreover, by linking the macro-level analysis to the micro-scale (field-level) analysis, we can represent shifts in farming practices, average productivity, and costs of production, as well as the environmental consequences of farmers' decisions resulting from the expansion of biomass feedstock production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Society is fundamentally ambivalent to the use of plastics. On the one hand, plastics are uniquely flexible materials that have seen them occupy a huge range of functions, from simple packing materials to complex engineering components. On the other hand, their durability has raised concerns about their end-of-life disposal. When that disposal route is landfill, their invulnerability to microbial decomposition, combined with relatively low density and high bulk, means that plastics will occupy increasing amounts of landfill space in a world where available suitable landfill sites is shrinking.The search for biodegradable plastics and their introduction to the marketplace would appear to be a suitable amelioration strategy for such a problem. And yet the uptake of biodegradable plastics has been slow. The term biodegradable itself has entered public controversy, with accidental and intended misuse of the term; the intended misuse has led to accusations and instances of 'greenwashing'. For this and other reasons standards for biodegradability and compostability testing of plastics have been sought.An environmental dilemma with more far-reaching implications is climate change. The need for rapid and deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts is one of the drivers for the resurgence of industrial biotechnology generally, and the search for bio-based plastics more specifically. Bio-based has come to mean plastics based on renewable resources, but this need not necessarily imply biodegradability. If the primary purpose is GHG emissions savings, then once again plastics durability can be a virtue, if the end-of-life solution can be energy recovery during incineration or recycling. The pattern of production is shifting from the true biodegradable plastics to the bio-based plastics, and that trend is likely to persist into the future.This paper looks at aspects of the science of biodegradable and bio-based plastics from the perspective of policy advisers and makers. It is often said that the bioplastics suffer from a lack of a favourable policy regime when compared to the wide-ranging set of policy instruments that are available on both the supply and demand side of biofuels production. Some possible policy measures are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of land-use changes on climate are assessed using specified-concentration simulations complementary to the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) and RCP8.5 scenarios performed for phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This analysis focuses on differences in climate and land-atmosphere fluxes between the ensemble averages of simulations with and without land-use changes by the end of the twenty-first century. Even though common land-use scenarios are used, the areas of crops and pastures are specific for each Earth system model (ESM). This is due to different interpretations of land-use classes. The analysis reveals that fossil fuel forcing dominates land-use forcing. In addition, the effects of land-use changes are globally not significant, whereas they are significant for regions with land-use changes exceeding 10%. For these regions, three out of six participating models-the Second Generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2); Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2 (Earth System) (HadGEM2-ES); and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System Model (MIROC-ESM)-reveal statistically significant changes in mean annual surface air temperature. In addition, changes in land surface albedo, available energy, and latent heat fluxes are small but significant for most ESMs in regions affected by land-use changes. These climatic effects are relatively small, as land-use changes in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios are small in magnitude and mainly limited to tropical and subtropical regions. The relative importance of the climatic effects of land-use changes is higher for the RCP2.6 scenario, which considers an expansion of biofuel croplands as a climate mitigation option. The underlying similarity among all models is the loss in global land carbon storage due to land-use changes. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - The production of transportation fuels from the conversion of biomass into gasoline and diesel in a bio-refinery is an attractive, clean, carbon neutral and sustainable process. The investment cost for the commercial application of a stand-alone bio-refinery may be reduced via integration with an existing petroleum refinery, whereby bio-refinery intermediates can be upgraded using the existing petroleum refinery infrastructure. In this work, two options of operational scenarios are studied and compared. The first option is to consider the bio-refinery and an existing petroleum refinery as stand-alone plants. The second option is to integrate bio-refinery network into an existing petroleum refinery and view it as an enterprise plant. The enterprise plant is represented in a superstructure, which is formulated as an MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) model. The MINLP model involves logic constraints to allow the conditional designing of the optimal enterprise plant network. The model application is demonstrated on representative case studies. The model results shows that the optimal enterprise plant network design achieved 2.82% ($21.5MM/year) higher profit compared to the combined profits of the stand-alone plants. As a result, the payback time for a new bio-refinery investment is reduced from 6.9 to 4.7 years. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An integrated multi-feedstock (i.e. switchgrass and crop residue) lignocellulosic-based bioethanol supply chain is studied under jointly occurring uncertainties in switchgrass yield, crop residue purchase price, bioethanol demand and sales price. A two-stage stochastic mathematical model is proposed to maximize expected profit by optimizing the strategic and tactical decisions. A case study based on ND (North Dakota) state in the U.S. demonstrates that in a stochastic environment it is cost effective to meet 100% of ND's annual gasoline demand from bioethanol by using switchgrass as a primary and crop residue as a secondary biomass feedstock. Although results show that the financial performance is degraded as variability of the uncertain parameters increases, the proposed stochastic model increasingly outperforms the deterministic model under uncertainties. The locations of biorefineries (i.e. first-stage integer variables) are insensitive to the uncertainties. Sensitivity analysis shows that "mean" value of stochastic parameters has a significant impact on the expected profit and optimal values of first-stage continuous variables. Increase in level of mean ethanol demand and mean sale price results in higher bioethanol production. When mean switchgrass yield is at low level and mean crop residue price is at high level, all the available marginal land is used for switchgrass cultivation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Because of the world energy crisis, many countries have initiated a series of measures to resolve this problem through alternative energy resources. Biodiesel as an alternate fuel has received much attention in recent years. A number of reports are available on the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils and related sources but its production from microalgae is a highly prospective field. Microalgae can produce and accumulate lipids within their cells. These lipids on transesterification yields biodiesel. Hence, microalgae have the capacity to produce more biodiesel per acre land than any other plants or living organisms. This manuscript deals with chemical and biochemical aspects of microalgae-based biodiesel and methodology of its production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Recently, Jatropha curcas L. has attracted worldwide attention for its potential as a source of biodiesel. However, most DNA markers have demonstrated high levels of genetic similarity among and within jatropha populations around the globe. Despite promising features of copia-type retrotransposons as ideal genetic tools for gene tagging, mutagenesis, and marker-assisted selection, they have not been characterized in the jatropha genome yet. Here, we examined the diversity, evolution, and genome-wide organization of copia-type retrotransposons in the Asian, African, and Mesoamerican accessions of jatropha, then introduced a retrotransposon-based marker for this biofuel crop. Results: In total, 157 PCR fragments that were amplified using the degenerate primers for the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of copia-type retroelements were sequenced and aligned to construct the neighbor-joining tree. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that isolated copia RT sequences were classified into ten families, which were then grouped into three lineages. An in-depth study of the jatropha genome for the RT sequences of each family led to the characterization of full consensus sequences of the jatropha copia-type families. Estimated copy numbers of target sequences were largely different among families, as was presence of genes within 5 kb flanking regions for each family. Five copia-type families were as appealing candidates for the development of DNA marker systems. A candidate marker from family Jc7 was particularly capable of detecting genetic variation among different jatropha accessions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosomes reveals that copia-type retrotransposons are scattered across chromosomes mainly located in the distal part regions. Conclusion: This is the first report on genome-wide analysis and the cytogenetic mapping of copia-type retrotransposons of jatropha, leading to the discovery of families bearing high potential as DNA markers. Distinct dynamics of individual copia-type families, feasibility of a retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism marker system in examining genetic variability, and approaches for the development of breeding strategies in jatropha using copia-type retrotransposons are discussed. © 2013 Alipour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Though n-butanol has been proposed as a potential transportation biofuel, its toxicity often causes oxidative stress in the host microorganism and is considered one of the bottlenecks preventing its efficient mass production. Results: To relieve the oxidative stress in the host cell, metallothioneins (MTs), which are known as scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS), were engineered in E. coli hosts for both cytosolic and outer-membrane-targeted (osmoregulatory membrane protein OmpC fused) expression. Metallothioneins from human (HMT), mouse (MMT), and tilapia fish (TMT) were tested. The host strain expressing membrane-targeted TMT showed the greatest ability to reduce oxidative stresses induced by n-butanol, ethanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and nickel. The same strain also allowed for an increased growth rate of recombinant E. coli under n-butanol stress. Further experiments indicated that the TMT-fused OmpC protein could not only function in ROS scavenging but also regulate either glycine betaine (GB) or glucose uptake via osmosis, and the dual functional fusion protein could contribute in an enhancement of the host microorganism's growth rate. Conclusions: The abilities of scavenging intracellular or extracellular ROS by these engineering E. coli were examined, and TMT show the best ability among three MTs. Additionally, the membrane-targeted fusion protein, OmpC-TMT, improved host tolerance up to 1.5% n-butanol above that of TMT which is only 1%. These results presented indicate potential novel approaches for engineering stress tolerant microorganism strains. © 2013 Chin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels derived from edible and non-edible oil are gaining interest as next generation fuels for replacement of conventional petroleum fuels. There is a huge potential for producing bio-diesel considering large and wide variety of biomass feedstock cultivated in India. In this context, this paper assesses the land requirements to meet the national biofuel policy target from different edible and non-edible seeds. This study has also been carried out as a comparative analysis between four different biodiesel crops for CO2 mitigation potential and with possible application for Clean Development Mechanism credits. Research indicates that in Indian perspective the mitigation potential of microalgae is the largest, followed by the Jatropha. Edible food crops Soya bean and coconut considered for this study found to have the smallest mitigation potential.

AB  - Microalgae are considered as the most promising renewable feedstock for biofuel production and biorefineries, due to their advantages of fast growth, efficient carbon dioxide fixation, not competing for arable lands and potable water, and potentially accumulating high amounts of lipids and carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates in microalgae biomass are mainly cellulose in the cell wall and starch in the plastids without lignin and low hemicelluloses contents, they can be readily converted into fermentable sugars. However, to date there are very few studies focusing on the use of microalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel production, which requires more understanding and knowledge to support the technical feasibility of this next-generation feedstock. This review article elucidates comprehensive information on the characteristics and metabolism of main fermentable microalgal carbohydrates (e.g., starch and cellulose), as well as the key factors and challenges that should be addressed during production and saccharification of microalgal carbohydrates. Furthermore, developments on the utilization of microalgae-based feedstock in producing liquid and gaseous biofuels are summarized. The objective of this article is to provide useful knowledge and information with regard to biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and commercial applications to assist in the viable technology development of for biofuels generation from microalgae-based carbohydrates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) produced for bioenergy is expected to compete with land resources used for stocker cattle (Bos taurus) grazing in the southern Great Plains. The objective was to determine the effect of stocking rate on animal performance, biomass yield, and quality. Three stocking rates (light [2.5 steers ha-1], moderate [4.9 steers ha-1], and heavy [7.4 steers ha-1]) and an ungrazed control were randomly assigned to twelve 0.81-ha paddocks in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Animal and biomass responses were analyzed using mixed ANOVA models. Average daily gain (P = 0.05) was 0.83, 1.04 and 1.05 kg head (hd)-1 for the light, moderate and heavy stocking rates, respectively. Grazing duration was affected (P &lt; 0.001) by stocking rate treatment, realizing 81, 43, and 28 d of grazing, respectively. Steer grazing days were not different (P = 0.22) between stocking rates treatments, producing 81, 86, and 84 d ha-1, respectively. Total gain by treatment were 167, 215, and 199 kg ha-1, respectively, and were different (P = 0.04). The ungrazed control produced more (P &lt; 0.001) harvested biomass at the end of the growing season (15.3. Mg ha-1) compared to the grazed treatments (10.6, 8.1, and 7.8. Mg ha-1, respectively). Forage quality decreased (P &lt; 0.05) throughout the growing season for all treatments. Results indicate switchgrass has the potential to extend the cool-season grazing season in the region while also allowing for the production of an annual supply of bioenergy feedstock for conversion into biofuel. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Background: One route for producing cellulosic biofuels is by the fermentation of lignocellulose-derived sugars generated from a pretreatment that can be effectively coupled with an enzymatic hydrolysis of the plant cell wall. While woody biomass exhibits a number of positive agronomic and logistical attributes, these feedstocks are significantly more recalcitrant to chemical pretreatments than herbaceous feedstocks, requiring higher chemical and energy inputs to achieve high sugar yields from enzymatic hydrolysis. We previously discovered that alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment catalyzed by copper(II) 2,2-bipyridine complexes significantly improves subsequent enzymatic glucose and xylose release from hybrid poplar heartwood and sapwood relative to uncatalyzed AHP pretreatment at modest reaction conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure). In the present work, the reaction conditions for this catalyzed AHP pretreatment were investigated in more detail with the aim of better characterizing the relationship between pretreatment conditions and subsequent enzymatic sugar release. Results: We found that for a wide range of pretreatment conditions, the catalyzed pretreatment resulted in significantly higher glucose and xylose enzymatic hydrolysis yields (as high as 80% for both glucose and xylose) relative to uncatalyzed pretreatment (up to 40% for glucose and 50% for xylose). We identified that the extent of improvement in glucan and xylan yield using this catalyzed pretreatment approach was a function of pretreatment conditions that included H2O2 loading on biomass, catalyst concentration, solids concentration, and pretreatment duration. Based on these results, several important improvements in pretreatment and hydrolysis conditions were identified that may have a positive economic impact for a process employing a catalyzed oxidative pretreatment. These improvements include identifying that: (1) substantially lower H 2O2 loadings can be used that may result in up to a 50-65% decrease in H2O2 application (from 100 mg H 2O2/g biomass to 35-50 mg/g) with only minor losses in glucose and xylose yield, (2) a 60% decrease in the catalyst concentration from 5.0 mM to 2.0 mM (corresponding to a catalyst loading of 25 μmol/g biomass to 10 μmol/g biomass) can be achieved without a subsequent loss in glucose yield, (3) an order of magnitude improvement in the time required for pretreatment (minutes versus hours or days) can be realized using the catalyzed pretreatment approach, and (4) enzyme dosage can be reduced to less than 30 mg protein/g glucan and potentially further with only minor losses in glucose and xylose yields. In addition, we established that the reaction rate is improved in both catalyzed and uncatalyzed AHP pretreatment by increased solids concentrations. Conclusions: This work explored the relationship between reaction conditions impacting a catalyzed oxidative pretreatment of woody biomass and identified that significant decreases in the H2O 2, catalyst, and enzyme loading on the biomass as well as decreases in the pretreatment time could be realized with only minor losses in the subsequent sugar released enzymatically. Together these changes would have positive implications for the economics of a process based on this pretreatment approach. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Increasingly tighter regulations regarding organic waste, and the demand for renewable chemicals and fuels, are pushing the manufacturing industry toward higher sustainability to improve cost-effectiveness and meet customers’ demand. Food waste valorization is one of the current research areas that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past few years as a potential alternative to the disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In particular, the development of environmentally sound and innovative strategies to process such waste is an area of increasing importance in our current society. Landfill, incineration and composting are common, mature technologies for waste disposal. However, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste due to the generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, high energy consumption and slow reaction kinetics. In fact, research efforts have also been oriented on novel technologies to decompose organic waste. However, no valuable product is generated from the decomposition process. Instead of disposing and decomposing food waste, recent research has focused on its utilization as energy source (e.g., for bioethanol and biodiesel production). Organic waste is also useful to generate useful organic chemicals via biorefinery or white biotechnology (e.g., succinic acid and/or bio-plastics). This article is aimed to summarize recent development of waste valorization strategies for the sustainable production of chemicals, materials, and fuels through the development of green production strategies. It will also provide key insights into recent legislation on management of waste worldwide as well as two relevant case studies (the transformation of corncob residues into functionalized biomass-derived carbonaceous solid acids and their utilization in the production of biodiesel-like biofuels from waste oils in Philippines, as well as the development of a bakery waste based biorefinery for succinic acid and bioplastic production in Hong Kong) to illustrate the enormous potential of biowaste valorization for a more sustainable society. Future research directions and possible sustainable approaches will also be discussed with their respective proofs of concept. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Hyperaspis paludicola Schwarz is a rarely collected scymnine coccinellid of the tribe Hyperaspidini. Knowledge of its habits has been limited to an association with the adventive mealybug Miscanthicoccus miscanthi (Takahashi) on Chinese silvergrass (Miscanthus sinensis; Poaceae) in Washington, DC. A second association of H. paludicola with M. miscanthi was observed in Clemson, South Carolina; adults were present on ornamental Chinese silvergrass from August 2010 to June 2012. The potential use of H. paludicola in the biocontrol of M. miscanthi and mealybugs of other bunchgrasses is proposed. I also review the coccinellid's previous distribution, including an over looked record from Massachusetts.

AB  - Process chains of thermo chemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass through gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (known as BTL) represent promising alternatives for biofu-els production. Since biomass is heterogeneous and not homogeneously spread over territories, one of the major technological stakes of the project is to develop a flexible industrial chain capable of co-treating the widest possible range of biomass and fossil fuel feedstock. The present study aims at characterizing biomass diversity (availability and potentials by area, cost and mineral composition) by carrying out a state of the art, as a preliminary step in order to define a series of biomasses to be tested in the demonstration plant and therefore define specifications for the process. Fifty different biomasses were considered for their bioenergy application potential and were finally classified into four categories: agricultural by-products, dedicated energy crops, (Very) Short Rotation Coppice ((V)SRC) and forestry biomasses. Biomass availability and potentials were investigated by the mean of a literature review of past and current projects (e.g. RENEW project, Biomass Energy Europe Project, etc.) and scientific articles. Most collected data are technical potentials, meaning that they take into account biophysical limits of crops and forests, technological possibilities, competition with other land uses and ecological constraints (e.g. natural reserves). Results show various emerging markets: North and South America have considerable amounts of agricultural by-products, forest residues, and large land areas which could be dedicated to energy crops; Africa shows relevant possibilities to grow Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) and energy crops; Russia has large available quantities of agricultural by-products and forest residues, as well as little valuable land where energy crops and SRC could be grown, and Asia shows relevant amounts of forest residues and possibilities of growing SRC, as well as relevant quantities of agricultural residues (notably from palm oil cropping systems). To a lesser extent, Europe also presents significant amounts of agricultural co-products and forestry residues which could be available for bio-energy. Nevertheless an improvement of biomass supply structure is necessary to be in the position to answer the demand for BtL (Biomass to Liquid) industry. Mineral composition is also a relevant parameter to be considered for the thermochemical conversion process, since the Fischer-Tropsch catalysis - last step of the conversion process - is very sensitive to mineral elements of biomass. Concerning mineral composition of biomasses, five public databases were analysed to collect relevant characteristics and the information was aggregated in one large database dedicated to the project. Nitrogen, chlorine, phosphorus, sulphur, ash and energy contents are the major parameters collected. By analysing these data, we observe that fast-growing plants (typically agricultural co-products) contain much more minerals than low-growing crops (typically forest residues). This is mostly due to the fertilizers spread in the fields for the growth of agricultural crops. Consequently, agricultural by-products appear as the most constraining biomasses in terms of mineral contents. Regarding costs, a literature review was also carried out, with a special focus on the French case. Most data come from REGIX Programme and French organisms (FCBA, Association AILE, etc.). This allowed us to observe that agricultural by-products are the cheapest biomasses (10 to 15 €/MWh, equivalent to 50 to 75 €/TDM), as they are still considered as sub-products of grains. Their price is only driven by conditioning and transport costs. (Very) short rotation forestry bio-masses are slightly more expensive (13 to 17 €/MWh, equivalent to 70 to 90 €/TDM), due to harvest costs, but they remain cheaper than energy crops (20 to 22 €/MWh, equivalent to 95 to 110 €/TDM), whose crop management practices (basically phytosanitary treatments and fertilization) increase costs. Finally, forestry wood chips show very variable prices (11 to 25 €/MWh, equivalent to 60 to 130 €/TDM), depending on the costs attributed to wood material, technology used, access to the plots, and the use of storage platform or not. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Microalgae are considered a promising biofuel resource to fix carbon dioxide (CO2), which can support social development and environmental improvement in the future. In this paper, characteristics of microalgae growth with two parameters of solar radiation and ambient temperature are investigated based on industrial-scale microalgae bulk growth model of Quinn By using this model, the potential biomass production of microalgae in China is estimated based on data of the available untilled lands and the weather to be 7.38 × 109 tonnes. This is 2.4 times larger than China's energy consumption of 3.08 × 109 tonnes standard coal equivalent in 2010, and satisfies that predicted with an exponentially increasing trend for 2020, and 89% of the amount predicted for 2030. The annual total CO2 emissions reduced is estimated to be 13.5 × 109 tonnes, which can improve the natural environment besides supplying sustainable production in China. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - The European Union increasingly integrates climate objectives into other policy areas. However, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions is not necessarily compatible with environmental protection or sustainable development, as the examples of nuclear energy, hydropower and biofuels illustrate. Therefore, climate policy integration needs to be compatible with the overarching objective of sustainable development. This article discusses under which conditions legislation that integrates climate objectives contributes to sustainable development and how this can be evaluated at the policy proposal stage. The key contribution is to illustrate in the European context how legislation on climate policy integration can be designed to also contribute to sustainable development. Based on the European Sustainable Development Strategy, this paper proposes four criteria: policy integration and coherence, environmental protection, social and economic development and justice/participation. These criteria are used to evaluate the Renewable Energy Directive and the 2014-2020 Common Agricultural Policy proposal. The paper concludes that both case studies can serve as best-practice examples for other policies on the European and national levels of how climate policy integration can be designed to also meet minimum levels of sustainable development. Policy implications are the inclusion of these criteria for sustainable climate policy integration into EU impact assessments and their use as minimum benchmarks in the policy debate as an evaluation tool that can be easily used by policy makers and stakeholders to evaluate if a negotiated compromise on a policy that integrates climate objectives still contributes to both reducing emissions and sustainable development. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Our report analyzes the substitution of marginal oil with biofuels. For that, we evaluate the effects that infl uence the substitution process in the short, mid and long term. We identify OPEC, resource nationalism, and geopolitical issues as important infl uence factors and arrive at the conclusion that in the short term biofuels will replace mainly OPEC oil but not the most expensive petroleum. In the medium and long term biofuels will replace the most expensive petroleum because OPEC production cuts are only possible on a temporary basis and in restricted quantities. Our comparison of the costs of the different fossil fuels with their greenhouse gas emissions shows that there is no direct correlation between the level of greenhouse gas emissions and production costs. However, we see strong evidence every time that the marginal oil gets more carbon-intensive and that biofuels will increasingly displace these carbon-intensive fossil fuels. That is shown especially in the increase of unconventional fossil fuels and new frontier oil (Amazon, deep-sea, etc.). The investments in these technologies are very price-sensitive, like the financial crisis 2008/2009 has showed. Further evidence brings the decline of the energy return on investment (EROI) of the oil production worldwide and the increase of the marginal oil costs from 25 to almost 100 dollars/barrel in the last 10 years. We expect that the increase of the carbon intensity of marginal oil will further enlarge the climate effects of global petroleum production. Marginal oil as an indirect effect of the biofuel use should therefore get the same significance value as indirect land-use change (ILUC) in the current climate protection debate. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (C-LCA) is a "system modelling approach in which activities in a product system are linked so that activities are included in the product system to the extent that they are expected to change as a consequence of a change in demand". Hence, C-LCA focuses on micro-economic actions linked to macro-economic consequences, by identifying the (marginal) suppliers and technologies prone to be affected by variable scale changes in the demand of a product. Detecting the direct and indirect environmental effects due to changes in the production system is not an easy task. Hence, researchers have combined the consequential perspective with different econometric models. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess an increase in biocrops cultivation in Luxembourg using three different consequential modelling approaches to understand the benefits, drawbacks and assumptions linked to each approach as applied to the case study selected. Methods: Firstly, a partial equilibrium (PE) model is used to detect changes in land cultivation based on the farmers' revenue maximisation. Secondly, another PE model is proposed, which considers a different perspective aiming at minimising a total adaptation cost (so-called opportunity cost) to satisfy a given new demand of domestically produced biofuel. Finally, the consequential system delimitation for agricultural LCA approach, as proposed by Schmidt (Int J Life Cycle Assess 13:350-364, 2008), is applied. Results and discussion: The two PE models present complex shifts in crop rotation land use changes (LUCs), linked to the optimisation that is performed, while the remaining approach has limited consequential impact on changes in crop patterns since the expert opinion decision tree constitutes a simplification of the ongoing LUCs. However, environmental consequences in the latter were considerably higher due to intercontinental trade assumptions recommended by the experts that were not accounted for in the economic models. Environmental variations between the different scenarios due to LUCs vary based on the different expert- or computational-based assumptions. Finally, environmental consequences as compared with the current state-of-the-art are lame due to the limited impact of the shock within the global trade market. Conclusions: The use of several consequential modelling approaches within the same study may help widen the interpretation of the advantages or risks of applying a specific change to a production system. In fact, different models may not only be good alternatives in terms of comparability of scenarios and assumptions, but there may also be room for complementing these within a unique framework to reduce uncertainties in an integrated way. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims at identifying the best practice in residual municipal solid waste management using specific data from Liège, a highly industrialized and densely populated region of Belgium. We also illustrate the importance of assumptions relative to energy through sensitivity analyses and checking uncertainties regarding the results using a Monte Carlo analysis. Methods: We consider four distinct household waste management scenarios. A life cycle assessment is made for each of them using the ReCiPe method. The first scenario is sanitary landfill, which is considered as the base case. In the second scenario, the refuse-derived fuel fraction is incinerated and a sanitary landfill is used for the remaining shredded organic and inert waste only. The third scenario consists in incinerating the whole fraction of municipal solid waste. In the fourth scenario, the biodegradable fraction is collected and the remaining waste is incinerated. The extracted biodegradable fraction is then treated in an anaerobic digestion plant. Results and discussion: The present study shows that various scenarios have significantly different environmental impact. Compared to sanitary landfill, scenario 4 has a highly reduced environmental impact in terms of climate change and particulate matter formation. An environmental gain, equal to 10, 37, or 1.3 times the impact of scenario 1 is obtained for, respectively, human toxicity, mineral depletion, and fossil fuel depletion categories. These environmental gains are due to energetic valorization via the incineration and anaerobic digestion. Considering specific categories, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 17 % in scenario 2 and by 46 % in scenarios 3 and 4. For the particulate matter formation category, a 71 % reduction is achieved by scenario 3. The figures are slightly modified by the Monte Carlo analysis but the ranking of the scenarios is left unchanged. Conclusions: The present study shows that replacing a sanitary landfill by efficient incineration significantly reduces both emissions of pollutants and energy depletion, thanks to electricity recovery. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Over the past decade, both Asia and Europe have devoted considerable effort to expanding the production of first-generation biofuels to fuel cars, taxis, buses, trucks, motorcycles, etc. On the one hand, with "peak oil" potentially looming in the future, and on the other, with an insatiable need for petroleum and diesel, the prospect of large-scale use of biofuels enjoyed tremendous public appeal as they seemed to provide a long-term alternative and clean fuel source in Asia and Europe. However, globally today, biofuels constitute only 3 % of the total transport fuel mix. Production is still steadily increasing in some countries, but their economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability have come into question in others with the result that production has slowed down considerably or even halted. The outlook for second- and third-generation biofuels is promising. However, they also cannot yet supplement, far less substitute, for petroleum and diesel in a commercially viable way. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has potential as an oilseed crop that may be grown during fall (autumn) and winter months in the Midwestern United States and harvested in the early spring as a biodiesel feedstock. There has been little agronomic improvement in pennycress through traditional breeding. Recent advances in genomic technologies allow for the development of genomic tools to enable rapid improvements to be made through genomic assisted breeding. Here we report an annotated transcriptome assembly for pennycress. RNA was isolated from representative plant tissues, and 203 million unique Illumina RNA-seq reads were produced and used in the transcriptome assembly. The draft transcriptome assembly consists of 33 873 contigs with a mean length of 1242 bp. A global comparison of homology between the pennycress and Arabidopsis transcriptomes, along with four other Brassicaceae species, revealed a high level of global sequence conservation within the family. The final assembly was functionally annotated, allowing for the identification of putative genes controlling important agronomic traits such as flowering and glucosinolate metabolism. Identification of these genes leads to testable hypotheses concerning their conserved function and to rational strategies to improve agronomic properties in pennycress. Future work to characterize isoform variation between diverse pennycress lines and develop a draft genome sequence for pennycress will further direct trait improvement. © 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Recent research exposing environmental and social externalities of biofuels has undermined the earlier national consensus that they would provide climate mitigation and rural development benefits, but support for ethanol remains strong in Iowa. The objective of this paper is to understand how stakeholder groups in Iowa have framed the benefits and risks associated with ethanol's impact on the local economy and environment. Our case study draws on in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants from agricultural organizations, environmental organizations, and government departments in the state. We find that in Iowa, widespread support for ethanol production exists among government, energy, and farm groups, and that they frame ethanol production as economically beneficial to rural communities and agriculture, while minimizing the possibility of associated environmental risks. Although participants from environmental organizations in Iowa express apprehension about the environmental impacts of expanded corn ethanol production, their unease is muted in relation to economic benefits and in relation to other environmental issues, and few have publicly voiced their concerns. To understand these findings, we draw from the environmental sociology literature that examines the role of powerful natural resource interests in framing the importance of resource extraction and commodity production to community identity and economy and in delegitimizing and naturalizing associated environmental issues and problems. We argue that powerful natural resource interests in Iowa both naturalize environmental problems related to ethanol production and engage in diversionary reframing to emphasize the economic benefits while minimizing or rejecting the potential environmental risks. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The necessity to move towards a sustainable economy is increasing day by day owing to various problems like climate change, increasing crude oil prices, etc. In this line, hydropyrolysis of Jatropha seed deoiled cake has been carried out at various pressures of hydrogen (1, 20, 40 and 52 bar) at 450 °C. With an increase in pressure under the experimental conditions of present study from 1 to 40 bar, the yield of bio-oil is found to have increased and beyond 40 bar the bio-oil yields have decreased. It has been observed that the liquid bio-oil yield is highest at 17 wt% at 40 bar. The FTIR spectrum of the bio-oil and char at 40 bar shows maximum functionality, indicating the clear opening of the macromolecular structure. The EDAX analysis of the hydropyrolysis char obtained at 40 bar pressure show a maximum of 85 wt% carbon and minimum of oxygen 13 wt%. © 2013 Springer Japan.

AB  - An array of feedstock is being evaluated as potential raw material for cellulosic biofuel production. Thorough assessments are required in regional landscape settings before these feedstocks can be cultivated and sustainable management practices can be implemented. On the processing side, a potential solution to the logistical challenges of large biorefineries is provided by a network of distributed processing facilities called local biomass processing depots. A large-scale cellulosic ethanol industry is likely to emerge soon in the United States. We have the opportunity to influence the sustainability of this emerging industry. The watershed-scale optimized and rearranged landscape design (WORLD) model estimates land allocations for different cellulosic feedstocks at biorefinery scale without displacing current animal nutrition requirements. This model also incorporates a network of the aforementioned depots. An integrated life cycle assessment is then conducted over the unified system of optimized feedstock production, processing, and associated transport operations to evaluate net energy yields (NEYs) and environmental impacts. A sustainability assessment was conducted in a nine-county region of Michigan for the categories of cellulosic ethanol production, soil characteristics, water quality, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Making significant changes such as introducing perennial grasses, riparian buffers and double crops in current landscapes provides the largest absolute NEYs of about 53 GJ/ha while also attaining 120% gains in soil organic carbon, 103% lower nitrogen leaching, and 68% reductions in net GHG emissions (compared to a baseline of current conventional landscapes). Interestingly, minimizing certain environmental impacts also provides greater NEYs. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - There is an urgent need to develop viable, renewable, sustainable energy systems that can reduce global dependence on fossil fuel sources of energy. Biofuels such as ethanol are being utilized as blends in surface transportation fuels and have the potential to improve sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term. Bioethanol, the most widely used liquid biofuel, is currently produced by converting sugars or starches from feed crops into ethanol. Use of this fuel source displaces and draws water consumption away from agricultural crops, increases soil erosion by shifting land from perennial grasses to annual crops, and increases use of fertilizers and insecticides. In contrast, bioethanol made from lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks does not have these limitations and in addition, offers a larger resource base: the amount of cellulosic material available for potential use vastly outweighs the amount of available starch-based feedstock. Therefore, bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass has attracted considerable interest from biofuel developers. This review is an update of some developments to optimize cellulose extraction from feedstock crops and to improve crop yields and logistics. It concludes that agricultural and forestry systems that incorporate lignocellulosic biomass crops can be designed for improved ecological function and energy use efficiency. Development of crops that have both desirable cell-wall traits and high biomass productivity under sustainable low-input conditions can significantly enhance the economics and efficiency of the conversion process. Optimizing the logistics of moving feedstock from field or forest to bio-refinery can significantly reduce costs of using lignocellulosic feedstocks. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel crops are promoted as a climate friendly alternative to fossil energy. Yet environmental risks such as potential biodiversity loss are not always adequately considered. This might occur directly as a consequence of land-use change from natural systems to biofuel plantations, but also through invasive behavior of the biofuel species, as it might disperse and establish into adjacent natural systems. Therefore, there is a need to perform ex-ante invasiveness risk assessments including field trials on new biofuel species before they get promoted and expanded on a large scale. This perspective uses Jatropha curcas L. as a model biofuel crop and reviews the biological traits and the circumstantial factors which may contribute to its invasive behavior. J. curcas has recently received much attention as a biodiesel 'wonder crop' and is being planted at large scale without scientific study on its invasiveness risk. We applied two risk assessment frameworks to provide an ex-ante invasiveness risk assessment and obtained that J. curcas is a species with a high invasiveness risk, which is in contradiction with recent experimental evidence. We discuss the limitations of the available risk assessment frameworks, which may have led to unreliable prediction. We interpret the outcome of this theoretical exercise with some recommendations for the selection, introduction, cultivation, and processing stages of J. curcas and other biofuel crops to minimize invasiveness risk. Finally we point to the responsibilities of investors and governments and the need for integrated research of the whole biofuel production supply chain to avoid bio-invasions. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The history of civilization is biased toward the use of bioenergy because of the biophysics of life and the structure of our natural environment. Energy physically drives the creation and maintenance of complex systems, which is shown here from simple molecular structures to empires. Only a fraction of the complexity currently supported by fossil fuels can be maintained using the energy in plant biomass alone, which is limited by global net primary productivity. From the dawn of civilization, agricultural land has always been used for energy for transportation, via feed for animals, and there has always been a trade-off between 'food, fuel, and environment'. The United States (USA), Germany, and Brazil now use roughly 12% of agricultural land for biofuels, but energy efficiency improvements by 2050 could require only 11% of US agricultural land or 15% of forest land for biofuels to support all modes of US transportation. Despite its limitations, bioenergy has been extensively used for thousands of years and probability theory suggests it will continue to be a critical energy resource. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Our report analyzes the substitution of marginal oil with biofuels. For that, we evaluate the effects that influence the substitution process in the short, mid and long term. We identify OPEC, resource nationalism, and geopolitical issues as important influence factors and arrive at the conclusion that in the short term biofuels will replace mainly OPEC oil but not the most expensive petroleum. In the medium and long term biofuels will replace the most expensive petroleum because OPEC production cuts are only possible on a temporary basis and in restricted quantities. Our comparison of the costs of the different fossil fuels with their greenhouse gas emissions shows that there is no direct correlation between the level of greenhouse gas emissions and production costs. However, we see strong evidence every time that the marginal oil gets more carbon-intensive and that biofuels will increasingly displace these carbon-intensive fossil fuels. That is shown especially in the increase of unconventional fossil fuels and new frontier oil (Amazon, deep-sea, etc.). The investments in these technologies are very price-sensitive, like the financial crisis 2008/2009 has showed. Further evidence brings the decline of the energy return on investment (EROI) of the oil production worldwide and the increase of the marginal oil costs from 25 to almost 100 dollars/barrel in the last 10years. We expect that the increase of the carbon intensity of marginal oil will further enlarge the climate effects of global petroleum production. Marginal oil as an indirect effect of the biofuel use should therefore get the same significance value as indirect land-use change (ILUC) in the current climate protection debate. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The emergence of concerns about "peak oil," the fallout from the Iraq War in terms of renewed calls for "energy security," and the development of new technology to gain access to fossil fuels and gas long off-limits because of economic and environmental concerns has led to a boom of multiple kinds of energy development in and around rural communities in the United States. This article uses the lens of treadmill-of-production and growth-machine literature to understand these developments in south central Illinois, an area with rich farmland and a history of underground coal extraction. While this analysis finds the expected support from community elites for renewed coal extraction, despite health and environmental risks, we find that the farm community, concerned about damage to land critical for producing corn and beans, profitable at historical levels in part because of the biofuel boom, formed a strong opposition movement. In short, we find evidence of colliding treadmills of energy production. The findings have implications for the analysis of rural energy production in the United States and beyond. © 2013, by the Rural Sociological Society.

The project initially launched as an effort to convert the coal-fired heating plant into the country's largest campus biofuel project. However, during the 2 years of planning, a new administration was elected, natural gas prices fell by over 67% and federal biomass subsidy programs were revised.

AB  - As a major component of the plant cell wall, cellulose is the most abundant source of terrestrial carbon and therefore attractive for biofuel production. However, current industrial efforts to convert plant biomass into biofuels have been hampered because plant polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicelluloses are difficult to break down and the fermentation of the resulting sugars is not efficient. Natural systems that hydrolyze and ferment cellulose could therefore inform these industrial efforts. The rumen, as part of the digestive tract in some herbivores, houses a microbial community that naturally and efficiently hydrolyzes cellulose and ferments the resulting sugars to products that are precursors to biofuels. Genomic and metagenomic sequencing of the rumen microbial community is leading to the discovery of fibrolytic enzymes and the identification of the multiple approaches used by rumen microbes to digest cellulosic substrates. These sequencing efforts are also identifying microbial interactions that make the rumen one of the most efficient bioreactors on Earth. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Wood has played a primary role in the evolution of land plants (Spicer and Groover 2010), but our understanding of the genes and mechanisms underlying wood evolution and development has been limited until recently. Importantly, many of the fundamental questions of woody plant evolution and development are now tractable using genomics and highcapacity sequencing technologies. A major challenge is to integrate the knowledge from traditional disciplines of woody plant research (e.g., anatomy, paleobotany, physiology, and developmental biology) with genomics and sequencing-based technologies. A synthetic field of research integrating these disciplines would be well positioned to make major advances in the basic biology of plants and to address applied goals such as providing optimal biofuels feedstocks or informing conservation strategies for forests in the face of climate change. This special issue of the International Journal of Plant Sciences highlights some of the research opportunities, including examples of fascinating evolutionary and developmental processes associated with woody plants and new genomics-based approaches for understanding them. Interestingly, many of the outstanding questions about the evolution and development of woody plants date to the beginnings of plant science. © 2013 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has been identified as a biodiesel plant globally. Efforts are underway to domesticate JCL for high seed yield. The plant has potential to grow on marginal/degraded/substandard lands to avoid competition with food crops, but little is known about its potential to reclaim degraded lands. At this study, several accessions of JCL were planted in 2005 on sodic soil to assess soil amelioration potential of the plant. After six years (2011) of plant growth, seed yield was not economically viable; however, soil properties improved significantly when compared to initial (0-year plantation) soil properties at 0-15cm soil depth. Random soil samples were collected from 0 to 15cm soil depth beneath and outside canopies of JCL with high, medium and poor growth in the year 2008 (3-year plantation) and 2011 (6-year plantation). Soil bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) decreased and soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), microbial biomass (MB-C, MB-N and MB-P) and enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and protease) increased significantly with effect of JCL plantation. Significant decrease in soil pH, EC and ESP has been noticed from 8.6 to 7.6, 1.29 to 0.98dSm-1 and 20.7% to 13.8%, respectively. Similarly, soil fertility parameters like SOC, MB-C, dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and protease increased significantly from 4.55 to 8.41gkg-1, 98 to 352μgg-1, 16.3 to 51.2μgTPFg-1h-1, 75.8 to 338.2μgPNPg-1h-1 and 43.7 to 163.2μgTyrosineg-1h-1, respectively after 6 years of JCL cultivation on sodic soil. Changes in soil properties were significantly higher beneath the canopy than outside canopy. Soil sodicity parameters (bulk density, pH, EC and ESP) and fertility attributes (SOC, N, P, MB and enzymes) were significantly negatively and positively correlated with the height, biomass and litter fall of JCL, respectively. Furthermore, to test whether changes in soil properties are induced by test crop, changes were compared with Prosopis juliflora plantation of same age, which is generally planted for amelioration of sodic soils. The significant decrease in soil sodicity and increase in soil fertility conclude that JCL is equally good to reclaim the sodic soils. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global warming and land-use change could have profound impacts on ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes, with consequent changes in C sequestration and its feedback to climate change. However, it is not well understood how net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) and its components respond to warming and mowing in tallgrass prairie. We conducted two warming experiments, one long term with a 1.7°C increase in a C4-dominated grassland (Experiment 1), and one short term with a 2.8°C increase in a C3-dominated grassland (Experiment 2), to investigate main and interactive effects of warming and clipping on ecosystem C fluxes in the Great Plains of North America during 2009-2011. An infrared radiator was used to simulate climate warming and clipping once a year mimicked mowing in both experiments. The results showed that warming significantly increased ecosystem respiration (ER), slightly increased GPP, with the net outcome (NEE) being little changed in Experiment 1. In contrast, warming significantly suppressed GPP and ER in both years, with the net outcome being enhanced in NEE (more C sequestration) in 2009-2010 in Experiment 2. The C4-dominated grassland showed a much higher optimum temperature for C fluxes than the C3-dominated grassland, which may partly contribute to the different warming effects in the two experiments. Clipping significantly enhanced GPP, ER, and NEE in both experiments but did not significantly interact with warming in impacting C fluxes in either experiment. The warming-induced changes in ecosystem C fluxes correlated significantly with C4 biomass proportion but not with warming-induced changes in either soil temperature or soil moisture across the plots in the experiments. Our results demonstrate that carbon fluxes in the tallgrass prairie are highly sensitive to climate warming and clipping, and C3/C4 plant functional types may be important factor in determining ecosystem response to climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Carbohydrate and lignin composition of feedstock materials are major factors in determining their bioenergy potential. This study was conducted to quantify dry biomass yield and the carbohydrate and lignin composition of six potential biofuel grasses (elephantgrass, energycane, sweetcane, giant reed, giant miscanthus, and sugarcane) across three sites in Florida for plant (2009) and first ratoon (2010) crops. Dry biomass yields ranged from about 30 to 50 Mg ha-1 and were generally greatest for elephantgrass, energycane, sweetcane, and sugarcane. Accordingly, total plant carbohydrate yields (20 to 25 Mg ha-1) were comparable among sugarcane, energycane, sweetcane, and elephantgrass, but were generally less for giant reed and even less for giant miscanthus. However, the contribution of total extractable carbohydrates and total fiber carbohydrates to total plant carbohydrate yields differed among species. Sugarcane had the highest concentrations of extractable carbohydrates (219 to 356 mg g-1), followed by energycane, then sweetcane, elephantgrass, and giant reed, with giant miscanthus having the lowest. Energycane and elephantgrass tended to have significantly more fiber glucose, and elephantgrass less xylose, than other species. Variability in total lignin concentrations on a fiber basis was relatively modest (250 to 285 mg g-1) across species, but was generally highest in sweetcane and giant reed. Overall, elephantgrass and energycane were prime regional candidates for cellulosic conversion using fermentation processes due to high yields and favorable fiber characteristics, although energycane tended to have higher extractable carbohydrates. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Cadmium contamination in croplands has been a serious concern because of its high health risk through soil-food chain transfer. A sudden emergence of Cd-tainted rice from the South China market urged countermeasures to prevent Cd uptake and accumulation in rice grains from Cd-contaminated rice paddies. A cross-site field experiment with biochar soil amendment (BSA) at rates from 20 to 40tha-1 in metal polluted rice fields was conducted across South China during 2010-2011. Samples both of topsoil and rice grains under BSA treatment were collected after rice harvest and soil extractable Cd pool and rice grain Cd level were analyzed. Across the sites, BSA treatment greatly reduced (by 20-90%) rice grain Cd content, and enabled a safe Cd level (&lt;0.4mgkg-1) of rice grain from all these Cd-contaminated rice fields using a 40tha-1 biochar application except in one site where soil had a Cd content over 20mgkg-1. This could be explained by a reduction in the extractable Cd pool in the biochar treated soil, which was closely correlated to the rise in soil pH with BSA treatment. This study demonstrated a promising role of BSA in preventing dangerous Cd accumulation by rice grain in contaminated rice paddies. © 2013.

AB  - Worldwide, the fly ash, generated in huge quantities from thermal power plants is a menace, especially its handling and disposal. Utilization of fly ash as a soil amendment to improve soil quality has received a great deal of attention. Co-application of biochar with fly ash may further enhance soil quality and crop productivity. Field experiment was conducted in an acidic red soil, from Dhanbad, India, to investigate the effects of lignite fly ash (LFA) and biochar (BC) on soil nutrients, biological properties, and the yield of Zea mays. The treatments were (i) control, (ii) BC (4. t/ha), (iii) LFA (4. t/ha), and (iv) BC (2. t/ha). +. LFA (2. t/ha). Soil samples were collected at three different crop stages of maize (vegetative, taselling and grain filling) and analyzed for pH, EC, organic carbon, N, P, K, soil enzymes, microbial biomass, and respiration. Soil bulk density and water holding capacity measured after the harvest of crop were not affected by the treatments. Soil P (+110%) and K (+64%) contents increased by LFA. +. BC application due to the presence of plant nutrient in BC and LFA. Soil enzymes like dehydrogenase activity (+60.7%), alkaline phosphatase (+32.2%), fluorescein hydrolases activity (12.3%) and microbial biomass (+25.3%) increased due to co-application of LFA and BC probably due to the pH-buffering and sorption of the organic matter to mineral surfaces to create a more reactive network for water, air and nutrient interactions in the soil. Available heavy metal (Zn, Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, and Pb) contents in soil decreased by LFA. +. BC application due to surface adsorption and precipitation caused by increase in soil pH. Maize grain yield increased by 11.4% for BC, 28.1% for BC. +. LFA treatment, and the yield was not significantly affected for the LFA alone treatment. Regression analysis showed soil P as the major factor for the increase in crop yield. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Converting row crop production to a perennial grass crop on highly erodible land has numerous benefits. Switchgrass, grown as a biofuel crop, can provide soil conservation benefits as a perennial crop and also provide economic value to the grower. However, little information exists regarding switchgrass management and production on these lands. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of two management practices, nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg ha-1) and harvest timing (mid-fall, late-fall, and spring), on: (1) dry matter (DM) yield, (2) switchgrass quality components (moisture, ash, and chloride (Cl-) concentrations), and (3) combustion energy content and yield. The study was conducted in 2009 and 2010 on highly erodible lands in the Driftless Area of southwest Wisconsin. Results showed a positive response of switchgrass DM to N fertilizer, with no yield gain above 112 kg ha-1 of N, although application of N increased Cl- concentrations. Harvest timing also affected switchgrass yield, with decreases in yield observed with progressively later harvest timings; this yield decrease was slightly greater compared with previous studies. Progressively later harvest timings led to a decrease in moisture, ash concentration, and Cl- concentration in both years. Energy content of switchgrass was not significantly affected by management. Energy yields, similar to DM yields, were maximized with 112 kg ha-1 of N with a mid-fall harvest. The similarities between this study and other research indicate there is a universal response of switchgrass to N in the northern USA and yields determined in this study indicate that highly erodible lands in the Driftless Area can be used to produce switchgrass at regionally expected yields. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The rapid growth of worldwide energy demands has led to mounting concerns about energy shortages and has promoted the development of biofuels, which are susceptible to climate change. To evaluate the effects of future environmental changes such as CO2 enrichment and water stress on the growth and biodiesel production of bioenergy plants, we exposed Jatropha curcas to two levels of CO2 concentration (ambient and elevated) and three watering regimes (well-watered, moderate drought, and severe drought) to study its biomass accumulation and allocation, energy cost-gain properties, and photosynthetic response. Elevated CO2 enhanced biomass accumulation of J. curcas by 31.5, 25.9, and 14.4 % under well-watered, moderate drought, and severe drought treatments, respectively, indicating that the stimulating effect was greater under optimum water conditions than in water-deficit conditions. Drought stress significantly increased the biomass allocation to roots, especially the fine roots. CO2 enrichment also increased the root mass fraction, though not significantly. CO2 enrichment significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate measured under growth CO2 concentration (A growth) and decreased foliar N content and therefore construction cost irrespective of watering conditions. Under elevated CO2, J. curcas employed a quicker return energy use strategy indicated by the higher photosynthetic energy use efficiency and lower payback time. There was a pronounced downregulation in the light-saturated photosynthetic rate under the common CO2 concentration (P max) under long-term CO2 exposure, due to a decrease in the initial and total ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activities and partially lower foliar N content. The significant interaction of CO2 enrichment and watering regimes implied that the stimulation of plant growth by CO2 enrichment may be negated by soil drought in the future. Long-term field experiments manipulating multiple factors simultaneously are needed to explore how the ecophysiological traits measured for J. curcas translate into bioenergy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - To date, cellulosic ethanol production has not been commercialized in the United States. However, government mandates aimed at increasing second-generation biofuel production could spur exploratory development in the cellulosic ethanol industry. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the fuelshed surrounding a starch-based ethanol plant near York, Nebraska that has the potential for cellulosic ethanol production. To assess the feasibility of supplying adequate biomass for year-round cellulosic ethanol production from residual maize (Zea mays) stover and bioenergy switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) within a 40-km road network service area of the existing ethanol plant, we identified ∼14,000 ha of marginally productive cropland within the service area suitable for conversion from annual rowcrops to switchgrass and ∼132,000 ha of maize-enrolled cropland from which maize stover could be collected. Annual maize stover and switchgrass biomass supplies within the 40-km service area could range between 429,000 and 752,000 metric tons (mT). Approximately 140-250 million liters (l) of cellulosic ethanol could be produced, rivaling the current 208 million l annual starch-based ethanol production capacity of the plant. We conclude that sufficient quantities of biomass could be produced from maize stover and switchgrass near the plant to support year-round cellulosic ethanol production at current feedstock yields, sustainable removal rates and bioconversion efficiencies. Modifying existing starch-based ethanol plants in intensive agricultural fuelsheds could increase ethanol output, return marginally productive cropland to perennial vegetation, and remove maize stover from productive cropland to meet feedstock demand. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study estimated the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and net energy ratio (NER) for producing hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) from canola and camelina in Western Canada. Using 1MJ of energy in the HDRD produced as the functional unit, a variety of scenarios were evaluated to account for variations in allocation methods, co-products, oilseed yield, N2O emission factor, and land use change (LUC). In producing HDRD, the farming stage and the oil conversion stage (i.e. the HDRD production stage) are the most energy and emission intensive. For canola based HDRD, the GHGs and NERs lie in the ranges of 33-94gCO2e/MJ and 1.2-2.2MJ/MJ respectively. For camelina based HDRD, the GHGs and NERs range from 30 - 82gCO2e/MJ and 1.0-2.3MJ/MJ respectively. In the base scenario (mass allocation; oilseed meal and propane fuel gas co-products; average yield; 0.76% N2O emission factor; LUC ignored), HDRD from camelina (38gCO2e/MJ, 2.0MJ/MJ) is environmentally superior to HDRD from canola (48gCO2e/MJ, 1.7MJ/MJ) due to lower agricultural inputs and higher yield for camelina. Considering all of the scenarios examined, HDRD from both crops appears to be more sustainable than fossil diesel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The decline in the use of fossil fuels in the future is due to the gradual depletion of their reserves and related environmental issues. Biofuels including ethanol are presented as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. However, ethanol production, generally from sugarcane demands the use of agricultural land and other natural resources, with emphasis on water and other nutrients. Sorghum is tolerant to drought. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potentiality of eight sweet sorghum cultivars in order to expand the ethanol production to areas with limited supply of water, not suitable for sugarcane which requires irrigation. The cultivars developed by breeding programs in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, were analyzed for fermentation by industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at 33 °C, under static conditions for a period of 6 h. All assessed parameters showed some statistically significant differences among cultivars (p &lt; 0.01), especially ethanol concentration (P) and the volumetric productivities (Qp) in the following order: Willey (P = 64.77 ± 4.4 g L-1 and Qp = 10.79 ± 0.74 g L-1 h-1), Wray (P = 59.10 ± 1.7 g L-1 and Qp = 9.85 ± 0.28 g L-1 h-1), BR 506 (P = 59.07 ± 1.3 g L-1 and Qp = 9.84 ± 0.21 g L-1 h-1) and SF 15 (54.40 ± 0.4 g L-1 and Qp = 9.07 ± 0.06 g L-1 h-1). The highest potentials for ethanol yield per hectare were observed for the cultivars SF 15 (3142.51 ± 428.47 L ha-1) and BR 506 (2193.95 ± 383.58 L ha-1). Therefore, the cultivars SF 15 and BR 506 seem to be very promising as an energy crop to be produced in areas with environmental conditions similar to Pernambuco. © 2013 Society for Sugar Research &amp; Promotion.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important bioenergy crop that has ability to produce both food (grain) and biofuel (from stalk juice). The objectives of the present investigation were (1) to assess the comparative performance of sweet sorghum experimental hybrids with open pollinated varieties (OPVs) for stalk yield, juice sugar quality traits, grain and bioethanol yields, and (2) to identify the best performing genotypes across the locations for both bioethanol and grain yields. Sixteen experimental sweet sorghum genotypes were evaluated during kharif season, 2007 at thirteen tropical Indian locations under dryland condition. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences were observed for stalk and sugar related traits. Fresh biomass varied from 39.0 to 67.0 t ha-1 and hybrids as a group produced 11.0 % more than OPVs. Millable stalk yield ranged from 29.4 to 46.5 t ha-1 among hybrids and OPVs with a mean of 40.2 t ha-1. Grain yield ranged from 1.14 to 2.25 t ha-1, and hybrids produced 38.0 % more grain yield than OPVs. Among all test genotypes, SPSSV30 alone recorded significantly superior juice °Brix, and total soluble sugars (TSS) than checks. Juice °Brix content has shown very strong positive correlations (R 2 = 0.7956, P ≤ 0.01) with TSS. In total sugar and bioethanol yields (range 1.66-2.53 t ha-1 and 925-1,440 L ha-1, res.), genotypes SPSSH 27, PAC52093 and SPSSH 24 in hybrid group, and SPSSV 20, SPSSV 15 and SPSSV 27 in OPV group were superior. Hybrids have recorded 10.0 and 18.0 % higher sugar and bioethanol yields, respectively than OPVs. The promising OPVs identified from this study could be the potential donors for further improvement of sweet sorghum for biofuel production. The results emphasized the importance of sweet sorghum hybrids over OPVs for stalk and bioethanol yields especially in the future climate change scenario. © 2013 Society for Sugar Research &amp; Promotion.

AB  - Dedicated bioenergy crops such as perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs) may reduce soil erosion and improve soil properties while providing biomass feedstock for biofuel. We quantified impacts of perennial WSGs and row crops on soil wind erodibility parameters (erodible fraction, geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates, and aggregate stability) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration under a dedicated bioenergy crop experiment in eastern Kansas after 4 and 5 yr of management. Soil properties were measured under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), and annual row crops including continuous corn (Zea mays L.), photoperiod sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sweet sorghum, and grain sorghum. Perennial WSGs reduced wind erodible fraction by 1.08 to 1.16 times compared with row crops. The geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates under switchgrass and miscanthus was 2.8 to 4.5 times greater than under row crops. Dry soil aggregate stability under miscanthus and big bluestem was greater than under row crops. After 5 yr, differences in SOC concentration between WSGs and row crops were not statistically significant for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Photoperiod sensitive and sweet sorghum had greater biomass yield than WSGs. In 2011, miscanthus yielded more biomass than corn by 5.3 Mg ha-1. Overall, growing dedicated bioenergy crops can reduce the soil's susceptibility to wind erosion but may not significantly increase SOC concentration in this region in the short term. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Toxic compounds, such as formic acid, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) generated during pretreatment of corn stover (CS) at high temperature and low pH, inhibit growth of Zymomonas mobilis and lower the conversion efficiency of CS to biofuel and other products. The inhibition of toxic compounds is considered as one of the major technical barriers in the lignocellulose bioconversion. In order to detoxify and/or degrade these toxic compounds by the model ethanologenic strain Z. mobilis itself in situ the fermentation medium, we constructed a recombinant Z. mobilis ZM4 (pHW20a-fdh) strain that is capable of degrading toxic inhibitor, formate. This is accomplished by cloning heterologous formate dehydrogenase gene (fdh) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and by coupling this reaction of NADH regeneration reaction system with furfural and HMF degradation in the recombinant Z. mobilis strain. The NADH regeneration reaction also improved both the energy efficiency and cell physiological activity of the recombinant organism, which were definitely confirmed by the improved cell growth, ethanol yield, and ethanol productivity during fermentation with CS hydrolysate.

AB  - Wind erosion is a soil degrading process that threatens agricultural sustainability and environmental quality globally. Protecting the soil surface with cover crops and plant residues, practices common in no-till and reduced tillage cropping systems, are highly effective methods for shielding the soil surface from the erosive forces of wind and have been credited with beneficial increases of chemical and physical soil properties including soil organic matter, water holding capacity, and wet aggregate stability. Recently, advances in biofuel technology have made crop residues valuable feed stocks for ethanol production. Relatively little is known about cropping systems effects on intrinsic soil erodibility, the ability of the soil without a protective cover to resist the erosive force of wind. We tested the bare, uniformly disturbed, surface of long-term tillage and crop rotation research plots containing silt loam soils in western Kansas and eastern Colorado with a portable field wind tunnel. Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) were measured using glass fiber filters and respirable dust, PM10 and PM2.5, were measured using optical particle counters sampling the flow to the filters. The results were highly variable and TSP emission rates varied from less than 0.5mgm-2s-1 to greater than 16.1mgm-2s-1 but all the results indicated that cropping system history had no effect on intrinsic erodibility or dust emissions from the soil surfaces. We conclude that prior best management practices will not protect the soil from the erosive forces of wind if the protective mantle of crop residues is removed. © 2012.

AB  - The growing need to use biofuel raw materials that do not compete with food and feed have resulted in a growing interest in lignocellulosic materials and microalgae. However, the life cycle environmental benefits of both biofuels have been questioned. The aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental sustainability of forest-based and microalgae biodiesel can be estimated by using the life cycle assessment framework. These biofuel chains were chosen because they are contrasting systems, as the first one is based on a "natural" feedstock production system, while the second one is an entirely anthropogenic system using an artificial infrastructure and external inputs to grow microalgae. This study focuses on life cycle impact categories still under methodological development, namely resource depletion, land use and land use change, water use, soil quality impacts and biodiversity. In addition, climate impacts were quantified in order to exemplify the uncertainty of the results and the complexity of estimating the parameters. This study demonstrates the difficulty to assess the absolute range of the total environmental impacts of the two systems. The results propose that the greenhouse gas emissions of microalgae biodiesel are higher than those of forest residue-based biodiesel, but the results of the microalgae chain are very uncertain due to the early development stage of the technology, and due to assumptions made concerning the electricity mix. On the other hand, the microalgae system has other advantages such as low competition on productive land and low biodiversity impacts. The findings help to recognise the main characteristics of the two production chains, and the main remaining research issues on bioenergy assessment along with the methodological development needs of life cycle approaches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper studies the spillover effects of rising biofuel production on participation in the Conservation Reserve Program. Landowner participation decisions are modeled using a real options framework. We develop a land use decision model that captures biofuel-driven structural changes in market demand and derive threshold conditions that trigger participation in the program. We then quantify the impacts of biofuel production on participation at both the national and state levels using Monte Carlo simulations. The model is also used to analyze how changes in the persistence of the biofuel production boom and in the volatility of farming returns affect conservation participation decisions. Policy implications of the results are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) is believed to be the most promising tree species used to produce biodiesel in China. Due to its abundant marginal land resource and good meteorological conditions, Southwest China is the major region to develop JCL. With Southwest China being taken as the study area in this paper, multi-factor comprehensive analysis is used to identify marginal land resources suitable to JCL plantation and make suitability assessment, thus obtaining their spatial distribution, suitability degree and total amount. With life cycle analysis (LCA), the life cycle net energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction capacity of marginal land resources with different suitability degrees used to produce biodiesel are investigated. Based on the research results, the life cycle model is expanded to obtain the potentiality of total net energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction of large-scale plantation of JCL in southwest China. The results show that the area of land resources suitable and moderately suitable for JCL plantation is 1.99×106ha and 5.57×106ha, respectively. If all of these land resources are put into use, the maximum net production potential of biodiesel from JCL would be 1.51×108GJ/a, and the total greenhouse gas emission reduction capacity 1.59×107t/a in Southwest China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent fertilizer-derived greenhouse gas which plays a predominant role in the life-cycle assessment of biofuels. The use of generic emissions factors to estimate its emissions in such context has been widely criticized because of its lack of accuracy, since N2O emissions are highly dependent on local soil and climate conditions, as well as crop management. This paper proposes an alternative method using an agroecosystem model (CERES-EGC) at interconnected geographical scales (from plot to regional). This method was applied to a case study comparing 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol made from sugar beet and Miscanthus feedstock, respectively, in the Picardy region (France), using a spatially-explicit approach and simple land-use options. This new method made it possible to capture the variability in direct N2O emissions in relation to pedoclimatic conditions. Biomass supply options, minimizing N2O emissions or minimizing the land area used by maximizing high yielding units, were used to select the most suitable arable fields on which to grow the feedstock. There were few differences between the two options in terms of area of land cultivated for both crops. However for sugar beet, the effect of minimizing total direct N2O emissions was more noticeable. Regional yield and N2O emission maps resulted in supply curves useful to optimize the placement of biorefinery facilities and feedstock production fields. This method should be further completed with the estimation of changes in soil carbon stocks to take into account land-use change effects and with landscape-scale simulation to consider indirect downstream emissions. © Springer Science+Business Media 2012.

AB  - Biofuels are considered as an important option for the mitigation of climate change. However, the negative impact of land-use change (LUC) on soil and vegetation carbon pools may jeopardize the potentially achievable savings of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study the impact of GHG emissions from LUC on the overall GHG performance of 1st generation biofuels was analyzed for the European Union (EU). The scenario-based analysis was done by coupling a spatial land-use model to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biofuels. The biofuel demand in the scenarios was derived from figures for the transport sector of the EU-27 Member States. The calculation of GHG emissions was performed with a Geographic Information System. Finally, these results were integrated into the LCA approach of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). Without taking LUC into account, the average GHG emission saving compared to fossil fuel use amounts to ~50%. In this case the mandatory 35% emission saving target laid down in the RED would be fulfilled. If LUC is considered, this target is reached under none of the simulated biofuel scenarios. In the most realistic scenario the GHG emission savings from 1st gen. biofuel use compared to fossil fuel use range between -2% and 13%. Based on our findings, we conclude that national policy plans for biofuel use should be reconsidered and revised as in their current form they do not provide an adequate measure for the mitigation of global warming on EU-level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Knowledge of the energy potential of an agricultural soil and the potential production of biomass, together with economic parameters, can help pinpoint more effective sites for growing plants for traditional purposes and for fuel production. There is approximately 10206PJ of potential energy accumulated in Slovakia's agricultural soils. The lowest utilisation was found in the Cambisols soil type (0.7-1.8%) and the highest in Regosols (3.1-7.0%). The bioenergy production potential of agricultural soils in Slovakia was determined for chosen soil parameters according to the production of the plants grown. With regard to energy, the most productive are soils of the Chernozem type (25.1MJm-2) and Mollic Fluvisols (22.5MJm-2). Gleysols, Histosols, Solonetz and Leptosols (3.0-5.0MJm-2) produce the lowest bioenergy levels. The highest energy production precondition (22.2MJm-2) occurs in soils in the very warm, very dry lowland climatic region. According to the granularity, the most energy (14.0-15.0MJm-2) is produced by deep clayey soils (18.0MJm-2) in a slope to 3° (18.3MJm-2) that are not or sporadically gravelly (19.2MJm-2). The highest energy yields can be expected from the biomass of plants grown in arable land (approximately 11.0MJm-2). Regarding the efficiency of economic and financial inputs, plants growing in Chernozem, Mollic Fluvisols, Fluvisols and Haplic Luvisols soil types in very warm, very dry, lowlands to warm, very dry, basin-like, continental climatic regions appear to be profitable in slopes to 7°, with no or only a sporadic gravel content. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of liquid biofuels from biomass stocks for the substitution of crude oil products (gasoline, diesel, etc.) in the transportation sector is one of the main objectives of bioenergy research. One of the main advantages of using biofuels is that, if one considers their complete life cycle, their carbon emissions can be substantially lower than in the case of fossil fuels. In this chapter, we describe all biofuel technologies and prospects. Thus, bioethanol and biodiesel that are usually produced from agricultural crops may have reached economic viability, but they also compete against food production elevating their prices. For this reason, second-generation biofuels are currently being developed which use lignocellulosic biomass (straw, grass, forestry sawdust, etc.) and therefore do not compete for agricultural land and water. In addition, we also treat in this chapter the so-called third-generation biofuels, like those obtained from microalgae, which offer excellent prospects for the production of biodiesel due to their high concentration in lipids. Besides, microalgae do not compete for large freshwater resources and can act as CO2 sinks during their growth. Hydrogen obtained from biomass can be considered another third-generation biofuel, but it is described in Chap. 5. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.

AB  - Numerous adverse effects are associated with the accidental release of ethanol (EtOH) and its persistence in the subsurface. Geophysical techniques may permit non-invasive, real time monitoring of microbial degradation of hydrocarbon. We performed complex resistivity (CR) measurements in conjunction with geochemical data analysis on three microbial-stimulated and two control columns to investigate changes in electrical properties during EtOH biodegradation processes in porous media. A Debye Decomposition approach was applied to determine the chargeability (m), normalized chargeability (m n) and time constant (τ) of the polarization magnitude and relaxation length scale as a function of time. The CR responses showed a clear distinction between the bioaugmented and control columns in terms of real (σ′) and imaginary (σ″) conductivity, phase (α) and apparent formation factor (Fapp). Unlike the control columns, a substantial decrease in σ′ and increase in Fapp occurred at an early time (within 4 days) of the experiment for all three bioaugmented columns. The observed decrease in σ′ is opposite to previous studies on hydrocarbon biodegradation. These columns also exhibited increases in α (up to ~ 9 mrad) and σ″ (up to two order of magnitude higher) 5 weeks after microbial inoculation. Variations in m and mn were consistent with temporal changes in α and σ″ responses, respectively. Temporal geochemical changes and high resolution scanning electron microscopy imaging corroborated the CR findings, thus indicating the sensitivity of CR measurements to EtOH biodegradation processes. Our results offer insight into the potential application of CR measurements for long-term monitoring of biogeochemical and mineralogical changes during intrinsic and induced EtOH biodegradation in the subsurface. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Snapped up for, in places, as little as fifty cents per hectare, African land is not necessarily brought into immediate food, forestry and mining production, and when it is, staples and biofuels dominate rather than export crops. Speculative hoarding, with a view to bringing the land into production when grain and other staples commodities markets are at their most profitable or selling the cheaply acquired land off again at enormous profit at a propitious future moment. The present contribution will see land grab, along with the virtual energy and virtual water that come with the land, as a phase in an ongoing geopolitical game for influence. Moreover, the present article considers the circumstances and options of two regionally hegemonic powers, Egypt and South Africa, claiming land and virtual water - or claiming it back.

AB  - Recently, cyanobacteria have been metabolically engineered to secrete valuable biofuel precursors eliminating the requirement to harvest and post-process algal biomass. However, development of new photobioreactors (PBRs) that can efficiently deliver light and address the mass transport challenges associated with maintaining high cyanobacteria productivity has been lagging. Hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) are a method for bubble-less gas exchange which has been shown to be effective at enhancing mass transfer. Previous applications of HFM technology to PBRs have been limited to exploring its ability to enhance CO2 delivery to the bulk liquid volume. To investigate potential strategies for novel PBR design configurations, we examined the growth pattern of Synechococcus elongatus around individual HFMs to determine the optimal spacing and conditions for maximizing photosynthetic activity. We have shown that a single fiber enabling passive transport from/to the atmosphere can provide enough gas exchange to increase biomass accumulation by &gt;2.5 times with respect to a non-fiber control. This increased growth was found to decay in the radial direction with the enhanced growth area spanning between 1.2 mm and 1.7 mm depending on the initial inoculation concentration. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Microalgae can make a significant contribution towards meeting global renewable energy needs in both carbon-based and hydrogen (H2) biofuel. The development of energy-related products from algae could be accelerated with improvements in systems biology tools, and recent advances in sequencing technology provide a platform for enhanced transcriptomic analyses. However, these techniques are still heavily reliant upon available genomic sequence data. Chlamydomonas moewusii is a unicellular green alga capable of evolving molecular H2 under both dark and light anaerobic conditions, and has high hydrogenase activity that can be rapidly induced. However, to date, there is no systematic investigation of transcriptomic profiling during induction of H2 photoproduction in this organism. Results: In this work, RNA-Seq was applied to investigate transcriptomic profiles during the dark anaerobic induction of H2 photoproduction. 156 million reads generated from 7 samples were then used for de novo assembly after data trimming. BlastX results against NCBI database and Blast2GO results were used to interpret the functions of the assembled 34,136 contigs, which were then used as the reference contigs for RNA-Seq analysis. Our results indicated that more contigs were differentially expressed during the period of early and higher H2 photoproduction, and fewer contigs were differentially expressed when H2-photoproduction rates decreased. In addition, C. moewusii and C. reinhardtii share core functional pathways, and transcripts for H 2 photoproduction and anaerobic metabolite production were identified in both organisms. C. moewusii also possesses similar metabolic flexibility as C. reinhardtii, and the difference between C. moewusii and C. reinhardtii on hydrogenase expression and anaerobic fermentative pathways involved in redox balancing may explain their different profiles of hydrogenase activity and secreted anaerobic metabolites. Conclusions: Herein, we have described a workflow using commercial software to analyze RNA-Seq data without reference genome sequence information, which can be applied to other unsequenced microorganisms. This study provided biological insights into the anaerobic fermentation and H2 photoproduction of C. moewusii, and the first transcriptomic RNA-Seq dataset of C. moewusii generated in this study also offer baseline data for further investigation (e.g. regulatory proteins related to fermentative pathway discussed in this study) of this organism as a H 2-photoproduction strain. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy related land use change would likely alter biogeochemical cycles and global greenhouse gas budgets. Energy cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is a sugarcane variety and an emerging biofuel feedstock for cellulosic bio-ethanol production. It has potential for high yields and can be grown on marginal land, which minimizes competition with grain and vegetable production. The DayCent biogeochemical model was parameterized to infer potential yields of energy cane and how changing land from grazed pasture to energy cane would affect greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4 and N2O) fluxes and soil C pools. The model was used to simulate energy cane production on two soil types in central Florida, nutrient poor Spodosols and organic Histosols. Energy cane was productive on both soil types (yielding 46-76 Mg dry mass{dot operator}ha-1). Yields were maintained through three annual cropping cycles on Histosols but declined with each harvest on Spodosols. Overall, converting pasture to energy cane created a sink for GHGs on Spodosols and reduced the size of the GHG source on Histosols. This change was driven on both soil types by eliminating CH4 emissions from cattle and by the large increase in C uptake by greater biomass production in energy cane relative to pasture. However, the change from pasture to energy cane caused Histosols to lose 4493 g CO2 eq{dot operator}m-2 over 15 years of energy cane production. Cultivation of energy cane on former pasture on Spodosol soils in the southeast US has the potential for high biomass yield and the mitigation of GHG emissions. © 2013 Duval et al.

AB  - Passenger cars in the United States (U.S.) rely primarily on petroleum-derived fuels and contribute the majority of U.S. transportation- related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Electricity and biofuels are two promising alternatives for reducing both the carbon intensity of automotive transportation and U.S. reliance on imported oil. However, as standalone solutions, the biofuels option is limited by land availability and the electricity option is limited by market adoption rates and technical challenges. This paper explores potential GHG emissions reductions attainable in the United States through 2050 with a county-level scenario analysis that combines ambitious plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) adoption rates with scale-up of cellulosic ethanol production. With PHEVs achieving a 58% share of the passenger car fleet by 2050, phasing out most corn ethanol and limiting cellulosic ethanol feedstocks to sustainably produced crop residues and dedicated crops, we project that the United States could supply the liquid fuels needed for the automobile fleet with an average blend of 80% ethanol (by volume) and 20% gasoline. If electricity for PHEV charging could be supplied by a combination of renewables and natural-gas combined-cycle power plants, the carbon intensity of automotive transport would be 79 g CO2e per vehicle-kilometer traveled, a 71% reduction relative to 2013. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Metagenomics aims at exploring microbial communities concerning their composition and functioning. Application of high-throughput sequencing technologies for the analysis of environmental DNA-preparations can generate large sets of metagenome sequence data which have to be analyzed by means of bioinformatics tools to unveil the taxonomic composition of the analyzed community as well as the repertoire of genes and gene functions. A bioinformatics software platform is required that allows the automated taxonomic and functional analysis and interpretation of metagenome datasets without manual effort. To address current demands in metagenome data analyses, the novel platform MetaSAMS was developed. MetaSAMS automatically accomplishes the tasks necessary for analyzing the composition and functional repertoire of a given microbial community from metagenome sequence data by implementing two software pipelines: (i) the first pipeline consists of three different classifiers performing the taxonomic profiling of metagenome sequences and (ii) the second functional pipeline accomplishes region predictions on assembled contigs and assigns functional information to predicted coding sequences. Moreover, MetaSAMS provides tools for statistical and comparative analyses based on the taxonomic and functional annotations. The capabilities of MetaSAMS are demonstrated for two metagenome datasets obtained from a biogas-producing microbial community of a production-scale biogas plant.

AB  - The amount of residues generated from biogas production has increased dramatically due to the worldwide interest in renewable energy. A common way to handle the residues is to use them as fertilizers in crop production. Application of biogas residues to agricultural soils may be accompanied with environmental risks, such as increased N2O emission. In 24-d laboratory experiments, N2O dynamics and total production were studied in arable soils (sandy, clay, and organic) amended with one of two types of anaerobically digested biogas residues (BR-A and BR-B) generated from urban and agricultural waste and nondigested cattle slurry (CS) applied at rates corresponding to 70 kg NH4 ±N ha-1. Total N2O-N losses from the sandy soil were higher after amendment with BR-B (0.32 g N2O-N m-2) than BR-A or CS (0.02 and 0.18 g N2O-N m-2, respectively). In the clay soil, N2O-N losses were very low for CS (0.02 g N2O-N m-2) but higher for BR-A and BR-B (0.25 and 0.15 g N2O-N m-2, respectively). In the organic soil, CS gave higher total N2O-N losses (0.31 g N2O-N m-2) than BR-A or BR-B (0.09 and 0.08 g N2O-N m-2, respectively). Emission peaks differed considerably between soils, occurring on Day 1 in the organic soil and on Days 11 to 15 in the sand, whereas in the clay the peak varied markedly (Days 1, 6, and 13) depending on residue type. In all treatments, NH4 + concentration decreased with time, and NO3 - concentration increased. Potential ammonium oxidation and potential denitrification activity increased significantly in the amended sandy soil but not in the organic soil and only in the clay amended with CS. The results showed that fertilization with BR can increase N2O emissions and that the size is dependent on the total N and organic C content of the slurry and on soil type. In conclusion, the two types of BR and the CS are not interchangeable regarding their effects on N2O production in different soils, and, hence, matching fertilizer type to soil type could reduce N2O emissions. For instance, it could be advisable to avoid fertilization of organic soils with CS containing high amounts or organic C and instead use BR. In clay soil, however, the risk of N2O emissions could be lowered by choosing a CS ©American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - A large abundance of environmentally harmful biomass waste is generated by water blooms. In order to provide an applicable solution for the relief of the environmental pressure, natural algae of Taihu Lake water blooms (CTL), mainly cyanobacteria, were catalytically pyrolyzed over silica-supported nickel phosphide to produce bio-oil. The properties of the bio-oil, such as chemical composition, elemental composition, and higher heating value (HHV), were examined. The composition of the gas product was also detected. The results suggest that catalytic pyrolysis could effectively convert the algae to a high quality bio-oil, in which the oxygen content was considerably reduced from 41.7 wt% in the algae to 8.0 wt% in the bio-oil. Long-chained alkanes became the primary component (59.4%). The HHV of the bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis was 37.2 MJ kg-1. The results indicate that it is possible to achieve high-grade renewable transportation fuels via catalytic pyrolysis of environmentally harmful CTL, and nickel phosphide is an applicable and effective catalyst. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - The Southern United States has sufficient rainfall and appropriate climate to supply a significant portion of the energy needs of our nation. However, harvesting large biomass crops can be difficult given the intense rainfall and high winds that can accompany hurricanes and tropical depressions. These weather events can flatten bioenergy crops leaving them difficult to harvest. This study examined the potential of using existing hay equipment to harvest artificially flattened sorghum sudangrass, a potential bioenergy crop. Results showed that rotary-type windrowers were better able to harvest downed bioenergy crops than sickle-type windrowers. Additionally, no significant differences in harvested biomass was found in the direction the windrowers were operated in relation to the downed bioenergy crops, regardless of the harvesting direction. Our major conclusion was that completely flattened biomass resulted in the highest losses with more than 20% of the bioenergy crop remaining in the field after harvest. Even though existing agricultural equipment was capable of harvesting large amounts of bioenergy crops that have been downed, improvements may be necessary to increase their capability for handling this problematic scenario. © 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ISSN 0883-8542.

AB  - Economical production of biofuel is prerequisite to depletion of fossil fuel. In recent years, biomass of numerous food crops was used as a feedstock for bioethanol production. Unfortunately, due to limited availability as well as confliction with food, these sources may hold back for continuous production of bioethanol. Therefore, in the present study a waste land crop "Kans grass" was utilized as feedstock for microbial production of bio-ethanol. The Kans grass biomass obtained after NaOH pretreatment at optimum conditions (in term of lignin removal) was subjected to enzymatic saccharification by using crude enzyme (obtained from Trichoderma reesei) to total reducing sugars (TRSs), which was further fermented for bioethanol production using yeast strains. Different time (30, 60, 90 and 120min), concentrations of NaOH (0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%) as well as temperatures (100, 110 and 120°C) were used for pretreatment study. At 120°C, approximately more than 50% of delignification was observed. Moreover, subsequent enzymatic saccharification contributed 350mgg-1 dry biomass of total reducing sugar (TRS) production. Interestingly, TRS was approx. fivefold higher than enzymatic saccharification of acid pretreated biomass (69.08mgg-1) as reported previously (Kataria et al., 2011) and fermentation of enzymatic hydrolysate using microbes resulted in the 0.44-0.46gg-1 ethanol yield which is a high yield when compared to the other existing literature. Another advantage of alkali pre-treatment was without production of toxic compounds in comparison to acid pre-treatment method. In conclusion, Kans grass was shown as potential feedstock for biofuel production via alkali and enzymatic saccharification in contrast to acid pre-treatment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Today incentives for an increased use of biofuels exist, one being the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). In this article the environmental performance of biogas systems using industrial residues from biofuel and food industries as substrates are analysed using a life-cycle perspective. These substrates are interesting since they do not compete directly with agricultural land for food production. The environmental performance is calculated using both the method described in the ISO-standard for life cycle assessment and the method presented in the EU RED. Furthermore, two perspectives are included, one where the residues are not utilised for other purposes today and one where the residues are utilised as animal feed, here presented as systems expansion. The results show that biogas from all residues investigated leads to a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels. When system expansion is applied, however, the benefit will be significantly smaller since the alternative utilisation of the substrates as animal feed is considered and included in the system. This might also lead to an indirect land-use competition since additional protein feed crops must be cultivated. Thus, all residues studied are well suited for biogas production if there is no demand for them as animal feed today. Otherwise, it is often more efficient to grow dedicated biogas crops directly. Similar to other studies of bio-based systems the results also show that emissions related to acidification and eutrophication will be higher compared to a fossil fuel based system. A conclusion is that the calculation method in RED has a limited systems perspective, which could lead to a sub optimisation of the utilisation of industrial waste from a GHG perspective depending on the current alternative utilisation of the residues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are advanced to replace fossil fuels in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. Yet freshwater scarcity is another growing concern and increased production of biofuels may increase this problem. In order to assess whether biofuels truly have a higher water use than do fossil fuels, a life cycle assessment study of a low input jatropha plantation in northern Mozambique was conducted. In addition to different water use indicators, the fossil energy use and global warming potential were assessed for 1 MJ of jatropha oil. The analysis compares results for jatropha oil with fossil diesel, generally showing lower global warming potential and fossil energy use for jatropha oil. However, aspects related to land use may alter the global warming potential of jatropha oil. Regarding water use, the choice of the water use indicator strongly influences the results. Specifically the indication of (1) so-called green water flows, (2) formation of so-called blue water and (3) water scarcity show crucial influences on the comparison. Depending on these specific features, jatropha oil may have higher or lower water use than fossil diesel. A number of uncertainties, such as the jatropha oil yield, are also shown to have a considerable impact on the results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several ongoing projects are harvesting maritime biomass from the Baltic Sea for eutrophication mitigation and utilisation of the recovered biomass. Some of this biomass comprises common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most widespread vascular plants on Earth. Reed utilisation from eutrophied coastal areas needs to be evaluated. Therefore, a system analysis was performed of reed harvesting for biofuel and biofertiliser production. The specific objectives of the analysis were to: investigate the methane yield associated with anaerobic co-digestion of reed; make a primary energy assessment of the system; quantify Greenhouse Gas (GHG) savings when a fossil reference system is replaced; and estimate the nutrient recycling potential of the system. The results from energy and GHG calculations are highly dependent on conditions such as system boundaries, system design, allocation methods and selected indicators. Therefore a pilot project taking place in Kalmar County, Sweden, was used as a case study system. Laboratory experiments using continuously stirred tank reactor digesters indicated an increased methane yield of about 220 m3 CH4/t volatile solids from co-digestion of reed. The energy balance for the case study system was positive, with energy requirements amounting to about 40% of the energy content in the biomethane produced and with the non-renewable energy input comprising about 50% of the total energy requirements of the system. The net energy value proved to be equivalent to about 40 L of petrol/t reed wet weight. The potential to save GHG emissions compared with a fossil reference system was considerable (about 80%). Furthermore an estimated 60% of the nitrogen and almost all the phosphorus in the biomass could be re-circulated to arable land as biofertiliser. Considering the combined benefits from all factors investigated in this study, harvesting of common reed from coastal zones has the potential to be beneficial, assuming an appropriate system design, and is worthy of further investigations regarding other sustainability aspects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life cycle studies of corn ethanol have largely centered on the fuel's carbon and energy benefits. However, with the recognition that this narrow focus falls short of addressing the environmental sustainability of fuel substitution, there is a growing body of literature that extends assessment to a broader range of impacts, such as eutrophication, smog formation, acidification, and water and land use. Using the USEtox impact assessment model, this study evaluates the life cycle freshwater ecotoxicity, human health cancer, and noncancer effects of U.S. corn ethanol and gasoline, which are less well understood in comparison to other impact categories. This study also takes into account spatial and temporal variations in corn production and ethanol conversion technologies. Results show that corn ethanol generates potentially larger freshwater ecotoxicity than gasoline due to releases of pesticides in corn growth, particularly, atrazine, acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, and cyfluthrin. So does corn ethanol have a higher potential noncancer impact due to releases of heavy metals through use of phosphate fertilizers. The two fuels seem to induce similar potential caner impacts. The results indicate that replacing gasoline with corn ethanol could further degrade water quality and exacerbate noncancer related human health issues. Overall, this study implies that environmental policymaking should consider a broader spectrum of impacts beyond carbon and energy to avoid or minimize potential environmental burden-shifting. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-filling option is drying out with rapid pile up of organic waste in urban areas; the problem can be circumvented with accelerated anaerobic decomposition which can also be a source of valuable bio-fuel. But many municipal anaerobic waste treatment systems fail due to the lack of adequate microbial inoculum and also hampered by the doubts on many aspects of its operation and stability. In this regard biomethanation of the organic fraction of urban waste was carried out in laboratory scale reactors with different inoculum. The interdependence among the anaerobic microbial community which leads to stability in operation was assessed with a set of diverse factors. Influential interplay of various physiochemical factors which includes Volatile fatty acid content, reduction in Chemical oxygen demand, average biogas production, methane content of the bio-fuel, variation in pH, influence of temperature and reduction in total solids content was assessed. The operation instability can be solely attributed to three factors, inadequate methanogenic diversity, differential nature of substrate and variation in temperature. Methanogens were isolated from different inoculum based stable digesters and an consortium was developed. The consortium not only circumvented the loopholes of the individual stable digesters but also demonstrated an enhanced stability, greater biogas yield, more methane content and higher reduction in chemical oxygen demand. To confirm the efficacy of the consortium, a direct equal mixture of various inoculum (bypassing the isolation step) was used for biomethanation process. Though it improved the performance of the digesters, the efficiency exhibited by the explicit role of the consortium was higher. Methanogen cell number was estimated both by direct count using fluorescence microscope and by roll tube technique on enriched media. Tracking individual methanogenic species of the consortium in the due course of organic waste digestion will be further carried out using FISH and immune-molecular techniques for further understanding of complex anaerobic process.

AB  - The Copenhagen Accord of 2009 refers to a 2°C target and encouraged countries to submit emission reduction proposals and actions (pledges) for the year 2020, which many did. Several studies determined the effect of these pledges on the global emission level in 2020, and analysed the gap between this emission level and the level consistent with least-cost emission pathways for achieving the 2°C target. These studies were summarised in the UNEP emission gap reports. Since the UNFCCC climate negotiations in Cancún, 2010, business-as-usual emission projections have been updated and some countries submitted new pledges or clarified existing pledges. Furthermore, new accounting rules for land use and the use of surplus units were agreed in Durban (2011) and Doha (2012). This paper shows that together, these developments have led to an increase in the emission level resulting from the pledges of about 4GtCO2equiv. compared to our assessment before Cancún, mainly due to increased business-as-usual projections. According to our projections, the pledges lead to an emission level of 52.7-56.5GtCO2equiv. by 2020, which implies an emission gap of 8.7-12.6GtCO2equiv. for a likely chance (greater than 66% likelihood) and from 6.7 to 10.6GtCO2equiv. for a medium chance (50-66% likelihood) of achieving 2°C. This does not imply that achieving 2°C is out of reach with the current pledges, but it will require higher reduction rates beyond 2020 and will depend more heavily on future technological developments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Measurements of the mole fraction of the CO2 and its isotopes were performed in Paris during the MEGAPOLI winter campaign (January-February 2010). Radiocarbon (14CO2) measurements were used to identify the relative contributions of 77% CO2 from fossil fuel consumption (CO2ff from liquid and gas combustion) and 23% from biospheric CO2 (CO2 from the use of biofuels and from human and plant respiration: CO2bio). These percentages correspond to average mole fractions of 26.4 ppm and 8.2 ppm for CO2ff and CO2bio, respectively. The 13CO2 analysis indicated that gas and liquid fuel contributed 70% and 30%, respectively, of the CO2 emission from fossil fuel use. Continuous measurements of CO and NOx and the ratios CO/CO2ff and NOx/CO2ff derived from radiocarbon measurements during four days make it possible to estimate the fossil fuel CO2 contribution over the entire campaign. The ratios CO/CO2ff and NOx/CO2ff are functions of air mass origin and exhibited daily ranges of 7.9 to 14.5 ppb ppm-1 and 1.1 to 4.3 ppb ppm-1, respectively. These ratios are consistent with different emission inventories given the uncertainties of the different approaches. By using both tracers to derive the fossil fuel CO2, we observed similar diurnal cycles with two maxima during rush hour traffic. © 2013 Author(s).

AB  - Biofuel cells typically yield lower power and are more difficult to fabricate than conventional fuel cells using inorganic catalysts. This work presents a glucose/O2 microfluidic biofuel cell (MBFC) featuring pyrolyzed photoresist film (PPF) electrodes made on silicon wafers using a rapid thermal process, and subsequently encapsulated by rapid prototyping techniques into a double-Y-shaped microchannel made entirely of plastic. A ferrocenium-based polyethyleneimine polymer linked to glucose oxidase (GOx/Fc-C6-LPEI) was used in the anode, while the cathode contained a mixture of laccase, anthracene-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and tetrabutylammonium bromide-modified Nafion (MWCNTs/laccase/TBAB-Nafion). The cell performance was studied under different flow-rates, obtaining a maximum open circuit voltage of 0.54 ± 0.04 V and a maximum current density of 290 ± 28 μA cm-2 at room temperature under a flow rate of 70 μL min-1 representing a maximum power density of 64 ± 5 μW cm-2. Although there is room for improvement, this is the best performance reported to date for a bioelectrode-based microfluidic enzymatic biofuel cell, and its materials and fabrication are amenable to mass production. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This study focuses on family farmer engagement in the Brazilian national programme for Production and use of Biodiesel (PNPB). The Brazilian government has been promoting the role of family farmers as producers of biomass for biodiesel since 2004; however, fewer than expected family farmers have decided to produce biomass for biodiesel. The North of Minas Gerais is one region where a biodiesel plant has been strategically located to source castor beans grown by family farmers. The target family farm type in this region specializes in beef and/or dairy production with low input pasture (approximately 30. ha per farm), maize intercropped with beans (approximately 1. ha per farm) and sugarcane (approximately 1. ha per farm). We selected this region for a case study to explore management decisions of farmers, industry and policy makers that influence family farmer engagement with biodiesel production through cultivation of castor beans. To evaluate outcomes for family farmers engaging with the PNPB, we focused on how cultivation of castor beans impacts family farmers in terms of income levels, income stability and levels of milk production. We used an application of systems thinking known as Bayesian network modelling (BNM). BNM was chosen for its suitability to integrate different types of knowledge and to include quantitative and qualitative variables. The study was built on a body of scientific literature explaining why family farmers have not been cultivating castor beans for biodiesel production and a body of experiential knowledge of local actors (farmers, extension officers, policy makers, biodiesel manufacturers and researchers in North of Minas Gerais). The complete BNM consisted of a 'cause and effect' diagram where the strengths of the causal relationships were quantified with elicited opinions from surveyed local actors. We used the complete BNM to explore scenarios that could improve outcomes for family farmers and consequently increase their level of engagement. For example, we addressed subsidy structures of the PNPB, crop management, farm-level trade-offs and value-chain innovations. We demonstrate that decisions to support family farmer engagement with biodiesel are not singular. Engagement by family farmers requires simultaneously: improvements in technical crop management, reductions in farm-level cash constraints and innovations in the production chain such that engagement of family farmers goes beyond cultivation of one more low-value crop. Finally we discuss some methodological issues from this application of BNM to farming systems research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha is an important second-generation biofuel plant. Salinity is a major factor adversely impacting the growth and yield of several plants including Jatropha. SbNHX1 is a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter gene that compartmentalises excess Na+ ions into the vacuole and maintains ion homeostasis. We have previously cloned and characterised the SbNHX1 gene from an extreme halophyte, Salicornia brachiata. Transgenic plants of Jatropha curcas with the SbNHX1 gene were developed using microprojectile bombardment mediated transformation. Integration of the transgene was confirmed by PCR and Rt-PCR and the copy number was determined by real time qPCR. The present study of engineering salt tolerance in Jatropha is the first report to date. Salt tolerance of the transgenic lines JL2, JL8 and JL19 was confirmed by leaf senescence assay, chlorophyll estimation, plant growth, ion content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content analysis. Transgenic lines showed better salt tolerance than WT up to 200 mM NaCl. Imparting salt tolerance to Jatropha using the SbNHX1 gene may open up the possibility of cultivating it in marginal salty land, releasing arable land presently under Jatropha cultivation for agriculture purposes. Apart from this, transgenic Jatropha can be cultivated with brackish water, opening up the possibility of sustainable cultivation of this biofuel plant in salty coastal areas. © 2013 Jha et al.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are promising feedstock for production of lipids, sugars, bioactive compounds and in particular biofuels, yet development of sensitive and reliable phylotyping strategies for microalgae has been hindered by the paucity of phylogenetically closely-related finished genomes.Results: Using the oleaginous eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis as a model, we assessed current intragenus phylotyping strategies by producing the complete plastid (pt) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes of seven strains from six Nannochloropsis species. Genes on the pt and mt genomes have been highly conserved in content, size and order, strongly negatively selected and evolving at a rate 33% and 66% of nuclear genomes respectively. Pt genome diversification was driven by asymmetric evolution of two inverted repeats (IRa and IRb): psbV and clpC in IRb are highly conserved whereas their counterparts in IRa exhibit three lineage-associated types of structural polymorphism via duplication or disruption of whole or partial genes. In the mt genomes, however, a single evolution hotspot varies in copy-number of a 3.5 Kb-long, cox1-harboring repeat. The organelle markers (e.g., cox1, cox2, psbA, rbcL and rrn16_mt) and nuclear markers (e.g., ITS2 and 18S) that are widely used for phylogenetic analysis obtained a divergent phylogeny for the seven strains, largely due to low SNP density. A new strategy for intragenus phylotyping of microalgae was thus proposed that includes (i) twelve sequence markers that are of higher sensitivity than ITS2 for interspecies phylogenetic analysis, (ii) multi-locus sequence typing based on rps11_mt-nad4, rps3_mt and cox2-rrn16_mt for intraspecies phylogenetic reconstruction and (iii) several SSR loci for identification of strains within a given species.Conclusion: This first comprehensive dataset of organelle genomes for a microalgal genus enabled exhaustive assessment and searches of all candidate phylogenetic markers on the organelle genomes. A new strategy for intragenus phylotyping of microalgae was proposed which might be generally applicable to other microalgal genera and should serve as a valuable tool in the expanding algal biotechnology industry. © 2013 Wei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The production of bioethanol in Argentina is based on the sugarcane plantation system, with extensive use of agricultural land, scarce use of fertilizers, pesticides, and artificial irrigation, and burning of sugarcane prior to harvesting. The objective of this paper is to develop a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the fuel ethanol from sugarcane in Tucumán (Argentina), assessing the environmental impact potentials to identify which of them cause the main impacts. Methods: Our approach innovatively combined knowledge about the main impact pathways of bioethanol production with LCA which covers the typical emission-related impact categories at the midpoint life cycle impact assessment. Real data from the Argentinean industry subsystems have been used to perform the study: S1 - sugarcane production, S2 - milling process, S3 - sugar production, and S4 - ethanol production from molasses, honey, or sugarcane juice. Results and discussion: The results are shown in the three alternative pathways to produce bioethanol. Different impact categories are assessed, with global warming potential (GWP) having the highest impact. So, the production of 1 kg of ethanol from molasses emitted 22.5 kg CO2 (pathway 1), 19.2 kg CO2 from honey (pathway 2), and 15.0 kg CO 2 from sugarcane juice (pathway 3). Several sensitivity analyses to study the variability of the GWP according to the different cases studied have been performed (changing the agricultural yield, including economic and calorific allocation in sugar production, and modifying the sugar price). Conclusions: Agriculture is the subsystem which shows the highest impact in almost all the categories due to fossil fuel consumption. When an economic and calorific allocation is considered to assess the environmental impact, the value is lower than when mass allocation is used because ethanol is relatively cheaper than sugars and it has higher calorific value. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Marine algae have emerged as an alternative feedstock for the production of a number of renewable fuels, including biogas. In addition to energy potential, other characteristics make them attractive as an energy source, including their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), higher productivity rates than land-based crops and the lack of water use or land competition. For Ireland, biofuels from marine algae can play an important role by reducing imports of fossil fuels as well as providing the necessary energy in rural communities. In this study, five potential seaweed species common in Irish waters, Saccorhiza polyschides, Ulva sp., Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus and Saccharina latissima, were co-digested individually with bovine slurry. Batch reactors of 120 ml and 1000 ml were set up and incubated at 35°C to investigate their suitability for production of biogas. Digesters fed with S. latissima produced the maximum methane yield (335 ml g volatile solids -1 (gVS-1)) followed by S. polyschides with 255 ml gVS-1. L. digitata produced 246 ml gVS -1 and the lowest yields were from the green seaweed Ulva sp. 191 ml gVS-1. The methane and CO2 percentages ranged between 50-72% and 10-45%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the seaweed species investigated are good feedstocks candidates for the production of biogas and methane as a source of energy. Their use on a large-scale process will require further investigation to increase yields and reduce production costs. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Switchgrass and other perennial grasses have been promoted as biomass crops for production of renewable fuels. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biomass removal on soil biogeochemical processes. A 3-year field study consisting of three levels of net primary productivity (NPP; low, medium, and high growing season precipitation) and two biomass crops (winter wheat and switchgrass) was conducted near Pendleton, Oregon. Switchgrass increased soil carbon (C)-nitrogen (N) ratio, but the effect varied with net primary productivity (NPP) and soil depth. In situ soil respiration (carbon dioxide; CO2) rate from switchgrass increased with NPP level but switchgrass had greater cumulative flux than wheat in medium and low NPP. Nitrogen mineralization and microbial biomass carbon were significantly greater under switchgrass than under wheat at high and medium NPP. Introduction of switchgrass initiates major changes in soil nutrient dynamics through organic-matter input. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Abstract We extend an earlier bioeconomic model of optimal duck harvest and wetland retention in the Prairie Pothole Region of Western Canada to include cropping decisions. Instead of a single state equation, the model has two state equations representing the population dynamics of ducks and the amount of wetlands. We use the model to estimate the impact of climate change on wetlands and waterfowl, including direct climate effects as well as land use change due to biofuel policies aimed at mitigating climate change. The model predicts that climate change will reduce wetlands by 37-56% from historic levels. Land use change due to biofuel policies is expected to reduce wetlands by between 35% and 45% from historic levels, whereas direct climate effects will range from a reduction of 2-11%, depending on the future climate scenario. This result indicates that models that neglect the effect of land use changes underestimate the effect of climate change on wetlands. Further, wetlands loss is geographically heterogeneous, with losses being the largest in Saskatchewan. ©2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Polysaccharides make up about 75% of plant cell walls and can be broken down to produce sugar substrates (saccharification) from which a whole range of products can be obtained, including bioethanol. Cell walls also contain 5-10% of proteins, which could be used to tailor them for agroindustrial uses. Here we present cell wall proteomics data of Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant for temperate grasses. Leaves and culms were analyzed during active growth and at mature stage. Altogether, 559 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics, among which 314 have predicted signal peptides. Sixty-three proteins were shared by two organs at two developmental stages where they could play housekeeping functions. Differences were observed between organs and stages of development, especially at the level of glycoside hydrolases and oxidoreductases. Differences were also found between the known cell wall proteomes of B. distachyon, Oryza sativa, and the Arabidopsis thaliana dicot. Three glycoside hydrolases could be immunolocalized in cell walls using polyclonal antibodies against proteotypic peptides. Organ-specific expression consistent with proteomics results could be observed as well as cell-specific localization. Moreover, the high number of proteins of unknown function in B. distachyon cell wall proteomes opens new fields of research for monocot cell walls. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Alpine grassland of Tibet is a frangible ecosystem in terms of carbon (C) emission. Yak dung is an important resident energy with about 80 % of yak dung combusted for energy in the north Tibetan plateau. This paper investigated the impact of dung combustion on the C cycle of the alpine grassland ecosystem in north Tibet, China. During the growing season of 2011, from a field survey and household questionnaires, the main impacts of dung collection for fuel on the C cycle of the ecosystem were identified. (1) The C sequestration and storage capacity, including the dung-derived C stored in soil and C captured by vegetation, decreased. The net primary production decreased remarkably because of the reduction of dung returned to soil. (2) In a given period, more C was emitted to the atmosphere in the dung combustion situation than that in the dung returned to soil situation. (3) The energy grazing alpine meadow ecosystem changed into a net C source, and the net biome production of the ecosystem dropped to -15.18 g C/m2 year in the dung combustion situation, 42.95 g C/m2 year less than that in the dung returned situation. To reduce the CO2 emission derived from dung use, the proportion of dung combustion should be reduced and alternative renewable energy such as solar, wind, or hydro energy should be advocated, which is suitable for, and accessible to, the north Tibetan plateau. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - While all other sectors had significant renewable energy penetrations, transport is still heavily dependent on oil displaying rapid growth in the last decades. There is no easy renewable solution to meet transport sector demand due to the wide variety of modes and needs in the sector. Nowadays, biofuels along with electricity are proposed as one of the main options for replacing fossil fuels in the transport sector. The main reasons for avoiding the direct usage of biomass, i.e. producing biomass derived fuels, are land use shortages, limited biomass availability, interference with food supplies, and other impacts on the environment and biosphere. Hence, it is essential to make a detailed analysis of this sector in order to match the demand and to meet the criteria of a 100% renewable energy system in 2050. The purpose of this article is to identify potential pathways for producing synthetic fuels, with a specific focus on solid oxide electrolyser cells (SOEC) combined with the recycling of CO2. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The optimization of the composition of the algae for the simultaneous production of bioethanol and biodiesel is presented. We consider two alternative technologies for the biodiesel synthesis from algae oil, enzymatic or homogeneous alkali catalyzed that are coupled with bioethanol production from algae starch. In order to determine the optimal operating conditions, we not only couple the technologies, but simultaneously optimize the production of both biofuels and heat integrate them while optimizing the water consumption. Multi-effect distillation is included to reduce the energy and cooling water consumption for ethanol dehydration. In both cases, the optimal algae composition results in 60% oil, 30% starch, and 10% protein. The best alternative for the production of biofuels corresponds to a production price of 0.35 $/gal, using enzymes, with energy and water consumption values (4.00 MJ/gal and 0.59 gal/gal). © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

High heritability was observed for fruits per plant, seeds per plant, 100-seed weight, seed/kernel (S/K) ratio and kernel oil percentage coupled with high genetic advance suggesting that the accessions can be considered improvement. The significant positive association of seed oil content (%) with 100-seed weight suggested the effectiveness of indirect selection for seed oil content through 100-seed weight. Accessions 76, 120, 29, 86 and 84 showed above average higher values for all yield attributes (viz. fruit and seed yield, 100-seed weight, S/K ratio and oil content) suggesting these as best out of the test accessions. Accessions showing higher values for one or the other yield attributes could be selected as parents for further improvement. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Successful modeling of the carbon (C) cycle requires empirical data regarding species-specific root responses to edaphic characteristics. We address this need by quantifying annual root production of three bioenergy systems (continuous corn, triticale/sorghum, switchgrass) in response to variation in soil properties across a toposequence within a Midwestern agroecosystem. Using ingrowth cores to measure annual root production, we tested for the effects of topography and 11 soil characteristics on root productivity. Root production significantly differed among cropping systems. Switchgrass root productivity was lowest on the floodplain position, but root productivity of annual crops was not influenced by topography or soil properties. Greater switchgrass root production was associated with high percent sand, which explained 45% of the variation. Percent sand was correlated negatively with soil C and nitrogen and positively with bulk density, indicating this variable is a proxy for multiple important soil properties. Our results suggest that easily measured soil parameters can be used to improve model predictions of root productivity in bioenergy switchgrass, but the edaphic factors we measured were not useful for predicting root productivity in annual crops. These results can improve C cycling modeling efforts by revealing the influence of cropping system and soil properties on root productivity. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Algal biodiesel has been a subject of growing importance in the realm of renewable energy due to carbon capture properties and its potential for photosynthetic efficiency with high lipid output. This study identified five isolates of freshwater green algae, belonging to the Chlorellaceae, and measured the lipid classes and fatty acid profiles of these species to determine suitability for biodiesel production. To induce the greater accumulation of lipids, especially in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) desired for biodiesel, we examined the lipid accumulation in cells stressed by nitrogen limitation, sulfur deficiency, or pH stress. Increases in biomass were monitored in order to determine if adjusting pH incrementally over the course of the experiment had any effect on growth and lipid accumulation of several isolates. TAG accumulation was visually screened by Nile Red fluorescence and further assessed by gas chromatography. Lipid amounts were comparably equal or better for pH stress treatments than for standard nutrient-deprivation treatments. Incrementally adjusted pH over the course of growth triggered lipid accumulation comparable to constant pH stress treatments, yet biomass accumulation was equivalent to unstressed growth. One isolate obtained from the Athabasca oil-sands region of Alberta, OS4-2, is a good candidate for biodiesel production, having accumulated over 45 % of its dry weight as lipid, with over 80 % of the lipid as triacylglycerols, and contains an abundance of 18:1 fatty acids. This class of fatty acids improves the cold flow and oxidative stability of biodiesel and is ideal for biofuel used in a Canadian climate. © 2012 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

AB  - The Directive 2009/28/EC established the overall target that 20% of energy consumption should be represented by renewable energy sources by 2020 in each European member state. Furthermore, the Directive sets a mandatory 10% minimum target for biofuels in the transport sector. Biofuels are potentially an important alternative to mineral diesel. We propose a pilot production line of biodiesel from sunflower on local scale in the Province of Siena (Tuscany) to research a possible reduction of fossil fuel consumption in the transport sector. This study might represent an opportunity to reduce petroleum dependence in the transport sector. Environmental Impact Indicators were provided by Material Flow Accounting, Embodied Energy Analysis and Emergy Accounting. Results showed that agricultural phase is the critical step in the production line. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment analysis for the biodiesel production line with mineral diesel production showed environmental advantages of the biofuel production, however requiring a higher land demand. Therefore, biodiesel may not the optimal solution on large scale but might be a good alternative to fossil fuel. This would depend upon the entire production cycle taking place in a limited area. This is necessary in order to fulfill the needs of local farms and small enterprises. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production and usage of biofuels has increased worldwide, seeking goals of energy security, low-carbon energy and rural development. As biofuels trade increased, the European Union introduced sustainability regulations in an attempt to reduce the risks associated with biofuels. Producers were then confronted with costs of sustainability certification, in order to access the EU market. Hopes were that sustainably-produced biofuels would be rewarded with higher prices in the EU. Based on a review of recent literature, interviews with traders and price data from Platts, this paper explores whether sustainability premiums emerged and if so, did they represent an attracting feature in the market for sustainable biofuels. This article finds that premiums for ethanol and biodiesel evolved differently between 2011 and 2012, but have been in general very small or inexistent, with certified fuels becoming the new norm in the market. For different reasons, there has been an apparent convergence between biofuel policies in the EU and the US. As market operators perceive a long-term trend for full certification in the biofuels market, producers in developing countries are likely to face additional challenges in terms of finance and capacity to cope with the sustainability requirements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Just as temperate region pulp and paper companies need to compete with Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers, lignocellulosic biofuel producers in North America and Europe, in the absence of protectionist trade policies, will need to be competitive with tropical and sub-tropical biofuel producers. This work sought to determine the impact of lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery siting on economic performance and minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for both east and west coast North American fuel markets. Facility sites included the pine-dominated Pacific Northwest Interior, the mixed deciduous forest of Ontario and New York, and the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo. Feedstock scenarios included both plantation (poplar, willow, and eucalyptus, respectively) and managed forest harvest. Site specific variables in the techno-economic model included delivered feedstock cost, ethanol delivery cost, cost of capital, construction cost, labour cost, electricity revenues (and co-product credits), and taxes, insurance, and permits. Despite the long shipping distance from Brazil to North American east and west coast markets, the MESP for Brazilian-produced eucalyptus lignocellulosic ethanol, modelled at $0.74L-1, was notably lower than that of all North American-produced cases at $0.83-1.02L-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Substituting renewable forms of energy for fossil fuels is a real challenge in developed countries and fuel wood will undoubtedly have an important role to play in forested areas. However, fuel wood harvesting may deplete nutrients in forest ecosystems and adversely affect site fertility in the long term. We compared the cost of compensatory fertilising and liming operations between whole-tree harvesting and traditional stem-only harvesting. We worked in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands in eastern France and two site fertility classes (high and low). We used a growth model to calculate the nitrogen, calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents of fine woody debris (FWD, diameter<7cm) and compared the benefits of selling this fine wood for energy to the cost of compensatory fertilising and liming. We showed that compensating and liming are more expensive than the profits derived from selling fine fuel wood, except when fuel wood prices rise considerably. This was mainly due to the high proportion of bark in FWD compared with other tree compartments. Indeed, bark is especially rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which were the most costly nutrients to replace. Our study highlights the importance of considering the environmental costs of fuel wood production at the stand scale. Whenever fertilisation or liming is necessary, we recommend compensating at least for calcium and magnesium, two nutrients that account for a very small part of the costs. In any case, fertilisation should only be used if long-term site fertility has been compromised. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the spatial supply and demand relationships for biomass energy potential for England, using Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping techniques. Due to energy use and cost of biomass feedstock transportation, the spatial relationship between potential supply and demand is crucial to efficient usage of this distributed feedstock. Previous studies have identified potential for biomass generation at individual sites, according to local factors dictating viable transport distances and costs. The research presented here necessarily takes a more generalised approach, to allow national scale assessment of capability to meet fixed location demands, and quantify theoretical potential generation under relevant scenarios. The approach is illustrated for England, although techniques are applicable elsewhere when suitable data are available.Mapping for England indicates that of the 2,521,996ha viable for cultivation of Miscanthus, 1,998,435ha are within 25km of the identified potential end uses of feedstock, and 2,409,541ha are within 40km. Potential generation exceeds the 2020 UK biomass generation target of 259PJ, whichever radius is applied. However, predictions assume Miscanthus cultivation at all appropriate sites, and no policy interventions to limit transport distance.Results from national scale analysis may be useful in informing government decisions, for example to identify impacts on total generation potential of incentives affecting decisions on allocation of overlap feedstock. Variation in GHG balance and environmental impacts between cultivation sites creates spatial variation in benefits of bioenergy, which should be taken into account in addition to the spatial relationship between supply and demand. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Meeting EU targets for renewable transport fuels by 2020 will necessitate a large increase in bioenergy feedstocks. Although deployment of first generation biofuels has been the major response to meeting these targets they are subject to wide debate on their sustainability leading to the development of second generation technologies which use lignocellulosic feedstocks. Second generation biofuel can be subdivided into those from dedicated bioenergy crops (DESGB), e.g. miscanthus, or those from co-products (CPSGB) such as cereal straw. Potential supply of cereal straw as a feedstock for CPSGB's is uncertain in England due to the difficulty in obtaining data and the uncertainty in current estimates. An on-farm survey of 249 farms (Cereal, General Cropping and Mixed) in England was performed and linked with Farm Business Survey data to estimate current straw use and potential straw availability. No significant correlations between harvested grain and straw yields were found for wheat and oilseed rape and only a weak correlation was observed for barley. In England there is a potential cereal straw supply of 5.27Mt from arable farm types; 3.82Mt are currently used and 1.45Mt currently chopped and incorporated. If currently chopped and incorporated cereal straw from arable farm types was converted into bioethanol, this could represent 1.5% of the UK petrol consumption by energy equivalence. The variations in regional straw yields (tha-1) have a great effect on the England supply of straw and the potential amount of bioethanol that can be produced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Field Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is a member of the mustard family and may be grown as a winter crop between traditional summer crops to produce renewable biomass for renewable diesel and jet fuel. This paper estimated total annual biofuel production potential of 15 million cubic metres from rotation between corn and soybeans on 16.2 million hectares in the Midwest without impact on food production. This study also investigated the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy balance of pennycress-derived Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel and Renewable Diesel (RD). Both system expansion and allocation approaches were applied to distribute environmental impacts among products and co-products along the life cycle of each biofuel. The life cycle GHG emissions (excluding land use change) for RD and HRJ range from 13 to 41gMJ-1 (CO2 eq.) and -18 to 45gMJ-1 (CO2 eq.), respectively, depending on how the co-products are credited. The majority of the energy required for each biofuel product is derived from renewable biomass as opposed to non renewable fossil. The fossil energy consumptions are considerably lower than the petroleum fuels. Scenario analyses were also conducted to determine response to model assumptions, including nitrogen fertilizer application rate, nitrogen content in crop residues, and sources of H2. The results show that pennycress derived biofuels could qualify as advanced biofuels and as biomass-based diesel as defined by the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Current estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels produced in the US can be improved by refining soil C emission factors (EF; C emissions per land area per year) for direct land use change associated with different biofuel feedstock scenarios. We developed a modeling framework to estimate these EFs at the state-level by utilizing remote sensing data, national statistics databases, and a surrogate model for CENTURY's soil organic C dynamics submodel (SCSOC). We estimated the forward change in soil C concentration within the 0-30cm depth and computed the associated EFs for the 2011 to 2040 period for croplands, grasslands or pasture/hay, croplands/conservation reserve, and forests that weresuited to produce any of four possible biofuel feedstock systems [corn (Zea Mays L)-corn, corn-corn with stover harvest, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L), and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deuter)]. Our results predict smaller losses or even modest gains in sequestration for corn based systems, particularly on existing croplands, than previous efforts and support assertions that production of perennial grasses will lead to negative emissions in most situations and that conversion of forest or established grasslands to biofuel production would likely produce net emissions. The proposed framework and use of the SCSOC provide transparency and relative simplicity that permit users to easily modify model inputs to inform biofuel feedstock production targets set forth by policy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The land potential for producing biomass for bioenergy purposes has been highly debated in recent years. The present paper analyses the possibilities and consequences for land use and agricultural production of biofuel production in Denmark based on domestic wheat and rape under specific scenario conditions for the period 2010-2030. The potential is assessed for a situation where policy targets for renewable energy carriers in the transport sector is reached using biofuels, and where second generation ethanol increasingly substitutes first generation ethanol.Three scenarios are developed and evaluated: a baseline, an alternative scenario allowing continuous growth in the now dominant livestock branch and a biofuel scenario assuming that efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in biofuel displaces part of the domestic production of fodder.Results show that the biofuel demand could be met in 2020; but only if current rape oil production is used to satisfy local bio-diesel demand. It would also imply that the Danish bio-diesel export currently supplying a minor part of the German fuel market would seize. In 2030, however, only about 60 percent of the biofuel demand would be covered by self-sufficiency. If biofuels were to displace animal production to make up for this, a reduction of the pig production between 10 and 20 percent would result. Efficiency increases across production branches would allow the animal production to continue un-affected if about half of the rape oil produced for other purposes is utilized. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second-generation biofuels that produce biomass for combustion or ethanol production do not yet appear to be a viable alternative to agriculture as they are low-value products. This may change, however, when energy prices increase and their production is combined with the provision of other services. The current analysis explores the potential for the production of an often overlooked biomass feedstock that can be combined with water and nature management objectives: reed. This crop has the additional advantage that it can be grown under conditions that are unfavourable to most other crops. An economics-based land-use modelling approach is applied to simulate the local competition between reed and grassland used for dairy farming under four different future scenarios in the Netherlands. Based on a location-specific assessment of potential costs and benefits of these crops under scenario-based conditions this analysis shows that the cultivation of reed for bioenergy, in combination with providing additional land-use functions, while not viable option under current economic and political conditions, may become competitive within the next twenty years if any of the following developments occur: energy prices increase substantially; water tables rise in the low-lying western parts of the country due to climate change; a policy is implemented that increases bioenergy prices; or a policy is implemented that stimulates water buffering and the preservation of peat soils. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was used as a woody biomass in the form of sawdust. Hydrothermal conversion of the biomass was carried out in the absence and presence of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate and boric acid at the temperatures of 250, 300 and 350°C. The effects of temperature and catalysts on the product distributions and bio-oil compositions were investigated. The highest total bio-oil yield obtained at 300°C with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was 34.9wt%, whereas the total bio-oil yields from the non-catalytic run and the run with H3BO3 at 300°C were 24.6wt% and 19.1wt%, respectively. Although the composition of bio-oils was similar in all runs, some compounds such as furfural and furfural derivatives were not observed in the light and heavy bio-oils produced from the non-catalytic run and the run with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate at 300°C. The light bio-oils from all runs contained mainly oxygenated hydrocarbons. The major compounds in HBOs were the following: 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone for disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid for the non-catalytic run and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid for the run with boric acid. The maximum heating values for the LBO and HBO were estimated to be about 25 and 28MJ/kg, respectively, and they were obtained with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate. SEM analysis of the bio-char obtained from the non-catalytic run at 250°C showed a semi-char formation. An increase in temperature from 250 to 300°C led to the formation of regular channels on the surface of the bio-char. These open channels closed when the temperature was increased from 300 to 350°C. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas seeds are a promising source of oil for biodiesel production. The presence of toxic phorbol esters in oil, biodiesel byproducts/co-products (e.g., seedcake and seed meal) and different plant parts however, raises both occupational and eco-toxicological concerns. Due to toxicity issues, there is a need to develop a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for determining phorbol ester content. An HPLC/UV-based rapid determination of phorbol esters using a C18 column (20, 50, and 75mm columns) was devised and validated. Vortex extraction was found to be the best method for extracting phorbol esters. The separation of Jatropha phorbol esters was best achieved with increased column lengths and run times (e.g., run times of 6, 8, and 12.5min for 20, 50, and 75mm columns, respectively). The limit of detection and limit of quantification for Jatropha phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate equivalent) ranged from 26 to 68ng and 107-200ng using three columns, respectively. The finalized method was rapid (≤12.5min run time) and able to detect low concentrations (up to 26ng) of phorbol esters when compared to conventional methods (&gt;35min run time and 400-800ng detection limit). The analyzed phorbol ester concentrations for different Jatropha samples (kernel, kernel meal, seedcake, seed meal, and oil) were within the acceptable range of reported values. The developed method was shown to be a rapid, sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective approach, which would find diverse applications ranging from value-added co-product development risk assessment to agricultural research. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growth of emerging economies, policy commitments to biofuels and volatility in commodity prices have contributed to a marked increase in the pace and scale of foreign direct investment in land-based enterprises in the global South. This paper explores the relationship between policy and practice associated with customary rights protections in the context of large-scale land acquisitions through a document review and case study analyses from Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Findings point to the difficulty of safeguarding customary rights even in countries providing "best practice" legal protections, and point to the fundamental role of human agency in shaping outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A key event in the domestication and breeding of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis was loss of the thick coconut-like shell surrounding the kernel. Modern E. guineensis has three fruit forms, dura (thick-shelled), pisifera (shell-less) and tenera (thin-shelled), a hybrid between dura and pisifera. The pisifera palm is usually female-sterile. The tenera palm yields far more oil than dura, and is the basis for commercial palm oil production in all of southeast Asia. Here we describe the mapping and identification of the SHELL gene responsible for the different fruit forms. Using homozygosity mapping by sequencing, we found two independent mutations in the DNA-binding domain of a homologue of the MADS-box gene SEEDSTICK (STK, also known as AGAMOUS-LIKE 11), which controls ovule identity and seed development in Arabidopsis. The SHELL gene is responsible for the tenera phenotype in both cultivated and wild palms from sub-Saharan Africa, and our findings provide a genetic explanation for the single gene hybrid vigour (or heterosis) attributed to SHELL, via heterodimerization. This gene mutation explains the single most important economic trait in oil palm, and has implications for the competing interests of global edible oil production, biofuels and rainforest conservation. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Increasing prices and demand for biofuel and cooking oil from importer countries have caused a remarkable expansion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia. In this paper, we attempt to monitor the expansion of oil palm plantations on peat land and in tropical forests. We measure the GHG emissions from the land conversion activities at provincial scale. Using Landsat images from three different periods (1990s, 2000s and 2012), we classified LULC of the Riau Province, which is the largest oil palm producing region in Indonesia. A hybrid method of integration, generated by combining automatic processing and manual analysis, yields the best results. We found that the tropical rainforest cover decreased from ∼63% in the 1990s to ∼37% in the 2000s. By 2012, the remaining tropical rainforest cover was only ∼22%. From the 1990s to the 2000s, conversion of forests and peat lands was the primary source of emissions, total CO2 emitted to the atmosphere was estimated at ∼26.6 million tCO2.y-1, with 40.62% and 59.38% of the emissions from conversion of peat lands and forests, respectively. Between 2000 and 2012, the total CO2 emitted to the atmosphere was estimated at ∼5.2 million tCO2. y-1, with 69.94% and 27.62% of the emissions from converted peat lands and converted forests, respectively. The results show that in the Riau Province, the oil palm industry boomed in the period from 1990 to 2000, with transformation of tropical forest and peat land as the primary source of emissions. The decrease of CO2 emissions in the period from 2000 to 2012 is possibly due to the enforcement of a moratorium on deforestation. © 2013 Ramdani, Hino.

AB  - Microalgae are capable of synthesizing a multitude of compounds including biofuel precursors and other high value products such as omega-3-fatty acids. However, accurate analysis of the specific compounds produced by microalgae is important since slight variations in saturation and carbon chain length can affect the quality, and thus the value, of the end product. We present a method that allows for fast and reliable extraction of lipids and similar compounds from a range of algae, followed by their characterization using gas chromatographic analysis with a focus on biodiesel-relevant compounds. This method determines which range of biologically synthesized compounds is likely responsible for each fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced; information that is fundamental for identifying preferred microalgae candidates as a biodiesel source. Traditional methods of analyzing these precursor molecules are time intensive and prone to high degrees of variation between species and experimental conditions. Here we detail a new method which uses microwave energy as a reliable, single-step cell disruption technique to extract lipids from live cultures of microalgae. After extractable lipid characterization (including lipid type (free fatty acids, mono-, di- or tri-acylglycerides) and carbon chain length determination) by GC-FID, the same lipid extracts are transesterified into FAMEs and directly compared to total biodiesel potential by GC-MS. This approach provides insight into the fraction of total FAMEs derived from extractable lipids compared to FAMEs derived from the residual fraction (i.e. membrane bound phospholipids, sterols, etc.). This approach can also indicate which extractable lipid compound, based on chain length and relative abundance, is responsible for each FAME. This method was tested on three species of microalgae; the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the model Chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the freshwater green alga Chlorella vulgaris. The method is shown to be robust, highly reproducible, and fast, allowing for multiple samples to be analyzed throughout the time course of culturing, thus providing time-resolved information regarding lipid quantity and quality. Total time from harvesting to obtaining analytical results is less than 2. h. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work reviews and performs a meta-analysis of the recent life cycle assessment and flow analyses studies palm oil biodiesel. The best available data and information are extracted, summarized, and discussed. Most studies found palm oil biodiesel would produce positive energy balance with an energy ratio between 2.27 and 4.81, and with a net energy production of 112 GJ ha-1y-1. With the exception of a few studies, most conclude that palm oil biodiesel is a net emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). The origin of oil palm plantation (planted area) is the foremost determinant of GHG emissions and C payback time (CPBT). Converting peatland forest results in GHG emissions up to 60 tons CO2equivalent (eq) ha-1y-1 leading to 420 years of CPBT. In contrast, converting degraded land or grassland for plantation can positively offset the system to become a net sequester of 5 tons CO2eq ha-1y-1. Few studies have discussed cradle-to-grave environmental impacts such as acidification, eutrophication, toxicity, and biodiversity, which open opportunity for further studies.

AB  - Introduction. The molecular links between shock-response and adaptation remain poorly understood, particularly for extremophiles. This has hindered rational engineering of solvent tolerance and correlated traits (e.g., productivity) in extremophiles. To untangle such molecular links, here we established a model that tracked the microevolution from shock to adaptation in thermophilic bacteria. Method. Temporal dynamics of genomes and transcriptomes was tracked for Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514 which under increasing exogenous ethanol evolved from ethanol-sensitive wild-type (Strain X) to tolerance of 2%- (XI) and eventually 6%-ethanol (XII). Based on the reconstructed transcriptional network underlying stress tolerance, genetic engineering was employed to improve ethanol tolerance and production in Thermoanaerobacter. Results: The spontaneous genome mutation rate (μg) of Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, calculated at 0.045, suggested a higher mutation rate in thermophile than previously thought. Transcriptomic comparison revealed that shock-response and adaptation were distinct in nature, whereas the transcriptomes of XII resembled those of the extendedly shocked X. To respond to ethanol shock, X employed fructose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS), Arginine Deiminase (ADI) pathway, alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and a distinct mechanism of V-type ATPase. As an adaptation to exogenous ethanol, XI mobilized resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux system and Adh, whereas X II, which produced higher ethanol than XI, employed ECF-type 24, an alcohol catabolism operon and phase-specific heat-shock proteins (Hsps), modulated hexose/pentose-transport operon structure and reinforced membrane rigidity. Exploiting these findings, we further showed that ethanol productivity and tolerance can be improved simultaneously by overexpressing adh or 24 in X. Conclusion: Our work revealed thermophilic-bacteria specific features of adaptive evolution and demonstrated a rational strategy to engineer co-evolving industrial traits. As improvements of shock-response, stress tolerance and productivity have been crucial aims in industrial applications employing thermophiles, our findings should be valuable not just to the production of ethanol but also to a wide variety of biofuels and biochemicals. © 2013 Lin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Although biofuels are seen as a viable option for partially replacing fossil fuels in the transportation sector, their widespread application raises questions about their potential economic, societal and environmental impacts. This article illustrates the application of a sustainability evaluation methodology to biofuels throughout their supply chain based on sustainability indicators. Five indicators (LCEE, FER, GW, LUI, and CSCE) were selected for the analysis, taking into account the information available in the open literature, and the availability of data to calculate them. Biodiesel and bioethanol from common feedstocks are compared with each other and with fossil diesel and gasoline, their main competitors, with the goal of identifying which ones are better from a sustainability point of view. Results show that ethanol from sugarcane is the most sustainable option, even when compared with dominant fossil fuels; while no feedstock for biodiesel production emerges as a better option. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a life cycle assessment of synthetic paraffinic kerosene produced from Jatropha curcas. The feedstock is grown in an intercropping arrangement with pasture grasses so that Jatropha is coproduced with cattle. Additional innovations are introduced including hybrid seeds, detoxification of jatropha seedcake, and cogeneration. Two fuel pathways are examined including a newly developed catalytic decarboxylation process. Sensitivities are examined including higher planting density at the expense of cattle production as well as 50% lower yields. Intercropping with pasture and detoxifying seedcake yield coproducts that are expected to relieve pressure on Brazil's forests and indirectly reduce environmental impacts of biofuel production. Other innovations also reduce impacts. Results of the baseline assessment indicate that innovations would reduce impacts relative to the fossil fuel reference scenario in most categories including 62-75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 64-82% reduction in release of ozone depleting chemicals, 33-52% reduction in smog-forming pollutants, 6-25% reduction in acidification, and 60-72% reduction in use of nonrenewable energy. System expansion, which explicitly accounts for avoided deforestation, results in larger improvements. Results are robust across allocation methodologies, improve with higher planting density, and persist if yield is reduced by half. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Some argue that peak conventional oil production is imminent due to physical resource scarcity. We examine the alternative possibility of reduced oil use due to improved efficiency and oil substitution. Our model uses historical relationships to project future demand for (a) transport services, (b) all liquid fuels, and (c) substitution with alternative energy carriers, including electricity. Results show great increases in passenger and freight transport activity, but less reliance on oil. Demand for liquids inputs to refineries declines significantly after 2070. By 2100 transport energy demand rises >1000% in Asia, while flattening in North America (+23%) and Europe (-20%). Conventional oil demand declines after 2035, and cumulative oil production is 1900 Gbbl from 2010 to 2100 (close to the U.S. Geological Survey median estimate of remaining oil, which only includes projected discoveries through 2025). These results suggest that effort is better spent to determine and influence the trajectory of oil substitution and efficiency improvement rather than to focus on oil resource scarcity. The results also imply that policy makers should not rely on liquid fossil fuel scarcity to constrain damage from climate change. However, there is an unpredictable range of emissions impacts depending on which mix of substitutes for conventional oil gains dominance - oil sands, electricity, coal-to-liquids, or others. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of woody bioenergy crops as an alternative energy source, there is need for a more comprehensive understanding of their carbon cycling and their allocation patterns throughout the lifespan. We therefore quantified the net ecosystem production (NEP) of a poplar (. Populus) short rotation coppice (SRC) culture in Flanders during its second growing season.Eddy covariance (EC) techniques were applied to obtain the annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the plantation. Further, by applying a component-flux-based approach NEP was calculated as the difference between the modelled gross photosynthesis and the respiratory fluxes from foliage, stem and soil obtained via upscaling from chamber measurements. A combination of biomass sampling, inventories and upscaling techniques was used to determine NEP via a pool-change-based approach.Across the three approaches, the net carbon balance ranged from 96 to 199gm-2y-1 indicating a significant net carbon uptake by the SRC culture. During the establishment year the SRC culture was a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, but already during the second growing season there was a significant net uptake. Both the component-flux-based and pool-change-based approaches resulted in higher values (47-108%) than the EC-estimation of NEE, though the results were comparable considering the considerable and variable uncertainty levels involved in the different approaches. The efficient biomass production - with the highest part of the total carbon uptake allocated to the aboveground wood - led the poplars to counterbalance the soil carbon losses resulting from land use change in a short period of time. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Faced with the twin challenges of anthropogenic climate change and 'peak oil', the need for an urgent and radical transformation of transport energy has been widely recognised. Adopting a neo-Polanyian economic sociology approach, this article asks what conditions European governance capacity to respond to these challenges, at either national or regional levels, using biofuels as a case study. It asks if the complexity of its political institutions, and the heterogeneity of interests and economic organisations, present 'the biggest obstacle of all' (Cohen 2007) to reduce fossil fuel dependency. By examining the European Commission level and comparing five countries, evidence is produced for a political failure in terms of continued fossil fuel dependency. Incumbent interests in the agricultural sector and a distinctively European legacy of a transport fleet dependent on fossil diesel, have led to a marriage of convenience between rapeseed farmers and vehicle manufacturers. As a consequence, rather than escaping from the path dependency on fossil fuels (Unruh 2000), Europe has gone down a cul-de-sac of rapeseed biodiesel inherently limited in scope, and with the low levels of greenhouse gas emissions savings. Ironically this outcome is in part an unintended consequence of opposition to biofuels from environmentalist groups and politics. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The US Midwest is an important area of first generation biofuels, accounting for 80-90% of US corn and soybean production (2009-2011). However, there are potential adverse impacts of biofuel production on water resources in this area. The objective of this study was to assess potential impacts of biofuel production on water resources by exploring relationships between hydrologic changes and climate and land surface changes based on long-term (~1930s-2010) stream gage and climate data from 55 unregulated watersheds in the US Midwest. Long-term trends in climate (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) and flow were evaluated. Sensitivity of changes in annual streamflow and baseflow to climate was evaluated using climate elasticity (sensitivity) and the residuals were attributed to land surface changes. Results show that streamflow increased significantly (. p<. 0.05) in 35% (19/55) of watersheds (median 2.4. ±. 0.3. mm/year), baseflow increased in 58% of watersheds (median 1.1. ±. 0.4. mm/year), and baseflow index (baseflow/streamflow, BFI) increased in 42% of watersheds (median 0.2. ±. 0.1%/year). Overall, climatic variability contributed more than land surface change to streamflow change (61. ±. 19% vs. 40. ±. 18%), while land surface change contributed much more to baseflow (74. ±. 10% vs. 27. ±. 10%; 2.7 times higher) and to BFI (119. ±. 14% vs. 27. ±. 18%; 4.4 times higher) than climate change. Watersheds (25/55, 45%) with no significant trend in climate but with significant flow trends provide direct evidence that the Midwest land surface change (cropping system and related land management) significantly impacted flow processes. Restricting analysis to these watersheds shows that land surface change contributed 2.0 times more than climate variability/change to streamflow change, 3.2 times more to baseflow change, and 7.7 times more to BFI change. The importance of past land surface changes on hydrology suggests that any future land surface changes, such as biofuel expansion or changing biofuel feedstocks, should consider impacts on the hydrology. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Whereas the new stakes on lignocellulosic biomass are often demand-oriented (heat, electricity, biofuels, etc.) mainly through public policies, the new equilibrium will depend also on the supply side. This supply has to be understood as socio-economic and environmental targets combining many topics: multi resources (agriculture, forest, "dedicated coppices", by-products and wastes), available/potential quantities and costs, localisation, replacement/substitution effects (activities, lands), and supply side stakeholders' behaviours. Many initiatives have been launched to grasp those dimensions through projects (National Research Agency, French Environment and Energy Management Agency, etc.). Many figures exist on the biomass assessment aspect but they are not clear enough and not comparable due to differences in definitions, scopes, data, parameters, geographical levels, reporting units, time-scale, etc. Regarding the characterisation of biomass supply chains, evaluations are often incomplete and lack methodological references. This article aims to focus on methodological key points and barriers to overcome, in order to get a better evaluation and understanding of biomass mobilisation expected by potential users and public authorities. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - Macroalgae commonly found in the ocean around Hawaii were collected from near shore locations and their potential as biomass feedstock for fermentative ethanol was investigated. A green alga, Ulva reticulata, was selected for further analysis. This species forms large complex structures that grow quickly and has high dry biomass percentage (20%), soluble carbohydrates (18%), and high total carbohydrates along with low quantities of lignin (13%). During acid saccharification, it was determined that 49% of the total mass was observed as sugars in the hydrolysate; however, fermentation was problematic. Enzymatic saccharification using cellulase from Trichoderma reesei was attempted which recovered a measured maximum of 20% glucose based on the initial dry mass. Fermentation successfully converted all the glucose to ethanol. The measured ethanol yield corresponded to approximately 90 L per tonne of dried macroalgae. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Use of lignocellulosic crop harvest residues for liquid or gaseous biofuel production may impact soil quality, long-term soil fertility and the major determinants of the latter, stocks of soil organic carbon and nutrients. When soil organic carbon stocks of mineral cropland soils are to be maintained, there is scope for the removal of lignocellulosic harvest residues in several systems with much reduced tillage or no tillage. The scope for such removal might be increased when suitably treated residues from the conversion of harvest residues into biofuel are returned to cropland soils. For mineral cropland soils under conventional tillage, the scope for the production of liquid biofuels from harvest residues is likely to be less than in the case of no-till systems. When fertility of cropland soils is to be sustainable, nutrients present in suitably treated biofuel production residues have to be returned to these soils. Apparently, the actual return of carbon and nutrients present in residues of biofuel production from crop harvest residues to arable soils currently predominantly concerns the application of digestates of anaerobic digestion. The effects thereof on soil fertility and quality need further clarification. Further clarification about the effects on soil fertility and quality of chars and of co-products of lignocellulosic ethanol production is also needed. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Microalgae hold promise for the production of sustainable replacement of fossil fuels due to their high growth rates, ability to grow on non-arable land and their high content, under the proper conditions, of high energy compounds that can be relatively easily chemically converted to fuels using existing technology. However, projected large-scale algal production raises a number of sustainability concerns concerning land use, net energy return, water use and nutrient supply. The state-of-the-art of algal production of biofuels is presented with emphasis on some possible avenues to provide answers to the sustainability questions that have been raised. Here, issues concerning algal strains and supply of nutrients for large-scale production are discussed. Since sustainability concerns necessitate the use of wastewaters for supply of bulk nutrients, emphasis is placed on the composition and suitability of different wastewater streams. At the same time, algal cultivation has proven useful in waste treatment processes, and thus this aspect is also treated in some detail. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Since the turn of the century, biofuels have been promoted not only for their potential to mitigate climate change and address energy security but also for the potential benefits to socio-ecological systems. However, the purported benefits were almost immediately called into question as evidence began to emerge of the potential negative consequences of biofuel production. Recent debates have highlighted the social impacts, particularly land access and food security, yet much of the academic literature on these social impacts remains in high level. This paper identifies peer-reviewed literature that documents the social impacts of biofuel expansion at the local (household and community) scale. A systematic review identified just seventeen research papers that presented evidence of the local livelihood impacts of biofuel production and processing. Three issues emerge from the review as especially important at the local level: household economics, food security and ecosystem services. Within the research, there is a bias towards the cultivation of Jatropha curcas in particular geographies (Africa and Asia). The evidence also shows that the costs and benefits are unevenly distributed within and between communities, with consequences for the ways in which social, economic and environmental impacts are experienced. We conclude by arguing that more evidence on the impacts of biofuels at the local level is desperately needed in order to demystify this complex issue and stimulate a more nuanced understanding of the winners and losers of this commodity. © 2013 The Author(s) Geography Compass © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In this article, we discuss some key aspects of biofuel production in developing countries, and where constraints and tradeoffs are likely to occur. We use the example of two countries, Senegal and India, to highlight some of the issues of cost competitiveness, problems with ensuring stable supply of feedstock as well as critical missing links in the biofuels value chain that pose problems to scaling up national programs in these countries. We discuss the particularly problematic nature of jatropha, as a biodiesel feedstock, and underline some helpful guiding principles that can help country-level policy. We point to an underlying "duality" between a well-functioning food system and favorable conditions for agribusiness enterprises, such as biofuels, and the relevance it has to achieving food security goals. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Being the two largest ethanol producers in the world, biofuel policies in Brazil and the United States affect both their domestic markets and the global food and biofuel economy. In this article we develop a price endogenous mathematical programming model to simulate and analyze the impacts of biofuel mandates and trade distortions on land use, agricultural commodity and transportation fuel markets, and global environment. We find that an 80% increase in total biofuel production from its 103 billion liter baseline level to the mandated 183 billion liter level in 2022 can be achieved with less than 2% increase in total cropland use in both countries. In the United States, this would occur with cellulosic biofuels meeting nearly half of the biofuels consumed and produced largely on cropland pasture and corn ethanol meeting the rest of the mandate and resulting in a 2% increase in corn price. In Brazil, the expansion in sugarcane production would be achieved by reducing land under pasture and a marginal increase in intensification of livestock production. In the aggregate, biofuel policies increase economic surplus in both countries by 1% and redistribute the benefits from agricultural consumers to agricultural producers and the fuel sector. Finally, we also find that full implementation of the mandates in North America, China, and the European Union would reduce the global life-cycle global greenhouse gas emissions by about 5%. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - This study aims to quantify water appropriation and the potential production of algal bio-oil using freshwater and municipal wastewater effluent (MWW) as an alternative water resource. The county-level analysis focuses on open-pond algae cultivation systems located in 17 states in the southern United States. Several scenarios were developed to examine the water availability for algae bio-oil production under various water resource mixing MWW and freshwater. The results of the analysis indicate that water availability can significantly affect the selection of an algal refinery site and therefore the potential production of algal bio-oil. The production of one liter of algal bio-oil requires 1036-1666L of water at the state level, in which 3% to 91% can be displaced by MWW, depending on the biorefinery location. This water requirement corresponds to a total of 25billion liters of bio-oil produced if the spatially and temporally available MWW effluent together with 10% of total available freshwater are used. The production of algal bio-oil is only 14% of estimated production under the assumption that all of the water demand can be fulfilled without any restriction. In addition, if only the spatially and temporally available effluent is used as the sole source of water, the total bio-oil production is estimated to be 9 billion liters. This study not only quantifies the water demands of the algal bio-oil, but it also elucidates the importance of taking water sustainability into account in the development of algal bio-oil. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: The economic viability of the intensive land-based cultivation of Ulva lactuca for biofuels (biogas and co-generation) was ascertained using a bioeconomic model developed for the Australian context. The cost assumptions, technical variables and biological parameters were sourced extensively from published literature. Results: Biogas production and the sale of electricity as a standalone business model was unprofitable at the current feed-in tariff due to high electricity generation costs of US0.44 kWh-1 for even the largest macroalgal production facility size of 400 ha (AU:US = 0.9369; 1 June 2011). Conclusion: As this is a prefeasibility study, it is largely literature based with some engineering estimates; therefore, this model needs validation with actual field data from a commercial-scale production facility. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Background: This paper gives insight into whether biofuels for road transport can play an important role in a Swedish county in the year 2030, and contributes to knowledge on how to perform similar studies. Methodology: A resource-focused assessment, including feedstock from the waste sector, agricultural sector, forestry sector and aquatic environments, partially considering technological and economic constraints. Results: Two scenarios were used indicating that biofuels could cover almost 30 and 50%, respectively, of total energy demand for road transport. Conclusion: Without compromising food security, this study suggests that it is possible to significantly increase biofuel production, and to do this as an integrated part of existing society, thereby also contributing to positive societal synergies. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Cyanobacteria represent a globally important biomass because they are responsible for a substantial proportion of primary production in the hydrosphere. Arthrospira platensis is a fast-growing halophilic cyanobacterium capable of accumulating glycogen and has the potential to serve as a feedstock in the fermentative production of third-generation biofuels. Accordingly, enhancing cyanobacterial glycogen production is a promising biofuel production strategy. However, the regulatory mechanism of glycogen metabolism in cyanobacteria is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the metabolic flux of glycogen biosynthesis using a dynamic metabolomic approach. Time-course profiling of widely targeted cyanobacterial metabolic intermediates demonstrated a global metabolic reprogramming that involves transient increases in the levels of some amino acids during the glycogen production phase induced by nitrate depletion. Also, in vivo labelling with NaH13CO3 enabled direct measurement of metabolic intermediate turnover in A. platensis, revealing that under conditions of nitrate depletion glycogen is biosynthesized with carbon derived from amino acids released from proteins via gluconeogenesis. This dynamic metabolic profiling approach provided conclusive evidence of temporal alterations in the metabolic profile in cyanobacterial cells. © The Author(2) [2013].

AB  - This article provides an overview of Brazilian and Chinese agricultural development cooperation activities in Ethiopia. Development cooperation is carefully managed and coordinated in Ethiopia, a highly aid-dependent country, in line with the national 'Growth and Transformation Plan'. The government promotes harmonisation and an alignment process of Western donor support through the Ethiopian High Level Forum. Brazil and China are currently not engaged in these coordination platforms, working instead on a bilateral basis. Core activities include experience-sharing in public governance, technical cooperation, and the attraction of private and public investments. In the case of Brazil, the cooperation focuses on renewable energy sector development mainly related to biofuels derived from sugar cane production, whilst in the case of China, cooperation is more focused on infrastructure, agricultural technology and skill transfer. The approach adopted by Ethiopia reflects a commitment to a 'developmental state' approach. This seems to be delivering results in the agricultural sector, and beyond. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The extensive under-used area of roadsides along public highways could readily provide valuable environmental, economic, and cultural benefits for society. Furthermore, local food sources are an increasing priority as energy and environmental costs of long-distance transport increase. This article highlights the central goals and principles for introducing food production in roadsides. Seven types of roadside cultivation are considered: market vegetables, grain, fodder, orchard, biofuel, compost, and livestock. Principles important for incorporating food production into roadsides include: location relative to adjacent land uses; wildlife movement and biodiversity; site topography and hydrology; and arrangement of crops based on roadside pollutant concentrations. Potential problems and their solutions are examined, such as: a swale and remediation system for stormwater and aerial pollutants; a banded vegetation pattern with inedible crops close to the road and edible crops farther from the road; and strategically locating trees to narrow the perceived highway width for enhanced driver safety. Major benefits of roadside production include providing additional farmland for farmers, vegetation design that facilitates wildlife movement and reduces the effects of habitat fragmentation, a cultural symbol of productivity in a highly visible landscape, local food for markets and eateries, carbon sequestration, and multi-use right-of-way biodiversity and landscape management. A case study uses the goals and principles pinpointed to outline a specific design strategy for inserting diverse agriculture along 30km of highway (MA I-495) outside Boston, Massachusetts (USA). Now, widespread designs and pilot projects are needed to initiate the next generation of our roadsides, where public appreciation for local food production, multiple uses of infrastructure, and the landscape's wildlife heritage become the norm.

AB  - Unlike most biofuel species, Jatropha curcas has promise for use in marginal lands, but it may serve an additional role by stabilizing soils. We evaluated the growth and structural responsiveness of young J. curcas plants to diverse soil conditions. Soils included a sand, a sandy-loam, and a clay-loam from eastern Mexico. Growth and structural parameters were analyzed for shoots and roots, although the focus was the plasticity of the primary root system architecture (the taproot and four lateral roots). The sandy soil reduced the growth of both shoot and root systems significantly more than sandy-loam or clay-loam soils; there was particularly high plasticity in root and shoot thickness, as well as shoot length. However, the architecture of the primary root system did not vary with soil type; the departure of the primary root system from an index of perfect symmetry was 14±5% (mean ± standard deviation). Although J. curcas developed more extensively in the sandy-loam and clay-loam soils than in sandy soil, it maintained a consistent root to shoot ratio and root system architecture across all types of soil. This strong genetic determination would make the species useful for soil stabilization purposes, even while being cultivated primarily for seed oil. © 2013 Ofelia Andrea Valdés-Rodríguez et al.

AB  - Instruments used to regulate the consumption of oil in the transport sector include fuel taxes, biofuel requirements, and fuel-efficiency standards. However, the effects that these have on oil consumption and price vary. If market power is present in the oil market, the directions of change in consumption and price might contrast with those in a competitive market. As a result, the market structure affects not only the effectiveness of the policy instruments used to reduce oil consumption, but also the terms of trade and carbon leakage. In particular, reduced oil consumption, as a result of increased fuel-efficiency standards, will unambiguously increase the price of oil under a monopoly. © The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2013.

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic, cellulolytic anaerobe that is a candidate microorganism for industrial biofuels production. Strains with mutations in genes associated with production of l-lactate (Δldh) and/or acetate (Δpta) were characterized to gain insight into the intracellular processes that convert cellobiose to ethanol and other fermentation end-products. Cellobiose-grown cultures of the Δldh strain had identical biomass accumulation, fermentation end-products, transcription profile, and intracellular metabolite concentrations compared to its parent strain (DSM1313 Δhpt Δspo0A). The Δpta-deficient strain grew slower and had 30 % lower final biomass concentration compared to the parent strain, yet produced 75 % more ethanol. A Δldh Δpta double-mutant strain evolved for faster growth had a growth rate and ethanol yield comparable to the parent strain, whereas its biomass accumulation was comparable to Δpta. Free amino acids were secreted by all examined strains, with both Δpta strains secreting higher amounts of alanine, valine, isoleucine, proline, glutamine, and threonine. Valine concentration for Δldh Δpta reached 5 mM by the end of growth, or 2.7 % of the substrate carbon utilized. These secreted amino acid concentrations correlate with increased intracellular pyruvate concentrations, up to sixfold in the Δpta and 16-fold in the Δldh Δpta strain. We hypothesize that the deletions in fermentation end-product pathways result in an intracellular redox imbalance, which the organism attempts to relieve, in part by recycling NADP+ through increased production of amino acids. © 2013 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion has been widely used to enhance biogas production of digesters and, therefore, to improve the anaerobic plants economic feasibility. In the present study, glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, was used as a co-substrate for pig manure. The results showed that the thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure supplemented with 3% of glycerol, on weight basis, was satisfactory. The specific biogas production of the co-digester was 180% higher than the one obtained by the reference digester, which was only fed with pig manure. The improvement was related to the double of the organic loading rate, the high biodegradability of the crude glycerol, the slight reduction of the free ammonia concentration and the optimisation of the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Moreover, the analysis of the organic matter (protein, lipids, carbohydrates and fibers) of the influent and the effluent of both digesters together with their biogas flow rates indicated that the microorganisms in the co-digester obtained large amounts of nutrients from the glycerol, whereas the microorganisms of the reference digester mainly produced biogas from the particulate matter. However, the digestate obtained from the co-digester cannot be directly applied as soil fertiliser or conditioner due to the presence of high levels of biodegradable matter, which may exert negative impacts on the plant-soil system. Thus, a longer hydraulic retention time, a reduction of the glycerol concentration and/or a post-treatment is required if the digestate is to be used as soil fertiliser or conditioner. In contrast, pig manure digestate can be directly applied on land. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the effect of pollinator exclusion, self-pollination, cross-pollination and individual visits of the stingless bee Frieseomelitta nigra and the honey bee Apis mellifera on fruit set and weight of fruit and seed of J. curcas. We compared the relative abundance of both bee species on flowers and whether their attributes (ratio of male to female flowers, nectar quantity and quality) affect bee visitation rates. Finally, we sampled various plantations to analyze whether the proportion of forest surrounding a site affects bee abundance and diversity. Significant higher rates of fruit set were obtained from open, cross-pollinated, F. nigra and A. mellifera visited flowers compared to self-pollinated and non-pollinated ones revealing the importance of bees for fruit production. Frieseomelitta nigra and A. mellifera had a similar effect on fruit set and quality, but the former was significantly more abundant on the crop suggesting a better pollinator performance. Male flowers were significantly more visited than female ones by both bee species in spite of their similar amounts of nectar and sugar. The proportion of forest in the surrounding matrix had a positive correlation with bee diversity and abundance on plantations. Our results indicate that preserving patches of forest around the plantations may increase the presence of native bees on Jatropha flowers and ensure sustainable levels of pollination. © 2013 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Duckweed, a small floating aquatic plant, is a novel bioenergy crop with great potential to accumulate starch. Three factors involved in the growth and starch accumulation of duckweed were investigated in the field: population, harvesting frequency and nutrient supply. Under identical conditions, Landoltia S3 had the highest maximum growth rate at 30.35g/m2/week; Lemna P1 had the highest N and P absorption rates at 0.622gN/m2/week and 0.135gP/m2/week, respectively; Landoltia OT had the highest starch accumulation rate at 3.88g/m2/week. The protein and P contents in each population decreased as the growth rate slowed. Different harvesting frequencies resulted in different growth rates. However, their biomass had almost the same composition. The addition of 15, 30 and 45ppm NH4+-N inhibited the growth of duckweed. The addition of CaO or microelements dramatically increased duckweed growth. By adding microelements, duckweed could grow in cold weather for an increased time period. With pond water and no sediment supply, duckweed reached the highest starch content of 52.9% with the lowest growth rate, which was the highest starch content in duckweed in the field in literatures. Starch content was negatively correlated with the growth rate, protein and P contents, which suggests that a high growth rate and high starch content in duckweed could hardly be acquired simultaneously. According to this systemic study, an operation process for harvesting high starch duckweed was proposed, paving the way for the large scale exploitation and application of duckweed in bioenergy and feed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacterial glycogen has gained interest as a valuable biomass feedstock for biofuel production. However, an ideal method for native glycogen quantification has not been developed. Here, we have proposed a simple methodology that enables the quantitative determination of cyanobacterial glycogen concentration with high repeatability using aqueous size-exclusion chromatography with a differential refractive index detector (SEC/RID). Our SEC/RID system also allows size distributions for native glycogen based on hydrodynamic volumes (Vh), which is proportional to the product of the molecular mass (M) and intrinsic viscosity [η], obtained by universal calibration using linear homopolymers of known M with Mark-Houwink-Sakurada parameters. The universal calibration curve achieved a broad linear range (Vh parameter [η]M=2×102-8×108mLg-1) with a high correlation coefficient (R2=0.9942), because the developed system is equipped with an OHpak SB-806M HQ aqueous column containing four types of polyhydroxy methacrylate-based particles with different particle and pore sizes. Based on the SEC/RID system, response of molecular size distribution of glycogen in microalgae to the cultivation condition was first observed. Our established SEC/RID method has several advantages over conventional techniques, including the simultaneous quantitative and size distribution analyses of glycogen, and represents a potentially useful tool to elucidate the relationship between structural properties and the roles of glycogen in metabolism. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel substitution for fossil fuels has been recommended in the literature and promoted in many countries; however, there are concerns about its economic viability. In this paper we focus on the cost-effectiveness of fuels, i.e., we compare the social costs of biofuels and fossil fuels for a functional unit defined as 1km of vehicle transportation. We base our empirical results on a case study in Vietnam and compare two biofuels and their alternative fossil fuels: ethanol and gasoline, and biodiesel and diesel with a focus on the blends of E5 and E10 for ethanol, and B5 and B10 for biodiesel. At the discount rate of 4%, ethanol substitution for gasoline in form of E5 or E10 saves 33% of the social cost of gasoline if the fuel consumption of E5 and E10 is the same as gasoline. The ethanol substitution will be cost-effective if the fuel consumption of E5 and E10, in terms of Lkm-1, is not exceeding the consumption of gasoline by more than 1.7% and 3.5% for E5 and E10 respectively. The biodiesel substitution would be cost-effective if the fuel consumption of B5 and B10, in terms of Lkm-1 compared to diesel, would decrease by more than 1.4% and 2.8% for B5 and B10 respectively at the discount rate of 4%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The large flow of reactive nitrogen (N) through agriculture causes negative environmental impacts, pointing to a need for changes in agricultural practices. At the same time, agriculture is expected to provide biomass to support the increasing demand from the UK bioenergy sector. A high-level aggregated model of the agricultural system in the UK was developed, which maintains the existing level of food and livestock production and at the same time increases N recirculation. Integrating three different bioenergy sub-systems into the agricultural system was an essential component of the model development. Cellulosic bioenergy crops were located in the landscape as vegetation filters to intercept and capture N and thereby reduce N leaching. Efficient collection and digestion of manure produced organic N fertiliser and biogas. Efficient forage production for cattle allowed further cultivation of bioenergy plants. Five implementation scenarios were developed to clarify the contribution of these bioenergy sub-systems to improved N management. The results point to a significant potential for improving the productive use of reactive N and for decreasing N losses to water and air. The interception and recirculation of N presently leaching from arable fields is assessed as the most important option. It is also important to increase recirculation of N in manure and in bioenergy system by-flows. Besides mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture these measures reduce the requirements for newly synthesised N fertilisers. A systems perspective on N, agriculture, and bioenergy systems facilitates N recirculation and promotes effective N use, reducing the need for additional N inputs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To meet the U.S. government goals for cellulosic biofuel production, more than 300 million metric tons of lignocellulosic feedstock must be collected annually by 2022. Perennial grasses, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), are expected to play a vital role in meeting these biomass demands. Determining optimum nitrogen fertilization practices and harvest timing will be essential to maximize yields, ensure stand longevity, and optimize feedstock quality. A field experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2012 at six locations in Illinois to determine the effect that N source (urea and slow-release N), N application rate (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224kgNha-1), and harvest timing (late summer, late fall, and early spring) have on above ground biomass yield and quality. The nitrogen source generally had no effect on biomass yield, moisture content or composition. Biomass yields increased with increasing N rates at each harvest timing with the highest yields occurring with 224, 168, and 112kgNha-1 for summer (12.9Mgha-1), fall (9.0Mgha-1), and spring (6.7Mgha-1) harvests, respectively. Moisture content was not affected by N rate and steadily decreased with delayed harvest timings. In general, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents were highest and lignin, protein and ash contents lowest when plots received 56kgNha-1 at all harvest timings. Based on this study, we recommend applying N fertilizer at 56 to 112kgNha-1 and harvesting from late fall to early spring to optimize switchgrass production in Illinois. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intercropping biofuel feedstocks in managed forests of the southeastern United States is a potentially sustainable source of renewable energy. Ecological effects of energy crops in forests are poorly understood, and it is unknown whether the ecological role of native rodents is influenced by alternative food resources. Therefore, we used a stable isotope analysis to compare diet and trophic responses of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in 1) plots where switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a C4 plant, was intercropped with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), a C3 plant, 2) plots of loblolly pine, and 3) plots of monocropped switchgrass. We collected fur from live-trapped rodents and potential dietary sources in 2010. We predicted δ13C and δ15N values of mice in switchgrass plots would reflect a C4-based, granivorous, diet if there was an effect of intercropping on the functional role of mice. Del13C values of mouse fur in monocropped switchgrass, but not intercropped switchgrass plots, shifted more toward a C4 signal. However, δ15N values indicated that mice remained functionally omnivorous across treatments. Our results were supported by isotope values from invertebrates across guilds. Diet and trophic position of white-footed mice was not influenced by intercropping switchgrass in pine plantations indicating they maintained their functional role in this biofuels management regime. Future research should focus on individual and population responses of rodents to altered vegetation structure where biofuels feedstocks are grown and indirect effects on inter- and intra-species interactions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Syagrus romanzoffiana is a palm species from the Arecaceae family, commonly known in Brazil as Jerivá. Its fruit is a drupe, global or oval with rigid endocarp that contains a high seed oil content, 52% (w/w) on a wet basis. This study analyzed Jerivá oil composition with regard to fatty acids and some physical-chemical properties related to its quality, aiming at using this oil as a raw material to produce biodiesel. The oil extracted is mainly composed of saturated fatty acids. The quality parameters of the Jerivá oil are in accordance with the European regulations, ASTM and Brazilian standards. Preliminary production tests revealed that the S. romanzoffiana oil is a viable alternative for the production of biodiesel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the fuel-chain greenhouse gas balance and farm economics of hemp grown for bioenergy with two perennial bioenergy crops, Miscanthus and willow, and two more traditional annual bioenergy crops, sugar beet and oil seed rape (OSR). The GHG burden of hemp cultivation is intermediate between perennial and traditional annual energy crops, but net fuel chain GHG abatement potential of 11t/CO2 eq./ha/year in the mid yield estimate is comparable to perennial crops, and 140% and 540% greater than for OSR and sugar beet fuel chains, respectively. Gross margins from hemp were considerably lower than for OSR and sugar beet, but exceeded those from Miscanthus when organic fertilizers were used and in the absence of establishment grants for the latter crop. Extrapolated up to the EU scale, replacing 25% of OSR and sugar beet production with hemp production could increase net GHG abatement by up to 21MtCO2eq./year. Hemp is a considerably more efficient bioenergy feedstock than the dominant annual energy crops. Integrated into food crop rotations, hemp need not compete with food supplies, and could provide an appealing option to develop more sustainable non-transport bioenergy supply chains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Consumption of ethanol in the United States has increased rapidly over the last few years, fueled by both higher crude oil prices and generous public support measures for renewable fuels. The contribution of ethanol to the transport energy mix varies markedly by state. Heterogeneity in ethanol adoption and market development is investigated using a hierarchical, spatiotemporal model. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed for estimation of the proposed flexible model structure. Besides spatial dependence among neighboring states, differential inclusion rates of ethanol are found to be largely determined by national- and state-level biofuel incentive policies, relative gasoline prices, feedstock availability, household median income, MTBE bans, and density of fuel retail infrastructure. Our findings imply that increasing renewable fuel support as well as investing in extending the transportation and fuel retail infrastructure can result in higher ethanol consumption. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomethane is an energy vector suitable for renewable transport fuel which may derive energy through three different methodologies: thermal gasification; biological anaerobic digestion; and conversion of electricity to hydrogen (via electrolysis) and on to methane as described by the Sabatier Equation. Thermal gasification to produce methane (based on " hard" feed stock) tends to require significant scale, of the order of 400 MW. Biological anaerobic digestion (based on " soft" feed stock) is typically of scale less than 1 MW. Systems based on the Sabatier Equation convert hydrogen to methane exothermically and sequester carbon. The resource is assessed at 19% of energy in transport in Ireland. Adopting the approach of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (for example double credit for biofuels from residues and lignocellulosic feed stock) biomethane can supply 40% renewable energy supply in transport (RES-T). The resource is sufficient to supply 30% of the private transport fleet with indigenous sustainable gaseous biofuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It has been recognized that oils derived from microorganism and wastewater sludge are comparable replacements of traditional biodiesel production feedstock, which is energy intensive and costly. Energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are essential factors to assess the feasibility of the production. This study evaluated the energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel production from microbial and wastewater sludge oil. The results show that energy balance and GHG emissions of biodiesel produced from microbial oil are significantly impacted by the cultivation methods and carbon source. For phototrophic microorganism (microalgae), open pond system gives 3.6 GJ higher energy gain than photo bioreactor system in per tonne biodiesel produced. For heterotrophic microorganisms, the energy balance depends on the type of carbon source. Three carbon sources including starch, cellulose, and starch industry wastewater (SIW) used in this study showed that utilization of SIW as carbon source provided the most favorable energy balance. When oil extracted from municipal sludge is used for biodiesel production, the energy gain is up to 29.7 GJ per tonne biodiesel produced, which is higher than the energy gain per tonne of biodiesel produced from SIW cultivated microbes. GHG emissions study shows that biodiesel production from microbes or sludge oil is a net carbon dioxide capture process except when starch is used as raw material for microbial oil production, and the highest capture is around 40 tonnes carbon dioxide per tonne of biodiesel produced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The marine transportation sector, responsible for consuming a large amount of degraded fuel oil, is one of the major contributors to global warming and air pollution. These effects are responsible for a large number of premature deaths in the US and throughout the world. The international regulation known as the 2008 MARPOL Annex VI Amendment, which is enforced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has imposed progressively more stringent limits on emissions from marine vessels. Biodiesel, an environmentally friendly, renewable, clean, and low-carbon fuel, is regarded as the most appropriate alternative fuel for marine vessels. However, the promotion of biodiesel use in water-borne transportation is considered to be a bigger challenge than its more successful development in land-based applications. The major obstacles to promoting biodiesel blends in marine transportation are examined in this study. The strategies proposed to overcome these obstacles include the comprehensive field testing of the biodiesel blends in marine vessels of various representative types, establishing a marine-grade biodiesel specification, increasing the price competitiveness of marine-grade biodiesel by reducing its manufacturing costs, providing tax cuts, exemptions, and government subsidies, increasing the amount of biodiesel use in marine applications, adopting compatible elastomers and metallic materials in fuel feeding systems and storage tanks, applying approaches or technologies suitable for improving the low-temperature fluidity of biodiesel blends, and increasing the added value of purified glycerol. The effective application of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biodiesel in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships, improving global air quality, protecting the ecological environment and improving people's health. © 2013.

AB  - Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a biofuel crop, which can be grown under tropical rainfed conditions without sacrificing food and fodder security. Three sweet sorghum cultivars (CSH 22 SS, NTJ 2 and ICSV 93046) with two row spacings (60 and 45cm) and six nitrogen levels (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150kgha-1) were grown on Vertisols during three post rainy (November to April) seasons at the ICRISAT center farm in Patancheru, India. The results showed that the row spacings (60 or 45cm) had no influence on performance of the cultivars. Sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22 SS produced the highest green stalk yield (45.4Mgha-1) and grain yield (2.33Mgha-1) compared to NTJ 2 (32.66Mgha-1 and 1.70Mgha-1) and ICSV 93046 (38.44Mgha-1 and 2.03Mgha-1). Net economic return from CSH 22 SS (US$681ha-1) was also significantly higher than that from NTJ 2 (US$ 415ha-1) and ICSV 93046 (US$ 539ha-1). All cultivars responded to applied N up to 150kgha-1; however beyond 90kgha-1N rate, the increase in yield was insignificant. Estimated N use efficiency (NUE) values indicated that 90kgNha-1 was an optimum N level for sweet sorghum crop. Simulated soil water balance components revealed that reduction in total transpiration due to water stress was 20 to 45% compared to the no-stress. In case of water use efficiency, CSH 22 SS showed the highest economic returns per unit volume of water input. Based on these results, it is concluded that sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22 SS at 90kgNha-1 is the best remunerative combination for maximizing yield, economic returns and resource use efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are touted as an attractive alternative to traditional forms of biomass for biofuel production, due to high productivity, ability to be cultivated on marginal lands, and potential to utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial flue gas. This work examines the fossil energy return on investment (EROIfossil), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and direct Water Demands (WD) of producing dried algal biomass through the cultivation of microalgae in Open Raceway Ponds (ORP) for 21 geographic locations in the contiguous United States (U.S.). For each location, comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for multiple microalgal biomass production pathways, consisting of a combination of cultivation and harvesting options. Results: Results indicate that the EROIfossil for microalgae biomass vary from 0.38 to 1.08 with life cycle GHG emissions of -46.2 to 48.9 (g CO2 eq/MJ-biomass) and direct WDs of 20.8 to 38.8 (Liters/MJ-biomass) over the range of scenarios analyzed. Further anaylsis reveals that the EROIfossil for production pathways is relatively location invariant, and that algae's life cycle energy balance and GHG impacts are highly dependent on cultivation and harvesting parameters. Contrarily, algae's direct water demands were found to be highly sensitive to geographic location, and thus may be a constraining factor in sustainable algal-derived biofuel production. Additionally, scenarios with promising EROIfossil and GHG emissions profiles are plagued with high technological uncertainty. Conclusions: Given the high variability in microalgae's energy and environmental performance, careful evaluation of the algae-to-fuel supply chain is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of emerging algal biofuel systems. Alternative production scenarios and technologies may have the potential to reduce the critical demands of biomass production, and should be considered to make algae a viable and more efficient biofuel alternative. © 2013 Zaimes and Khanna; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We quantify the impact of land-use change, determined by our growing demand for food and biofuel production, on isoprene emissions and subsequent atmospheric oxidant chemistry in 2015 and 2030, relative to 1990, ignoring compound climate change effects over that period. We estimate isoprene emissions from an ensemble (n=1000) of land-use change realizations from 1990-2050, broadly guided by the IPCC AR4/SRES scenarios A1 and B1. We also superimpose land-use change required to address projected biofuel usage using two scenarios: (1) assuming that world governments make no changes to biofuel policy after 2009, and (2) assuming that world governments develop biofuel policy with the aim of keeping equivalent atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm. We present the median and interquartile range (IQR) statistics of the ensemble and show that land-use change between &amp;minus;1.50 &amp;times; 1012 m 2 to +6.06 &amp;times; 1012 m2 was found to drive changes in the global isoprene burden of -3.5 to +2.8 Tg yr&amp;minus;1 in 2015 and -7.7 to +6.4 Tg yr&amp;minus;1 in 2030. We use land-use change realizations corresponding to the median and IQR of these emission estimates to drive the GEOS-Chem global 3-D chemistry transport model to investigate the perturbation to global and regional surface concentrations of isoprene, nitrogen oxides (NO+NO2), and the atmospheric concentration and deposition of ozone (O3). We show that across subcontinental regions the monthly surface O3 increases by 0.1-0.8 ppb, relative to a zero land-use change calculation, driven by increases (decreases) in surface isoprene in high (low) NOx environments. At the local scale (4&amp;deg; &amp;times; 5&amp;deg;) we find that surface O3 increases by 5-12 ppb over temperate North America, China and boreal Eurasia, driven by large increases in isoprene emissions from short-rotation coppice crop cultivation for biofuel production. © 2013 Author(s).

AB  - Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by 2050 to meet the projected demands from rising population, diet shifts, and increasing biofuels consumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising demands, rather than clearing more land for agriculture has been highlighted as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However, we first need to understand how crop yields are changing globally, and whether we are on track to double production by 2050. Using ∼2.5 million agricultural statistics, collected for ∼13,500 political units across the world, we track four key global crops-maize, rice, wheat, and soybean-that currently produce nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. We find that yields in these top four crops are increasing at 1.6%, 1.0%, 0.9%, and 1.3% per year, non-compounding rates, respectively, which is less than the 2.4% per year rate required to double global production by 2050. At these rates global production in these crops would increase by ∼67%, ∼42%, ∼38%, and ∼55%, respectively, which is far below what is needed to meet projected demands in 2050. We present detailed maps to identify where rates must be increased to boost crop production and meet rising demands. © 2013 Ray et al.

AB  - The US Renewable Fuel Standard sets a lower bound on the amount of biofuels used, with consequences for behavior of agricultural commodity markets that currently supply the vast majority of feedstocks for biofuel production. In this article, maize biotechnology is considered taking into account the impacts of US biofuel mandates. The impact of a hypothetical technology that reduces the severity of negative maize yield shocks is estimated using a structural economic model simulated stochastically. The importance of mandated levels of use of biofuels depends on whether they are binding. If biofuel use exceeds mandated levels, then mandates have little impact. If mandates are binding, then the markets' ability to respond to price movements can be reduced. In either case, aggregate maize demand is inelastic in these projections, so yield technology improvements can reduce total revenue to maize production.© 2013 AgBioForum.

AB  - With rapid expansion of biofuel production, major concerns have arisen over higher food costs and competition between food, feed, and biofuel for energy-rich commodities. Most projections are based on short- and intermediate-term commodity price shocks. We estimate long-term biofuel demand and cost-minimizing supply functions for feedstock and biofuel in developed and developing countries. We assume input and output coefficients and substitution elasticities adjust over time in response to changing prices in a dynamic market environment with productivity growth. Three alternative oil price scenarios are considered for biofuel feedstock production and conversion. The price of oil puts both a floor and ceiling on feedstock price. We conclude that global biofuel expansion will be limited in the absence of government incentives and mandates, unless high real oil prices prevail. Countries and regions need large, excess feedstock supplies (price-elastic response) if biofuel expansion is to be competitive with oil or other liquid fuels.© 2013 AgBioForum.

AB  - The need of fossil fuels and renewable energy is steadily increasing. The evaluation of the sustainability of the bio-fuel production needs to be considered in detail and under a holitistic point of view. The goals of this study are to enumerate the life cycle Energy Intensity (EI) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) of corn grain ethanol production, and to explore ethanol production scenarios which differ at the treatment of the Whole Stillage (WS) co-product, the starch content of the corn kernels and the corn production process at farm scale. A case study of ethanol production in Wisconsin, United States is done. The system boundaries of the investigation are from 'cradle to plant gate'. In this study statistic data are used for real conditions of corn grain production in Wisconsin. The data for energy use at the biorefinery industrial processes are sourced from an ethanol plant survey. From the comparison of co-product use scenarios, we find that recycling the WS into electricity, heat and fertilizer is the most environmentally beneficial co-product use because it results in a 54% lower EI and a 49% lower GWP than the processing of WS into Distillers Dried Grains with Soluables (DDGS). An increasing starch content of the corn kernels shows a strong decrease of the EI and GWP of the ethanol production up to 20%.

AB  - Black carbon aerosol plays a unique and important role in Earth's climate system. Black carbon is a type of carbonaceous material with a unique combination of physical properties. This assessment provides an evaluation of black-carbon climate forcing that is comprehensive in its inclusion of all known and relevant processes and that is quantitative in providing best estimates and uncertainties of the main forcing terms: direct solar absorption; influence on liquid, mixed phase, and ice clouds; and deposition on snow and ice. These effects are calculated with climate models, but when possible, they are evaluated with both microphysical measurements and field observations. Predominant sources are combustion related, namely, fossil fuels for transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open burning of biomass. Total global emissions of black carbon using bottom-up inventory methods are 7500 Gg yr-1 in the year 2000 with an uncertainty range of 2000 to 29000. However, global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a factor of almost 3. After this scaling, the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W m-2. Total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W m-2. Direct radiative forcing alone does not capture important rapid adjustment mechanisms. A framework is described and used for quantifying climate forcings, including rapid adjustments. The best estimate of industrial-era climate forcing of black carbon through all forcing mechanisms, including clouds and cryosphere forcing, is +1.1 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of +0.17 to +2.1 W m-2. Thus, there is a very high probability that black carbon emissions, independent of co-emitted species, have a positive forcing and warm the climate. We estimate that black carbon, with a total climate forcing of +1.1 W m-2, is the second most important human emission in terms of its climate forcing in the present-day atmosphere; only carbon dioxide is estimated to have a greater forcing. Sources that emit black carbon also emit other short-lived species that may either cool or warm climate. Climate forcings from co-emitted species are estimated and used in the framework described herein. When the principal effects of short-lived co-emissions, including cooling agents such as sulfur dioxide, are included in net forcing, energy-related sources (fossil fuel and biofuel) have an industrial-era climate forcing of +0.22 (-0.50 to +1.08) W m-2 during the first year after emission. For a few of these sources, such as diesel engines and possibly residential biofuels, warming is strong enough that eliminating all short-lived emissions from these sources would reduce net climate forcing (i.e., produce cooling). When open burning emissions, which emit high levels of organic matter, are included in the total, the best estimate of net industrial-era climate forcing by all short-lived species from black-carbon-rich sources becomes slightly negative (-0.06 W m-2 with 90% uncertainty bounds of -1.45 to +1.29 W m-2). The uncertainties in net climate forcing from black-carbon-rich sources are substantial, largely due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both black carbon and co-emitted organic carbon. In prioritizing potential black-carbon mitigation actions, non-science factors, such as technical feasibility, costs, policy design, and implementation feasibility play important roles. The major sources of black carbon are presently in different stages with regard to the feasibility for near-term mitigation. This assessment, by evaluating the large number and complexity of the associated physical and radiative processes in black-carbon climate forcing, sets a baseline from which to improve future climate forcing estimates. ©2013 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the relationships between biodiesel, ethanol and related fuels and agricultural commodities with a use of minimal spanning trees and hierarchical trees. To distinguish between short term and long term effects, we construct the trees for different frequencies (weekly, monthly and quarterly). At lower frequencies, the system splits into two well separated branches - a fuels part and a food part. Biodiesel tends to the fuels branch and ethanol to the food branch. We especially concentrate on the links and comovements between the commodities for different stages of the market based on the level of prices of important commodities or groups of commodities. Such approach uncovers some more interesting results and, in general, confirms the separation of network into fuels and food for majority of analyzed cases. © 2013 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Although many endo-ß-1,4-glucanases have been isolated in invertebrates, their cellulolytic systems are not fully understood. In particular, gastropod feeding on seaweed is considered an excellent model system for production of bioethanol and renewable bioenergy from third-generation feedstocks (microalgae and seaweeds). In this study, enzymes involved in the conversion of cellulose and other polysaccharides to glucose in digestive fluids of the sea hare (Aplysia kurodai) were screened and characterized to determine how the sea hare obtains glucose from sea lettuce (Ulva pertusa). Four endo-ß-1,4-glucanases (21 K, 45 K, 65 K, and 95 K cellulase) and 2 ß-glucosidases (110 K and 210 K) were purified to a homogeneous state, and the synergistic action of these enzymes during cellulose digestion was analyzed. All cellulases exhibited cellulase and lichenase activities and showed distinct cleavage specificities against cellooligosaccharides and filter paper. Filter paper was digested to cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose by 21 K cellulase, whereas 45 K and 65 K enzymes hydrolyzed the filter paper to cellobiose and glucose. 210 K ß-glucosidase showed unique substrate specificity against synthetic and natural substrates, and 4-methylumbelliferyl (4MU)-ß-glucoside, 4MU-ß-galactoside, cello-oligosaccharides, laminarin, and lichenan were suitable substrates. Furthermore, 210 K ß-glucosidase possesses lactase activity. Although ß-glucosidase and cellulase are necessary for efficient hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose to glucose, laminarin is hydrolyzed to glucose only by 210 K ß-glucosidase. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of 210 K ß-glucosidase by D-glucono-1,5-lactone suggested the presence of 2 active sites similar to those of mammalian lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Saccharification of sea lettuce was considerably stimulated by the synergistic action of 45 K cellulase and 210 K ß-glucosidase. Our results indicate that 45 K cellulase and 210 K ß-glucosidase are the core components of the sea hare digestive system for efficient production of glucose from sea lettuce. These findings contribute important new insights into the development of biofuel processing biotechnologies from seaweed. © 2013 Tsuji et al.

AB  - Biofuels production has been promoted in the attempt to address global warming and oil dependence concerns. However, the environmental impact of biofuels is a very complex issue and cannot be represented by GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions only (carbon footprint). In particular, water consumption (water footprint) has been recognized as a key issue in renewable fuels production. This paper proposes a multiobjective Mixed Integer Linear Programming modeling framework to optimize the environmental (i.e., the carbon and water footprints) and economic performances of bioethanol supply chains. Multiechelon, multiperiod, and spatially explicit features are embedded within the formulation to steer decisions and investments through a global approach. The strategic design and planning of corn- and stover-based bioethanol production networks is taken into account. A case study is presented referring to the emerging Italian ethanol production. Results show the effectiveness of mathematical programming-based tools to provide decision makers with a quantitative analysis assessing the economic and environmental performances of different design configurations. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Members of the anaerobic thermophilic bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor are emerging candidates for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) because they are capable of efficiently growing on biomass without conventional pretreatment. C. bescii produces primarily lactate, acetate and hydrogen as fermentation products, and while some Caldicellulosiruptor strains produce small amounts of ethanol C. bescii does not, making it an attractive background to examine the effects of metabolic engineering. The recent development of methods for genetic manipulation has set the stage for rational engineering of this genus for improved biofuel production. Here, we report the first targeted gene deletion, the gene encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), for metabolic engineering of a member of this genus. Results: A deletion of the C. bescii L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldh) was constructed on a non-replicating plasmid and introduced into the C. bescii chromosome by marker replacement. The resulting strain failed to produce detectable levels of lactate from cellobiose and maltose, instead increasing production of acetate and H§ssub§ 2§esub§ by 21-34% relative to the wild type and ΔpyrFA parent strains. The same phenotype was observed on a real-world substrate - switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Furthermore, the ldh deletion strain grew to a higher maximum optical density than the wild type on maltose and cellobiose, consistent with the prediction that the mutant would gain additional ATP with increased acetate production. Conclusions: Deletion of ldh in C. bescii is the first use of recently developed genetic methods for metabolic engineering of these bacteria. This deletion resulted in a redirection of electron flow from production of lactate to acetate and hydrogen. New capabilities in metabolic engineering combined with intrinsic utilization of lignocellulosic materials position these organisms to provide a new paradigm for consolidated bioprocessing of fuels and other products from biomass. © 2013 Cha et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Bioethanol is the world's largest-produced alternative to petroleum-derived transportation fuels due to its compatibility within existing spark-ignition engines and its relatively mature production technology. Despite its success, questions remain over the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of fuel ethanol use with many studies showing significant impacts of differences in land use, feedstock, and refinery operation. While most efforts to quantify life-cycle GHG impacts have focused on the production stage, a few recent studies have acknowledged the effect of ethanol on engine performance and incorporated these effects into the fuel life cycle. These studies have broadly asserted that vehicle efficiency increases with ethanol use to justify reducing the GHG impact of ethanol. These results seem to conflict with the general notion that ethanol decreases the fuel efficiency (or increases the fuel consumption) of vehicles due to the lower volumetric energy content of ethanol when compared to gasoline. Here we argue that due to the increased emphasis on alternative fuels with drastically differing energy densities, vehicle efficiency should be evaluated based on energy rather than volume. When done so, we show that efficiency of existing vehicles can be affected by ethanol content, but these impacts can serve to have both positive and negative effects and are highly uncertain (ranging from -15% to +24%). As a result, uncertainties in the net GHG effect of ethanol, particularly when used in a low-level blend with gasoline, are considerably larger than previously estimated (standard deviations increase by >10% and >200% when used in high and low blends, respectively). Technical options exist to improve vehicle efficiency through smarter use of ethanol though changes to the vehicle fleets and fuel infrastructure would be required. Future biofuel policies should promote synergies between the vehicle and fuel industries in order to maximize the society-wise benefits or minimize the risks of adverse impacts of ethanol. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperature, and precipitation affect plant growth and evapotranspiration. However, the interactive effects of these factors are relatively unexplored, and it is important to consider their combined effects at geographic and temporal scales that are relevant to policymaking. Accordingly, we estimate how climate change would affect water requirements for irrigated corn ethanol production in key regions of the U.S. over a 40 year horizon. We used the geographic-information- system-based environmental policy integrated climate (GEPIC) model, coupled with temperature and precipitation predictions from five different general circulation models and atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to estimate changes in water requirements and yields for corn ethanol. Simulations infer that climate change would increase the evaporative water consumption of the 15 billion gallons per year of corn ethanol needed to comply with the Energy Independency and Security Act by 10%, from 94 to 102 trillion liters/year (tly), and the irrigation water consumption by 19%, from 10.22 to 12.18 tly. Furthermore, on average, irrigation rates would increase by 9%, while corn yields would decrease by 7%, even when the projected increased irrigation requirements were met. In the irrigation-intensive High Plains, this implies increased pressure for the stressed Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water to seven states and irrigates one-fourth of the grain produced in the U.S. In the Corn Belt and Great Lakes region, where more rainfall is projected, higher water requirements could be related to less frequent rainfall, suggesting a need for additional water catchment capacity. The projected increases in water intensity (i.e., the liters of water required during feedstock cultivation to produce 1 L of corn ethanol) because of climate change highlight the need to re-evaluate the corn ethanol elements of the Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Thermophilic microorganisms have special advantages for the conversion of plant biomass to fuels and chemicals. Members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor are the most thermophilic cellulolytic bacteria known. They have the ability to grow on a variety of non-pretreated biomass substrates at or near ∼80°C and hold promise for converting biomass to bioproducts in a single step. As for all such relatively uncharacterized organisms with desirable traits, the ability to genetically manipulate them is a prerequisite for making them useful. Metabolic engineering of pathways for product synthesis is relatively simple compared to engineering the ability to utilize non-pretreated biomass. Results: Here we report the construction of a deletion of cbeI (Cbes2438), which encodes a restriction endonuclease that is as a major barrier to DNA transformation of C. bescii. This is the first example of a targeted chromosomal deletion generated by homologous recombination in this genus and the resulting mutant, JWCB018 (ΔpyrFA ΔcbeI), is readily transformed by DNA isolated from E. coli without in vitro methylation. PCR amplification and sequencing suggested that this deletion left the adjacent methyltransferase (Cbes2437) intact. This was confirmed by the fact that DNA isolated from JWCB018 was protected from digestion by CbeI and HaeIII. Plasmid DNA isolated from C. hydrothermalis transformants were readily transformed into C. bescii. Digestion analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from seven Caldicellulosiruptor species by using nine different restriction endonucleases was also performed to identify the functional restriction-modification activities in this genus. Conclusion: Deletion of the cbeI gene removes a substantial barrier to routine DNA transformation and chromosomal modification of C. bescii. This will facilitate the functional analyses of genes as well as metabolic engineering for the production of biofuels and bioproducts from biomass. An analysis of restriction-modification activities in members of this genus suggests a way forward to eliminating restriction as a barrier to DNA transformation and efficient genetic manipulation of this important group of hyperthermophiles. © 2013 Chung et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This paper introduces the production process of an alternative transportation biofuel, biobutanol. European legislation concerning biofuels and their sustainability criteria are also briefly described. The need to develop methods to ensure more sustainable and efficient biofuel production processes is recommended. In addition, the assessment method to evaluate the sustainability of biofuels is considered and sustainability assessment of selected feedstocks for biobutanol production is performed. The benefits and potential of using lignocellulosic and waste materials as feedstocks in the biobutanol production process are also discussed. Sustainability assessment in this paper includes cultivation, harvest/collection and upstream processing (pretreatment) of feedstocks, comparing four main biomass sources: food crops, non-food crops, food industry by-product and wood-based biomass. It can be concluded that the highest sustainable potential in Finland is when biobutanol production is integrated into pulp & paper mills. © 2013, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - Ensuring the sustainability of biofuels is a mandatory requisite for the EU Member States. The EU Renewables Directive focuses on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of high biodiversity and carbon stock lands. The current framework does not consider the consumption of non-renewable resources. Starting from the paper "Assessment of biodiesel energy sustainability using the ExROI concept" published in Energy [4], which defined the ExROI (Exergy Return on Investment) indicator and applied it to well-to-tank biodiesel production from rapeseed, sunflower and palm, this paper proposes extending the use of ExROI, which involves exergy cost accounting, to the life cycle; extending the calculations to soybean and used cooking oil; and assessing ways to "defossilise" the cycles. This paper demonstrates that the ExROI is a better indicator than the EROI (Energy Return on Investment) which only considers energy flows. Also, it shows that biodiesel life cycles have positive ExROI values and that the ExROI value can be improved up to 26.51; i.e. for one unit of non-renewable sources invested in the process more than 26 units of biodiesel are obtained. This means that biodiesel can be around five times more sustainable than fossil diesel, from the viewpoint of non-renewable resources consumption.

AB  - The freshwater eukaryotic algae has potential applications in sewage treatment, biofuel and food production. Here, we characterized a freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus), which could grow normally under low light intensity and deposit at the bottom of the medium, facilitating the harvesting. We found that the dry mass of S. obliquus contained 45.90% of proteins and 9.53% of lipids that were mainly composed of 42.59% of palmitoleic acid (C16:1), 24.58% of palmitic acid (C16:0), and 19.14% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Besides,our results suggests that both pumping air into the culture medium and moderate darkness stress could increase the growth rate of S. obliquus, whereas shaking had no obvious effects.Moreover, the effects of eight antibiotics on the growth of S. obliquus were investigated. Among them, chloramphenicol (Cm) and streptomycin (Str) had the strongest growth inhibitory effects, as well as higher concentration of geneticin (G418) and gentamycin (Gen), suggesting their potentiality to be used as selection markers for transformation experiments. Together, our data indicated that the S. obliquus is a promising resource for biofuel and food production. The identification of several candidate selection markers will also facilitate genetic manipulations to further improve the lipid yield in S. obliquus.

AB  - Sustainable bioenergy production depends upon the efficiency with which crops use available water to produce biomass and store carbon belowground. Therefore, water use efficiency (WUE; productivity vs. annual evapotranspiration, ET) is a key metric of bioenergy crop performance. We evaluate WUE of three potential perennial grass bioenergy crops, Miscanthus × giganteus (miscanthus), Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), and an assemblage of prairie species (28 species), and Zea mays-Glycine max rotation, during the establishment phase in Illinois. Ecosystem WUE (EWUE; net ecosystem productivity vs. ET) was highest in miscanthus, reaching a maximum value of 12.8 ± 0.3 kg ha-1 mm-1 in the third year, followed by switchgrass (7.5 ± 0.3 kg ha-1 mm-1) and prairie (3.9 ± 0.3 kg ha-1 mm-1); the row crop was the lowest. Besides EWUE, harvest-WUE (HWUE, harvested biomass vs. ET) and net biome productivity-WUE (BWUE, calculated as net ecosystem production - harvest vs. ET) were also estimated for all crops and years. After three years of establishment, HWUE and BWUE were highest in miscanthus (9.0 ± 2 and 3.8 ± 2.9 kg ha-1 mm-1, respectively) providing a net benefit to the carbon balance, while the row crops had a negative carbon balance and a negative BWUE. BWUE for maize/soybean indicate that this ecosystem would deplete the soil carbon stocks while using the water resources. Switchgrass had the second highest BWUE, while prairie was almost neutral indicating that long-term carbon sequestration for this agro-ecosystem would be sensitive to harvest timing with an early harvest removing more biomass, and thus carbon, from the field. © 2013.

AB  - Ensenada health officials lack pertinent information on the sustainable management of solid waste, as do health officials from other developing countries. The aims of this research are: (a) to quantify and analyze the household solid wastes generated in the city of Ensenada, Mexico, and (b) to project biogas production and estimate generation of electrical energy. The characterization study was conducted by socioeconomic stratification in two seasonal periods, and the biogas and electrical energy projections were performed using the version 2.0 Mexico Biogas Model. Per capita solid waste generation was 0.779 ± 0.019 kg per person per day within a 98 % confidence interval. Waste composition is composed mainly of food scraps at 36.25 %, followed by paper and cardboard at 21.85 %, plastic at 12.30 %, disposable diapers at 6.26 %, and textiles at 6.28 %. The maximum capacity for power generation is projected to be 1.90 MW in 2019. Waste generated could be used as an intermediate in different processes such as recycling (41.04 %) and energy recovery (46.63 %). The electrical energy that could be obtained using the biogas generated at the Ensenada sanitary landfill would provide roughly 60 % of the energy needed for street lighting. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biofuel policies are a subset of policies designed to achieve energy security, an improved environment, enhanced agricultural incomes, technological change, and overall economic benefits, with increased domestic energy production creating green jobs and foreign exchange savings. In assessing this broad spectrum of proclaimed policy goals with the outcome of biofuel mandates, subsidies, import barriers, binary sustainability standards, and indirect land use measures, we identify many perverse and contradictory effects. Most importantly, we show how biofuel policies established the crop-energy price link and hence the food-fuel trade-off, the contradictory effects of combining mandates with different subsidies, the various surprising welfare economic effects, and the various inconsistencies associated with binary sustainability standards and carbon leakages. We conclude with examples of how biofuel policies have generated paradoxical effects in many other different dimensions. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Proposed climate mitigation measures do not account for direct biophysical climate impacts of land-use change (LUC), nor do the stabilization targets modeled for phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) representative concentration pathways (RCPs). To examine the significance of such effects on global and regional patterns of climatechange, a baseline and an alternative scenario of future anthropogenic activity are simulated within the Integrated Earth System Model, which couples the Global Change Assessment Model, Global Land-Use Model, and Community Earth System Model. The alternative scenario has high biofuel utilization and approximately 50% less global forest cover than the baseline, standard RCP4.5 scenario. Both scenarios stabilize radiative forcing from atmospheric constituents at 4.5 W m-2 by 2100. Thus, differences between their climate predictions quantify the biophysical effects of LUC. Offline radiative transfer and land model simulations are also utilized to identify forcing and feedback mechanisms driving the coupled response. Boreal deforestation is found to strongly influence climate because of increased albedo coupled with a regional-scalewater vapor feedback. Globally, the alternative scenario yields a twentyfirst- century warming trend that is 0.5°C cooler than baseline, driven by a 1 W m-2 mean decrease in radiative forcing that is distributed unevenly around the globe. Some regions are cooler in the alternative scenario than in 2005. These results demonstrate that neither climate change nor actual radiative forcing is uniquely related to atmospheric forcing targets such as those found in the RCPs but rather depend on particulars of the socioeconomic pathways followed to meet each target. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is assumed to be an important instrument to support decision-making in Brazil. Although not mandatory, nearly 35 SEAs, of which one third are devoted to energy plans and programmes (oil, gas, hydroelectricity and biofuel), have been prepared over the past 15 years in Brazil. The effectiveness of SEA, however, has not been studied in detail. This paper reports on the application of a procedural effectiveness analysis to 9 SEAs prepared for energy planning in Brazil, of which 5 deal with renewable energy plans and programmes. The results indicate no significant difference between renewable and non-renewable energy in terms of procedural effectiveness, with adequate performance in screening, baseline and description of mitigation actions, but serious deficiencies in the definition of SEA objectives, identification of strategic alternatives, description of public participation and follow-up strategies. The variability in the performance to each effectiveness criteria is taken as evidence that Brazil has not achieved consistency in SEA procedures, reinforcing the need for improvements in the current system. © 2013 Imperial College Press.

AB  - Oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria and microalgae have attracted attention as feedstocks for next-generation biofuels. To date, however, there have been no reports on efficient bioethanol production from cyanobacterial glycogen by yeast fermentation. Additionally, multiple pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis steps of polysaccharides are required for conventional ethanol production from agricultural crops and microalgae. Here, we investigate direct ethanol production from Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis, a fast-growing halophilic cyanobacterium that accumulates large amounts of glycogen, using lysozyme and a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast strain to eliminate the need for biomass pretreatment and amylase hydrolysis. In the direct conversion process from A. platensis to ethanol, 6.5 g L-1 (ethanol productivity of 1.08 g per L per day) of ethanol was produced. The total ethanol yield based on glycogen consumption was 86% of theoretical yield, which to our knowledge, is the highest yield of bioethanol from an oxygenic photosynthetic microorganism. The present findings indicate that A. platensis is a remarkable carbohydrate feedstock in the form of glycogen, which is a promising material for the production of bioethanol and various other commercially valuable chemicals. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Miscanthus is referred to as an ideal lignocellulosic bioenergy crop, which can be used to generate heat, power, and fuel, as well as to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The new Miscanthus sacchariflorus genotype named Geodae-Uksae 1 was recently collected from damp land in southern Korea. This study investigated the growth characteristics of Miscanthus genotypes, and developed a specific, sensitive, and reproducible sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to distinguish new M. sacchariflorus genotype Geodae-Uksae 1 from other native Miscanthus species in Korea. Growth characteristics such as stem length, stem diameter, and dry weight of Geodae-Uksae 1 were greater than those of normal M. sacchariflorus. The genotypes within Geodae-Uksae 1 were had the highest genetic similarity. A putative 1,800-bp polymorphic sequence specific to Geodae-Uksae 1 was identified with the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) N8018 primer. The sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers Geodae 1-F and Geodae 1-R were designed based on the unique RAPD amplicon. The SCAR primers produced a specific 1,799-bp amplicon in authentic Geodae-Uksae 1, whereas no amplification was observed in other Miscanthus species. The SCAR marker could contribute to identify Geodae-Uksae 1 among native Miscanthus species. The new Miscanthus genotype Geodae-Uksae 1 has great potential as an alternative lignocellulosic biomass feedstock for bioenergy productions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biofuels derived from microalgae are considered a viable alternative energy resource that eliminates the major drawbacks associated with biofuels produced from land crops. Strain selection is a critical factor for the success of microalgal production systems. This study evaluates Picochlorum oklahomensis (PO) as a potential microalga strain for biofuel and bioproduct applications. Nannochloropsis oculata (NO) was included in the study as a well-studied reference strain with biomass properties suitable for commercial applications. Growth pattern including specific growth rates, generation time and maximum biomass concentrations in culture media were determined for both PO and NO. Oil and protein contents and fatty acid composition of both strains were analyzed. PO had a higher biomass concentration in the medium and shorter generation time than NO. Both strains were rich in oil, protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This study indicates that PO can be a viable strain for bioproduct manufacturing because of its high oil and protein content and biomass productivity. © 2013 AOCS.

AB  - Aims: Milletia pinnata is a leguminous tropical tree that produces seed oil suitable for biodiesel and is targeted to be planted on marginal land associated with nitrogen poor soil. This study aimed to identify effective rhizobia species for M. pinnata. Methods: Soil samples were collected from M. pinnata grown in Kununurra, Australia. Rhizobia were trapped, characterised and sequenced for 16S rRNA, atpD, dnaK and recA genes. Results: Forty isolates tolerated pH 7 - 9, temperatures 29 - 37 °C, salinity below 1 % NaCl, and had optimal growth on mannitol, arabinose or glutamate as a single carbon source, a few grew on sucrose and none grew on lactose. Inoculation of isolates increased shoot dry weight of M. pinnata's seedlings in nitrogen minus media. Slow-growing isolates were closely related to Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, Bradyrhizobium sp. DOA10, Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS305 and B. liaoningense LMG 18230T. The fast-growing isolates related to Rhizobium sp. 8211, R. miluonense CCBAU 41251T, R miluonense CC-B-L1, Rhizobium sp.

AB  - Transportation contributes to a significant and rising share of global energy use and GHG emissions. Therefore modeling future travel demand, its fuel use, and resulting CO2 emission is highly relevant for climate change mitigation. In this study we compare the baseline projections for global service demand (passenger-kilometers, ton-kilometers), fuel use, and CO2 emissions of five different global transport models using harmonized input assumptions on income and population. For four models we also evaluate the impact of a carbon tax. All models project a steep increase in service demand over the century. Technology change is important for limiting energy consumption and CO2 emissions, the study also shows that in order to stabilise or even decrease emissions radical changes would be required. While all models project liquid fossil fuels dominating up to 2050, they differ regarding the use of alternative fuels (natural gas, hydrogen, biofuels, and electricity), because of different fuel price projections. The carbon tax of 200 USD/tCO2 in 2050 stabilizes or reverses global emission growth in all models. Besides common findings many differences in the model assumptions and projections indicate room for further understanding long-term trends and uncertainty in future transport systems. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biogas production and use are generally regarded as a sustainable practice that can guarantee high greenhouse gas (GHG) savings. However, the actual carbon footprint of biogas is strongly influenced by several factors. The aim of this study is to analyse the environmental performance of different biogas to electricity scenarios. Two criticalities are identified as important: the choice of feedstock and the operational practice concerning the digestate. Maize, manure and co-digestion of them are the different feedstocks chosen. Maize has higher yields, but its cultivation has to be accounted for, which consists of 28-42% of the GHG emissions of the whole process of producing electricity. Manure is considered a residue and as a result benefits from no production stage, but also from avoided emissions from the normal agricultural practice of storing it in the farm and spreading it as fertiliser, but has lower methane yields. Co-digestion combines the benefits and disadvantages of the two different feedstocks. Digestate storage in open or closed tanks and further use as fertiliser is analysed. The environmental impact analysis shows that a substantial reduction of GHG emissions can be achieved with closed digestate storage. The GHG emissions savings vary from about 3% in the maize pathways with open storage up to 330% in the manure pathway with closed storage. The biogas pathways, though, have worse environmental performances in all other environmental impacts considered but ozone depletion potential when compared to the European electricity average mix. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The expanding demand for biofuel feedstock may lead to large-scale conscription of land for monoculture production of biofuel crops with concomitant substantial negative impacts on biodiversity. We compared moth diversity in light-trap samples from corn, miscanthus, switchgrass and native prairie, to determine whether there is an observable relationship between plant species diversity and moth abundance and diversity. Moth alpha diversity was highest in prairie and was higher in switchgrass than in the other two biofuel crops. Beta diversity generally was low among the biofuel crops, and prairie shared lower beta diversity with switchgrass than with corn or miscanthus. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences in moth abundance per species among treatments. The alpha and beta diversity index findings are consistent with those of other studies on arthropods in biofuel crops and provide evidence to suggest that large-scale conversion of acreage to biofuel crops may have substantial negative effects on arthropod biodiversity both within the cropping systems and in the surrounding landscape. © 2012 The Authors Insect Science © 2012 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Over the past decade UK government policy has been promoting bioenergy innovation in the name of the public good. This has been envisaged through sociotechnical imaginaries - feasible, desirable future visions dependent upon technoscientific advance. UK bioenergy has had three major imaginaries: localisation, agri-diversification and oil substitution. Through these imaginaries, technoscientific innovation is promoted as an essential means to gain societal benefits, to avoid harm and/or to overcome obstacles. Each imaginary combines specific models of environmental sustainability and economic advantage. These models arise from discursive resonances among research managers, government departments and other public-sector bodies. While such imaginaries have a decade-long history, they have been elaborated more persuasively for specific innovation pathways. Some linkages between imaginaries and innovation pathways have been consolidated more strongly than others; key bodies have been convinced to provide a stronger policy commitment and material support. Warnings about unsustainable biomass have been discursively accommodated via prospects for future innovation which will enhance sustainability, alongside R&D funds to realise those prospects. Meanwhile bioenergy policy attempts to leave open future options which may generate more benefits. In such ways, UK bioenergy policy links epistemic claims for future sustainability with political authority for targets, subsidy and other incentives. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We obtained soil samples from geographically diverse switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) crop sites and from nearby reference grasslands and compared their edaphic properties, microbial gene diversity and abundance, and active microbial biomass content. We hypothesized that soils under switchgrass, a perennial, would be more similar to reference grassland soils than sorghum, an annual crop. Sorghum crop soils had significantly higher NO3--N, NH4+-N, SO42--S, and Cu levels than grassland soils. In contrast, few significant differences in soil chemistry were observed between switchgrass crop and grassland soils. Active bacterial biomass was significantly lower in sorghum soils than switchgrass soils. Using GeoChip 4. 0 functional gene arrays, we observed that microbial gene diversity was significantly lower in sorghum soils than grassland soils. Gene diversity at sorghum locations was negatively correlated with NO3--N, NH4+-N, and SO42--S in C and N cycling microbial gene categories. Microbial gene diversity at switchgrass sites varied among geographic locations, but crop and grassland sites tended to be similar. Microbial gene abundance did not differ between sorghum crop and grassland soils, but was generally lower in switchgrass crop soils compared to grassland soils. Our results suggest that switchgrass has fewer adverse impacts on microbial soil ecosystem services than cultivation of an annual biofuel crop such as sorghum. Multi-year, multi-disciplinary regional studies comparing these and additional annual and perennial biofuel crop and grassland soils are recommended to help define sustainable crop production and soil ecosystem service practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and giant reed (Arundo donax) are leading bioenergy crops. Both exhibit many invasive characteristics, though only giant reed is known to be invasive. Despite this, neither produces viable seed, limiting movement to vegetative propagules. Therefore, to assess vegetative fragments as potential propagules, we quantified seasonal changes in culm node viability and performance in giant miscanthus and giant reed under greenhouse conditions. Giant miscanthus culms were collected in spring, summer, fall, and winter from established fields, while giant reed culms were collected in summer, fall, and winter from feral stands. Treatments at each timing consisted of whole culms and single-node culm fragments planted in soil or placed in standing water for an 8-week period. Giant miscanthus whole culms and fragments produced shoots and roots in both soil and standing water immediately following cutting from spring to summer, but failed to produce shoots and roots after fall and winter cutting dates. All rhizome fragments survived and generated shoots and roots after burial. By comparison, giant reed produced shoots and roots in both soil and standing water throughout the year, regardless of cutting date. With giant miscanthus, precautions should be taken when living culms or rhizome fragments are harvested and transported through riparian habitats during the summer months. By comparison, giant reed showed a remarkable increase in propagule generation and productivity throughout the year and, thus, escaped propagules present a far greater risk of unintentional establishment compared to giant miscanthus. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A recent alternative strategy to reduce environmental problems associated with P transport from agricultural soils is the use of bioenergy crops to remediate excess soil P. In addition to the positive impacts associated with P mitigation, harvested biomass used as a renewable energy source can also offset the cost associated with plant-based P remediation strategies. The objective of this study was to identify potential crop species that can be used for remediation of soil P and as a cellulosic feedstock for production of renewable energy in South Florida. Fifteen crop entries were investigated for their potential to remove P from a P-enriched soil. Dry matter (DM) yield varied among crop species with greatest yield observed for elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) (43 and 39 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively). Similarly, greater P removal rates were observed for elephantgrass (up to 126 kg P ha-1 year-1 in 2008) followed by sugarcane (62 kg P ha-1 year-1 in 2008). Although there was no effect (P = 0. 45) of crop species on P reduction in the soil, soil P concentrations decreased linearly during the 3-year study. Because of its relatively greater DM yield and P removal rates, elephantgrass was shown to be a good candidate for remediation of excess soil P in South Florida Spodosols. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - During a multistate survey (2009) of diseases of perennial grasses under consideration as biofuel feedstocks, a new leaf blight of Miscanthus × giganteus caused by Leptosphaerulina chartarum was observed on 100 % of the plants evaluated in research plots near Lexington, Kentucky. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effect of L. chartarum on M. × giganteus biomass and to identify effective foliar fungicides against the disease. Eleven broad-spectrum fungicides were tested with rates typically used in agronomic crops. Fungicides tested included active ingredients from five different chemical groups, demethylation inhibitors (prothioconazole, tebuconazole, cyproconazole, propiconazole, tetraconazole, flutriafol, and metconazole), quinone outside inhibitors (pyraclostrobin), succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (boscalid), methyl benzimidazole carbamates (thiophanate-methyl), and chloronitriles (chlorothalonil). Infection by L. chartarum significantly lowered aboveground biomass by an average of 33 %. Application of cyproconazole, flutriafol, tebuconazole, or prothioconazole significantly reduced disease severity, with cyproconazole and flutriafol ranking best at an average of 29 % disease control. However, no fungicide treatment resulted in biomass loss abatement. Greater rates or a combination of fungicides might be needed to achieve adequate control. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a perennial rhizomatous grass that shows promise as a bioenergy crop in the Mediterranean environment. The species has spread throughout the world, catalyzed by human activity, though also as a result of its intrinsic robustness, adaptability, and versatility. Giant reed is able to thrive across a wide range of soil types and is tolerant to drought, salinity, and flooding. This tolerance to environmental stresses is significant and could mean that growing energy crops on marginal land is one possible strategy for reducing competition for land with food production and for improving soil quality. We devised an experiment in which we cultivated giant reed in a sandy loam soil with low nutrient availability. Our goal was to evaluate the dynamics of aboveground and belowground biomass and assess the nutrient dynamics of this grass species, focusing particularly on nutrient accumulation and remobilization. The species demonstrated good productivity potential: In the third year, aboveground dry biomass yield reached around 20 t ha-1, with a corresponding rhizome dry biomass yield of 16 t ha-1. Results for this species were characterized by low nutrient contents in the aboveground biomass at the end of the growing season, and its rhizome proved able to support growth over the spring period and to store nutrients in the autumn. Nevertheless, the adaptability of giant reed to marginal land and the role of its belowground biomass should be investigated over the long-term, and any further research should focus on its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintain soil fertility. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study presents results from a 2-year evaluation of biomass and cellulosic ethanol (EtOH) production potential of forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cultivars differing in brown midrib trait (i. e., bmr12) under dryland (no irrigation) and limited irrigation (2. 88 mm day-1; subsurface drip) in the semiarid Southern High Plains of the USA. Commercial cultivar Sorghum Partners 1990 (SP 1990, conventional non-bmr) produced significantly more biomass (29-62 %) than a bmr12 cultivar PaceSetter bmr (PS bmr) under irrigated and dryland conditions during both years of this study. However, PS bmr biomass had higher cellulosic EtOH conversion efficiency than SP 1990 in both years according to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation analysis. Irrigation resulted in 26-49 % more biomass and 28-72 % more cellulosic EtOH production during both growing seasons, indicating that limited irrigation had favorable effects on both biomass and biofuel production. In the first year, when precipitation was below average, both cultivars produced similar amounts of cellulosic EtOH. During the second year, when precipitation was above average, higher biomass production of SP 1990 resulted in 28 % higher cellulosic EtOH production than PS bmr when averaged across both irrigated and dryland conditions. The large range of cellulosic EtOH production (1,600 to 3,380 L ha-1) during the 2 years of this study was primarily driven by differences in water availability that resulted from precipitation and irrigation. Our findings indicates that chemical composition and biomass yield potential of sorghum cultivars are critical factors that affect biomass and biofuel production under limited water conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) are large perennial grass bioenergy crops in the USA and Europe. Despite much research into their agronomic potential, few studies have examined in situ root growth dynamics under irrigation and soil water deficits, particularly as they relate to shoot performance. We grew miscanthus and switchgrass in outdoor mesocosms under irrigated and rainfed conditions and assessed the spatial distribution and abundance of roots using minirhizotron images and whole root system sampling. Despite surviving an extended period of drought, shoot and root biomass, root length density, numbers of culms, and culm height were reduced in both species under rainfed (dry) conditions. However, rainfed switchgrass far outperformed rainfed miscanthus in all shoot and root growth metrics. The rainfed (drought) treatment reduced switchgrass and miscanthus whole plant biomass by 83 and 98 %, culm production by 67 and 90 %, and root length density by 67 and 94 % compared to irrigated plants, respectively. Root nitrogen concentration was higher for miscanthus (3-fold) and switchgrass (4-fold) in the rainfed treatment compared to irrigated plants and did not significantly differ between species. Unlike miscanthus, switchgrass grew roots continuously into regions of available soil moisture as surface soil layers grew increasingly dry, indicating a drought avoidance strategy. Our study suggests that switchgrass is more likely to tolerate drought by mining deep wet soils, while miscanthus relies on shallow rhizome production to tolerate dry soils. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Previous assessments of the economic feasibility and large-scale productivity of microalgae biofuels have not considered the impacts of land and carbon dioxide (CO2) availability on the scalability of microalgae-based biofuels production. To accurately assess the near-term productivity potential of large-scale microalgae biofuel in the USA, a geographically realized growth model was used to simulate microalgae lipid yields based on meteorological data. The resulting lipid productivity potential of Nannochloropsis under large-scale cultivation is combined with land and CO2 resource availability illustrating current geographically feasible production sites and corresponding productivity in the USA. Baseline results show that CO2 transport constraints will limit US microalgae-based bio-oil production to 4 % of the 2030 Department of Energy (DOE) alternative fuel goal. The discussion focuses on synthesis of this large-scale productivity potential results including a sensitivity analysis to land and CO2 resource assumptions, an evaluation of previous modeling efforts, and their assumptions regarding the transportation of CO2, the feasibility of microalgae to meet DOE 2030 alternative fuel goals, and a comparison of the productivity potential in several key regions of the USA. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Following up the rather sobering results of the biofuels boom in Tanzania, we analyze the preconditions that would make large-scale oil production from the feedstock Jatropha curcas viable. We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels policies and projects may lead to environmental, economic and social impacts. A number of studies point out the need to deliver comprehensive sustainability assessments regarding biofuels, with some presenting analytical frameworks that claim to be exhaustive. However, what is often found in the literature is an overexploitation of environmental and economic concerns, by contrast to a limited appraisal of the social aspects of biofuels. Building on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature, this paper discusses the social constraints and strengths of ethanol, with regard to the product's lifecycle stages and the actors involved. Its objective is to contribute to the development of social frameworks to be used in assessing the impact of ethanol. Main findings indicate that ethanol developments can increase the levels of social vulnerability, although there is little evidence in the literature regarding the positive and negative social impacts of 1st-generation ethanol and potential impacts of cellulosic ethanol. Further work is needed on the formulation of social criteria and indicators for a comprehensive sustainability assessment of this biofuel. Policy makers need to internalise the social dimension of ethanol in decision-making to prevent public opposition and irreversible social costs in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This analysis identifies the sensitivity of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway to facility location. The economic feasibility of a 2000 metric ton per day fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing biorefinery is quantified based on 30 different state-specific facility locations within the United States. We calculate the 20-year internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) for each location scenario as a function of state- and region-specific factors. This analysis demonstrates that biorefinery IRR and NPV are very sensitive to bio-oil yield, feedstock cost, location capital cost factor, and transportation fuel market value. The IRRs and NPVs generated for each scenario vary widely as a result, ranging from a low of 7.4% and -$79.5 million in Illinois to a high of 17.2% and $165.5 million in Georgia. The results indicate that the economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is strongly influenced by facility location within the United States. This result could have important implications for cellulosic biofuel commercialization under the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigate the impacts of the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS2) and several alternative biofuel policy designs on global GHG emissions from land use change and agriculture over the 2010-2030 horizon. Analysis of the scenarios relies on GLOBIOM, a global, multi-sectoral economic model based on a detailed representation of land use. Our results reveal that RFS2 would substantially increase the portion of agricultural land needed for biofuel feedstock production. U.S. exports of most agricultural products would decrease as long as the biofuel target would increase leading to higher land conversion and nitrogen use globally. In fact, higher levels of the mandate mean lower net emissions within the U.S. but when the emissions from the rest of the world are considered, the US biofuel policy results in almost no change on GHG emissions for the RFS2 level and higher global GHG emissions for higher levels of the mandate or higher share of conventional corn-ethanol in the mandate. Finally, we show that if the projected crop productivity would be lower globally, the imbalance between domestic U.S. GHG savings and additional GHG emissions in the rest of the world would increase, thus deteriorating the net global impact of U.S. biofuel policies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We analyze the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) as a regulatory tool using biofuel regulations as an illustrative example. A regulatory context calls for a consequential LCA (CLCA) of a policy as opposed to an attributional LCA (ALCA) of a product. In performing CLCA, issues of scale, price effects, technology and policy in the counterfactual state of the world, strategic behavior, policy horizon etc. need consideration. This appears to increase both uncertainty in estimates and the cost of performing LCA. We suggest heuristics for determining vulnerability to harmful indirect effects at an early stage in the policy process and discuss alternative policies to limit harmful indirect effects without engaging in the full effort of computation and selection of a central estimate for uncertain outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane ethanol is the main liquid biofuel used in Brazil as a substitute for fossil fuels for the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, ethanol production also produces GHG emissions during the agricultural phase through the disposal of its residues. Vinasse, as the main residue from ethanol production, may contribute to GHG emission during its storage, transportation and application to soil as ferti-irrigation. The objective of this study was to quantify the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O resulting from vinasse application in sugarcane fields under different straw managements and to determine the N2O emission factor derived from this practice. This study was performed at the Boa Vista Farm, in São Paulo State, Brazil. The application of 200m3ha-1 of vinasse tripled the CO2 emissions in areas with burnt or unburnt harvest systems. The consumption of CH4 was observed, supporting the hypothesis that this usually applied amount of vinasse to the soil does not necessarily result in CH4 emissions. The 46kg of N contained in this dose of vinasse increased the release of N2O by the soil and resulted in emission factors of 0.68% and 0.44% for the burnt and unburnt areas, respectively. The fluxes of N2O and CH4, converted into CO2 eq, indicate that each m3ha-1 of vinasse applied to the soil emits 0.491 and 0.314kg of CO2 eq. in the burnt and unburnt sugarcane areas, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone contributes to the removal of air pollutants from the atmosphere but is itself a pollutant that is harmful to human health and vegetation. Biogenic isoprene emissions are important ozone precursors, and therefore future changes in land use that change isoprene emissions are likely to affect atmospheric ozone concentrations. Here, we use the chemical transport model LOTOS-EUROS (dedicated to the regional modeling of trace gases in Europe) to study a scenario in which 5% of the crop- and grass-land in Europe is converted into poplar plantations to be used for biofuel production. Although this scenario is rather conservative, our simulations project that isoprene emissions are substantially increased by an average of 45% over the simulated domain. As a consequence, ozone peak values are expected to increase by up to 6%, and ozone indicators for damage to human health and vegetation by up to 25% and 40%, respectively. Finally, we show that after the change in land use NOx emission reductions of 15-20% in Europe would be required to restore the ozone levels to current values. Because biomass production is expected to increase throughout Europe in the coming decades, we conclude that careful consideration of the tree types and regions to be used is required to constrain the concomitant air pollution to a minimum. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agriculture in the US Corn Belt is under increasing pressure to produce greater quantities of food, feed and fuel, while better protecting environmental quality. Key environmental problems in this region include water contamination by nutrients and herbicides emitted from cropland, a lack of non-agricultural habitat to support diverse communities of native plants and animals, and a high level of dependence on petrochemical energy in the dominant cropping systems. In addition, projected changes in climate for this region, which include increases in the proportion of precipitation coming from extreme events could make soil and water conservation in existing cropping systems more difficult. To address these challenges we have conducted three cropping systems projects in central Iowa: the Marsden Farm Cropping Systems experiment, the Science-based Trials of Row-crops Integrated with Prairies (STRIPs) experiment, and the Comparison of Biofuel Systems (COBS) experiment. Results from these experiments indicate that (1) diversification of the dominant corn-soybean rotation with small grains and forage legumes can permit substantial reductions in agrichemical and fossil hydrocarbon use without compromising yields or profitability; (2) conversion of small amounts of cropland to prairie buffer strips can provide disproportionately large improvements in soil and water conservation, nutrient retention, and densities of native plants and birds; and (3) native perennial species can generate large amounts of biofuel feedstocks and offer environmental benefits relative to corn-and soybean-based systems, including greater carbon inputs to soil and large reductions in nitrogen emissions to drainage water. Increasing biodiversity through the strategic integration of perennial plant species can be a viable strategy for reducing reliance on purchased inputs and for increasing agroecosystem health and resilience in the US Corn Belt. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In the present paper, we have determined emission factor of chemical composition of the emission from the burning of biomass (e.g. Dung cake, Acacia, Neem, Mulberry, Indian Rosewood, Pigeon pea etc.) commonly used as a residential fuel in the rural sector of Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) (Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal), India. For comparison, we have selected only those biomass fuels, which are used in at least three of the above mentioned states. Dung cake from all the states reports highest emission of particulate matter (PM) (15.68 g kg-1), Organic Carbon (OC) (4.32 g kg-1) and Elemental Carbon (EC) (0.51 g kg-1). Among all biomass fuels studied, agricultural residue reports substantial amount of emission of Na+ (104 mg kg-1), K+ (331 mg kg-1) and Cl- (447 mg kg-1) particularly in Pigeon pea and Mustard stem. Eucalyptus (fuel wood) emits large amounts of Ca2+ (21.47 mg kg-1) and NO3- (614 mg kg-1). The emission of PM from dung cake is higher in Delhi (19.31 g kg-1) and followed by Uttar Pradesh (17.58 g kg-1) &gt; Haryana (15.46 g kg-1) &gt; Bihar (14.99 g kg-1) &gt; Punjab (12.06 g kg-1) &gt; West Bengal (5.90 g kg-1). Carbonaceous aerosols (OC and EC) and dominant Ionic species (Cl-, K+, SO42-, NO3- and PO43-) are altogether contributing 40-70% of total emissions. Characteristics and ratios of chemical species of emissions may help to develop a methodology of discriminating the sources of ambient particulate matter. Using a laboratory determined emission factor of chemical species, we have determined the emission budget over IGP, India. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study of bioproduct production, such as bioethanol and biochemicals, from inexpensive biomass has recently attracted considerable attention. Compared to land biomass, marine biomass can be grown rapidly and is easily cultivated without the need for expensive equipment. In addition, annual CO2 absorption by marine biomass is five to seven times higher than that of wood-biomass and the carbohydrate content is higher and can easily be converted to chemicals through proper chemical processes. In the production of various biochemicals from marine biomass, levulinic acid is a highly versatile chemical with numerous industrial uses and the potential to become a commodity chemical. It can be used as a raw material for resins, plasticizers, textiles, animal feed, coatings and antifreeze. The present study was carried out to determine the optimum conditions of temperature, acid concentration and reaction time for levulinic acid production from marine biomass Gelidium amansii using two-step treatment. In the first hydrolysis step, solid-state cellulose was obtained through acid soaking and used to produce ethanol by fermentation and liquid-state galactose. In the second hydrolysis step, the liquid-state galactose was converted into levulinic acid via a high-temperature reaction in a batch reactor. The overall production conversion of G. amansii biomass to levulinic acid in the two-step acid hydrolysis was approximately 20.6%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Short rotation forestry (SRF) is a promising feedstock for production of biofuels via the thermochemical route. Five poplar biomasses (SRF of different clones and ages, and debarked wood) were ground and separated into three particle size fractions: <0.2 mm; 0.2-0.4 mm; >0.4 mm. The characterization of these samples was performed to evaluate the quality and homogeneity of SRF feedstocks. Some major properties related to thermochemical processes were measured: chemical composition, organic and inorganic elemental compositions. The heterogeneity in SRF feedstock properties, resulting from high bark content, appeared to be transferred to particle size fractions. The results obtained highlighted that fine particles below 0.2 mm had very specific properties, close to those of bark. The removal of this fraction would result in a more homogeneous feedstock, avoiding the issue caused by segregation risk for process stability. Such removal of small particles would also modify the biomass properties by reducing bark amount, improving the suitability of SRF feedstock for thermochemical conversion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Presently wastewater treatment is the only economically viable way to produce algal biomass for conversion to energy such as biofuels with minimum environmental impact. Increasing industrialization and urbanization large amount of wastewater is generated which create a very serious problem for human and other animal health. The aim of this study was to produce algal biomass using waste water &amp; its high level of nutrients and CO2 through aeration. Waste water was collected and analyzed for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), Chemical oxygen demand (COD), Nitrate (NO3-), Phosphate (PO4--), Ammonia (NH3). The algal biomass was increased simultaneously with increasing CO2 consumption rate. The maximum algal biomass was recorded in 8 times diluted waste water at one, two and three time aeration on 21st day is 14.1±0.71 g/l, 18.6±0.55g/l and 33.2±1.2 g/l respectively. Cultivating algae on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in animal manure effluents presents an alternative to the current practice of land application. Finally, cost effective algal biomass used as a source of energy.

AB  - Intensive cultivation of freshwater macroalgae is likely to increase with the development of an algal biofuels industry and algal bioremediation. However, target freshwater macroalgae species suitable for large-scale intensive cultivation have not yet been identified. Therefore, as a first step to identifying target species, we compared the productivity, growth and biochemical composition of three species representative of key freshwater macroalgae genera across a range of cultivation conditions. We then selected a primary target species and assessed its competitive ability against other species over a range of stocking densities. Oedogonium had the highest productivity (8.0 g ash free dry weight m-2 day-1), lowest ash content (3-8%), lowest water content (fresh weigh: dry weight ratio of 3.4), highest carbon content (45%) and highest bioenergy potential (higher heating value 20 MJ/kg) compared to Cladophora and Spirogyra. The higher productivity of Oedogonium relative to Cladophora and Spirogyra was consistent when algae were cultured with and without the addition of CO2 across three aeration treatments. Therefore, Oedogonium was selected as our primary target species. The competitive ability of Oedogonium was assessed by growing it in bi-cultures and polycultures with Cladophora and Spirogyra over a range of stocking densities. Cultures were initially stocked with equal proportions of each species, but after three weeks of growth the proportion of Oedogonium had increased to at least 96% (±7 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Spirogyra bi-cultures, 86% (±16 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Cladophora bi-cultures and 82% (±18 S.E.) in polycultures. The high productivity, bioenergy potential and competitive dominance of Oedogonium make this species an ideal freshwater macroalgal target for large-scale production and a valuable biomass source for bioenergy applications. These results demonstrate that freshwater macroalgae are thus far an under-utilised feedstock with much potential for biomass applications. © 2013 Lawton et al.

AB  - Biofuels have the potential to be sustainable, secure, low carbon footprint transportation fuels. Primarily due to government mandates, biofuels have become increasingly adopted as transportation fuels over the last decade and are projected to steadily increase in production. Here the prospects of biofuels are summarized in terms of several important performance measures, including: lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy return on investment (EROI), land and water requirements, and tailpipe emissions. A review of the literature leads to the conclusion that most first-generation biofuels, including corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel produced in the United States, reduce tailpipe pollutant emissions and GHG emissions-provided their feedstocks do not replace large quantities of fixed carbon. However, their production is perhaps unsustainable due to low EROI and significant land-use and water requirements. Second-generation biofuels; for example ethanol produced from lignocellulosic biomass, have the potential for larger reductions in GHG emissions and can provide sustainable EROI with reasonable land area usage; however, they require water inputs several orders-of-magnitude greater than required by petroleum fuels. Advanced biofuels from algal oils and synthetic biological processes are further from commercial reality and require more assessment but potentially offer better performance due to their orders-of-magnitude greater yields per land area and lower water requirements; at present, the energy costs of such biofuels are uncertain. © 2013 by ASME.

AB  - Bio-oils produced from small-scale pyrolysis may have economic and environmental benefits for both densifying agricultural biomass and supplying local bioenergy markets with fossil energy alternatives to support state policies (e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standards). We analyze the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG), energy, and cost tradeoffs for farm-scale bio-oil production via fast pyrolysis of corn stover feedstock and subsequent utilization for power generation in the state of Pennsylvania. We evaluate the life cycle ramifications of either cofiring the biochar coproduct with coal in existing power plants for energy generation, or using the biochar as a land amendment within the agricultural sector. The results show GHG emissions of 217 and 84 g CO2e per kWh of bio-oil electricity for coal cofiring and land amendment, respectively. Cofiring biochar with coal displaces more fossil energy than does land application. We discuss the potential for bio-oil and biochar penetrating near-term electricity markets (c. 2015). Our analysis shows that the electricity produced from burning pyrolysis oil and biochar with variable operating costs of $93/MWh and $18/MWh, respectively, are competitive with the fuel oil and coal electricity markets in Pennsylvania within the vicinity of the agricultural sites supplying biomass in spite of the potentially higher NOx emissions due to nitrogen present in the fuel. Small scale pyrolysis bio-oil may be an economically viable and environmentally sustainable near-term option for peak power production and for meeting the state's Renewable Portfolio Standards. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The C4 perennial grass Miscanthus giganteus has proved to be a promising bio-energy crop. However, the biomass recalcitrance is a major challenge in biofuel production. Effective pretreatment is necessary for achieving a high efficiency in converting the crop to fermentable sugars, and subsequently biofuels and other valued products. Results: Miscanthus lutarioriparious was pretreated with a liquid hot water (LHW) reactor. Between the pretreatment severity (PS) of 2.56-4.71, the solid recovery was reduced; cellulose recovery remained nearly unchanged; and the Klason lignin content was slightly increased which was mainly due to the dissolving of hemicellulose and the production of a small amount of pseudo-lignin. The result shows that a LHW PS of 4.71 could completely degrade the hemicellulose in Miscanthus. Hemicellulose removal dislodged the enzymatic barrier of cellulose, and the ethanol conversion of 98.27% was obtained. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that LHW served as an effective pretreatment in case that Miscanthus lutarioriparious was used for ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The combination and the pretreatment method of Miscanthus feedstock holds a great potential for biofuel production. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A key advantage of using microalgae for biofuel production is the ability of some algal strains to thrive in waters unsuitable for conventional crop irrigation such as saline groundwater or seawater. Nonetheless, the availability of sustainable water supplies will provide significant challenges for scale-up and development of algal biofuels. We conduct a partial techno-economic assessment based on the availability of freshwater, saline groundwater, and seawater for use in open pond algae cultivation systems. We explore water issues through GIS-based models of algae biofuel production, freshwater supply (constrained to less than 5% of mean annual flow per watershed) and costs, and cost-distance models for supplying seawater and saline groundwater. We estimate that, combined, these resources can support 9.46 × 107 m 3 yr-1 (25 billion gallons yr-1) of renewable biodiesel production in the coterminous United States. Achievement of larger targets requires the utilization of less water efficient sites and relatively expensive saline waters. Despite the addition of freshwater supply constraints and saline water resources, the geographic conclusions are similar to our previous results. Freshwater availability and saline water delivery costs are most favorable for the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and Florida peninsula, where evaporation relative to precipitation is moderate. As a whole, the barren and scrub lands of the southwestern U.S. have limited freshwater supplies, and large net evaporation rates greatly increase the cost of saline alternatives due to the added makeup water required to maintain pond salinity. However, this and similar analyses are particularly sensitive to knowledge gaps in algae growth/lipid production performance and the proportion of freshwater resources available, key topics for future investigation. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To better understand the sources of PM10 samples in Mumbai, India, aerosol chemical composition, i.e., total carbon (TC), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and inorganic ions were studied together with specific markers such as methanesulfonate (MSA), oxalic acid (C2), azelaic acid (C9), and levoglucosan. The results revealed that biofuel/biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion are the major sources of the Mumbai aerosols. Nitrogen-isotopic (δ15N) composition of aerosol total nitrogen, which ranged from 18.1 to 25.4 ‰, also suggests that biofuel/biomass burning is a predominate source in both the summer and winter seasons. Aerosol mass concentrations of major species increased 3-4 times in winter compared to summer, indicating enhanced emission from these sources in the winter season. Photochemical production tracers, C2 diacid and nssSO42-, do not show diurnal changes. Concentrations of C2 diacid and WSOC show a strong correlation (r2 = 0.95). In addition, WSOC to OC (or TC) ratios remain almost constant for daytime (0.37 ± 0.06 (0.28 ± 0.04)) and nighttime (0.38 ± 0.07 (0.28 ± 0.06)), suggesting that mixing of fresh secondary organic aerosols is not significant and the Mumbai aerosols are photochemically well processed. Concentrations of MSA and C9 diacid present a positive correlation (r 2 = 0.75), indicating a marine influence on Mumbai aerosols in addition to local/regional influence. Backward air mass trajectory analyses further suggested that the Mumbai aerosols are largely influenced by long-range continental and regional transport. Stable C-isotopic ratios (δ13C) of TC ranged from -27.0 to -25.4‰, with slightly lower average (-26.5 ± 0.3 ‰) in summer than in winter (-25.9 ± 0.3 ‰). Positive correlation between WSOC/TC ratios and δ13C values suggested that the relative increment in 13C of wintertime TC may be caused by prolonged photochemical processing of organic aerosols in this season. This study suggests that in winter, the tropical aerosols are more aged due to longer residence time in the atmosphere than in summer aerosols. However, these conclusions are based on the analysis of a limited number of samples (n = 25) and more information on this topic may be needed from other similar coastal sites in future. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Carbohydrate structures are modified and degraded in the biosphere by a myriad of mostly hydrolytic enzymes. Recently, lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases (LPMOs) were discovered as a new class of enzymes for cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides that instead employ an oxidative mechanism. LPMOs employ copper as the catalytic metal and are dependent on oxygen and reducing agents for activity. LPMOs are found in many fungi and bacteria, but to date no basidiomycete LPMO has been structurally characterized. Here we present the three-dimensional crystal structure of the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium GH61D LPMO, and, for the first time, measure the product distribution of LPMO action on a lignocellulosic substrate. The structure reveals a copper-bound active site common to LPMOs, a collection of aromatic and polar residues near the binding surface that may be responsible for regioselectivity, and substantial differences in loop structures near the binding face compared with other LPMO structures. The activity assays indicate that this LPMO primarily produces aldonic acids. Last, molecular simulations reveal conformational changes, including the binding of several regions to the cellulose surface, leading to alignment of three tyrosine residues on the binding face of the enzyme with individual cellulose chains, similar to what has been observed for family 1 carbohydrate-binding modules. A calculated potential energy surface for surface translation indicates that P. chrysosporium GH61D exhibits energy wells whose spacing seems adapted to the spacing of cellobiose units along a cellulose chain.

AB  - Of late, decrease in mineral oil supplies has stimulated research on use of biomass as an alternative energy source. Climate change has brought problems such as increased drought and erratic rains. This, together with a rise in land degeneration problems with concomitant loss in soil fertility has inspired the scientific world to look for alternative bio-energy species. Euphorbia tirucalli L., a tree with C3/CAM metabolism in leaves/stem, can be cultivated on marginal, arid land and could be a good alternative source of biofuel.We analyzed a broad variety of E. tirucalli plants collected from different countries for their genetic diversity using AFLP. Physiological responses to induced drought stress were determined in a number of genotypes by monitoring growth parameters and influence on photosynthesis. For future breeding of economically interesting genotypes, rubber content and biogas production were quantified.Cluster analysis shows that the studied genotypes are divided into two groups, African and mostly non-African genotypes. Different genotypes respond significantly different to various levels of water. Malate measurement indicates that there is induction of CAM in leaves following drought stress. Rubber content varies strongly between genotypes. An investigation of the biogas production capacities of six E. tirucalli genotypes reveals biogas yields higher than from rapeseed but lower than maize silage. © 2013 Hastilestari et al.

AB  - Over the last decade, dramatic growth in the global production of biofuels has in turn fuelled immense criticism. This has been directed towards the form of that growth, which has in many ways been the culmination of a broader transformation of global agricultural production processes. Criticism has focused on the dominance of agri-business multi-nationals in production processes, large-scale land alienation in developing countries, adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts and greater food insecurity. In responding to such concerns, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) is a high profile transnational multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the 'sustainability' of the production of biofuels. Sustainability standards such as these have become a widespread form of global governance over agricultural production. This paper considers the RSB as a vehicle for considering how such interventions might be better understood in their contribution to wider change. It suggests an approach that focuses on broader standard processes so as to interrogate how such change is actually unfolding in the way it is and how political struggles in their production may be masked by a narrower interpretation of the standards themselves. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The high cost of transportation fuels and the environmental risks associated with acquiring and using nonrenewable energy sources have created a demand for developing renewable bioenergy crops. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a warm-season perennial grass, is a promising feedstock due to its high biomass production under a wide range of growing conditions and its satisfactory forage quality and chemical composition. West Virginia contains vast expanses of reclaimed surface mine lands that could be used to produce switchgrass as a bioenergy feedstock. Th is study determined dry matter yields of three switchgrass varieties (Cave-In-Rock, Shawnee, and Carthage) during the second to fourth years of production. Two research sites were established on reclaimed surface mines in southern West Virginia: Hobet and Hampshire. The Hobet site was prepared using crushed, unweathered sandstone as the soil material, and yields were signifi cantly lower at 803 kg ha-1 averaged across varieties and years than annual yields at Hampshire. The highest yield at Hobet, with Shawnee in the third year, was 1964 kg ha-1. The Hamphire site, which was reclaimed in the late 1990s using topsoil and treated municipal sludge, averaged 5760 kg ha-1 of switchgrass across varieties and years. The highest yield, obtained with Cavein-Rock during the third year, was 9222 kg ha-1. Switchgrass yields on agricultural lands in this region averaged 12,000 kg ha-1. Although average switchgrass yields at Hampshire were about 50% lower than agricultural lands, they were greater than a target yield of 5000 kg ha-1, a threshold for economically feasible production. Yields during the fourth year from a two-harvest per year system were not signifi cantly different from a single, end-of-year harvest at both sites. Reclaimed lands show promise for growing bioenergy crops such as switchgrass on areas where topsoil materials are replaced and amended like that at the Hampshire site. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - When the G20 took up food security in 2010, many were optimistic that it could bring about positive change by addressing structural problems in commodity markets that were contributing to high and volatile food prices and exacerbating hungerIts members could tighten the regulation of agricultural commodity futures markets, support multilateral trade rules that would better reflect both importer and exporter needs, end renewable fuel targets that diverted land to biofuels production, and coordinate food reservesIn this article, we argue that although the G20 took on food security as a focus area, it missed an important opportunity and has shown that it is not the most appropriate forum for food security policyInstead of tackling the structural economic dimensions of food security, the G20 chose to promote smoothing and coping measures within the current global economic frameworkBy shifting the focus away from structural issues, the G20 has had a chilling effect on policy debates in other global food security forums, especially the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS)In addition, the G20 excludes the voices of the least developed countries and civil society, and lacks the expertise and capacity to implement its recommendations© 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Energy crops can provide a sustainable source of power and fuels, and mitigate the negative effects of CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel use. Miscanthus is a perennial C4 energy crop capable of producing large biomass yields whilst requiring low levels of input. Miscanthus is largely unimproved and therefore there could be significant opportunities to increase yield. Further increases in yield will improve the economics, energy balance, and carbon mitigation of the crop, as well as reducing land-take. One strategy to increase yield in Miscanthus is to maximize the light captured through an extension of canopy duration. In this study, canopy duration was compared among a diverse collection of 244 Miscanthus genotypes. Canopy duration was determined by calculating the number of days between canopy establishment and senescence. Yield was positively correlated with canopy duration. Earlier establishment and later senescence were also both separately correlated with higher yield. However, although genotypes with short canopy durations were low yielding, not all genotypes with long canopy durations were high yielding. Differences of yield between genotypes with long canopy durations were associated with variation in stem and leaf traits. Different methodologies to assess canopy duration traits were investigated, including visual assessment, image analysis, light interception, and different trait thresholds. The highest correlation coefficients were associated with later assessments of traits and the use of quantum sensors for canopy establishment. A model for trait optimization to enable yield improvement in Miscanthus and other bioenergy crops is discussed. © 2013 © The Author(2) [2013].

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a common veterinary antibiotic in biogas plants. 20 mg/kg of oxytetracycline was intramuscularly injected into a cow and its concentration in manure, which was sampled daily during the following 20 days, was measured. A total of 20 % of the injected oxytetracycline was detected in manure. Collected manure samples on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 were digested in triplicate serum bottles at 37 C for 30 days. Control serum bottles produced 255 ± 13 mL biogas, whereas 50-60 % inhibitions were obtained for the serum bottles operated with samples collected for the 5 days after medication. Multivariate statistics used for the evaluation of FISH results showed that Methanomicrobiales were the main methanogenic group responsible for most of the biogas production. Numbers of active Bacteria and Methanomicrobiales were negatively correlated with the presence of oxytetracycline, whereas Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales were less affected. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The expansion of a given land use may affect deforestation directly if forests are cleared to free land for this use, or indirectly, via the displacement of other land-use activities from non-forest areas towards the forest frontier. Unlike direct land conversion, indirect land-use changes affecting deforestation are not immediately observable. They require the linking of changes occurring in different regions. This paper empirically assesses the possible indirect effects of sugarcane expansion in Brazil's state of São Paulo, on forest conversion decisions in the country's Amazon region. Further, it examines the evidence for a mechanism through which these effects might materialize, namely a displacement of cattle ranching activities from São Paulo state to the Amazon. The results suggest a positive relationship between sugarcane expansion and deforestation. This indirect land-use effect is shown to be a dynamic process materializing over 10-15 years. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Saline lands are characterized by salinity and nutrient deficiency and there is an ever increasing need for economical, adaptable plant species to rejuvenate these lands. In this study, we determined the suitability and tolerance of Euphorbia lathyris L. (Caper spurge), a well-known biofuel plant, as a sustainable candidate to colonize saline lands. We investigated the germination rate, seedling growth, solute change and anti-oxidative enzyme activities etc. under salt stress conditions. Our results showed that Caper spurge seeds prefer to germinate under nonsaline environments and high salt stress induced temporary dormancy during germination, but did not completely hamper the viability of the seeds. The seedling biomass increased without any visible distress symptoms in the presence of NaCl not over 171 mM. Further increase in NaCl concentration had a negative impact on the seedling growth. These demonstrate that Caper spurge seedlings have the potential to grow in saline lands. The salinity tolerance of Caper spurge seedlings was closely associated with the regional distribution of Na+ in roots, stable absorption of Ca2 +, K+ and Mg2 +, accumulation of organic solutes, and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes. However, excessive accumulation of Na+, sharp increase of superoxide (O2 -), H2O2, malonaldehyde (MDA) and cell membrane leakage, reduction of osmoprotectants, and decreased activities of CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) etc. under high salinity might be the reasons for the restrained seedling growth. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biomethane is a gaseous energy vector that can be produced via thermochemical (gasification) or biological (anaerobic digestion) routes. Biomethane may be used as a renewable fuel for transport, for power generation, or for heating. In this paper, the net energy of biomethane derived from a hectare of willow using a gasification process is detailed and shown to be in the range of 83 to 117GJ/ha/a; the precise value is dependent on the process efficiency assumptions. This was compared to existing studies on grass biomethane produced via biological routes. The net energy of both biological and gasification processes is very similar. The net energy per hectare of the biomethane systems is of the same order of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. It is suggested that the rationale for choosing between these two methods of generating biomethane may be based on economic considerations and it is more likely that the biological route will win out in Ireland due to the investment required to set up such an industry. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines potential changes in solid waste policies for the reduction in GHG for the country of Brazil and one of its major states and cities, Rio de Janeiro, from 2005 to 2030. To examine these policy options, trends in solid waste quantities and associated GHG emissions are derived. Three alternative policy scenarios are evaluated in terms of effectiveness, technology, and economics and conclusions posited regarding optimal strategies for Brazil to implement. These scenarios are been building on the guidelines for national inventories of GHG emissions (. IPCC, 2006) and adapted to Brazilian states and municipalities' boundaries. Based on the results, it is possible to say that the potential revenue from products of solid waste management is more than sufficient to transform the current scenario in this country into one of financial and environmental gains, where the negative impacts of climate change have created a huge opportunity to expand infrastructure for waste management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interest in renewable energy sources derived from plant biomass is increasing, raising concerns about fuel vs. food competition. One strategy to produce additional cellulosic biomass without reducing food-harvest potential is to grow winter cover crops after harvest of the primary summer crop. This study estimated biomass accumulation of a fall-planted winter rye (Secale cereale L.) double crop across the United States on corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] croplands. We identified corn and soybean areas by county using National Agricultural Statistics Service data, excluding irrigated land and areas already supporting a winter small-grain crop. Within this area, we calculated biomass production after corn harvest and before the subsequent corn or soybean crop for 30 locations using RyeGro, a cover-crop simulation model. Average RyeGro biomass yields for a 14-yr period were used to develop a regression model based on temperature and precipitation, which was used to determine rye biomass potential in each county. The spatial analysis indicated that 7.44 Mha in continuous corn and 31.7 Mha in a corn- soybean rotation are suitable for producing winter rye. The average RyeGro biomass yield for the 30 locations for six planting- harvest date scenarios is 4.2 Mg ha-1. The regression modeling results projected that 112 to 151 Tg (120-170 million U.S. tons) of rye biomass can be harvested from this land base 14 to 7 d, respectively, before spring crop planting. The study demonstrates the sizable potential for this strategy to produce cellulosic biofuel feedstock without redirecting the primary food crop to fuel. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Perennial grain cropping systems could address a number of contemporary agroecological problems, including soil degradation, NO3 leaching, and soil C loss. Since it is likely that these systems will be rotated with other agronomic crops, a better understanding of how rapidly perennial grain systems improve local ecosystem services is needed. We quantified soil moisture, lysimeter NO3 leaching, soil labile C accrual, and grain yields in the first 2 yr of a perennial grain crop under development [kernza wheatgrass, Tinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth &amp; D.R. Dewey] relative to annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under three management systems. Overall, differences between annual and perennial plants were much greater than differences observed due to management. In the second year, perennial kernza reduced soil moisture at lower depths and reduced total NO3 leaching (by 86% or more) relative to annual wheat, indicating that perennial roots actively used more available soil water and captured more applied fertilizer than annual roots. Carbon mineralization rates beneath kernza during the second year were increased 13% compared with annual wheat. First-year kernza grain yields were 4.5% of annual wheat, but second year yields increased to 33% of wheat with a harvest index of 0.10. Although current yields are modest, the realized ecosystem services associated with this developing crop are promising and are a compelling reason to continue breeding efforts for higher yields and for use as a multipurpose crop (e.g., grain, forage, and biofuel). © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy., 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - One of the major challenges of the National Biofuel Policy in India is to achieve a target of 20% blending of biodiesel by 2017. This demands expansion of area under jatropha plantation, as jatropha is the major source of biodiesel in India. Under this background, present paper makes an attempt to analyze the influences of the factors that motivate farmers to expand area under jatropha plantation in North East India. The study shows that education, attitude towards jatropha, unutilized suitable land for jatropha, minimum expected income from jatropha, percentage of agricultural income to total income, technical help, and risk are found to have statistically significant influences on the decision of expansion of jatropha plantation. The study has important implication for framing suitable policy measures for expansion of biodiesel production in the region. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ground-level ozone is a priority air pollutant, causing ∼ 22,000 excess deaths per year in Europe, significant reductions in crop yields and loss of biodiversity. It is produced in the troposphere through photochemical reactions involving oxides of nitrogen (NO x) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The biosphere is the main source of VOCs, with an estimated 1,150 TgC yr -1 (∼ 90% of total VOC emissions) released from vegetation globally. Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is the most significant biogenic VOC in terms of mass (around 500 TgC yr -1) and chemical reactivity and plays an important role in the mediation of ground-level ozone concentrations. Concerns about climate change and energy security are driving an aggressive expansion of bioenergy crop production and many of these plant species emit more isoprene than the traditional crops they are replacing. Here we quantify the increases in isoprene emission rates caused by cultivation of 72 Mha of biofuel crops in Europe. We then estimate the resultant changes in ground-level ozone concentrations and the impacts on human mortality and crop yields that these could cause. Our study highlights the need to consider more than simple carbon budgets when considering the cultivation of biofuel feedstock crops for greenhouse-gas mitigation. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Evaluation of biofuel production cropping systems should address not only energy yields but also the impacts on soil attributes. In this study, forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cropping systems were initiated on a low organic matter soil (<0.9 %) with a history of intensively tilled low-input cotton production in the semiarid Southern High Plains of the U. S. Sorghum cropping systems were evaluated in a split-plot design with sorghum cultivar as the main plot and the combination of irrigation level (non-irrigated and deficit irrigated) and aboveground biomass removal rate (50 % and 100 %) as the split plot. The sorghum cultivars used varied in yield potential and lignin content, which are important features for feedstock-producing crops. Within 1 year, the transition from long-term cotton cropping systems to sorghum biofuel cropping systems resulted in increased soil microbial biomass C (16 %) and N (17 %) and shifts in the microbial community composition as indicated by differences in fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles. Additionally, enzyme activities targeting C, N, P and S cycles increased 15-75 % (depending on the enzyme) after two growing seasons. Increased enzyme activities (16-19 %) and differences in FAME profiles were seen due to irrigation regardless of aboveground biomass removal rate. Biomass removal rate and the cultivar type had little effect on the soil microbial properties during the time frame of this study. Early results from this study suggest improvements in soil quality and the sustainability of sorghum biofuel cropping for low organic matter agricultural soils. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).

AB  - Background: The study presented here has used the commercial flow sheeting program Aspen Plus™ to evaluate techno-economic aspects of large-scale hemp-based processes for producing transportation fuels. The co-production of biogas, district heat and power from chopped and steam-pretreated hemp, and the co-production of ethanol, biogas, heat and power from steam-pretreated hemp were analysed. The analyses include assessments of heat demand, energy efficiency and process economics in terms of annual cash flows and minimum biogas and ethanol selling prices (MBSP and MESP). Results: Producing biogas, heat and power from chopped hemp has the highest overall energy efficiency, 84% of the theoretical maximum (based on lower heating values), providing that the maximum capacity of district heat is delivered. The combined production of ethanol, biogas, heat and power has the highest energy efficiency (49%) if district heat is not produced. Neither the inclusion of steam pretreatment nor co-production with ethanol has a large impact on the MBSP. Ethanol is more expensive to produce than biogas is, but this is compensated for by its higher market price. None of the scenarios examined are economically viable, since the MBSP (EUR 103-128 per MWh) is higher than the market price of biogas (EUR 67 per MWh). The largest contribution to the cost is the cost of feedstock. Decreasing the retention time in the biogas process for low solids streams by partly replacing continuous stirred tank reactors by high-rate bioreactors decreases the MBSP. Also, recycling part of the liquid from the effluent from anaerobic digestion decreases the MBSP. The production and prices of methane and ethanol influence the process economics more than the production and prices of electricity and district heat. Conclusions: To reduce the production cost of ethanol and biogas from biomass, the use of feedstocks that are cheaper than hemp, give higher output of ethanol and biogas, or combined production with higher value products are primarily suggested. Further, practical investigations on increased substrate concentration in biogas and ethanol production, recycling of the liquid in anaerobic digestion and separation of low solids flows into solid and a liquid fraction for improved reactor applications deserves further attention. © 2013 Barta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - One of the greatest current challenges is to find cost-effective and eco-friendly solutions to the ever increasing needs of modern society. Some plant species are suitable for a multitude of biotechnological applications such as bioenergy production and phytoremediation. A sustainable practice is to use energy crops to clean up polluted lands or to treat wastewater in constructed wetlands without claiming further arable land for biofuel production. However, the disposal of combustion by-products may add significant costs to the whole process, especially when it deals with toxic waste. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of recycling ash from energy biomass as a fertilizer for agriculture and forestry. In particular, the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn were analyzed in the plant tissues and corresponding ash of the grasses Phragmites australis and Arundo donax, collected in an urban stream affected by domestic sewage. Results showed that the metal concentration in ash is 1.5-3 times as high as the values in plant tissues. However, metal enriched ash showed much lower element concentrations than the legal limits for ash reutilization in agriculture and forestry. This study found that biomass ash from constructed wetlands may be considered as a potential fertilizer rather than hazardous waste. Energy from biomass can be a really sustainable and clean option not only through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but also through ash recycling for beneficial purposes, thus minimizing the negative impacts of disposal. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the years, culturable cellulase-producing microorganisms have been isolated from a variety of sources and genes of cellulolytic enzymes have been cloned. Then again, the "great plate count anomaly" phenomenon necessitates a culture-independent metagenomic approach for the isolation of cellulolytic genes from microorganisms in their natural environment. We have constructed a metagenomic library derived from rice straw composts. Of 2739 clones screened, a lambda clone carrying a 12. kb genomic fragment was able to yield a clear zone on an agar plate containing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). A 4.7. kb subclone, generated by restriction enzyme digestion, was found to harbor a GH12 cellulase gene, RSC-EG1, encoding 464 amino acids along with two other ORFs. The identified cellulolytic gene showed more than 70% similarity on the amino acid level with cellulase from Micromonospora aurantiaca and Thermobispora sp. Interestingly, RSC-EG1 contains a stretch of approximately 86 amino acids not present in either of these close relatives. Our results demonstrated that RSC-EG1, stable over a wide temperature and pH range, is a novel endoglucanase, and provided the first example of metagenomics approach to isolate cellulolytic gene from rice straw composts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - High productivity processes are critical for commercial production of cellulosic ethanol. One high productivity process-continuous hydrolysis and fermentation-has been applied in corn ethanol industry. However, little research related to this process has been conducted on cellulosic ethanol production. Here, we report and compare the kinetics of both batch SHF (separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation) and SSCF (simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation) of AFEX™ (Ammonia Fiber Expansion) pretreated corn stover (AFEX™-CS). Subsequently, we designed a SSCF process to evaluate continuous hydrolysis and fermentation performance on AFEX™-CS in a series of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Based on similar sugar to ethanol conversions (around 80% glucose-to-ethanol conversion and 47% xylose-to-ethanol conversion), the overall process ethanol productivity for continuous SSCF was 2.3- and 1.8-fold higher than batch SHF and SSCF, respectively. Slow xylose fermentation and high concentrations of xylose oligomers were the major factors limiting further enhancement of productivity. Biotechnol.

AB  - This study examines the Jatropha adoption process in Sarawak, Malaysia, a land rich in biological and ethnic diversity, but highly impoverished. Attempts to alleviate poverty through oil palm plantation development resulted in internationally condemned destruction of peat lands. Sarawak subsequently turned to the inedible, low-input, exportable, biodiesel feedstock Jatropha. This case study argues that Jatropha is unlikely to make more significant socio-economic contributions than oil palm or other cash crops. The analysis suggests that companies use social capital to aggressively expand their Jatropha business among the native population in order to gain access to native customary lands, which are often underproductive peat lands. Global biofuels sector development dynamics are examined through the lenses of political economics and social, agricultural, and energy studies. The research finds that farmers' decisions to participate in the biofuels global value chain may result in negative income effects, household food security reduction, and biodiversity loss from peat land destruction. The paper concludes with a proposal for an alternative approach to evaluate both social and financial drivers in order to prevent the negative effects of biofuel-based agribusiness on human and environmental systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel policies affect global agricultural and oil commodity markets, whose response has consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Estimates of the net GHG impact of biofuel policies are wide ranging and shrouded in uncertainty. We perform a Monte Carlo experiment using a stylized model of the global liquid fuel market and compare different biofuel policies with respect to global GHG emissions and global oil consumption taking ILUC emissions into consideration. We find that for the currently commercial biofuels, inclusion of ILUC emissions as part of the policy rating of biofuels' GHG intensity: (i) likely leads to lower emissions; (ii) leads to greater reduction in both domestic and global oil consumption; (iii) leads to higher price of fuels in the home region; all compared to when ILUC emissions are excluded from the policy rating; and (iv) does not, however, ensure that emissions absolutely decline, owing to fuel market effects, which, unlike ILUC, are presently excluded from all existing fuel GHG regulations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that ILUC emissions and the price elasticity of oil supply are the greatest contributors to variance in net global GHG emissions under any given policy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research examines the economic implications of different designs for a national low carbon fuel standard (NLCFS) for the road transportation sector. A NLCFS based on the average Carbon Intensity (CI) of all fuels sold generates an incentive for fuel suppliers to reduce the measured CI of their fuels. The economic impacts are determined by the availability of low carbon fuels, estimates of which can vary widely. Also important are the compliance path, reference level CI, and the design of the credit system, particularly the opportunities for trading and banking. To quantitatively examine the implications of a NLCFS, we created the Transportation Regulation and Credit Trading (TRACT) Model. With TRACT, we model a NLCFS credit trading system among profit maximizing fuel suppliers for light- and heavy-duty vehicle fuel use for the United States from 2012 to 2030. We find that credit trading across gasoline and diesel fuel markets can lower the average costs of carbon reductions by an insignificant amount to 98% depending on forecasts of biofuel supplies and carbon intensities. Adding banking of credits on top of trading can further lower the average cost of carbon reductions by 5%-9% and greatly reduce year-to-year fluctuations in credit prices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biofuels can increase land competition, leading to global land use change (LUC). LUC poses risks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and food prices. The magnitude of the risk is uncertain, but could be significant. Given these uncertainties and risks, we suggest that policymakers pursue a mix of the following three strategies: (1) promote feedstocks that rely less on land; (2) reduce LUC risk for land-using feedstocks; and (3) stimulate investments that increase land productivity and environmental protection. To realize these three strategies, we recommend that policymakers distinguish among feedstocks based on LUC risk; explore certifying production that avoids land competition; and adopt policy mechanisms that encourage investments in LUC-prone areas. We favor including feedstock-specific LUC emissions estimates in policies despite relatively large scientific uncertainty. While misleadingly precise, point estimates can be selected from science-based ranges to directly link LUC policy to emissions and provide strong transparent signals to biofuel investors. LUC emissions estimates can be updated regularly (~3-5 years) to reflect improvements in scientific understanding, and global changes in policy and economic environments. With or without LUC emissions point estimates, additional policies, some outside the biofuel sector, will be needed to pursue the three strategies above. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the economic and GHG implications of stacking a low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) with and without a carbon price policy on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). We compare the performance of various policy combinations for food and fuel prices, fuel mix and fuel consumption. We also analyze the economic costs and benefits of alternative policy combinations and their distributional effects for consumers and producers in the transportation and agricultural sector in the US. Using a dynamic, multi-market, partial equilibrium model of the transportation and agricultural sectors, we find that combining the RFS with an LCFS policy leads to a reduction in first generation biofuels and an increase in second generation biofuels compared to the RFS alone. This policy combination also achieves greater reduction in GHG emissions even after considering offsetting market mediated effects. Imposition of a carbon price with the RFS and LCFS policy primarily induces fuel conservation and achieves larger GHG emissions reduction compared to the other policy scenarios. All these policy combinations lead to higher net economic benefits for the transportation and agricultural sectors relative to the no policy baseline because they improve the terms of trade for US. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Policies formulated to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as a low-carbon fuel standard, frequently rely on life-cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate emissions, but LCA results are often highly uncertain. This study develops life-cycle models that quantitatively and qualitatively describe the uncertainty and variability in GHG emissions for both fossil fuels and ethanol and examines mechanisms to reduce those uncertainties in the policy process. Uncertainty regarding emissions from gasoline is non-negligible, with an estimated 90% confidence interval ranging from 84 to 100gCO2e/MJ. Emissions from biofuels have greater uncertainty. The widths of the 90% confidence intervals for corn and switchgrass ethanol are estimated to be on the order of 100gCO2e/MJ, and removing emissions from indirect land use change still leaves significant remaining uncertainty. Though an opt-in policy mechanism can reduce some uncertainty by incentivizing producers to self-report fuel production parameters, some important parameters, such as land use change emissions and nitrogen volatilization, cannot be accurately measured and self-reported. Low-carbon fuel policies should explicitly acknowledge, quantify, and incorporate uncertainty in life cycle emissions in order to more effectively achieve emissions reductions. Two complementary ways to incorporate this uncertainty in low carbon fuel policy design are presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses the potential energy security implications of a national low carbon fuel standard (NLCFS). A low carbon fuel standard is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by targeting the fuel portion of the fuel-vehicle system. Specifically, a NLCFS would set national targets for the average carbon intensity (CI) of motor fuels, and establish a market for credits that allows fuel producers and importers to respond in a variety of ways to the signal provided by the credit price. An important method for lowering the CI of transportation is to substitute lower-carbon alternative fuels such as advanced biofuels, electricity, CNG, and H2. Despite the focus on GHGs, so long as transportation fuels remain dominated by petroleum, transportation fuel policies like a NLCFS also will be evaluated in terms of their energy security impacts. We examine the fuel substitutions that are projected to be induced by a NLCFS and consider the energy security implications of displacing higher carbon fuels, such as imported Canadian Oil Sands oil or certain imported crude oils, with lower-carbon domestic oil, biofuels, or lower carbon oil imported from other sources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may have adverse effects on urban air quality and human exposure to harmful pollutants. The use of bioethanol fuelled vehicles is increasing worldwide and may create new undesired pollution effects. Different measurement campaigns were performed in a pilot study to contribute to the understanding of the consequences associated with the use of bioethanol blended fuel (E95) on a series of pollutants. Ambient screening measurements of NO2, O3, acetic acid, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were performed at different urban locations, exposed and not exposed to the circulation of bioethanol buses. In addition, volatile organic compounds were measured at the exhaust pipe of a bioethanol fuelled bus, both under idling conditions (carbonyls; DNPH cartridge) and under on-road driving conditions applying online monitoring (PTR-TOF). Higher ambient acetaldehyde values were measured at locations exposed to bioethanol fuelled buses than at locations not exposed, and very high acetaldehyde and acetic acid values were measured from the exhaust pipe during driving conditions (acetaldehyde&gt;150ppm; acetic acid≈20-30ppm) and modelled at close distance to the bioethanol bus. Human exposure to high concentration of acetaldehyde is expected, and it may involve a significantly increased chance in developing cancer. The high concentration of acetic acid will involve odour annoyance and significant material degradation or corrosion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The question of whether or not biofuels help mitigate climate change has attracted much debate in the literature. Using a global computable general equilibrium model that explicitly represents land-use change impacts due to the expansion of biofuels, our study attempts to shed some light on this question. Our study shows that if biofuel mandates and targets currently announced by more than 40 countries around the world are implemented by 2020 using crop feedstocks and if both forests and pasture lands are used to meet the new land demands for biofuel expansion, this would cause net release of GHG emissions to the atmosphere until 2043 as the GHG emissions released through land-use change exceeds the reduction of emissions due to replacement of gasoline and diesel. On the other hand, if the use of forest lands is avoided by channeling only pasture lands to meet the demand for new lands, the net release of GHG emissions would cease by 2021, a year after the full implementation of the mandates and targets. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In the medium to long term, low fossil fuel availability will make it necessary to find alternatives. Mass production of biofuels will not be a practical solution because it requires strong competition for land that is used for growing food. Therefore, it will be necessary to revise the frame of transportation energy sources. The number of pure light- and heavy-duty electric vehicles could increase in urban areas. Instead, it will be hard to find a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine for extra-urban transport vehicles, therefore alternative synthetic fuels could be used to compensate for fossil fuel depletion. Aside from a small share obtainable from biomass, most synthetic fuels are expected to be obtained from coal. Among these, synthetic natural gas represents a very good solution. In fact, synthetic natural gas will be advantageous with respect to hydrogen, whose on-board storage will be an unsolved problem in the medium term, and with respect to synthetic liquid fuels, which require more energy in the production phase. Moreover, the carbon content of liquid fuels, which is higher than that of gaseous fuels, will be responsible for higher CO2 emissions from vehicles. Currently, natural gas has poor diffusion in the transport sector, and this paper highlights the motivations for favouring a policy aimed at increasing the share of gaseous fuel-powered vehicles. In addition to the low environmental impact, synthetic natural gas also offers the possibility of optimising the utilisation of future resources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard aims to increase the production of biofuels to improve energy efficiency and decrease carbon dioxide emissions in the US. The effectiveness of this regulation is being debated by the scientific community regarding carbon emissions from direct and indirect land-use change. A valid alternative may be to design policies that stimulate sustainable land use in biofuel production. This article develops a model that simulates a voluntary program to increase the land use efficiency in production of biofuels. This stochastic dynamic model optimizes the sustainability of biofuels producible by including climate information and participatory decisions on land use. The model is parameterized using the Maximum Entropy econometric technique to present a simulation of the program in the State of Alabama. The results of this simulation show that participatory decisions on land-use may increase the net energy value of produced biofuel up to 215.68% and reduce the carbon emissions by 19.67% towards the state energy goals. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Miscanthus, a promising feedstock for the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, will likely see a considerable increase in cultivation and production in the U.S. and Europe in the coming decades. To better predict the effect of this change on soil edaphic resources, we examined a Miscanthus sinensis-dominated grassland in its native range in southern Japan. Soil organic carbon age, accumulated carbon stock, and carbon source were determined on pyrolysis volatile (Py-V) and pyrolysis residue (Py-R) fractions of soil organic matter. Stable carbon isotopic composition of soil organic matter was also determined. Values of total sequestered C summed from two soil profiles (0-1.5m) were 515 and 559MgCha-1. Stable isotope analysis showed that about 66.8% of soil C, ranging from 52.0 to 84.8%, was derived from C4 plants. Variation of soil age indicated by 14C dates of Py-V and Py-R fractions was correlated linearly with soil depths with a R2 value ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. Phytolith data showed an increase in abundance of M. sinensis and Pleioblastus sect. Nezasa following a pyroclastic eruption 7kyrs ago, and a decrease in Sasa sect. Crassinodi from 12 to 7kyrs ago. Organic carbon flux ranged from 0.85 to 1.63MgCha-1yr-1 through 1.5-m soil profiles, and Miscanthus-derived carbon flux was distributed in a similar pattern to the total C throughout the soil profiles. Over a 12,000year history of land use at the Aso caldera, Japan, M. sinensis was found to be a major contributor to soil carbon and a sink for atmospheric CO2, which, under certain constraints, has implications for the potential sequestration of soil carbon under Miscanthus in cultivated conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The utilisation of anaerobic digestion to produce biogas as an energy source is a mature technology in many European countries but is yet to be developed in Ireland. In 2009, the EU issued the Renewable Energy Source Directive 2009/28/EC which requires a 20% share of renewable energy sources (heat and electricity) in final energy consumption for all member states, respectively, including a 10% share of biofuels in the transport sector by 2020. The introduction of biogas to produce power and electricity in the form of CHP technology and biomethane as a transport fuel can help Ireland achieve the mandatory targets set by the directive. The key focus of the paper is to determine the optimum small to medium scale biogas technology and the impact the introduction of that technology infrastructure will have on renewable energy targets for Ireland. In terms of feedstock, agricultural sources such as energy crops and slurry offer a sustainable input to the anaerobic digestion process. The crop rotations under consideration consist of different arrangements of grass silage, maize silage and barley. Grass silage is found to be the most suitable crop for biogas energy production while biogas upgrading to biomethane as a transport fuel has the optimum technology potential in Ireland. To fuel a car operating on biomethane, 0.22 ha of grass land is required annually. Full scale national development of 5% of the area under grass in Ireland will contribute 11.4% of renewable energy to the total final transport energy demand by 2020, surpassing the target set by the Renewable Energy Source Directive 2009/28/EC. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel policies (blend mandate or tax credit) have impacts on food and energy prices, and on land-use. The magnitude of these effects depends on the market response to price, and thus on the agricultural supply curve, which, in turn, depends on the land availability (quantity and agronomic quality) and relative prices. To understand these relationships, we develop a theoretical framework with an explicit representation of land heterogeneity. The elasticity of the supply curve is shown to be non-constant, depending on land heterogeneity and the availability of land for agricultural expansion. This influences the welfare economics of biofuels policies, and the possible carbon leakage in land and fuel markets. We emphasize that the impacts of biofuel policies on welfare and land-use change depend strongly on the potential development of the agricultural sector in terms of expansion and intensification, and not only on its current size. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calendula (Calendula officinalis L.) and camelina (Camelina sativa L.) can provide a domestic, renewable, non-food alternative to imported oil sources for bioenergy and industrial purposes. However, limited information exists concerning N fertilizer guidelines for these emerging oilseed crops. Therefore, a replicated greenhouse study was conducted to assess the growth and yield response of calendula and camelina to N fertility. Plants were grown in pots, and treatments consisted of fertilizing with urea at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0gNpot -1, corresponding to field-area equivalent rates of 0, 26, 52, 130, and 260kgha -1. Reproductive [i.e., flower and seed head (capitula) dry biomass (gplant -1), seed yield (gplant -1), seed-oil yield (gpot -1), and seed-oil content (gkg -1)] and vegetative parameters [i.e., root and shoot dry biomass, N concentration (mgg -1) and N uptake (mgNplant -1)] were used to assess crop response to N-fertility. Quadratic functions (r 2=0.93, P=0.05 and r 2=0.99, P=0.09) described the response of calendula capitula dry biomass and camelina seed yield gplant -1) to N fertilizer, respectively. These functions predicted maximum agronomic yields occurring at 0.65 and 0.75gNpot -1, for calendula and camelina, respectively. Camelina seed-oil content (gkg -1) declined from 390 to 360gkg -1 in response to N fertility, but because seed yield increased with N fertility, likewise, so did total seed-oil yield (gpot -1). Nitrogen uptake efficiency of aboveground vegetative biomass ranged about 19-29% for camelina). Maximum agronomic yield may compromise economic return, which needs to be considered when developing fertilizer recommendations for field production of these two oil-seed crops. © 2012 .

AB  - Background: Although α-linked xylose is a major constituent of the hemicelluloses of land plants, few secreted α-xylosidases have been described from fungi or bacteria. AxlA of Aspergillus niger is a secreted α-xylosidase that was earlier shown to promote the release of free glucose (Glc) and xylose (Xyl) from substrates containing α-linked xylose, including isoprimeverose (IP), the heptasaccharide subunit of pea xyloglucan (XG), and tamarind XG. Results: The utility of AxlA for enhancing release of free Glc and Xyl in combination with commercial enzyme cocktails from dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants was examined. Without AxlA supplementation, a mixture of CTec2 and HTec2 (both of which are derived from T. reesei) did not release significant levels of Glc from pea XG or tamarind XG. This is consistent with their lack of detectable α-xylosidase activity using model substrates. On alkaline hydrogen peroxide-pretreated corn stover, supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 (at a loading of 2.5 mg/g glucan) with AxlA (at a loading of 8 mg/g glucan) increased Glc yields from 82% to 88% of the total available Glc and increased Xyl yields from 55% to 60%. AxlA supplementation also improved Glc yields from corn stover treated with the commercial cellulase Accellerase 1000. The AxlA enhancement was not a general protein effect because bovine serum albumin or bovine gamma-globulin at similar concentrations did not enhance Glc yields from corn stover in response to CTec2/HTec2. Supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 with AxlA did not enhance Glc release from pretreated green or etiolated pea tissue. However, AxlA did enhance Glc and Xyl yields compared to CTec2/HTec2 alone from another dicotyledonous herbaceous plant, Chenopodium album (lamb's quarters). Conclusion: Supplementation of commercial cellulase cocktails with AxlA enhances yields of Glc and Xyl from some biomass substrates under some conditions, and may prove useful in industrial lignocellulose conversion. © 2013 Jabbour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Production of food crops on trace element-contaminated agricultural lands in the Campine region (Belgium) can be problematic as legal threshold values for safe use of these crops can be exceeded. Conventional sanitation of vast areas is too expensive and alternatives need to be investigated. Zea mays on a trace element-contaminated soil in the region showed an average yield of 53 ± 10 Mg fresh or 20 ± 3 Mg dry biomass ha-1. Whole plant Cd concentrations complied with legal threshold values for animal feed. Moreover, threshold values for use in anaerobic digestion were met. Biogas production potential did not differ between maize grown on contaminated and non-contaminated soils. Results suggested favorable perspectives for farmers to generate non-food crops profitably, although effective soil cleaning would be very slow. This demonstrates that a valuable and sustainable alternative use can be generated for moderately contaminated soils on which conventional agriculture is impaired. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A global biofuels program will potentially lead to intense pressures on land supply and cause widespread transformations in land use. These transformations can alter the Earth climate system by increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use changes and by changing the reflective and energy exchange characteristics of land ecosystems. Using an integrated assessment model that links an economic model with climate, terrestrial biogeochemistry, and biogeophysics models, we examined the biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects of possible land use changes from an expanded global second-generation bioenergy program on surface temperatures over the first half of the 21st century. Our integrated assessment model shows that land clearing, especially forest clearing, has two concurrent effects - increased GHG emissions, resulting in surface air warming; and large changes in the land's reflective and energy exchange characteristics, resulting in surface air warming in the tropics but cooling in temperate and polar regions. Overall, these biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects will only have a small impact on global mean surface temperature. However, the model projects regional patterns of enhanced surface air warming in the Amazon Basin and the eastern part of the Congo Basin. Therefore, global land use strategies that protect tropical forests could dramatically reduce air warming projected in these regions. Key Points Land-use changes from a global bioenergy program will impact the climate by 2050 Biofuels have a negligible impact on global climate but large regional impacts The climate impact of biofuels is influenced by the land use policy framework. ©2013.

AB  - The capacity of metal-dependent fungal and bacterial polysaccharide oxygenases, termed GH61 and CBM33, respectively, to potentiate the enzymatic degradation of cellulose opens new possibilities for the conversion of recalcitrant biomass to biofuels. GH61s have already been shown to be unique metalloenzymes containing an active site with a mononuclear copper ion coordinated by two histidines, one of which is an unusual τ-N-methylated N-terminal histidine. We now report the structural and spectroscopic characterization of the corresponding copper CBM33 enzymes. CBM33 binds copper with high affinity at a mononuclear site, significantly stabilizing the enzyme. X-band EPR spectroscopy of Cu(II)-CBM33 shows a mononuclear type 2 copper site with the copper ion in a distorted axial coordination sphere, into which azide will coordinate as evidenced by the concomitant formation of a new absorption band in the UV/vis spectrum at 390 nm. The enzyme's three-dimensional structure contains copper, which has been photoreduced to Cu(I) by the incident X-rays, confirmed by X-ray absorption/fluorescence studies of both aqueous solution and intact crystals of Cu-CBM33. The single copper(I) ion is ligated in a T-shaped configuration by three nitrogen atoms from two histidine side chains and the amino terminus, similar to the endogenous copper coordination geometry found in fungal GH61. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Twenty macropods from five locations in Queensland, Australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. Specifically, the V3/V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was examined. A total of 5040 OTUs were identified in the data set (post filtering). Thirty-two OTUs were identified as 'shared' OTUS (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes (Clostridiales/Bacteroidales). These phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. Genera represented within the shared OTUs included: unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Clostridiales, Peptococcus sp. Coprococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Blautia sp., Ruminoccocus sp., Eubacterium sp., Dorea sp., Oscillospira sp. and Butyrivibrio sp. The composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (Macropus rufus, Macropus giganteus and Macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. Specifically, eleven dominant OTUs that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Bacteroidales, Prevotella spp. and a Syntrophococcus sucromutans. Putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. Future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. Ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry. © 2013 Gulino et al.

AB  - Focusing on energy consumption of the agricultural sector and using renewable resources of energy have high importance for sustainable agriculture, minimizing also the problems for disposal. Besides the crops itself, large quantities of residues of agriculture are generated every year. These residues constitute a major part of the total annual production of biomass and could be an important source of energy both for domestic as well as industrial purposes. Among the most spread crops in southern Italy, attention has been focused on the residual biomass of globe artichoke, since the marketable heads, used for human nutrition, represents about the 20% of total biomass, and after their harvest a high amount of biomass remains in the fields. In addition, previous studies showed that globe artichoke crop residues (leaves+stalks) could be used to obtain lignocellulosic biomass for pellets production yielding good quantity of solid biofuel. In this work, data concerning the production of residual biomass (leaves, stalks and not-marketable heads) of 12 globe artichoke accessions were evaluated. Results showed, on average of the accessions, that crop for head production yielded more than 15 t ha-1 of DM of residual biomass and considering that the land involved in this cultivation is in restricted areas of Apulia, Sicily and Sardinia, the use of globe artichoke biomass residues to yield bioenergy could have the advantage to reduce also the costs of transport.

AB  - Agriculture is historically a dominant form of global environmental degradation, and the potential for increased future degradation may be driven by growing demand for food and biofuels. While these impacts have been explored using global gridded maps of croplands, such maps are based on relatively coarse spatial data. Here, we apply high-resolution cropland inventories for the conterminous U.S. with a land-use model to develop historical gridded cropland areas for the years 1850-2000 and year 2000 abandoned cropland maps. While the historical cropland maps are consistent with generally accepted land-use trends, our U.S. abandoned cropland estimates of 68 Mha are as much as 70% larger than previous gridded estimates due to a reduction in aggregation effects. Renewed cultivation on the subset of abandoned croplands that have not become forests or urban lands represents one approach to mitigating the future expansion of agriculture. Potential bioenergy production from these abandoned lands using a wide range of biomass yields and conversion efficiencies has an upper-limit of 5-30% of the current U.S. primary energy demand or 4-30% of the current U.S. liquid fuel demand. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that may accompany land-use change (LUC) from increased biofuel feedstock production are a source of debate in the discussion of drawbacks and advantages of biofuels. Estimates of LUC GHG emissions focus mainly on corn ethanol and vary widely. Increasing the understanding of LUC GHG impacts associated with both corn and cellulosic ethanol will inform the on-going debate concerning their magnitudes and sources of variability. Results: In our study, we estimate LUC GHG emissions for ethanol from four feedstocks: corn, corn stover, switchgrass, and miscanthus. We use new computable general equilibrium (CGE) results for worldwide LUC. U.S. domestic carbon emission factors are from state-level modelling with a surrogate CENTURY model and U.S. Forest Service data. This paper investigates the effect of several key domestic lands carbon content modelling parameters on LUC GHG emissions. International carbon emission factors are from the Woods Hole Research Center. LUC GHG emissions are calculated from these LUCs and carbon content data with Argonne National Laboratory's Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) model. Our results indicate that miscanthus and corn ethanol have the lowest (-10 g CO2e/MJ) and highest (7.6 g CO2e/MJ) LUC GHG emissions under base case modelling assumptions. The results for corn ethanol are lower than corresponding results from previous studies. Switchgrass ethanol base case results (2.8 g CO 2e/MJ) were the most influenced by assumptions regarding converted forestlands and the fate of carbon in harvested wood products. They are greater than miscanthus LUC GHG emissions because switchgrass is a lower-yielding crop. Finally, LUC GHG emissions for corn stover are essentially negligible and insensitive to changes in model assumptions. Conclusions: This research provides new insight into the influence of key carbon content modelling variables on LUC GHG emissions associated with the four bioethanol pathways we examined. Our results indicate that LUC GHG emissions may have a smaller contribution to the overall biofuel life cycle than previously thought. Additionally, they highlight the need for future advances in LUC GHG emissions estimation including improvements to CGE models and aboveground and belowground carbon content data. © 2013 Dunn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Wastewater remediation by microalgae is an eco-friendly process with no secondary pollution as long as the biomass produced is reused and allows efficient nutrient recycling. This study was undertaken to evaluate the remediation of wastewater by the green alga Chlorella vulgaris and the potential of these alga (biomass) to produce sustainable biofuel. The results shows that the cultivation of green alga Chlorella vulgaris on wastewater has a positive effect on removal the major inorganic elements form the wastewater. Biodiesel can be produced from Chlorella vulgaris. The Chlorella vulgaris can be used for remediation of wastewater and the producing biomass can be used as source of renewable energy. ©2013 Science Publication.

AB  - We assess the economic feasibility of a 10 million gallon per year biodiesel plant that uses canola seeds as feedstock. A Monte Carlo Cash Flow model is programmed using @Risk simulation software. The model is programmed with three output variables: stream of revenues, profits/loss, and the resulting net present value (NPV) over ten year forecast period. The study finds that the likelihood of the NPV greater than zero is 63% on average. This indicates that the plant may be economically feasible, subject to model assumptions. Sensitivity and scenario analyses show that the NPVs were most affected by fluctuations in biodiesel price, canola seed price, and the price of seed meal. Indeed, over the long-term, feedstock price and biodiesel subsidies remain the major determining factors of profitability in biodiesel production. Historically, feedstock prices have been characterized by high volatility. The profitability of the biodiesel plant hinges to a large extent on the assumption that feedstock prices remain low and regular gasoline prices, especially petroleum diesel, remain stable over the forecast horizon. Moreover, the analysis assumes that the current biodiesel subsidy at $1.00/gallon remains in effect over the period of the study. Thus, removal of the subsidy would also render biodiesel production unprofitable given current feedstock prices. © 2013 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

AB  - Perennial biomass from grasslands managed for conservation of soil and biodiversity can be harvested for bioenergy. Until now, the quantity and quality of harvestable biomass from conservation grasslands in Minnesota, USA, was not known, and the factors that affect bioenergy potential from these systems have not been identified. We measured biomass yield, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency, and plant tissue nitrogen (N) as metrics of bioenergy potential from mixed-species conservation grasslands harvested with commercial-scale equipment. With three years of data, we used mixed-effects models to determine factors that influence bioenergy potential. Sixty conservation grassland plots, each about 8 ha in size, were distributed among three locations in Minnesota. Harvest treatments were applied annually in autumn as a completely randomized block design. Biomass yield ranged from 0.5 to 5.7 Mg ha-1. May precipitation increased biomass yield while precipitation in all other growing season months showed no affect. Averaged across all locations and years, theoretical ethanol conversion efficiency was 450 l Mg-1 and the concentration of plant N was 7.1 g kg-1, both similar to dedicated herbaceous bioenergy crops such as switchgrass. Biomass yield did not decline in the second or third year of harvest. Across years, biomass yields fluctuated 23% around the average. Surprisingly, forb cover was a better predictor of biomass yield than warm-season grass with a positive correlation with biomass yield in the south and a negative correlation at other locations. Variation in land ethanol yield was almost exclusively due to variation in biomass yield rather than biomass quality; therefore, efforts to increase biomass yield might be more economical than altering biomass composition when managing conservation grasslands for ethanol production. Our measurements of bioenergy potential, and the factors that control it, can serve as parameters for assessing the economic viability of harvesting conservation grasslands for bioenergy. © 2013 Jungers et al.

AB  - Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) by drinking shallow groundwater causes widespread disease in Bangladesh and neighboring countries. The release of As naturally present in sediment to groundwater has been linked to the reductive dissolution of iron oxides coupled to the microbial respiration of organic carbon (OC). The source of OC driving this microbial reduction-carbon deposited with the sediments or exogenous carbon transported by groundwater- is still debated despite its importance in regulating aquifer redox status and groundwater As levels. Here, we used the radiocarbon (14C) signature of microbial DNA isolated from groundwater samples to determine the relative importance of surface and sediment- derived OC. Three DNA samples collected from the shallow, high-As aquifer and one sample fromthe underlying, low-As aquifer were consistently younger than the total sediment carbon, by as much as several thousand years. This difference and the dominance of heterotrophic microorganisms implies that younger, surface-derived OC is advected within the aquifer, albeit more slowly than groundwater, and represents a critical pool of OC for aquifer microbial communities. The vertical profile shows that downward transport of dissolved OC is occurring on anthropogenic timescales, but bomb 14C-labeled dissolved OC has not yet accumulated in DNA and is not fueling reduction. These results indicate that advected OC controls aquifer redox status and confirm that As release is a natural process that predates human perturbations to groundwater flow. Anthropogenic perturbations, however, could affect groundwater redox conditions and As levels in the future.

AB  - The future roles of biomass and carbohydrate for meeting needs of food/feed, renewable materials, and transportation fuels (biofuels) remain controversial due to numerous issues, such as increasing food and feed needs, constraints of natural resources (land, water, phosphate, biomass, etc.), and limitations of natural photosynthesis, as well as competing energy conversion pathways and technologies. The goal of this opinion article is to clarify the future roles of biomass and biorefineries using quantitative data other than adjective words. In most scenarios, human beings could have enough biomass resource from plant photosynthesis for meeting the three goals at the same time: feeding 9 billion people, providing renewable materials, and producing transportation biofuels that could replace nearly all fossil fuel-based liquid fuels used in the land transportation in 2050. Land transport means will pass through transitions from internal combustion engines plus liquid fuels, to hybrid systems, to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could play a minor role. Next generation biorefineries based on artificial photosynthesis featuring ultra-high energy efficiency and low-water consumption could produce a large amount of carbohydrate and/or other biocommodities from hydrogen/electricity and CO2. In conclusion, it is time to develop next generation biorefineries, which will efficiently utilize nonfood biomass for the coproduction of multiple products from biofuels, biochemicals, to food/feed, and even store electricity/hydrogen by fixing CO2 to carbon-containing chemicals and biofuels. Next generation biorefineries will address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma at the same time. Out-of-the-box solutions will address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma. Biomass will be sufficient to meet food, renewable materials and biofuels needs. Next-generation biorefineries will have a central role in the sustainability revolution. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - • Sugarcane planted area in Brazil grew by 7.56% per year during the last decade. The state of São Paulo (Southeast region) was responsible for 55.3% of all Brazilian sugarcane planted area in 2010, appreciating even more arable land values. • Consequences of the appreciation of land prices: • Rural exodus happened in almost all regions, with the greatest rate found in the Southeast region • Bovine cattle production moved toward the Midwest and North regions • Cattle industry underwent a process of intensification: around 60% of the slaughtered head growth was due to an increase in slaughter rate (slaughtered head/herd size) and 40% due to an increase in herd size, indicating that production efficiency is improving • Contribution of sugar/ethanol industry to supply co-products for cattle operations is small, and has become a recent conern for the growing livestock sector. • In the near future, livestock production, especially beef cattle, may move to other regions and promote more intensive production systems. © Meyer, Rodrigues, and Millen.

AB  - • First-generation biofuels can have several environmental and socioeconomic impacts. • Major impacts include greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric pollution, water overconsumption and pollution, deforestation, biodiversity loss, rural development, food security, energy security, public health, and social conflicts. • The nature and the magnitude of biofuel impacts depend on the feedstock, the mode of feedstock production, the agricultural practices adopted during feedstock production, the environmental and socioeconomic context of biofuel production, the stage of the biofuel's life-cycle, and the policies in place during biofuel production, use, and trade. • Trade-offs are inevitable, but at least some of biofuels' negative impact can be mitigated through careful planning. © Gasparatos, Stromberg, and Takeuchi.

AB  - • As omnivores, pigs are ideally suited to convert non humanedible feedstuffs into high quality food animal protein. Dietary inclusion of co-products from food and bio-fuel production will considerably improve the human-edible protein balance (edible protein output/input) of swine production. • Compared with traditional diets based on a single grain as an energy source and soybean meal as a protein source, feeding high inclusion levels of co-products has a greater risk. This risk can be managed using modern feed formulation, feed evaluation, feed enzymes, and feed processing to attain predictable swine growth performance, carcass characteristics, and pork quality. • Dietary inclusion of co-products reduces feed cost per unit of pork produced and is part of an effort to create sustainable swine production systems. Fast adoption of feeding co-products is driven by unprecedented high corn and soybean meal prices. © Zijlstra and Beltranena.

AB  - • Livestock production has experienced a major shift toward intensification in recent years. Livestock production today is using much less land than in the past. That trend is expected to continue in the future. • Meat production from the most efficient converters of feed, poultry, and pork will grow faster than beef, with poultry being the leader. We expect to see more regional specialization and more international trade in livestock products. • The biofuels boom and higher feed prices have slowed growth rates in the world's livestock sector. That effect is expected to diminish as corn ethanol production will not grow significantly in the future. • For a number of reasons, the prospects for a return to a more stable equilibrium of supply and demand in crop markets appears to be likely. Therefore, with average weather conditions, we expect to see a return to lower animal feed prices (not the historic lows but not the recent extreme highs either) with a movement to increasing growth rates in animal production and consumption. © Taheripour, Hurt, and Tyner.

AB  - The Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden are keen to be regarded as proving grounds for clean technology and the implementation of tough emission reductions policies. The region has ambitions to achieve a carbon-neutral energy system by 2050. In terms of land transport, it will require a dramatic increase in the use of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrids using clean power, a switch to public transport by bus and rail and the use of biofuels-powered vehicles for long-haul and freight transport. Vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells could also play a greater role in the longer term, depending on technological advances. Hydrogen could provide a convenient way to store energy from renewables, e.g., the region's hydropower resources and wind power under development. The share of CO2 emissions contributed by road transport in the Nordic region rose from 53% in 1960 to 70% in 2009, while total CO2 emissions from transport increased more than threefold. The share of passenger-kilometers travelled by car and plane in Nordic countries is nearly double the global average.

AB  - Biofuel production has been promoted to save fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there have been concerns about the potential of biofuel to improve energy efficiency and mitigate climate change. This paper investigates energy efficiency and GHG emission saving of cassava-based ethanol as energy for transportation. Energy and GHG balances are calculated for a functional unit of 1 km of road transportation using life-cycle assessment and considering effects of land use change (LUC). Based on a case study in Vietnam, the results show that the energy input for and GHG emissions from ethanol production are 0.93 MJ and 34.95 g carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of ethanol respectively. The use of E5 and E10 as a substitute for gasoline results in energy savings, provided that their fuel consumption in terms of liter per kilometer of transportation is not exceeding the consumption of gasoline per kilometer by more than 2.4% and 4.5% respectively. It will reduce GHG emissions, provided that the fuel consumption of E5 and E10 is not exceeding the consumption of gasoline per kilometer by more than 3.8% and 7.8% respectively. The quantitative effects depend on the efficiency in production and on the fuel efficiency of E5 and E10. The variations in results of energy input and GHG emissions in the ethanol production among studies are due to differences in coverage of effects of LUC, CO2 photosynthesis of cassava, yields of cassava, energy efficiency in farming, and by-product analyses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the trend of utilizing oil palm residue, i.e. the empty fruit bunches (EFB) left after extraction of the palm oil, using a case study of Malaysia, which is one of the world's major palm oil producers, and discusses the environmental performance of recycling technologies being developed in Malaysia for fuel, fiber, and fertilizer. Seven technologies are analyzed: ethanol production, methane recovery, briquette production, biofuel for combined heat and power (CHP) plants, composting, medium density fiberboard (MDF) production, and pulp and paper production. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method is used to discuss the environmental impacts of these technologies for adding value to this biomass. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine the land use effects for the various technologies utilizing EFB and to estimate the energy generation potential of raw EFB in CHP plants and methane production. Among the technologies for energy production, CHP plants have the best performance if the electricity generated is connected to the national grid, with superior benefits in the majority of impact categories compared to briquette, methane, and ethanol production. Overall, we find that methane recovery and composting are more environmentally friendly than other technologies, as measured by reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Pulp and paper, and MDF production are favorable technologies for land use impacts; however, they have intense primary energy requirements, chemical use in the processes, and emissions from their waste treatment systems. Our results provide information for decision makers when planning for sustainable use of oil palm biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the wake of recent food price spikes, plus growing demands for food in emerging Asia and for biofuels in Europe and the United States, governments are re-examining their strategies for dealing with both short-term and long-term food security concerns. This paper argues that long-run trends in real agricultural prices have policy implications for food security that are at least as important as those related to short-lived spikes around trend prices. The paper therefore summarizes recent projections of markets to 2030 under various scenarios, and then reviews evidence on how trade policy restrictions typically are altered to insulate domestic markets from short-run fluctuations in international prices around their long-run trends. That provides a firm empirical basis for re-examining the effectiveness and efficiency of various policy options for ensuring food security in Asia and elsewhere. Those options include boosting agricultural productivity growth rates to deal with long-run concerns, and using more-appropriate domestic policy measures rather than trade policies to cope with price volatility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Belowground carbon (C) dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the global C cycle and thereby in climate regulation. Globally, land-use change is a major driver of changes in belowground C storage. The emerging bioenergy industry is likely to drive widespread land-use changes, including the replacement of annually tilled croplands with perennial bioenergy crops, and thereby to impact the climate system through alteration of belowground C dynamics. Mechanistic understanding of how land-use changes impact belowground C storage requires elucidation of changes in belowground C flows; however, altered belowground C dynamics following land-use change have yet to be thoroughly quantified through field measurements. Here, we show that belowground C cycling pathways of establishing perennial bioenergy crops (0- to 3. 5-year-old miscanthus, switchgrass, and a native prairie mix) were substantially altered relative to row crop agriculture (corn-soy rotation); specifically, there were substantial increases in belowground C allocation (>400%), belowground biomass (400-750%), root-associated respiration (up to 2,500%), moderate reductions in litter inputs (20-40%), and respiration in root-free soil (up to 50%). This more active root-associated C cycling of perennial vegetation provides a mechanism for observed net C sequestration by these perennial ecosystems, as well as commonly observed increases in soil C under perennial bioenergy crops throughout the world. The more active root-associated belowground C cycle of perennial vegetation implies a climate benefit of grassland maintenance or restoration, even if biomass is harvested annually for bioenergy production. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Objectives: Health effects associated with air pollution at exposure levels below toxicity may not be directly related to level of exposure, but rather mediated by perception of the air pollution and by top-down processing (e.g., beliefs that the exposure is hazardous). The aim of the study was to test a model that describes interrelations between odorous air pollution at non-toxic exposure levels, perceived pollution, health risk perception, annoyance and health symptoms. Methods: A population-based questionnaire study was conducted in a Swedish community of residents living near a biofuel facility that emitted odorous substances. Individuals aged 18-75 years were selected at random for participation (n = 1,118); 722 (65 %) agreed to participate. Path analyses were performed to test the validity of the model. Results: The data support a model proposing that exposure level does not directly influence annoyance and symptoms, and that these relations instead are mediated by perceived pollution and health risk perception. Conclusions: Perceived pollution and health risk perception play important roles in understanding and predicting environmentally induced annoyance and health symptoms in odorous environments at non-toxic levels of exposure. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biofuels from bioenergy crops may substitute a significant part of fossil fuels in the transport sector where, e.g., the European Union has set a target of using 10% renewable energy by 2020. Savings of greenhouse gas emissions by biofuels vary according to cropping systems and are influenced by such regional factors as soil conditions, climate and input of agrochemicals. Here we analysed at a regional scale the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with cultivation of winter wheat for bioethanol and winter rapeseed for rapeseed methyl ester (RME) under Danish conditions. Emitted CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) were quantified from the footprints of CO2, CH4 and N2O associated with cultivation and the emissions were allocated between biofuel energy and co-products. Greenhouse gas emission at the national level (Denmark) was estimated to 22.1 g CO2eq MJ-1 ethanol for winter wheat and 26.0 g CO2eq MJ-1 RME for winter rapeseed. Results at the regional level (level 2 according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics [NUTS]) ranged from 20.0 to 23.9 g CO2eq MJ-1 ethanol and from 23.5 to 27.6 g CO2eq MJ-1 RME. Thus, at the regional level emission results varied by up to 20%. Differences in area-based emissions were only 4% reflecting the importance of regional variation in yields for the emission result. Fertilizer nitrogen production and direct emissions of soil N2O were major contributors to the final emission result and sensitivity analyses showed that the emission result depended to a large extent on the uncertainty ranges assumed for soil N2O emissions. Improvement of greenhouse gas balances could be pursued, e.g., by growing dedicated varieties for energy purposes. However, in a wider perspective, land-use change of native ecosystems to bioenergy cropping systems could compromise the CO2 savings of bioenergy production and challenge the targets set for biofuel production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The triacylglycerol (TAG) pathway provides several targets for genetic engineering to optimize microalgal lipid productivity. GPAT (glycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase) is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of TAG biosynthesis. Despite many recent biochemical studies, a comprehensive sequence-structure analysis of GPAT across diverse lipid-yielding organisms is lacking. Hence, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of plastid-located GPAT proteins from 7 microalgae and 3 higher plants species. The close evolutionary relationship observed between red algae/diatoms and green algae/plant lineages in the phylogenetic tree were further corroborated by motif and gene structure analysis. The predicted molecular weight, amino acid composition, Instability Index, and hydropathicity profile gave an overall representation of the biochemical features of GPAT protein across the species under study. Furthermore, homology models of GPAT from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Glycine max provided deep insights into the protein architecture and substrate binding sites. Despite low sequence identity found between algal and plant GPATs, the developed models exhibited strikingly conserved topology consisting of 14α helices and 9β sheets arranged in two domains. However, subtle variations in amino acids of fatty acyl binding site were identified that might influence the substrate selectivity of GPAT. Together, the results will provide useful resources to understand the functional and evolutionary relationship of GPAT and potentially benefit in development of engineered enzyme for augmenting algal biofuel production. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The use of biogenic additives in fuels is required by law for environmental reasons. This raises the question of whether the oil separator tested according to ÖNORM EN 858-1 complies with these new requirements. In this study, a commercial mineral oil separator was tested with different fuels with up to 100 % biodiesel (FAME) and its elimination performance was described in terms of the parameters KW, KW-Index DIN EN ISO 9377-2 H 53 (2000), and also the non-standardized parameters for mineral oil analysis in accordance with H 18 and H 53 without the purification stage. The results showed that all the tests with different fuel mixtures complied with the test value of 5 mg/l laid out in EN 858-1 (2005) and based on the parameter mineral oil analysis in accordance with DIN 38409-H 18 (1981). As the purification stage of this method removes the biofuel fraction, the question arises as to whether fuels with increased biogenic content can be analyzed satisfactorily using these standardized mineral oil parameters; and whether the use of pure mineral oil for ÖNORM EN 858-1 (2005) performance tests is still suitable, or whether other fuels should also be used as test media. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Residues from forest-industry wastewater-treatment systems are treated as waste at many pulp and paper mills. These organic substances have previously been shown to have potential for production of large quantities of biogas. There is concern, however, that the process would require expensive equipment because of the slow degradation of these substances. Pure non-fibrous sludge from forest industry showed lower specific methane production during mesophilic digestion for 19. days, 53. ±. 26. Nml/g of volatile solids as compared to municipal sewage sludge, 84. ±. 24. Nml/g of volatile solids. This paper explores the possibility of using anaerobic co-digestion with municipal sewage sludge to enhance the potential of methane production from secondary sludge from a pulp and paper mill. It was seen in a batch anaerobic-digestion operation of 19. days that the specific methane production remained largely the same for municipal sewage sludge when up to 50% of the volatile solids were replaced with forest-industry secondary sludge. It was also shown that the solid residue from anaerobic digestion of the forest-industry sludge should be of suitable quality to use for improving soil quality on lands that are not used for food production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of residual materials from animals and crops offers an opportunity to simultaneously produce bioenergy and plant fertilizers at single farms and in farm communities where input substrate materials and resulting digested residues are shared among member farms. A surplus benefit from this practice may be the suppressing of propagules from harmful biological pests like weeds and animal pathogens (e.g. parasites). In the present work, batch experiments were performed, where survival of seeds of seven species of weeds and non-embryonated eggs of the large roundworm of pigs, Ascaris suum, was assessed under conditions similar to biogas plants managed at meso- (37. °C) and thermophilic (55. °C) conditions. Cattle manure was used as digestion substrate and experimental units were sampled destructively over time. Regarding weed seeds, the effect of thermophilic conditions (55. °C) was very clear as complete mortality, irrespective of weed species, was reached after less than 2 days. At mesophilic conditions, seeds of Avena fatua, Sinapsis arvensis, Solidago canadensis had completely lost germination ability, while Brassica napus, Fallopia convolvulus and Amzinckia micrantha still maintained low levels (∼1%) of germination ability after 1 week. Chenopodium album was the only weed species which survived 1 week at substantial levels (7%) although after 11. d germination ability was totally lost. Similarly, at 55. °C, no Ascaris eggs survived more than 3. h of incubation. Incubation at 37. °C did not affect egg survival during the first 48. h and it took up to 10. days before total elimination was reached. In general, anaerobic digestion in biogas plants seems an efficient way (thermophilic more efficient than mesophilic) to treat organic farm wastes in a way that suppresses animal parasites and weeds so that the digestates can be applied without risking spread of these pests. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article examines how key political actors-the media, the president, and Congress-framed biofuels from 1999 through 2008, and what factors had the most pronounced influence on their storytelling. Special attention is paid to how their stories concerning biofuels changed in response to shifts in the broader political milieu and whether these actors influenced one another's storytelling. The findings indicate that these actors most commonly told stories concerning biofuels' impacts on the environment (good and bad), the economy (good and bad), and energy security. The results also suggest that while these actors had little if any influence on one another's storytelling, media, presidential, and congressional framing was heavily shaped by the economic climate in the country, and by key events such as 9/11, which elevated the issue of energy security. These events and conditions were vital because they established which storylines would resonate in the public sphere. © The Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - Tropical forest soils decompose litter rapidly with frequent episodes of anoxia, making it likely that bacteria using alternate terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) such as iron play a large role in supporting decomposition under these conditions. The prevalence of many types of metabolism in litter deconstruction makes these soils useful templates for improving biofuel production. To investigate how iron availability affects decomposition, we cultivated feedstock-adapted consortia (FACs) derived from iron-rich tropical forest soils accustomed to experiencing frequent episodes of anaerobic conditions and frequently fluctuating redox. One consortium was propagated under fermenting conditions, with switchgrass as the sole carbon source in minimal media (SG only FACs), and the other consortium was treated the same way but received poorly crystalline iron as an additional terminal electron acceptor (SG + Fe FACs). We sequenced the metagenomes of both consortia to a depth of about 150 Mb each, resulting in a coverage of 26× for the more diverse SG + Fe FACs, and 81× for the relatively less diverse SG only FACs. Both consortia were able to quickly grow on switchgrass, and the iron-amended consortium exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity than the unamended consortium. We found evidence of higher stress in the unamended FACs and increased sugar transport and utilization in the ironamended FACs. This work provides metagenomic evidence that supplementation of alternative TEAs may improve feedstock deconstruction in biofuel production.

AB  - The land-use change and forestry sector can be a cost-effective contributor to climate mitigation in at least three ways: providing carbon offsets through carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, reducing emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and producing biofuels that replace fossil fuels. The presence of carbon markets should help encourage these activities; however, most carbon trades to date have occurred in the energy sector. A major obstacle to carbon trades from land-use systems is the presence of high transaction costs of converting a carbon offset into a tradable commodity, so the prevailing market carbon prices may not provide enough incentive for adoption. This paper presents a model of the exchange of carbon offsets between a project developer and a group of landholders. The model is solved to derive project feasibility frontiers that show the minimum number of contracts necessary to make a project feasible at any given carbon price. The model is applied to two case studies (smallholder agroforestry in Indonesia and partial reforestation of family farms in Australia) under two types of contract (purchase of carbon flows and rental of carbon stocks). The paper concludes by identifying possible strategies to reduce transaction costs while maintaining project integrity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - This study applied the concept of local self-reliance in energy for a North American city, Cleveland, Ohio. Results revealed that while nearly all of Cleveland's energy is imported, there is potential to meet the demand entirely using local, renewable sources of energy. Four scenarios were constructed. The first scenario included planned renewable energy developments: the 20. MW Municipal Solid Waste to Energy (MSWE) facility by Cleveland Public Power and a 20. MW offshore wind project by the Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation (LEEDCo). These resulted in 1% energy self-reliance for the city. The second scenario, in which the contribution of offshore wind power was increased to 1000. MW (LEEDCo's target for 2020), solar power was provided using 10% efficient solar panels on one-quarter of all rooftop area and biodiesel was produced on one-half of the city's vacant land using algae of moderate productivity, produced 17.6% self-reliance. In Scenario 3, the level of energy self-reliance jumped to 70% when LEEDCo's 2030 target of 5000. MW was considered together with solar panels of 20% efficiency and high-productivity algae. In Scenario 4, 100% self-reliance was attained by further increasing offshore wind power. The analysis also revealed that enhanced energy self-reliance could result in $28.7. M to $1.76. bn being retained in Cleveland annually. Although consumer behavior, market forces, and political dynamics can shape the production and use of energy, it is concluded that cities have the potential to substantially increase their energy self-reliance, which may bolster their economic resilience and reduce their ecological footprint. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Termites are highly eusocial insects that thrive on recalcitrant materials like wood and soil and thus play important roles in global carbon recycling and also in damaging wooden structures. Termites, such as Reticulitermes flavipes (Rhinotermitidae), owe their success to their ability to extract nutrients from lignocellulose (a major component of wood) with the help of gut-dwelling symbionts. With the aim to gain new insights into this enzymatic process we provided R. flavipes with a complex lignocellulose (wood) or pure cellulose (paper) diet and followed the resulting differential gene expression on a custom oligonucleotide-microarray platform. We identified a set of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with differential abundance between the two diet treatments and demonstrated the source (host/symbiont) of these genes, providing novel information on termite nutritional symbiosis. Our results reveal: (1) the majority of responsive wood- and paper-abundant ESTs are from host and symbionts, respectively; (2) distinct pathways are associated with lignocellulose and cellulose feeding in both host and symbionts; and (3) sets of diet-responsive ESTs encode putative digestive and wood-related detoxification enzymes. Thus, this study illuminates the dynamics of termite nutritional symbiosis and reveals a pool of genes as potential targets for termite control and functional studies of termite-symbiont interactions. © 2013 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - In 2010, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) came into force in the EU and establishes a framework for achieving legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Only sustainable biofuels can be counted towards Member State targets. The aim of this paper is to calculate realistic and transparent scenario-based CO2-emission values for the GHG emissions savings of palm oil fuel compared with fossil fuel. Using the calculation scheme proposed by the RED, we derive a more realistic overall GHG emissions saving value for palm oil diesel by using current input and output data of biofuel production (e. g. in South-East Asia). We calculate different scenarios in which reliable data on the production conditions (and the regarding emission values during the production chain) of palm oil diesel are used. Our results indicate values for the GHG emissions savings potential of palm oil biodiesel not only above the 19 % default and 36 % typical value published in RED but also above the 35 % sustainable threshold. Our findings conclude the more accurate GHG emissions saving value for palm oil feedstock for electricity generation to be 52 %, and for transportation biodiesel between 38. 5 and 41 %, depending on the fossil fuel comparator. Our results confirm the findings by other studies and challenge the official typical and default values published in RED. As a result, the reliability of the Directive to support the EU's low-carbon ambitions is being undermined, exposing the EU and commission to charges of trade discrimination and limiting the ability of Member States to achieve their legally binding GHG emission reductions. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Short-chain carboxylic acids generated by various mixed- or pure-culture fermentation processes have been considered valuable precursors for production of bioalcohols. While conversion of carboxylic acids into alcohols is routinely performed with catalytic hydrogenation or with strong chemical reducing agents, here, a biological conversion route was explored. The potential of carboxydotrophic bacteria, such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium ragsdalei, as biocatalysts for conversion of short-chain carboxylic acids into alcohols, using syngas as a source of electrons and energy is demonstrated. Acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, n-valeric acid, and n-caproic acid were converted into their corresponding alcohols. Furthermore, biomass yields and fermentation stoichiometry from the experimental data were modeled to determine how much metabolic energy C. ljungdahlii generated during syngas fermentation. An ATP yield of 0.4-0.5mol of ATP per mol CO consumed was calculated in the presence of hydrogen. The ratio of protons pumped across the cell membrane versus electrons transferred from ferredoxin to NAD+ via the Rnf complex is suggested to be 1.0. Based on these results, we provide suggestions how n-butyric acid to n-butanol conversion via syngas fermentation can be further improved. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Argentina is one of the world's largest biodiesel producers and the largest exporter, using soybeans as feedstock. Using a computable general equilibrium model that explicitly represents the biofuel industry, this study carries out several simulations on two sets of issues: (i) international markets for biofuel and feedstock, such as an increase in prices of soybean, soybean oil, and biodiesel, and (ii) domestic policies related to biofuels, such as an introduction of biofuel mandates. Both sets of issues can have important consequences to the Argentinean economy. The simulations indicate that increases in international prices of biofuels and feedstocks would increase Argentina's gross domestic product and social welfare. Increases in international prices of ethanol and corn also can benefit Argentina, but to a lesser extent. The domestic mandates for biofuels, however, would cause small losses in economic output and social welfare because they divert part of biodiesel and feedstock from exports to lower-return domestic consumption. An increase in the export tax on either feedstock or biodiesel also would lead to a reduction in gross domestic product and social welfare, although government revenue would rise. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The EU imports both bioethanol and the raw material needed to produce it. Thirty percent of bioethanol is produced from sugar beets in the EU. However, sugar beet cultivated area and yields have fallen due to the 2006 sugar regime reform. Given the potential uncertainty about the future for sugar beet farmers, biofuels may represent an alternative market. This paper analyses potential contribution to the efficiency, in terms of environmental output, of the sugar beet crop both when production is oriented toward bioethanol and regarding the use of input.An empirical application is performed in Spain by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results show that 4% of farms have full technical efficiency, while the rest have an average efficiency of 55.9%. The figures show that inputs can be reduced over 40%, and also show the low average level of input-use efficiency. In addition, it cannot be said that there is a relationship between efficiency and farm scale. The consideration of aspects such as the environmental advantages of using sugar beet production for bioethanol can open new lines of action to support this crop in the EU. In addition, boosting sugar beet production may reduce potential dependency on importation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Given the rising price of crude oil, some developing countries including Thailand are looking towards developing their domestic renewable energy resources, in particular biofuels. However, there are concerns about the possible adverse effects such a policy strategy would have on key variables such as sectoral output, land allocation and the effects of prices, particularly food prices. This study develops a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Thailand economy that features enhancements of the energy sector and uses it to analyze the government's recent renewable energy development plan. This plan aims to increase domestic energy use from renewable sources to replace fossil fuel imports. The study simulated specific policies contained in the plan. Among other things, we found that promoting biofuel use causes a rapid increase in the price of biofuel and biofuel feedstock in the short-run, whereas these prices only increase slightly in the long-run due to more elastic supplies. The prices of food and other products marginally increase, implying that food security is not undermined by the policy. On the basis of the findings, the study recommends a review of some of the targets because they were found to be rather high, and a phasing in of others. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential for regional climate change arising from adoption of policies to increase production of biofuel feedstock is explored using a regional climate model. Two simulations are performed using the same atmospheric forcing data for the period 1979-2004, one with present-day land use and monthly phenology and the other with land use specified from an agro-economic prediction of energy crop distribution and monthly phenology consistent with this land use change. In Kansas and Oklahoma, where the agro-economic model predicts 15-30% conversion to switchgrass, the regional climate model simulates locally lower temperature (especially in spring), slightly higher relative humidity in spring and slightly lower relative humidity in summer, and summer depletion of soil moisture. This shows the potential for climate impacts of biofuel policies and raises the question of whether soil water depletion may limit biomass crop productivity in agricultural areas that are responsive to the policies. We recommend the use of agronomic models to evaluate the possibility that soil moisture depletion could reduce productivity of biomass crops in this region. We conclude, therefore, that agro-economic and climate models should be used iteratively to examine an ensemble of agricultural land use and climate scenarios, thereby reducing the possibility of unforeseen consequences from rapid changes in agricultural production systems. Key Points Climate change in the Great Plains U. S. can result from of biofuel policies Great Plains soil water may be insufficient to support biofuel production Regional feedback requires interactive regional agro-economic-climate models. ©2013 American Geophysical Union.

AB  - The microbial production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is a multi-component process that involves biomass hydrolysis, carbohydrate transport and utilization, and finally, the production of ethanol. Strains of the genus Thermoanaerobacter have been studied for decades due to their innate abilities to produce comparatively high ethanol yields from hemicellulose constituent sugars. However, their inability to hydrolyze cellulose, limits their usefulness in lignocellulosic biofuel production. As such, co-culturing Thermoanaerobacter spp. with cellulolytic organisms is a plausible approach to improving lignocellulose conversion efficiencies and yields of biofuels. To evaluate native lignocellulosic ethanol production capacities relative to competing fermentative end-products, comparative genomic analysis of 11 sequenced Thermoanaerobacter strains, including a de novo genome, Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus WC1, was conducted. Analysis was specifically focused on the genomic potential for each strain to address all aspects of ethanol production mentioned through a consolidated bioprocessing approach. Whole genome functional annotation analysis identified three distinct clades within the genus. The genomes of Clade 1 strains encode the fewest extracellular carbohydrate active enzymes and also show the least diversity in terms of lignocellulose relevant carbohydrate utilization pathways. However, these same strains reportedly are capable of directing a higher proportion of their total carbon flux towards ethanol, rather than non-biofuel end-products, than other Thermoanaerobacter strains. Strains in Clade 2 show the greatest diversity in terms of lignocellulose hydrolysis and utilization, but proportionately produce more non-ethanol end-products than Clade 1 strains. Strains in Clade 3, in which T. thermohydrosulfuricus WC1 is included, show mid-range potential for lignocellulose hydrolysis and utilization, but also exhibit extensive divergence from both Clade 1 and Clade 2 strains in terms of cellular energetics. The potential implications regarding strain selection and suitability for industrial ethanol production through a consolidated bioprocessing co-culturing approach are examined throughout the manuscript. © 2013 Verbeke et al.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis may be used for sewage sludge treatment with the advantages of a significant reduction of solid waste volume and production of a bio-oil that can be used as fuel. A study of the influence of the reaction temperature on sewage sludge pyrolysis has been carried out using a pyrolysis centrifugel reactor (PCR) at 475, 525, 575, and 625 C. Maxima of both organic oil yield of 41 wt % on a dry ash free feedstock basis (daf) and a sludge oil energy recovery of 50% were obtained at 575 C. The water-insoluble fraction, molecular-weight distribution, higher heating value (HHV), and thermal behaviors of sludge oils were found to be considerably influenced by the applied pyrolysis temperatures. The sludge oil properties obtained at the optimal temperature of 575 C were a HHV of 25.5 MJ/kg, a water-insoluble fraction of 18.7 wt %, a viscosity of 43.6 mPa s at 40 C, a mean molecular weight of 392 g/mol, and metal concentrations lower than 0.14 wt % on a dry basis (db). Less optimal oil properties with respect to industrial applications were observed for oil samples obtained at 475 and 625 C. Char properties of the 575 C sample were an ash content of 81 wt % and a HHV of 6.1 MJ/kg db. A total of 95% of the sewage sludge phosphorus content was recovered in the char. The solid waste amount (char compared to sludge) was reduced to 52% on a bulk volume basis at the pyrolysis temperature of 575 C. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper projects a positive outcome for large-scale algal biofuel and energy production when wastewater treatment is the primary goal. Such a view arises partly from a recent change in emphasis in wastewater treatment technology, from simply oxidising the organic matter in the waste (i.e. removing the biological oxygen demand) to removing the nutrients - specifically nitrogen and phosphorus - which are the root cause of eutrophication of inland waterways and coastal zones. A growing need for nutrient removal greatly improves the prospects for using new algal ponds in wastewater treatment, since microalgae are particularly efficient in capturing and removing such nutrients. Using a spreadsheet model, four scenarios combining algae biomass production with the making of biodiesel, biogas and other products were assessed for two of Australia's largest wastewater treatment plants. The results showed that super critical water reactors and anaerobic digesters could be attractive pathway options, the latter providing significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions. Combining anaerobic digestion with oil extraction and the internal economies derived from cheap land and recycling of water and nutrients on-site could allow algal oil to be produced for less than US1 per litre. © 2013 IWA Publishing.

AB  - Sugarcane area is currently expanding in Brazil, largely in response to domestic and international demand for sugar-based ethanol. To investigate the potential hydroclimatic impacts of future expansion, a regional climate model is used to simulate 5 years of a scenario in which cerrado and cropland areas (∼1.1E6 km2) within south-central Brazil are converted to sugarcane. Results indicate a cooling of up to ∼1.0°C during the peak of the growing season, mainly as a result of increased albedo of sugarcane relative to the previous landscape. After harvest, warming of similar magnitude occurs from a significant decline in evapotranspiration and a repartitioning toward greater sensible heating. Overall, annual temperature changes from large-scale conversion are expected to be small because of offsetting reductions in net radiation absorption and evapotranspiration. The decline in net water flux from land to the atmosphere implies a reduction in regional precipitation, which is consistent with progressively decreasing simulated average rainfall for the study period, upon conversion to sugarcane. However, rainfall changes were not robust across three ensemble members. The results suggest that sugarcane expansion will not drastically alter the regional energy or water balance, but could result in important local and seasonal effects. © 2013.

AB  - Wood from biomass plantations with fast growing tree species such as poplars can be used as an alternative feedstock for production of biofuels. To facilitate utilization of lignocellulose for saccharification, transgenic poplars with modified or reduced lignin contents may be useful. However, the potential impact of poplars modified in the lignification pathway on ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, which play important roles for plant nutrition, is not known. The goal of this study was to investigate EM colonization and community composition in relation to biomass and nutrient status in wildtype (WT, Populus tremula × Populus alba) and transgenic poplar lines with suppressed activities of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeate/5-hydroxyferulate O-methyltransferase, and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase in a biomass plantation. In different one-year-old poplar lines EM colonization varied from 58% to 86%, but the EM community composition of WT and transgenic poplars were indistinguishable. After two years, the colonization rate of all lines was increased to about 100%, but separation of EM communities between distinct transgenic poplar genotypes was observed. The differentiation of the EM assemblages was similar to that found between different genotypes of commercial clones of Populus × euramericana. The transgenic poplars exhibited significant growth and nutrient element differences in wood, with generally higher nutrient accumulation in stems of genotypes with lower than in those with higher biomass. A general linear mixed model simulated biomass of one-year-old poplar stems with high accuracy (adjusted R2 = 97%) by two factors: EM colonization and inverse wood N concentration. These results imply a link between N allocation and EM colonization, which may be crucial for wood production in the establishment phase of poplar biomass plantations. Our data further support that multiple poplar genotypes regardless whether generated by transgenic approaches or conventional breeding increase the variation in EM community composition in biomass plantations. © 2013 Danielsen et al.

AB  - Background: Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a crop that holds promise for cellulosic biofuel production. To minimize fertilizer costs, farmers prefer to reduce crop removal of nutrients from the soil when biomass is harvested. The objective of this study was to monitor, from May 2008-November 2009 at Portageville (MO, USA), the nutrient concentration in the soil, switchgrass roots and rhizomes in a 20-year-old switchgrass field. Soil and tissue samples were collected to determine the sink of the nutrients lost in the aboveground biomass during senescence of the plant. Results: Nutrient concentration in switchgrass biomass decreased from July to the end of the season. In general, as switchgrass senesced, the nutrient concentration of the roots did not significantly change, whereas that of the rhizomes increased. Soil test results varied depending on where samples were collected relative to switchgrass root clumps. Generally, soil samples collected from the clump showed the highest evidence of nutrients returning to the soil from the aboveground biomass; however, some of this could be due to root breakage during sampling. Soil ammonium acetate extracted K in the clumps and averaged 218 kg K kg-1 soil in October, compared with 302 mg K kg-1 soil in November. Soil NO3-N content in the clumps in November was 5.5 mg kg-1 soil, compared with 1.5 mg kg-1 soil in October. Conclusion: This study provided evidence of nutrient recycling in the field by switchgrass plants and supports the concept of a reverse flow of nutrients to soil at the end of the season. The harvest of switchgrass late in November will help minimize the nutrient removal and maximize biomass yield. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Biogas production technologies commonly involve the use of natural anaerobic consortia of microbes. The objective of this study was to elucidate the importance of hydrogen in this complex microbial food chain. Novel laboratory biogas reactor prototypes were designed and constructed. The fates of pure hydrogen-producing cultures of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and Enterobacter cloacae were followed in time in thermophilic and mesophilic natural biogas-producing communities, respectively. Molecular biological techniques were applied to study the altered ecosystems. A systematic study in 5-litre CSTR digesters revealed that a key fermentation parameter in the maintenance of an altered population balance is the loading rate of total organic solids. Intensification of the biogas production was observed and the results corroborate that the enhanced biogas productivity is associated with the increased abundance of the hydrogen producers. Fermentation parameters did not indicate signs of failure in the biogas production process. Rational construction of more efficient and sustainable biogas-producing microbial consortia is proposed. © 2013 K. L. Kovács et al.

AB  - The production of first generation biofuels, such as sunflower-based biodiesel, is potentially an option for diversifying the energy matrix in several South American countries. However, biofuels present environmental challenges, especially concerning the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study, using a life-cycle approach, evaluates the GHG emissions and energy balance of the future nationwide production of sunflower-based biodiesel in Chile. Direct land use change is included in the analysis. The overall findings indicate that sunflower biodiesel, under the most likely production conditions, will have better environmental performance than fossil diesel in terms of both indicators. The agricultural stage is associated to key factors such as land use change, and nitrogen fertilizers. These factors contribute significantly to GHG emissions or energy demand in the biodiesel life cycle. The sensitivity analysis shows that no GHG emission saving could occur if nitrogen fertilizers rate exceeds 330 kg N/ha. In order to reduce the environmental impacts of this biofuel, improvement measures are suggested. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is considerable interest in both soy and canola as biodiesel feedstock crops because of the net reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from the use of biodiesel in place of petroleum diesel. Whether these two crops differ in net CO2 savings is unknown, in part because of our ignorance of their impact on soil C. We, therefore, monitored soil C for three years in an experiment that included both soy and canola rotations. We found that soil C concentrations were significantly lower under canola than soy, and that the difference represented as much as 64% of the C savings of soy biodiesel over petroleum diesel. We tested two hypotheses that could explain this difference in soil C. First, because canola can acidify the soil, we determined whether a reduction in inorganic C (as carbonate) in canola plots could account for the soil C difference. Carbonate concentration did not differ significantly in soy and canola plots. Second, we determined whether soil organic matter concentration could account for the soil C difference. Soil organic matter concentration was significantly lower in canola than in soy plots, accounting for the difference in soil C. We further hypothesized that because soy is mycorrhizal and canola is not, soy soils should contain higher concentrations of glomalin, a recalcitrant substance produced by mycorrhizal fungi, and that this could help to explain the difference in soil organic matter. Glomalin concentrations were significantly lower in canola plots, but this difference accounted for only a fraction of the total soil C difference. Our results suggest that a proper accounting of life cycle C savings of biodiesel when used in place of petroleum diesel must consider soil C. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The local and regional impacts of open fires and trash burning on ground-level ozone (O3) and fine carbonaceous aerosols in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and surrounding region during two high fire periods in March 2006 have been evaluated using WRF-CHEM model. The model captured reasonably well the measurement-derived magnitude and temporal variation of the biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), and the simulated impacts of open fires on organic aerosol (OA) were consistent with many observation-based estimates. We did not detect significant effects of open fires and trash burning on surface O3 concentrations in the MCMA and surrounding region. In contrast, they had important influences on OA and elemental carbon (EC), increasing primary OA (POA) by ∼60%, secondary OA (SOA) by ∼22%, total OA (TOA Combining double low line POA + SOA) by ∼33%, and EC by ∼22%, on both the local (urban) and regional scales. Although the emissions of trash burning are substantially lower than those from open fires, trash burning made slightly smaller but comparable contributions to OA as open fires did, and exerted an even higher influence on EC. Of the ∼22% enhancement in SOA concentrations (equivalent to a ∼15% increase in TOA) simulated, about two third was attributed to the open fires and one-third to the trash burning. On the annual basis and taking the biofuel use emissions into consideration, we estimated that open fires, trash burning and biofuel use together contributed about 60% to the loading of POA, 30% to SOA, and 25% to EC in both the MCMA and its surrounding region, of which the open fires and trash burning contributed about 35% to POA, 18% to SOA, and 15% to EC. The estimates of biomass burning impacts in this study may contain considerable uncertainties due to the uncertainties in their emission estimates in magnitude, temporal and spatial distribution, extrapolations and the nature of spot comparison. More observation and modeling studies are needed to accurately assess the impacts of biomass burning on tropospheric chemistry, regional and global air quality, and climate change. © 2013 Author(s).

AB  - This paper proposes a mixed integer linear program for determining economical biomass processing facility locations and capacities, and applies it to assess the biofuel supply chain of the Midwestern United States and the feasibility of meeting governmental biofuel mandates in 2015. Existing corn ethanol facilities and new candidate facility sites are considered for biofuel production by utilizing eight types of biomass. The spatial distribution and farmgate cost of biomass is accessed from a recently updated U.S. Department of Energy database. Seven biomass processing technologies that are expected to be commercialized in the near-term are available for construction at each candidate facility site. A detailed cash flow analysis that includes capital depreciation and taxation is embedded into the model formulation to give insights into the minimum biofuel selling price for each facility site. Equilibrium market cost for the Renewable Fuel Standard biofuel classifications (renewable fuel, advanced biofuel, and cellulosic biofuel), which is directly related to the Renewable Identification Number market price, is determined through sensitivity analysis of the delivered biofuel price. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As part of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), we evaluate the historical black carbon (BC) aerosols simulated by 8 ACCMIP models against observations including 12 ice core records, long-term surface mass concentrations, and recent Arctic BC snowpack measurements. We also estimate BC albedo forcing by performing additional simulations using offline models with prescribed meteorology from 1996-2000. We evaluate the vertical profile of BC snow concentrations from these offline simulations using the recent BC snowpack measurements. Despite using the same BC emissions, the global BC burden differs by approximately a factor of 3 among models due to differences in aerosol removal parameterizations and simulated meteorology: 34 Gg to 103 Gg in 1850 and 82 Gg to 315 Gg in 2000. However, the global BC burden from preindustrial to present-day increases by 2.5-3 times with little variation among models, roughly matching the 2.5-fold increase in total BC emissions during the same period.We find a large divergence among models at both Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) high latitude regions for BC burden and at SH high latitude regions for deposition fluxes. The ACCMIP simulations match the observed BC surface mass concentrations well in Europe and North America except at Ispra. However, the models fail to predict the Arctic BC seasonality due to severe underestimations during winter and spring. The simulated vertically resolved BC snow concentrations are, on average, within a factor of 2-3 of the BC snowpack measurements except for Greenland and the Arctic Ocean. For the ice core evaluation, models tend to adequately capture both the observed temporal trends and the magnitudes at Greenland sites. However, models fail to predict the decreasing trend of BC depositions/ice core concentrations from the 1950s to the 1970s in most Tibetan Plateau ice cores. The distinct temporal trend at the Tibetan Plateau ice cores indicates a strong influence from Western Europe, but the modeled BC increases in that period are consistent with the emission changes in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South and East Asia. At the Alps site, the simulated BC suggests a strong influence from Europe, which agrees with the Alps ice core observations. At Zuoqiupu on the Tibetan Plateau, models successfully simulate the higher BC concentrations observed during the non-monsoon season compared to the monsoon season but overpredict BC in both seasons. Despite a large divergence in BC deposition at two Antarctic ice core sites, some models with a BC lifetime of less than 7 days are able to capture the observed concentrations. In 2000 relative to 1850, globally and annually averaged BC surface albedo forcing from the offline simulations ranges from 0.014 to 0.019Wm-2 among the ACCMIP models. Comparing offline and online BC albedo forcings computed by some of the same models, we find that the global annual mean can vary by up to a factor of two because of different aerosol models or different BC-snow parameterizations and snow cover. The spatial distributions of the offline BC albedo forcing in 2000 show especially high BC forcing (i.e., over 0.1Wm-2) over Manchuria, Karakoram, and most of the Former USSR. Models predict the highest global annual mean BC forcing in 1980 rather than 2000, mostly driven by the high fossil fuel and biofuel emissions in the Former USSR in 1980. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - In the US Corn Belt, a recent doubling in commodity prices has created incentives for landowners to convert grassland to corn and soybean cropping. Here, we use land cover data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer to assess grassland conversion from 2006 to 2011 in the Western Corn Belt (WCB): five states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. Our analysis identifies areas with elevated rates of grass-to-corn/soy conversion (1.0-5.4% annually). Across the WCB, we found a net decline in grass-dominated land cover totaling nearly 530,000 ha. With respect to agronomic attributes of lands undergoing grassland conversion, corn/soy production is expanding onto marginal lands characterized by high erosion risk and vulnerability to drought. Grassland conversion is also concentrated in close proximity to wetlands, posing a threat to waterfowl breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region. Longer-term land cover trends from North Dakota and Iowa indicate that recent grassland conversion represents a persistent shift in land use rather than short-term variability in crop rotation patterns. Our results show that the WCB is rapidly moving down a pathway of increased corn and soybean cultivation. As a result, the window of opportunity for realizing the benefits of a biofuel industry based on perennial bioenergy crops, rather than corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, may be closing in the WCB.

AB  - Assessments of environmental performance are challenged by multifunctionality of production systems where impacts cannot be assigned to any one specific output. In the assessment method emergy accounting, all available energy used up for a process is summed up after being converted to solar equivalent Joules. In emergy accounting each output carries the resource use burden of all co-produced outputs. When comparing emergy indicators on a product-to-product basis (reference approach), products from single-output processes tend to be favoured. This constitutes a method bias. Building on emergy algebra rules, we describe approaches to calculate solar transformities when co-production is involved and give guidelines on how to compare products and systems. The approaches are exemplified in a comparison between willow biomass, fertilised with manure, and natural gas used as feedstock for combined heat and power (CHP) production. A Danish willow-based CHP model system was assessed whereas data for the fossil-based system was from literature. When compared on a product-to-product basis using the reference approach, bio-based CHP production is inferior to fossil-based CHP with respect to resource use (transformities of 2.31 E+05. seJ/J and 0.88 E+05. seJ/J, respectively). If the manure is considered as a waste and modelled as heat loss, the single-product transformity for biobased production is only 0.37 E+05. seJ/J. When compared on a system-to-system basis, bio-based production is competitive with fossil-based production (transformities of 2.21 E+05. seJ/J and 2.29 E+05. seJ/J, respectively). The paper evaluates compatibility of suggested approaches with emergy theory and practices and presents a discussion of the distinction between waste and resource. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European Union has set a 10 % target for the share of renewable energy in the transportation sector for 2020. To reach this target, second generation biofuels from, for example, forest residues are expected to replace around 3 % of the transport fossil fuel consumption. However, forest residues could also be utilised in the heat and electricity sectors where large amounts of fossil fuels can be replaced, thus reducing global fossil CO2 emissions. This study investigates the use of forest residues for second generation biofuel (ethanol or methanol) or combined heat and power (CHP) production at the European level, with focus on the influence of different economic policy instruments, such as carbon cost or biofuel policy support. A techno-economic, geographically explicit optimisation model is used. The model determines the optimal locations of bioenergy conversion plants by minimising the cost of the entire supply chain. The results show that in order to reach a 3 % second generation biofuel share, a biofuel support comparable to today's tax exemptions would be needed. With a carbon cost applied, most available forest residues would be allocated to CHP production, with a substantial resulting CO2 emission reduction potential. The major potential for woody biomass and biofuel production is found in the region around the Baltic Sea, with Italy as one of the main biofuel importers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biofuels impact on global land use has been a controversial yet important topic. Up until recently, there has not been enough biofuels to have caused major land use change, so the evidence from actual global land use data has been scant. However, in the past decade, there have been 72 million hectares added to global crop cover. In this research we take advantage of this new data to calibrate the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and parameters. We make two major changes. First, we calibrate the land transformation parameters (called constant elasticity of transformation, CET) to global regions so that the parameters better reflect the actual land cover change that has occurred. Second, we alter the land cover nesting structure. In the old GTAP model, cropland, pasture, and forest were all in the same nest suggesting, everything else being equal, that pasture or forest convert to cropland with equal ease and cost. However, we now take advantage of the fact that pasture converts to cropland at lower cost than forest. The paper provides the theoretical and empirical justification for these two model improvements. Then it re-evaluates the global land use impacts due to the USA ethanol program using the improved model tuned with actual observations. Finally, it shows that compared to the old model, the new model projects: (1) less expansion in global cropland due to ethanol expansion; (2) lower U.S. share in global cropland expansion; (3) and lower forest share in global cropland expansion. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - The performance and microbial community characteristics of a laboratory scale anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with four compartments (C1-C4) treating sugar refinery wastewater were investigated. The COD removal was 94.8 % with a CH4 yield of 0.21 Lg-1 CODremoved at total organic loading rate (OLR) of 5.33 kg COD/m-3day-1. Fermentative bacteria were dominant in C1 and C2, while syntrophic acetogens and methanogens were dominant in C3 and C4. Some acid-tolerant methanogens were enriched in acidogenic phase. The present of the acid-tolerant methanogens could improve the efficiency and stability of the ABR as the most of the methanogens are vulnerable to low pH. In addition, high functional redundancy of the fermentative bacteria implicated that the microbial communities in acidogenic phase were stable functionally and allowed the ABR to balance perturbation. It was also found that syntrophic acetogenesis might be a weakness in the ABR as syntrophic acetogens were poor as compared with fermentative bacteria and methanogens. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Management of heathlands has been problematic for some decades and the situation is now acute. These areas have mostly lost the economic drivers that once sustained them. Now, with eutrophication, successional change, and difficulties in getting reliable conservation grazing, many sites are under threat. This article suggests that the approach applied to North American and continental European wood-fuel lots could offer a local economic function for heathlands.

AB  - Purpose: The main objective of this study is to expand the discussion about how, and to what extent, the environmental performance is affected by the use of different life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) illustrated by the case study of the comparison between environmental impacts of gasoline and ethanol form sugarcane in Brazil. Methods: The following LCIA methods have been considered in the evaluation: CML 2001, Impact 2002+, EDIP 2003, Eco-indicator 99, TRACI 2, ReCiPe, and Ecological Scarcity 2006. Energy allocation was used to split the environmental burdens between ethanol and surplus electricity generated at the sugarcane mill. The phases of feedstock and (bio)fuel production, distribution, and use are included in system boundaries. Results and discussion: At the midpoint level, comparison of different LCIA methods showed that ethanol presents lower impacts than gasoline in important categories such as global warming, fossil depletion, and ozone layer depletion. However, ethanol presents higher impacts in acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation, and agricultural land use categories. Regarding to single-score indicators, ethanol presented better performance than gasoline using ReCiPe Endpoint LCIA method. Using IMPACT 2002+, Eco-indicator 99, and Ecological Scarcity 2006, higher scores are verified for ethanol, mainly due to the impacts related to particulate emissions and land use impacts. Conclusions: Although there is a relative agreement on the results regarding equivalent environmental impact categories using different LCIA methods at midpoint level, when single-score indicators are considered, use of different LCIA methods lead to different conclusions. Single-score results also limit the interpretability at endpoint level, as a consequence of small contributions of relevant environmental impact categories weighted in a single-score indicator. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: This paper performs a life cycle assessment study for a white wine produced in the northern part of Portugal, i.e. the white vinho verde. The purpose is to identify the environmental impacts occurring along the wine life cycle as well as the stages that mostly contribute to the environmental impact, as well as the associated causes. The stages considered include: (1) viticulture, (2) wine production (vinification to storage), (3) wine distribution and (4) bottles production. Methods: The consumption of materials and energy, as well as the emissions to air, soil and water from the wine campaign of 2008/2009 were reported to the functional unit (0.75 l of white vinho verde). A Portuguese company that produces about 25 % of the current total production of white vinho verde supplied specific life cycle data for the stages of viticulture, wine production and distribution. SimaPro and the Ecoinvent database were used to perform the environmental assessment using CML 2001 impact methodology. A sensitivity analysis for a set of significant parameters was performed. Results: Results show that for viticulture the contribution of each impact category is larger than 50 %. The production of bottles is the second contributor varying from about 4 % (to eutrophication) to 26 % (to acidification). Wine production and distribution are the subsequent contributors. The contribution of wine production varies between 0.6 % (to land competition) and about 13 % (from marine aquatic and sediment ecotoxicity 100a). The contribution of distribution is up to 14 % (to photochemical oxidation). Sensitivity analysis shows that significant changes are calculated for parameters as the nitrate leaching to groundwater, the emission of nitrous oxide from managed soil, and from runoff and leaching. Changes in these parameters are significant for only a few impact categories as eutrophication and global warming. Conclusions: Viticulture is the stage with the largest relative contribution to the overall environmental impact and the bottle production is the subsequent stage. In order to improve the environmental performance of the supply chain for wine, it is necessary to optimise the dosage of fertilisers and phytosanitary products used during viticulture. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the most influential parameters relate with the emission of nitrogen compounds associated with the use of fertilisers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: There has been lively debate, especially in Finland and Sweden, on the climate impacts of peat fuel. Previous studies of peat fuel's life-cycle climate impacts were controversial in their interpretation. The aim of this paper is conclusive examination of the issues of LCA methodology, derived from critical review of previous studies and recalculation based on the latest knowledge of greenhouse gas balances related to peat fuel's utilisation and the radiative forcing impacts of greenhouse gases. Methods: The most recent findings on emissions and the gas fluxes between soil, vegetation and atmosphere were used in calculation of the life-cycle climate impacts of the various peat fuel utilisation chains by means of LCA methodology. In the main, the calculation methods and rules were the same as in the previous studies, with the aim being to distinguish the impact of peat fuel's utilisation from that of the natural or semi-natural situation. A dynamic method was employed for assessing changes in radiative forcing. The results of alternative peat fuel utilisation chains were compared to the corresponding result for coal. Results: There are many steps in peat fuel LCA, where different assumptions lead to different outcomes. Determining the functional unit, reference situations and system boundaries, as well as the emission calculation methods, is important from this point of view. Determination of the initial reference situation emerged as one of the critical points in the calculations. Time scale can strongly affect the final outcomes in a study where effects of long-term land-use change are considered. Conclusions: Each peatland area is unique. The higher the greenhouse gas emissions in the initial reference situation, the greater is the climate impact of the area and the more suitable the area is for peat extraction. The study showed that more greenhouse gas flux measurements are needed, for better assessment of the climate impacts of different potential peat extraction sites. Climate change mitigation requires quick actions, and uncertainties related to emissions are higher for longer time spans. Therefore, it can be concluded that a perspective spanning more than 100 years is inappropriate in peat fuel's life-cycle climate impact assessments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - It has been claimed that Camelina sativa, a recently introduced crop in the northern Great Plains, is a highly competitive species. However, this issue has not been formally tested. Utilizing replacement series diagrams, we assessed the importance of growing conditions in the competitive ability of C. sativa. Results indicated that canola and Bromus tectorum were superior competitors in both loam and sandy soils, thus providing evidence that C. sativa may not be as competitive as previously indicated.

AB  - Ecological-economic model simulations of the world food system have been used to study the impacts of historic and future liquid transport biofuel expansion on agricultural markets and the environment. Almost half of global cropland increase between 2000 and 2008 (about 8 Mha or 0.5% of global cropland) can be attributed to biofuel expansion alone. The central 'New Policies Scenario' of the World Energy Outlook 2011 projects an increase of conventional crop-based biofuel use from 60 Mtoe (2.5 EJ) in 2010 to annually 160 Mtoe (6.7 EJ) in 2035. Until 2020, the projected biofuel consumption provides no or little cumulative net greenhouse gas (GHG) savings as the time period is hardly sufficient to compensate for carbon losses due to over 10 Mha of additional land use conversion. By 2035, cumulative net GHG savings improve up to 2.8 Pg CO2 equivalent in a scenario with assumed higher agricultural productivity growth in developing countries. This scenario increases the developing region's competitive positions and avoids additional people at risk of hunger due to higher commodity prices caused by biofuel use. Available underutilized grassland and woodland may provide land resources suitable for nonfood energy crop production required for the second-generation biofuel conversion pathways, while causing only limited impacts on food security and biodiversity. We estimate between 246 and 475 Mha of global grassland and woodland to be agronomically suitable for industrial-scale lignocellulosic energy crop production, with achievable rain-fed yields of at least 10 tons of dry matter per hectare, with good accessibility and relatively low ruminant livestock density. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol production by Flammulina velutipes from high substrate concentrations was evaluated. F. velutipes produces approximately 40-60 g l-1 ethanol from 15 % (w/v) d-glucose, d-fructose, d-mannose, sucrose, maltose, and cellobiose, with the highest conversion rate of 83 % observed using cellobiose as a carbon source. We also attempted to assess direct ethanol fermentation from sugarcane bagasse cellulose (SCBC) by F. velutipes. The hydrolysis rate of 15 % (w/v) SCBC with commercial cellulase was approximately 20 %. In contrast, F. velutipes was able to produce a significant amount of ethanol from 15 % SCBC with the production of β-glucosidase, cellobohydrolase, and cellulase, although the addition of a small amount of commercial cellulase to the culture was required for the conversion. When 9 mg g-1 biomass of commercial cellulase was added to cultures, 0.36 g of ethanol was produced from 1 g of cellulose, corresponding to an ethanol conversion rate of 69.6 %. These results indicate that F. velutipes would be useful for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol. © 2013 The British Mycological Society.

AB  - The UK whole-wheat bioethanol and straw and DDGS-based combined heat and power (CHP) generation systems were assessed for environmental sustainability using a range of impact categories or characterisations (IC): cumulative primary fossil energy (CPE), land use, life cycle global warming potential over 100 years (GWP100), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and abiotic resources use (ARU). The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive's target of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission saving of 60% in comparison to an equivalent fossil-based system by 2020 seems to be very challenging for stand-alone wheat bioethanol system. However, the whole-wheat integrated system, wherein the CHP from the excess straw grown in the same season and from the same land is utilised in the wheat bioethanol plant, can be demonstrated for potential sustainability improvement, achieving 85% emission reduction and 97% CPE saving compared to reference fossil systems. The net bioenergy from this system and from 172,370 ha of grade 3 land is 12.1 PJ y-1 providing land to energy yield of 70 GJ ha-1 y-1. The use of DDGS as an animal feed replacing soy meal incurs environmental emission credit, whilst its use in heat or CHP generation saves CPE. The hot spots in whole system identified under each impact category are as follows: bioethanol plant and wheat cultivation for CPE (50% and 48%), as well as for ARU (46% and 52%). EP and GWP100 are distributed among wheat cultivation (49% and 37%), CHP plant (26% and 30%) and bioethanol plant (25%, and 33%), respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Genetic improvement of crop yields under potential (Yp) and water scarce conditions (Yw) will be an important avenue to improved food security over the next four decades, at the end of which projected demand for food, feed and biofuel feedstock is expected to level out. Current measured relative rates of improvement in Yp and Yw for the three main cereal crops (maize, wheat and rice) in many cropping systems in the world are mostly well below the 1.16-1.31%y-1 rates required to meet projected demand for cereals in 2050. These relative rates can be expected to fall further if the current absolute rates of yield improvement continue unchanged and/or the current indications of stagnation in yield improvement for some crops in some regions of the world become widespread. This review assesses the available evidence for unexploited opportunities for enhancing current rates of genetic improvement for Yp and Yw, and examines some substantive proposals for achieving the same end through genetic engineering of photosynthesis, above-ground ideotype design, and improvement of root capacity for water uptake. Because time is of the essence, special attention is paid to the time scales required to progress potentially useful traits through to proof of concept under field conditions, from there to farmer-ready cultivars, and for widespread adoption by farmers of the improved cultivars. The requirements of breeders for inclusion of potentially important traits into the conventional breeding process are outlined and the value of molecular breeding tools as aids to genetic improvement of simple and complex traits is considered. Intellectual property and regulatory requirements are taken as additional potential drags on the rates of adoption into the breeding process of useful traits and/or to the free flow of information between research teams. Main conclusions are: (a) there are some unexploited opportunities to improve Yp or Yw in some crops and/or cropping systems; (b) exploitation of these opportunities could be hastened by increasing funding for focussed research and by identifying and eliminating or reducing drags at various stages of the idea to farmer-ready cultivar chain; (c) the time-scales required for major improvements in yield in farmer-ready cultivars through genetic engineering or ideotype realisation are likely to be measured in decades rather than years; (d) current and expected future relative rates of progress in Yp and Yw are a matter of real concern and are insufficient to meet projected demand for cereals by 2050. Possible step changes in Yp or Yw powered by genetic improvements such as exploitation of hybrid vigour in rice or hypothetical successes in the genetic engineering of photosynthesis are unlikely to change this outlook. The pessimistic assessments embodied in the last two conclusions should not obscure the fact that without continued investment in the search for sources of genetic improvement and development of aids to breeding, the unmet demands for cereals in 2050 will be even greater. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) targets, implemented to achieve climate change mitigation, affect the level of agricultural production in the EU and in the rest of the world. This article presents an impact assessment of increased biomass supply under different sustainability constraints on land use and resulting total GHG emissions at global and EU level. We apply GLOBIOM, a global partial equilibrium model integrating the agricultural, livestock, bioenergy and forestry sectors based on geographically explicit modeling of supply under prescribed demand. According to the model, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture and land-use change (LUC) are anticipated to rise significantly up to 2030 due to various drivers (among others: GDP and population, diet shifts, and also bioenergy demand) despite basic sustainability criteria implemented by the RED (Reference scenario). Applying additional criteria, mainly protecting biodiversity outside the EU, overall GHG emissions can be reduced by 5% in 2030 compared to the Reference. Deforestation area decreases in this scenario slightly due to exclusion of high biodiversity forests but also due to increasing demand for energy wood that makes forests more valuable. If, however, in addition, deforestation is prevented through effective land-use policies, global GHG emissions can be reduced by 20% (compared to the Reference scenario). We conclude that sustainability criteria applied to biofuel production and imports only, do not mitigate potential negative impacts on total GHG emissions effectively. Unsustainable biomass production in sectors not covered by the bioenergy criteria can be best avoided by targeting deforestation and biodiversity loss directly. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs), as submitted to the European Commission by the 27 European Union member states (EU27), show ambitious development paths for the deployment of biomass in the heat, electricity, and transport sectors up to 2020. This study analyzes the distribution of different biomass feedstocks over these sectors for various biomass scenarios, examining the fixed development paths described in the NREAPs, while also presenting a possible change in biomass demand for these scenarios. The analysis also reaches beyond the scope of the NREAPs up to 2030. The allocation of biomass for heating (H), electricity (E) and transport (T) applications in the EU27 has been modeled using the RESolve toolkit. RESolve can work both in a static mode and in a dynamic mode. In the static mode the demand for biomass based energy per sector (H, E, and T) is constrained to a fixed amount, whereas in the dynamic mode this constraint is relaxed: the interaction with other renewable (and partially also fossil) energy sources may result in a change in bioenergy demand. From the analysis it can be concluded that in most EU countries the NREAP figures for bioenergy deployment will not be reached under the present regional and national policy/support schemes and market developments. When applying stricter sustainability criteria, the bioenergy developments in the EU27 decrease even further. These effects are strongest for the use of biofuels in transport and biogas for electricity. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Three scenarios are developed to illustrate the likely impacts of sustainability criteria on biomass supply and demand within the Biomass Futures project. This paper presents the rationale behind these scenarios. The reference scenario re-analyzes the NREAP bioenergy demands based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria targeted to biofuels for transport. It provides a refined basis for assessing sustainable bioenergy supply curves. As such, it is expected that this scenario provides member states with direct input to update their National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) templates and to benchmark the available information with a coherent, harmonized approach of estimating the biomass role in the different markets (heat, electricity, and transport) for each member state. The sustainability scenario, on the other hand, expands its coverage to electricity and heat production and applies the sustainability criteria to all bioenergy sectors. Additionally, it considers more stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation criteria for all bioenergy carriers (70%). A high biomass scenario focuses on stronger policy ambitions. The objective of this scenario is to analyze the role of biomass in view of the quite large amount of unutilized biomass potential in the EU, even when the sustainability criteria are included in analyzing the potential. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Like other EU Member States, Austria will meet the substitution target of the EU European Renewable Energy Directive for transportation almost exclusively by first generation biofuels, primarily biodiesel from oilseed rape (OSR). Genetically modified (GM) plants have been promoted as a new option for biofuel production as they promise higher yield or higher quality feedstock. We tested implications of GM OSR application for biodiesel production in Austria by means of high resolution spatially explicit simulation of 140 different coexistence scenarios within six main OSR cropping regions in Austria (2400 km2). We identified structural land use characteristics such as field size, land use diversity, land holding patterns and the proportion of the target crop as the predominant factors which influence overall production of OSR in a coexistence scenario. Assuming isolation distances of 800 m and non-GM-OSR proportions of at least 10% resulted in a loss of area for cultivation of OSR in all study areas ranging from -4.5% to more than -25%, depending on the percentage of GM farmers and on the region. We could show that particularly the current primary OSR cropping regions are largely unsuitable for coexistence and would suffer from a net loss of OSR area even at isolation distances of 400 or 800 m. Coexistence constraints associated with application of GM OSR are likely to offset possible GM gains by substantially reducing farmland for OSR cultivation, thus contradicting the political aim to increase domestic OSR area to meet the combined demands of food, feed and biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates how different sustainability criteria restrict the supply of cropped biomass sources within the EU. There are already mandatory sustainability criteria formulated in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) at EU level for biomass feedstocks to be used for conversion into biofuels. For solid and gaseous biomass feedstock, however, there are only recommendations formulated by the European Commission (EC) to be adopted on a voluntary basis by the EU member states (MS). This paper specifically focuses on the potential supply of biomass from crops for all bioenergy sectors when applying stricter sustainability criteria. These criteria relate to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation targets, including indirect land-use change (iLUC) related GHG emissions, and the introduction of no-go areas, such as areas of high biodiversity value and high carbon stock. The results show that stricter criteria indeed reduce the cropping potential and change the crop mix significantly, as rotational arable crops for biofuels do no longer comply with the stricter mitigation criteria. This is because they usually compete with food and feed crops for higher quality land requiring a compensation for iLUC emissions. The stricter sustainability criteria can only be applied successfully if they are accompanied by a change in demand, in particular for lignocellulosic biomass for advanced biofuels and other bioenergy uses. Without stimulation of such pathways, it will be difficult to realize improved sustainability in the bio-energy sector. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the methodology and the main energy-related projections for various scenarios quantified with the PRIMES biomass model. The PRIMES biomass model quantifies scenarios for the biomass supply system based on a given demand for bio-energy commodities which is exogenous to the model. The scenarios quantified the impacts of different scenario contexts (only climate and energy package targets and long-term decarbonization targets) and/or of different policies and measures on the biomass supply system. The analysis shows that the demand for bio-energy commodities in the case of achieving only the climate and energy package targets can be met mostly with currently known technologies; the assessment has also shown that demand projected by the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) could be met for most bio-energy commodity types with known technologies; however, some issues have been identified regarding the mix of commodities. The 2050 decarbonization objectives are found to be feasible as far as biomass contribution is concerned, but for this, considerable development of advanced technologies will be necessary. However, if sustainability criteria are stricter the achievement of the 2020 targets is found problematic; although in the long-term toward 2050 the effect is lower, thanks to advanced technology developments. In case demand for biofuels in transportation increases beyond standard projections, due to for example a delay in transport electrification, stronger development of advanced technologies was found necessary. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Canola (Brassica napus) is cultivated for oil as a biofuel crop. Few quantitative data concerning its tolerance to abiotic stresses has been presented. We evaluated the tolerances of canola to drought and salinity stresses in terms of parameter values in a macroscopic root water uptake model. We conducted an experiment using nine columns with two plants in each: three columns were under drought stresses, another three were under saline stress and others provided potential transpiration. Two soil moisture and salinity probes were inserted into each of the six columns under stress to monitor water content and electrical conductivity. Weight of the columns was manually measured to obtain daily transpiration. Water uptake at each depth and time was calculated by substituting linearly interpolated matric and osmotic potentials into the stress response function. Determined stress response functions indicated that canola is more sensitive to drought compared to Jatropha. While, it was found to be as tolerant as Jatropha to salinity stress in terms of transpiration. Matric potential was more determining than osmotic potential to root water uptake of canola.

AB  - Soil erosion and loss of soil organic C (SOC) may limit the sustainable harvest of crop residues for biofuels from dryland systems in the semiarid Great Plains. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capabilities and constraints of harvesting residues from dryland systems. The study used observations from a long-term experiment in Colorado to examine biomass production from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] at three no-till sites in a winter wheat-corn-fallow (WCF) or winter wheat-sorghum-fallow cropping system. Modeling evaluated the impact of residue removal on erosion rates and SOC dynamics. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and the Wind Erosion Equation were used to simulate erosion, and the DAYCENT model was used to estimate changes in SOC with residue removal. Biomass yield for WCF averaged 3.8 Mg ha-1, divided into stover and grain yields of 2.2 and 1.6 Mg ha-1. Water erosion was not shown to constrain residue harvest, but modeling indicated unsustainable wind erosion rates after removing 10 to 30% of corn residue. Simulations showed that up to 80% of wheat straw could be harvested without exceeding sustainable wind erosion rates. The major constraint to sustainable residue harvest is a residue return rate of 2.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1 of biomass to maintain SOC. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack) is a minor cereal crop in Alberta which has recently garnered interest as a biofuel feedstock. Basic agronomic information is lacking for triticale cultivars released since 1990. Field experiments were initiated in 2010 and conducted for 2 yr at four sites in central and southern Alberta to compare the impact of cultivar selection, seeding date, and seeding rate on grain yield, grain quality, and other agronomic traits. Six triticale cultivars released between 1996 and 2011, and one SoftWhite Spring wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L.) were evaluated over two seeding dates; one before and one after 15% of the total seasonal growing degree days (GDD; base = 0°C) had elapsed. Th e cultivars were evaluated at seeding rates of 250, 375, and 500 seeds m-2. Older triticale cultivars had higher grain yields but lower grain quality than cultivars released after 2000. Th e triticale cultivars produced more grain than SoftWhite Spring wheat in five of seven environments; however, SoftWhite Spring wheat exhibited better grain quality than the triticales. Yield generally increased linearly with seeding rate but the highest return on investment was observed at 375 seeds m-2. Provided there was not an early frost, triticale seeded after 15% of the seasonal GDD had elapsed could produce grain yield similar to the earlier-seeded triticale. A sustainable management system for triticale includes modern cultivars, a seeding date that can accumulate 1750 GDD's before frost, and a sowing density of at least 375 seeds m-2. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - The production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass is a promising technology for developing a renewable source of energy. Efforts to produce ethanol from cellulosic biomass using microbes, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, face major challenges, including the need for detoxification. Here, we apply a strategy to discover genetic alterations that lead to improved robustness of S. cerevisiae in the presence of acetate, which is present at toxic concentrations in hemicellulose hydrolysates. Acetate in its protonated form (acetic acid) enters the cell through passive diffusion and dissociates into a proton and acetate, acidifying the cytosol and inhibiting cell function, an effect that is exacerbated in the presence of sodium. Through flow cytometry analysis, implemented as part of a novel cell culture technique, the Cytostat, we characterized the deleterious effects of sodium acetate on growth and on cell size homeostasis. Further, using the Cytostat to screen a genome-wide, gene overexpression library, we identified that overexpressing the ENA2 gene, a P-type sodium pump ATPase, provides a significant growth improvement in the presence of sodium acetate. Together, our data support the proposed mechanism for the synergistic growth inhibition exerted by acetate and sodium, as well as the mechanism that develops resistance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Through a micro-level study of a biofuel-related land acquisition in rural Tamil Nadu, India, this article reveals how state-subject relations are shaping modern land deal politics. Through its political construction of the concept of 'wasteland' and its associated wasteland development programme, the Indian state has facilitated a series of questionable land acquisitions, reshaping agrarian livelihoods in the process. A class of land brokers has emerged to help carry out the state's project of converting 'wastelands' to more 'productive', state-defined uses such as biofuel cultivation and industrial expansion. Those whose lands have been acquired as part of these programmes have undergone a transition to wage labour, increasing the prolitarianization of agrarian communities. By documenting the mechanics of this 'wasteland governmentality', this study contributes to a political sociology of the state by unpacking the linkages between the state and agrarian subjects in the context of the 'global land grab'. © 2013 International Institute of Social Studies.

AB  - In Mexico and all over the world, the number of studies on the species of the Jatropha genus has increased because of the use of its seed oil to produce biodiesel. However, the knowledge of the taxonomy, distribution, and ethnobotany of these and related species is incomplete. This article presents the distribution of the genus in Mexico according to its internationally accepted taxonomic identity. The distribution is linked to environmental variables such as elevation, climate type, soil, and soil moisture patterns. In addition to showing the current taxonomical knowledge in Mexico, this article discusses its biogeography, its traditional uses and the research lines to follow in further study of the genus. The distribution results show that some species are broadly adapted; as a consequence, they are present in many different environments. Species such as J. dioica, J. curcas, J. cordata, J. cinerea and J. gaumeri are distributed in areas with well defined environmental conditions. However, the distribution of species such as J. riojae has not yet been ascertained. Three areas with high species richness were identified, and they are very important for the study and conservation of the genus. Mexico is a global center of diversity for this genus. Food and medicinal uses have been reported for some species. This article concludes with recommendations for further study to improve the knowledge of this genus in Mexico. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The large-scale industrial agriculture that provides the majority of food at present is dependent upon fossil fuels in the form of tractor fuel, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. Yet, the age of cheap and abundant fossil fuels will likely come to an end within the coming decades. In this case study, the productivity of a small-scale farm (8 ha arable land, 5.5 ha meadow, 3.5 ha pasture and 18 ha forest) independent on fossil fuels by using organic methods and draught horse power was investigated. The aim was to quantify its productivity when the animal composition and possible alternatives to tractive power were varied. After an analysis of possible solutions, three scenarios for tractive power were selected: draught horse power, diesel tractor, and combination of draught horse power and rapeseed oil fueled tractor. A model that calculates the amount of food available at the farm in terms of meat, milk egg, and crops, converts it into energy units and calculates how many people can be supplied from the farm was developed. The most reasonable of the scenarios studied was when draught horse power was combined with tractor (and combine harvester) driven on locally produced rapeseed oil. Then the farm will have access to all advantages with the tractor and harvester, e.g., timeliness in harvest and lifting heavy loads, and the renewability and efficiency of draught horse power on smaller fields, and lighter operations. This system was able to support between 66 and 82 persons depending on crop yields, milk yields, meat production, fuel demand for the tractor, and availability of forest grazing. Most likely the production capacity lands on ability to support approximately 68-70 persons, and the farm may require fossil fuels to support more than 80 persons. If all farmland globally was to be operated with the same productivity, this would be enough for supplying the global population with food at present. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Summary: Biomass production for bioenergy may change soil microbes and influence ecosystem properties. To explore the impact of different bioenergy cropping systems on soil microorganisms, the compositions and quantities of soil microbial communities (16S rRNA gene) and N-cycling functional groups (nifH, bacterial amoA, archaeal amoA and nosZ genes) were assessed under maize, switchgrass and Miscanthus x giganteus at seven sites representing a climate gradient (precipitation and temperature) in Illinois, USA. Overall, the site-to-site variation in community composition surpassed the variation due to plant type, and microbial communities under each crop did not converge on a 'typical' species assemblage. Fewer than 5% of archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nifH and nosZ OTUs were significantly different among these crops, but the largest differences observed at each site were found between maize and the two perennial grasses. Quantitative PCR revealed that the abundance of the nifH gene was significantly higher in the perennial grasses than in maize, and we also found significantly higher total N in the perennial grass soils than in maize. Thus, we conclude that cultivation of these perennial grasses, instead of maize, as bioenergy feedstocks can improve soil ecosystem nitrogen sustainability by increasing the population size of N-fixing bacteria.

AB  - Perennial biofuel crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass are thought to increase soil organic matter and therefore may increase soil nitrogen (N) mineralization rates. Our objective was to evaluate a range of N-mineralization indices for soils with established biofuel crops and compare these results with soils in a traditional corn and soybean rotation. We sampled surface soil (0-10 cm deep) from switchgrass (6 years after establishment) and Miscanthus plots (5 years) in a high-organic-matter Mollisol. The longest potential N mineralization index, a 24-day incubation, was significantly greater in Miscanthus soils compared to switchgrass and corn-soybean. In addition, 7-day anaerobic N and potassium chloride-extractable ammonium N were both greater in Miscanthus soils compared to switchgrass and corn-soybean. Our results do support our hypothesis that N-mineralization rates are greater in soils under biofuel production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Oil derived from photosynthetic microalgae is a potential major source of renewable energy, but while industrial-scale efforts to grow algal biomass are underway, it remains an expensive process. The cost of biomass production may be offset by using the algae to simultaneously remediate chemical contaminants from wastewater or natural surface waters. This work examines trace metal accumulation and cycling in algae grown for biofuel use, and evaluates the potential of this approach for remediation purposes. In the system studied, a natural, mixed-species algal community was allowed to develop on a shallow floway fed with water from the York River estuary (VA, USA). Accumulation of metals ranged widely in the algal biomass (Fe > Mn > >Pb > Cu > V > Cd) and represented removal from the dissolved phase of between 1 and 87% (for Cd and Pb, respectively). These metals were selected for analysis because of their differing geochemical behavior, as well as their importance as micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, V) and toxicants (Pb, Cu, Cd). Most of the algal metal inventory was partitioned in the intracellular fraction (∼30% for Mn, 50-90% for other metals; operationally defined using a chemical wash technique), indicating accumulation due to biochemical demand, not adsorption to cell surfaces. Although algal community composition was similar on the upstream and downstream ends of the floway, the metal inventory was two-fold higher on the downstream end. Differences in metal accumulation may have been related to algal physiology or to pronounced cycles of water pH and dissolved oxygen driven by algal photosynthesis and respiration. Differences in metal removal efficiency and biomass inventory indicate that algal floway systems may be manipulated to optimize remediation of metal-contaminated water. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Efforts to meet the European Union's (EU) alternative energy targets have resulted in increased production of biofuels. This production has resulted in deforestation-related emissions through displacement of agricultural production, a problem known as indirect land-use change. The European Commission (EC) has proposed regulatory options to respond to this problem, but all risk not being in conformity withWorld Trade Organization (WTO) law.Trade law challenges result from the underlying methodological uncertainty, and the attempt to address a systemic problem on the level of individual producers.Yet, this does not necessarily indicate that the intent of these regulations is to protect EU markets.Thus, this is an instructive case study to examine the relationship betweenWTO law and complex, emerging environmental problems. © 2013 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.

AB  - This paper investigates market effects of the Brazilian biodiesel law, which made the use of biodiesel, blended with petroleum diesel, mandatory in Brazil. The study estimates the demand curve for diesel fuel (biodiesel and petroleum diesel) and the industry supply curve of biodiesel. These two pieces of information have been used in a static analysis to draw scenarios with different biodiesel mandates. The results show that the current proportion of biodiesel in the diesel mixture (5%) increases consumers' price by 1.7% and decreases the consumption by 1.5% compared to the scenario without biodiesel. Also, an increase in the biodiesel percentage to 10% would raise the price by 3.5% and reduce the consumption by 3%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding latitudinal adaptation of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus J. M. Greef & Deuter ex Hodk. & Renvoize) to the southern Great Plains is key to maximizing productivity by matching each grass variety to its optimal production environment. The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify latitudinal variation in production of representative upland switchgrass ecotypes (Blackwell, Cave-in-Rock, and Shawnee), lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Alamo, Kanlow), and Miscanthus in the southern half of the US Great Plains and (2) to investigate the environmental factors affecting yield variation. Leaf area and yield were measured on plots at 10 locations in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. More cold winter days led to decreased subsequent Alamo switchgrass yields and increased subsequent upland switchgrass yields. More hot-growing season days led to decreased Kanlow and Miscanthus yields. Increased drought intensity also contributed to decreased Miscanthus yields. Alamo switchgrass had the greatest radiation use efficiency (RUE) with a mean of 4. 3 g per megajoule intercepted PAR and water use efficiency (WUE) with a mean of 4. 5 mg of dry weight per gram of water transpired. The representative RUE values for other varieties ranged from 67 to 80 % of Alamo's RUE value and 67 to 87 % of Alamo's WUE. These results will provide valuable inputs to process-based models to realistically simulate these important perennial grasses in this region and to assess the environmental impacts of production on water use and nutrient demands. In addition, it will also be useful for landowners and companies choosing the most productive perennial grasses for biofuel production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - Increased production of bioenergy crops in North America is projected to exacerbate already heavy demands upon existing agricultural landscapes with potential to impact biodiversity negatively. Grassland specialist birds are an imperilled avifauna for which perennial-based, next-generation agroenergy feedstocks may provide suitable habitat. We take a multi-scaled spatial approach to evaluate the ability of two candidate second-generation agroenergy feedstocks (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum, and mixed grass-forb plantings) to act as spring migratory stopover habitat for birds. In total, we detected 35 bird species in mixed grass-forb plantings and switchgrass plantings, including grassland specialists and species of state and national conservation concern (e. g., Henslow's Sparrow, Ammodramus henslowii). Some evidence indicated that patches with higher arthropod food availability attracted a greater diversity of migrant bird species, but species richness, total bird abundance, and the abundance of grassland specialist species were similar in fields planted with either feedstock. Species richness per unit area (species density) was relatively higher in switchgrass fields. The percent land cover of forest in landscapes surrounding study fields was negatively associated with bird species richness and species density. Habitat patch size and within-patch vegetation structure were unimportant in predicting the diversity or abundance of spring en route bird assemblages. Our results demonstrate that both switchgrass and mixed grass-forb plantings can attract diverse assemblages of migrant birds. As such, industrialized production of these feedstocks as agroenergy crops has the potential to provide a source of en route habitat for birds, particularly where fields are located in relatively unforested landscapes. Because industrialization of cellulosic biomass production will favor as yet unknown harvest and management regimes, predicting the ultimate value of perennial-based biomass plantings for spring migrants remains difficult. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - California Governor's Executive Order (CGEO) S-3-05 requires that California greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be reduced to 80 % below 1990 levels by the year 2050. Meeting this target will require drastic changes in transportation technology, fuel, and behavior which will reduce criteria pollutant emissions as well as GHG emissions. The improvement to local air quality caused by the reduced criteria pollutant emissions must be calculated to fully evaluate the overall benefits and costs of CGEO S-3-05. In the present study, seven different transportation scenarios that move towards the goals of CGEO S-3-05 in the transportation sector were examined to determine how they would affect future airborne particulate matter (PM2. 5) concentrations in California: (1) hydrogen fuel cells, (2) electric vehicles, (3) high efficiency vehicles, (4) public mass transit, (5) biofuels, (6) biofuels + hybrid electric vehicles, and (7) hydrogen fuel cells + electric vehicles. The air quality implications of each scenario were evaluated using a chemical transport model applied during a wintertime stagnation episode representing future climate in California. Scenarios (6) and (7) reduced population-weighted PM2. 5 mass concentrations by ~9 % and PM2. 5 elemental carbon (EC) concentrations by ~30 % relative to base-case predictions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper analyses the financial performance of a poplar short rotation woody crop (SRWC) plantation in Belgium, from a farmer's and an investor's viewpoint, based on simulations from the newly developed model POPFINUA. The establishment, production and harvest costs were investigated to calculate the net present value (NPV) and the equivalent annual value (EAV) of the SRWC cultivation when the biomass chips were sold at a price of 40 € Mg-1 with a moisture content (m. c.) of 50 %. The calculated NPVs were 229 and -485 € ha-1, and the EAVs equalled 16. 3 and -34. 6 € ha-1 year-1 for the farmer's and investor's scenario, respectively. The break-even price at which the produced biomass could be sold at the farm gate excluding transport, handling, storage and profit margins of the involved companies was calculated using the levellised costs (LC) method and equalled 78. 4 and 83. 5 € oven-dried ton (odt)-1 for the farmer's and investor's viewpoint, respectively. Three harvesting strategies, applied on a SRWC plantation of 18. 1 ha in Flanders (Belgium), were studied and compared. It became clear that preference should be given to more economic, small-scale harvesters instead of large-scale self-propelled harvesters, given the relatively limited surface available for SRWCs in Belgium. Furthermore, the inclusion of transportation over a distance of 50 km by truck increased the LC by 15. 1 € odt-1. Moreover, subsidies such as establishment grants and/or yearly incentives proved indispensable to make this long-term investment profitable. This is particularly true for the scenario where an investor decides to cultivate SRWCs for energy purposes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Although upgrading bio-oil from fast pyrolysis of biomass is an attractive pathway for biofuel production, nitrogen (N) and mineral matter carried over from the feedstock to the bio-oil represents a serious contaminant in the process. Reducing the N and ash content of biomass feedstocks would improve process reliability and reduce production costs of pyrolytic biofuels. This study investigated: (1) How does switchgrass harvest date influence the yield, N concentration ([N]), and ash concentration of biomass and fast pyrolysis products? and (2) Is there a predictive relationship between [N] of switchgrass biomass and [N] of fast pyrolysis products? Switchgrass from five harvest dates and varying [N] from central Iowa were pyrolyzed using a free-fall reactor. Harvestable biomass peaked in August (8. 6 Mg ha-1), dropping significantly by November (6. 7 Mg ha-1, P = 0. 0027). Production of bio-oil per unit area mirrored that of harvested biomass at each harvest date; however, bio-oil yield per unit dry biomass increased from 46. 6 % to 56. 7 % during the season (P = 0. 0018). Allowing switchgrass to senesce lowered biomass [N] dramatically, by as much as 68 % from June to November (P &lt; 0. 0001). Concurrently, bio-oil [N] declined from 0. 51 % in June to 0. 17 % by November (P &lt; 0. 0001). Significant reductions in ash concentration were also observed in biomass and char. Finally, we show for the first time that the [N] of switchgrass biomass is a strong predictor of the [N] of bio-oil, char, and non-condensable gas with R2 values of 0. 89, 0. 94, and 0. 88, respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

However, poor seed set is a major impediment to seed production in this species. our objectives were to (i) estimate frequency of seed set (i.e., normal caryopsis in spikelet) and seed predation by insects and (ii) partition variance for seed set into environmental and morphological sources for a population of prairie cordgrass selected for biofuel production. During 2005 through 2011, panicles were collected from nurseries of the selected population in South Dakota and Illinois. Seed set was 79% for 1- and 2-yr-old stands indicating neither poor seed set or seed predation, which ranged from 0 to 15%, by Aethes spartinana (Barnes & McDunnough) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) seriously limited seed production. Most of the variation in seed set could be accounted for by variation among and within panicles within nurseries. Spikes in the distal two-thirds of the panicle had higher seed set and lower seed predation than those in the proximal one-third. However, variance between spikes from similar panicle positions accounted for more of the variation in seed set than any other spatial or morphological source. Therefore, increased understanding of seed set, which is subject to environmental vagaries from heading through seed development, will require sampling emphasis at the spikes within panicles and spikelets within spikes levels. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Mining activities produce a huge amount of contaminated wastes inducing potential risks for groundwater and/or food chain. As classical remediation solutions are very expensive, the necessity to find alternative rehabilitation is needed. The aim of this study was to assess the growth of Miscanthus×. giganteus (high lignocellulosic biomass used as biofuel) on highly contaminated mining media. In the way to control the parameters, experiments were conducted during 3. months in phytotron from composite mining soils without inputs developed from a former gold mine rich in arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb). Results gave evidence of a clear aerial biomass reduction, whereas no real impact on physiological activity and development, as well as a very low translocation factor of contaminants to aerial parts are effective. The major conclusions are (i) the capacity of Miscanthus×. giganteus to grow on highly contaminated soils, and (ii) its short-term use as soils phytostabilizer by cropping the plant without any inputs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Driven by the increasing environmental concern related to the use of fossil fuels and the growing worldwide demand for biofuels, the Brazilian government launched a national biodiesel policy promoting feedstock supply from family farms. Especially in semi-arid regions farmers have been encouraged to grow castor bean. However, there has been little farmer uptake and knowledge is lacking regarding the main constraints that hamper farmers' engagement in the biodiesel market. A farm typology, developed on the basis of original data gathered in two municipalities in the Southeast region of Brazil, revealed that the majority of farmers (livestock, mixed and less endowed farm types) face great challenges to participate in biodiesel markets. A stronger policy impact could be achieved by the promotion of biodiesel crops that have alternative markets and fit more easily into the current farming system, such as sunflower, resulting in reduced trade-offs with current crop activities and allowing synergies between fuel and feed production (livestock farmers). Better enforcement of resource providing contracts are critical to avoid default and to alleviate labour (mixed farmers) and land constraints (less endowed farmers), thereby improving farmers' ability to engage in biodiesel crop production. Furthermore, soybean farmers lack policy instruments based on price incentives which could enable their engagement in sunflower production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Modeling groundwater vulnerability to pollution is critical for implementing programs to protect groundwater quality. Most groundwater vulnerability modeling has been based on current hydrogeology and land use conditions. However, groundwater vulnerability is strongly dependent on factors such as depth-to-water, recharge and land use conditions that may change in response to future changes in climate and/or socio-economic conditions. In this research, a modeling framework, which employs three sets of models linked within a geographic information system (GIS) environment, was used to evaluate groundwater pollution risks under future climate and land use changes in North Dakota. The results showed that areas with high vulnerability will expand northward and/or northwestward in Eastern North Dakota under different scenarios. GIS-based models that account for future changes in climate and land use can help decision-makers identify potential future threats to groundwater quality and take early steps to protect this critical resource. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are promoted worldwide as an alternative for the replacement of fossil fuels, especially in the transportation sector, although the extent to which biofuels can meet this need is unclear. Currently, oil palm is the most important crop used for biodiesel production in the world. The growth of oil palm plantations in Asia has often occurred at the expense of forest areas creating environmental concerns. Colombia is the fifth largest oil palm grower worldwide, and policies that provide subsidies have been enacted to ensure that Colombia plays an important role in future biodiesel markets. At that same time, many sectors of society are concerned that the negative effects of biofuels may be worse than the benefits. In this paper we analyze the land use transitions generated by the expansion of oil palm crops between 2002 and 2008; we identify the factors associated with the expansion and project the future expansion of plantations in Colombia by applying spatial regression analysis and econometric models. To model future expansion, we started with a map of oil palm plantations in 2008. An econometric model that incorporates the impact of governmental policies (normative and economic that support the biofuel sector) through a Time Series Intervention Model Analysis was used to estimate the cultivated area in 2020. To spatially project these estimates a spatial logistic regression model that incorporates biophysical and socioeconomic variables was used. Finally, future land use transitions associated with the expansion of oil palm plantations were analyzed. The results show that present and future oil palm expansion is concentrated in areas dominated by pastures, and to a lesser extent areas that are a mix of agricultural land and natural forests. Our results also suggest that it is highly unlikely that the government will reach its goal of over 3 million hectares of oil palm plantations by 2020 and the goal of biodiesel blends supplying 20% of the national fuel needs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural biofuels require the use of scarce land, and this land has opportunity cost. We explore the objective function of a social planner who includes a land constraint in the optimization decision to minimize environmental cost. The inclusion of this land constraint in our optimization model motivates the measurement of emissions on a per-hectare basis. Switchgrass and corn are modeled as competing alternatives to show how the inclusion of a land constraint can influence life cycle rankings and alter policy conclusions. With land use unconstrained, ethanol produced from switchgrass is always an optimal feedstock relative to ethanol produced from corn. With land use constrained, however, our results show that it is unlikely that switchgrass would be optimal in the midwestern United States, but may be optimal in southern states if carbon is priced relatively high. Whether biofuel policy advocates for one feedstock over another should consider these contrasting results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, has caused enormous ecological consequences since it was introduced to China over 30 years ago. However, as a potential bioenergy plant, it has obvious advantages. Therefore, it is academically important to study its spatial distribution and bioenergy potentials. The present research, using the remote sensing data from China and Brazil earth resources satellite (CBERS), coupled with data from related literature, concludes that the total area covered by the herb in China reaches 34,178ha, mainly in eastern Jiangsu Province, Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province, accounting for 94.22% of the country's total. Its total annual biomass reaches 2.53Mt, producing 39 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 1.33Mt of standard coal. The annual biomass of its above-ground parts is 1.12Mt, producing 18 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 0.61Mt of standard coal. Besides, it also has strong carbon sequestration capabilities, its annual C stock amounting to 1.16Mt, or 4.25Mt of CO2. Therefore it is very significant for the carbon cycle of the ocean ecosystem. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper develops scenarios whereby CO2 emissions from the transportation sector are eliminated worldwide by the end of this century. Data concerning the energy intensity and utilization of different passenger and freight transportation modes in 2005, and per capita income, in 10 different socio-economic regions of the world are combined with scenarios of population and per capita GDP to generate scenarios of future transportation energy demand. The impact of various technical options (improvements in the energy intensity of all transportation modes, changes in the proportions of vehicles with different drive trains, and a shift to biomass or hydrogen for the non-electricity energy requirements) and behavioural options (a shift to less energy-intensive LDV market segments, a reduction in total passenger-km of travel per capita, and an increase in the share of less energy-intensive passenger and freight modes of transport) is assessed. To eliminate transportation fossil fuel emissions within this century while limiting the demand for electricity, biofuels or hydrogen to manageable levels requires the simultaneous application of all the technical and behavioural measures considered here, with improvements in vehicle efficiencies and a shift to plug-in hybrid and battery-electric drive trains for light duty vehicles being the most important measures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nigeria's economy is largely dependent on petroleum, yet the country is suffering from fuel supply shortages. In response to the transportation fuel supply difficulties in Nigeria, the country released the Nigerian Biofuel Policy and Incentives in 2007 to create favorable investment climate for the entrance of Nigeria into the biofuel sector. The paper assessed the progress made thus far by Nigeria, 4 years after the Nigerian biofuel was released in an attempt to answer the question whether the policy is adequate to transform Nigeria into a biofuel economy. The study found that little progress has been made, which includes commencement of the construction of 20 bioethanol factories, installation of biofuel handling facilities at two depots (Mosimi and Atlas Cove), and selection of retail outlets for biofuel/conventional fuel mix. The site construction of the announced biofuel projects is now slow and other progress is marginal. We therefore conclude that the Nigerian biofuel policy is unlikely to transform Nigeria into a biofuel economy unless the Government revert and refocus on biofuel and include additional financial incentives such as grants and subsidy to complement the tax waivers (income, import duty, VAT), loans, and insurance cover contained in the policy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Demand for alternative fuels has sparked renewed interest in the production of biodiesel from oil-rich seeds. Oilseed meals are a byproduct of this process, and given their relatively high nutrient content, land application represents a potential value-added use. In this microcosm-based study, soil microbial community responses to amendments of a glucosinolate-containing brassicaceous oilseed meal (Brassica juncea, mustard), a non-glucosinolate-containing, nonbrassicaceous oilseed meal (Linum usitatissimum, flax), and a nonoilseed biomass (Sorghum bicolor) were characterized using a 28-day time series of replicated 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS gene sequence libraries. We hypothesized that biomass type and glucosinolate content would alter community composition but that effects would diminish over time. Distinct separation occurred by amendment type, with mustard inducing large increases in the abundance of bacterial taxa associated with fungal disease suppression (e.g. Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces spp.). Dramatic shifts were seen among the fungi, too, with phylotype richness decreasing by > 60% following mustard addition. Changes in bacterial and fungal community composition were rapid, and distinct community types persisted throughout the study. Oilseed amendment, and mustard in particular, has the potential to alter soil microbial community structure substantially, and such changes are likely to be important in the context of ecosystem health. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - The extent and severity of recent native bark beetle (Dendroctonae) outbreaks in western North America have created a pressing need for forest managers to understand potential consequences of post-disturbance management. For example, post-outbreak timber harvest (i.e., salvage harvest) could alter future forest development, productivity and susceptibility to subsequent disturbance. To assess the potential for such consequences, we measured first-year effects of post-outbreak timber harvest on tree regeneration, soil nitrogen (N) availability and fuels by using a paired and replicated before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design with eight pairs of 0.25-ha plots in beetle-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA). Post-outbreak timber harvest reduced total (live +dead) lodgepole pine basal area by 90%. Total sapling density (advance regeneration) declined by about 50% following harvest, with tall (30-140cm) saplings declining most, but mean post-harvest sapling density still exceeded 1600 stems ha-1. Relative species density was unaffected and remained dominated by lodgepole pine. Soil temperature at the litter-soil interface was warmer during summer in harvested stands, and soil NO3- concentration increased with harvest relative to untreated plots. Soil NH4+ concentration and resin bag N accumulation increased through time in all beetle-killed plots and were not affected by harvest. Following harvest, dead woody surface fuels in all size categories doubled, and canopy fuel load and canopy bulk density both were reduced; dead fuel depth, duff depth, and canopy base height did not differ between untreated and harvested plots. Harvest did reduce canopy fuels, but the natural progression of needle shedding after beetle-kill accounted for 25-40% of this total canopy fuel reduction. Salvage harvest seems unlikely to alter post-outbreak successional trajectories in these lodgepole pine forests. However, the altered fuel complex (immediate increase in dead woody surface fuels and expected long-term reduction in large-diameter fuels) in harvested plots could cause subsequent fire behavior and effects to differ between harvested and untreated stands. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper explores the relationships and division of tasks and responsibilities (boundary arrangements) between research and stakeholders in policy processes in competing claims contexts. The paper starts from the idea that better understanding about the role of research in multi-stakeholder policy processes requires going beyond the research-policy interface, by analysing boundary arrangements at multiple research-stakeholder interfaces. The paper describes five episodes in the policy debate on biofuel sustainability in Mozambique. Within each episode, the boundary arrangements at the different research-stakeholder interfaces in relation to the policy context, research activities and stakeholder dynamics inside and outside the policy arena are described and analysed.The analysis creates awareness about the complexities, pitfalls and opportunities of actively engaging in multi-stakeholder policy processes, as this is likely to result in situations where multiple boundary arrangements at different research-stakeholder interfaces co-emerge and coexist. The direction in which boundary arrangements at a research-stakeholder interface develop over time is affected by the credibility, legitimacy and salience of the research as perceived by the specific stakeholder group, the changing policy context and boundary arrangements at other research-stakeholder interfaces. Different boundary arrangements relating to policy content and policy process can coexist at a research-stakeholder interface. Furthermore, boundary arrangements show patterns of path dependency in terms of their credibility, legitimacy and salience for different stakeholders through time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Considerations for using corn (Zea mays L.) residues for biofuel should include impacts on the subsequent soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] crop. We used the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX) model to study the effects of: four rates of corn residue removals, 0%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, across site-specific conditions of two land types, highly erodible land (HEL) and non-HEL; three soil textural classes, clayey, loamy, and sandy; and the four soil hydrologic groups, A, B, C, and D, on soybean yield and nitrogen (N) dynamics, for 3703 farm fields within the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Overall, residue removal reduced soybean yield, N fixation, uptake, losses, and soil storage by 8%, 6%, 7%, and 5%, respectively. There is a positive tradeoff of residue removal, that is, it reduces the pool of nutrients available for loss, which resulted in a 9% decline in N losses when compared to no residue removal. Corn residue removal-induced reduction in soil organic N storage could affect the magnitude of the soybean N credit, implying that increased fertilization rates could be needed to sustain corn productivity in corn/soybean rotation systems. Responses were however subject to site-specific conditions, key considerations when determining residue removal thresholds. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Given the challenges of upholding human rights in countries where land grabbing has been most acute, attention has turned to alternative regulatory mechanisms by which better land governance might be brought about. This essay considers one such approach: certification schemes. These encourage agricultural producers to adopt sustainability standards which are then monitored by third-party auditors. Used by the European Union to help govern its biofuel market, they now also have an important mandatory dimension. However, through a study of Bonsucro and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels, we find both flaws in their standards and shortcomings in their ability to discipline the companies they are financially dependent upon. In sum, we suggest that the real value of these roundtable certification schemes might lie less in their ability to enforce standards than their (partially realised) role in enabling scrutiny, providing new possibilities for corporate accountability in transnational commodity chains. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Amendment of agricultural soils with municipal sewage sludge (SS) provides a valuable source of plant nutrients and organic matter but it may create a risk of trace-element pollution of the environment. Utilization of SS in cultivation of oil- and biofuel-producing crops such as canola (Brassica napus) may be useful for safe management of biosolids. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of SS application rate on bioavailability and phytoextraction of trace elements by canola. To achieve this goal, a greenhouse pot experiment was established in a Typic Xerfluvent from Greece amended with various rates of sewage sludge: 20 Mg ha-1 (SS1), 50 Mg ha-1 (SS2), and 100 Mg ha-1 (SS3). Furthermore, a soil sample without any amendment was cultivated and used as a control (C). After a planting period of 2 months, the whole plants and soils were removed from the pots. One kg from the soils was selected for analyses and the rest of the soil was cultivated again for 2 more months with the same crop. Soil samples were analyzed for total and available forms of trace elements [iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd)] and the same elements were measured in plant tissue. The results showed that increasing SS application rate increased significantly the total amounts of all the studied trace elements compared to the control except for Fe and Ni. However, the total concentrations of all the studied elements were less than the critical concentrations in soils. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable element concentrations increased significantly with increasing the biosolid application rate, especially in the case of SS3. However, no significant differences were recorded between control and SS1 for Fe, Mn, Pb, Ni, and Cd. Plant tissue element concentrations for all elements except for Fe increased significantly compared to the control with increasing sewage sludge application rate, especially with SS3, whereas no significant differences were found between the control and SS1 in the cases of Cu and Pb. Iron showed the opposite trend, where it decreased significantly with increasing SS rate. The ability of canola in phytoextraction of the studied elements was measured by bioconcentration ratios (BCR) (plant tissues concentration / DTPA-extractable elements). Values of BCR differed widely between the elements. Iron and Zn BCR values decreased significantly with increasing the SS application rate in both planting periods. The BCR values of Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Pb increased in the SS-treated soil compared to the control with a relative increase in SS1 and SS2 treatments compared to SS3. Data from this result convinced us that there is no risk from utilization of biosolids in production of noneaten plants like canola. The recommended rate was 20 Mg SS ha-1. © 2013 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Goals, norms, and rules negotiated and implemented by the private sector are one of the global governance approaches under debate for regulating land grabbing. This paper looks at two private governance instruments that are especially relevant: the Equator Principles (EPs) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB). Both instruments promote and introduce sustainability meta-standards in the decision-making and risk management process of signatory firms, financial institutions, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with regard to land use and access. And they aim to govern two sectors of international investment, namely biofuels and project finance, that are associated with highly land consuming economic activity. Against the background of key features, the paper concludes that the imprecise and voluntary nature, lack of effective sanction and compensation mechanisms, and bias towards client interests highlight that both governance approaches provide insufficient protection of communities or the environment in weak regulatory settings and in view of the intense commercial pressure on land. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We describe and analyze the efficiency of a new solar-thermochemical reactor concept, which employs a moving packed bed of reactive particles produce of H2 or CO from solar energy and H2O or CO2. The packed bed reactor incorporates several features essential to achieving high efficiency: spatial separation of pressures, temperature, and reaction products in the reactor; solid-solid sensible heat recovery between reaction steps; continuous on-sun operation; and direct solar illumination of the working material. Our efficiency analysis includes material thermodynamics and a detailed accounting of energy losses, and demonstrates that vacuum pumping, made possible by the innovative pressure separation approach in our reactor, has a decisive efficiency advantage over inert gas sweeping. We show that in a fully developed system, using CeO2 as a reactive material, the conversion efficiency of solar energy into H2 and CO at the design point can exceed 30%. The reactor operational flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of operating conditions, allowing for high efficiency on an annual average basis. The mixture of H2 and CO, known as synthesis gas, is not only usable as a fuel but is also a universal starting point for the production of synthetic fuels compatible with the existing energy infrastructure. This would make it possible to replace petroleum derivatives used in transportation in the U.S., by using less than 0.7% of the U.S. land area, a roughly two orders of magnitude improvement over mature biofuel approaches. In addition, the packed bed reactor design is flexible and can be adapted to new, better performing reactive materials. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The present study analyses the cost structure and ecological performance of biomethane production and feed-in from organic wastes and manure in a site-specific approach for Upper Austria. The theoretically available quantities of biowaste and manure can feed representative biogas plant capacities resulting in relatively high biomethane full costs in the natural gas grid of at least 9.0 €-cents/kWh, which shows strong economies of scale when feed-in flows of methane from 30 to 120 Nm3/h are considered. From the ecological point of view small plant capacities are to be preferred since the environmental effect, i.e. the global warming potential (up to -22% of CO 2eq), is lower in comparison to higher capacities as a consequence of reduced transport in the evaluated scenarios. To enforce the combined energetic use of the biowaste fraction, co-operation between compost facility, gas grid and biogas plant operators is necessary to use existing infrastructure, logistics and knowledge to promote the production, upgrade and feed-in of biomethane from biowastes at attractive locations in Upper Austria and in the whole of Europe. © IWA Publishing 2013.

AB  - In order to explore the current relationship between industrial design and waste management (WM), a semi-structured interview study was carried out with 25 professionals from WM and designers that have worked with waste. The main aim was to learn about the collaborative work between these two areas and to investigate whether collaboration could help to incorporate material resources into production. The study reveals that designers and WM professionals regard the relation between disciplines in different ways, being more or less centered in their own disciplines. The designers interviewed, however tend to have a wider impression of this relation. This, together with the lack of understanding of the other's role and a fundamental scale difference when dealing with material flows were identified as the main barriers to better and more frequent collaboration. Even though some examples of collaborative work were found, they were not significant enough to have any noticeable effect on the WM system. In order to facilitate future collaboration, the contribution of the presented work is to identify areas for collaboration and suggest initial solutions for overcoming the barriers encountered to help to close the material loop. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Farming of biofuel crops by local communities under contract with parastatal and private firms is being established in the Philippines and elsewhere. This study explores tensions in integrating indigenous peoples into the global biofuels network. Drawing from critical perspectives on contract farming and from the environmental sociology of networks and flows, we examine production relations associated with contract farming of Jatropha on indigenous lands in the Philippines. In on-site observations and interviews, we found that while some indigenous groups grow Jatropha in polyculture, shifting-cultivation systems as part of biofuel contracts, these smallholder production systems are being phased out or transformed by the global biofuels network. In contract farming relationships involving biofuel crops, there seems to be a greater tendency for indigenous peoples to adapt to, or be left outside of, global production networks than for the latter to include indigenous peoples in socially and ecologically sustainable ways. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - There is an abundant supply of corn stover in the United States that remains after grain is harvested which could be used to produce cellulosic biofuels mandated by the current Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This research integrates the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model and the DayCent biogeochemical model to investigate water quality and soil greenhouse gas flux that results when corn stover is collected at two different rates from corn-soybean and continuous corn crop rotations with and without tillage. Multiobjective watershed-scale optimizations are performed for individual pollutant-cost minimization criteria based on the economic cost of each cropping practice and (individually) the effect on nitrate, total phosphorus, sediment, or global warming potential. We compare these results with a purely economic optimization that maximizes stover production at the lowest cost without taking environmental impacts into account. We illustrate trade-offs between cost and different environmental performance criteria, assuming that nutrients contained in any stover collected must be replaced. The key finding is that stover collection using the practices modeled results in increased contributions to atmospheric greenhouse gases while reducing nitrate and total phosphorus loading to the watershed relative to the status quo without stover collection. Stover collection increases sediment loading to waterways relative to when no stover is removed for each crop rotation-tillage practice combination considered; no-till in combination with stover collection reduced sediment loading below baseline conditions without stover collection. Our results suggest that additional information is needed about (i) the level of nutrient replacement required to maintain grain yields and (ii) cost-effective management practices capable of reducing soil erosion when crop residues are removed in order to avoid contributions to climate change and water quality impairments as a result of using corn stover to satisfy the RFS. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The article discusses geo-logics of Indian agro-investments in Africa. While the economic dimensions of the land deals that have been concluded in Africa have received substantial media attention, the political dimensions of this process have been less described and explored. Recently there has been substantial controversy around the practice of grabbing land for the development of Special Economic Zones in India, although the land parcels involved are relatively modest in size when compared to recent land purchases and leases in Africa. Biofuels are meant to be a carbon neutral or positive 'fix' for the ecological contradiction between fixed amounts of terrestrial resources and an ever-expanding global economy. By accessing energy from the sun more directly through plant life, biofuels are presented as an extra global fix to this dilemma. Land grabbing has implications for the pace of climate change since land conversion, as noted above, often results in the release of carbon through forest clearance.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) are well-established oil-seed crops with great promise also for biofuels. Both are cold-tolerant, and camelina is regarded to be especially appropriate for production on marginal lands. We examined physiological and biochemical alterations in both species during cold stress treatment for 3 days and subsequent recovery at the temperature of 25°C for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24h, with particular emphasis on the post-translational regulation of the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase (EC3.6.3.14). The activity and translation of the PM H+-ATPase, as well as 14-3-3 proteins, increased after 3 days of cold stress in both species but recovery under normal conditions proceeded differently. The increase in H+-ATPase activity was the most dramatic in camelina roots after recovery for 2h at 25°C, followed by decay to background levels within 24h. In rapeseed, the change in H+-ATPase activity during the recovery period was less pronounced. Furthermore, H+-pumping increased in both species after 15min recovery, but to twice the level in camelina roots compared to rapeseed. Protein gel blot analysis with phospho-threonine anti-bodies showed that an increase in phosphorylation levels paralleled the increase in H+-transport rate. Thus our results suggest that cold stress and recovery in camelina and rapeseed are associated with PM H+-fluxes that may be regulated by specific translational and post-translational modifications. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This paper describes a framework that can be used to evaluate the environmental risks and benefits associated with biofuel production. It uses the example of biodiesel produced from Argentinean soy to show how such a framework can be used to conceptualize trade-offs between different environmental, social and economic impacts of biofuel production. Results showing the greenhouse-gas savings and overall life-cycle impact of different 'soy-biodiesel' production methods are presented. These impacts and the significance of uncertainty in overall assessments of key parameters, such as greenhouse-gas savings, are discussed. It is shown that, even where sufficient knowledge exists to be able to quantify these impacts, the sustainability of supply of a particular biofuel is inextricably linked to values and ethical judgements. However, tailoring certification efforts to the issues that are most likely to make a significant difference to the overall sustainability could improve the effectiveness of certification efforts. The potential for a framework to guide and focus certification efforts is discussed and future research and policy priorities suggested. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Recent estimates of additional land available for bioenergy production range from 320 to 1411 million ha. These estimates were generated from four scenarios regarding the types of land suitable for bioenergy production using coarse-resolution inputs of soil productivity, slope, climate, and land cover. In this paper, these maps of land availability were assessed using high-resolution satellite imagery. Samples from these maps were selected and crowdsourcing of Google Earth images was used to determine the type of land cover and the degree of human impact. Based on this sample, a set of rules was formulated to downward adjust the original estimates for each of the four scenarios that were previously used to generate the maps of land availability for bioenergy production. The adjusted land availability estimates range from 56 to 1035 million ha depending upon the scenario and the ruleset used when the sample is corrected for bias. Large forest areas not intended for biofuel production purposes were present in all scenarios. However, these numbers should not be considered as definitive estimates but should be used to highlight the uncertainty in attempting to quantify land availability for biofuel production when using coarse-resolution inputs with implications for further policy development. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The increasing demand for solid biofuels, such as logging residue fuels, has highlighted the importance of considering that, in contrast to fossil fuels, biofuels are produced in dynamic ecosystems. The environmental effects of changes in management policy, whether positive and negative, are not obvious. For example, calculations of the carbon budget in single forest stands show that the carbon balance switches dramatically from uptake to loss at final felling. The time taken to recover the carbon losses after disturbance can span decades to centuries. However, forests are not managed on the single stand level but on the landscape scale. Thus, for example, final felling occurs by definition only once for each rotation period on the whole area considered in a single stand, but within the same time span, it occurs frequently on a fraction of the area in a landscape. The actual frequency and ratio of land area affected each year by final felling depend on the age distribution and rotation age of all stands present in the landscape. In order to reliably evaluate the consequences of new management policies, the aggregated effects of a number of individual stands need to be considered. Here we used two different ecosystem models (the Q model and the CoupModel) to compare the carbon budgets of conventional harvesting of stems on a single-stand level and on the landscape scale under different harvesting intensities. In the calculations, the landscape was assumed to consist of many stands, all of different ages and each representing one year of a given rotation period. The results showed that the aggregated carbon balance in the forest landscape was less dramatic than that of a single stand. Provided that environmental factors and management policy remain unchanged, the aggregated carbon balance remains stable over time in any landscape. However, the carbon gains from harvesting and its effects on soil carbon stock occur on different time scales. While any change in harvesting system takes a long time to be fully implemented, changes in the proportion of increased removals take effect without delay, while components of soil organic carbon have response times longer than centuries. The carbon gain after introducing removal of logging residues starts to increase immediately at the first harvest in a landscape. The quantities of soil carbon lost with the increased removals are always less than the removals in biomass. Soil carbon losses show a declining response over time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Some commentators on biofuel cultivation in developing countries suggest biofuel development may cause exploitation and marginalisation. Others suggest that on occasion biofuels can be a suitable option to advance local development. It is critical to broadly understand local conditions and sustainable biofuels implementation before determining development options specific to different biophysical, environmental, societal and power settings. In particular, there is a need to reflect on less exploitive, more equitable opportunities that uphold community integrity. This paper examines biofuel project implementation opportunities and impediments in a developing country in sub-Saharan Africa: Zimbabwe. Interviews were conducted in Zimbabwe with villagers, investors and other local stakeholders affected by a biofuel sugarcane case study project. The project was identified as having significant influences (positive and negative) on Zimbabwean rural populations. The article argues that through local education and capacity building, biofuel initiatives can uphold environmental and societal worthiness if developed in conjunction with effective sustainability design and implementation approaches. However, project sustainability, specific to localities, needs to be temporally verified for indirect impacts and socio-economic and environmental equality, with particular focus on gender issues and under-privileged groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels have been the only alternative fuel which has substantially contributed to supplying transport with energy. Biofuels enjoyed broad support, but now they have come under criticism. In order to obtain answers to the question of what role biofuels could play in the future fuel mix, the following aspects are analysed: competing uses of scarce biomass and biofuels; sustainability of biofuels, standards and certification schemes; types and availability of biofuels; potentials for bioenergy and biofuels; and the technical compatibility of biofuels with vehicles. Finally, preconditions and necessary policy measures for the increased deployment of sustainable biofuels are examined. © 2013 ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bioethanol as regards to its carbon dioxide emissions. The production of the raw material accounts for more than 50 % of the total cost as well as having a significant part of greenhouse gases emitted during the entire process. For this reason, special emphasis is given to a change in agricultural land usage influenced by the demand of biofuel. Therefore, we have estimated the extent of policy influence according to its bioethanol cost-effectiveness. A case study on bioethanol production in an ex-sugar factory in the region of Thessaly, Greece, illustrates the above ideas. Methods: A partial equilibrium micro-economic model of regional supply in the arable farming system of Thessaly was coupled to industrial processing sub-models of bioethanol production from beets and grains. The maximisation of total welfare determines the most suitable crop mix for farmers as well as the lowest cost configurations for industry and, eventually, the minimal level of support by the government for biofuel activity to take off. The environmental performance is assessed under the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework following three interrelated phases: data inventory, data analysis and interpretation. The economic burden to society to support the activity divided by avoided CO2 eq. emissions indicates the bioethanol cost-effectiveness, in other words, the cost of greenhouse gases emissions savings. Results: The integrated agro-industry model has been parametrically run for a range of biofuel capacities. A change in direct land use results in lower emissions in the agricultural phase, since energy crops are a substitute for intensive cultivations, such as cotton and corn. A change in indirect land use moderates these estimations, as it takes in account imported food crops that are replaced by energy crops in the region. The savings in cost vary around 160 euros per ton of CO2 eq. for the basic agricultural policy scenario. The current policy that supports cotton production by means of increased coupled area payment has increased up to 30 % the cost of greenhouse gas savings due to bioethanol production. Conclusions: An integrated model, articulating the agricultural supply of biomass with ethanol processing, maximises the total surplus that is under constraints in order to determine the cost-effectiveness for different production levels. Results demonstrate that economic performances, as well as the environmental cost-effectiveness of bioethanol, are clearly affected by the parameters of agricultural policies. Therefore, bioenergy, environmental and economic performances, when based on LCA and the conceptual change in land usage, are context dependent. Agricultural policies for decoupling subsidies from production are in favour of cultivation in biomass for energy purposes. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Several factors contribute to the current increased focus on alternative fuels such as biodiesel, including an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of petrochemical (PC) oil products such as PC diesel, the continuously increasing price of PC oil, and the depletion of PC oil. For these reasons, the European Union has enacted a directive requiring each member state to ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in transport be at least 10 % of the final consumption of energy by 2020 (The European Parliament and the Council 2009). This LCA study assesses the specific environmental impacts from the production and use of biodiesel as it is today (real-time), based on rapeseed oil and different types of alcohols, and using technologies that are currently available or will be available shortly. Different options are evaluated for the environmental improvement of production methods. The modeling of the LCA is based on a specific Danish biodiesel production facility. Methods: The functional unit is "1,000 km transportation for a standard passenger car." All relevant process stages are included, such as rapeseed production including carbon sequestration and N2O balances, and transportation of products used in the life cycle of biodiesel. System expansion has been used to handle allocation issues. Results and discussion: The climate change potential from the production and use of biodiesel today is 57 kg CO 2-eq/1,000 km, while PC diesel is 214 kg CO2-eq/1,000 km. Options for improvement include the increased use of residual straw from rapeseed fields for combustion in a power plant where carbon sequestration is considered, and a change in transesterification from a conventional process to an enzymatic process when using bioethanol instead of PC methanol. This research also evaluates results for land use, respiratory inorganics potential, human toxicity (carc) potential, ecotoxicity (freshwater) potential, and aquatic eutrophication (N) potential. Different sources for uncertainty are evaluated, and the largest drivers for uncertainty are the assumptions embedded into the substitution effects. The results presented should not be interpreted as a blueprint for the increased production of biodiesel but rather as a benchmarking point for the present, actual impact in a well-to-wheels perspective of biodiesel, with options for improving production and use. Conclusions: Based on this analysis, we recommend investigating additional options and incentives regarding the increased use of rape straw, particularly considering the carbon sequestration issues (from the perspective of potential climate change) of using bioalcohol instead of PC alcohol for the transesterification process. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: Current estimations of the climate impact from indirect land use change (ILUC) caused by biofuels are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding the biofuel production period. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new method (baseline time accounting) that takes global land use dynamics into account that is consistent with the global warming potential, that is applicable to any phenomenon causing land use change, and that is independent of production period assumptions. Methods: We consider ILUC in two forms. The first is called "accelerated expansion" and concerns ILUC in regions with an expanding agricultural area. The second is called "delayed reversion" and concerns ILUC in regions with a decreasing agricultural area. We use recent trends in international land use and projections of future land use change to assess how ILUC from biofuels will alter the development in global agricultural land use dynamics compared to the existing trend (i.e., the baseline development). We then use the definition of the global warming potential to determine the CO2 equivalence of the change in land use dynamics. Results and discussion: We apply baseline time accounting to two existing ILUC studies in the literature. With current trends in global agricultural land use, the method significantly reduces the estimated climate impact in the previous ILUC studies (by more than half). Sensitivity analyses show that results are somewhat sensitive to assumptions regarding carbon sequestration and assumptions regarding postreversion ecosystems. Conclusions: The global dynamic development in land use has important implications for the time accounting step when estimating the climate impact of ILUC caused by biofuel production or other issues affecting land use. Ignoring this may lead to erroneous conclusions about the actual climate impact of ILUC. Several land use projections indicate that the global agricultural area will keep expanding up to and beyond 2050. We therefore recommend to apply the baseline time accounting concept as an integrated part of future ILUC studies and to update the results on a regular basis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: Several articles within the area of green chemistry often promote new techniques or products as 'green' or 'more environmentally benign' than their conventional counterpart although these articles often do not quantitatively assess the environmental performance. In order to do this, life cycle assessment (LCA) is a valuable methodology. However, on the planning stage, a full-scale LCA is considered to be too time consuming and complicated. Two reasons for this have been recognised, the method is too comprehensive and it is hard to find inventory data. In this review, key parameters are presented with the purpose to reduce the time-consuming steps in LCA. Methods: In this review, several LCAs of so-called 'green chemicals' are analysed and key parameters and methodological concerns are identified. Further, some conclusions on the environmental performance of chemicals were drawn. Results and discussion: For fossil-based platform chemicals several LCAs exists but for chemicals produced with industrial biotechnology or from renewable resources the number of LCAs is limited, with the exception of biofuels, for which a large number of studies are made. In the review, a significant difference in the environmental performance of bulk and fine chemicals was identified. The environmental performance of bulk chemicals are closely connected to the production of the raw material and thereby different land use aspects. Here, a lot can be learnt from biofuel LCAs. In many of the reviewed articles focusing on bulk chemicals a comparison regarding fossil and renewable raw material was done. In most of the comparisons the renewable alternative turned out to be more environmentally preferable, especially for the impact on GWP and energy use. However, some environmental concerns were identified as important to include to assess overall environmental concern, for example eutrophication and the use of land. Conclusions: To assess the environmental performance of green chemicals, quantitative methods are needed. For this purpose, both simple metrics and more comprehensive methods have been developed, one recognised method being LCA. However, this method is often too time consuming to be valuable in the process planning stage. This is partly due to a lack of available inventory data, but also because the method itself is too comprehensive. Here, key parameters for the environmental performance and methodological concerns were described to facilitate a faster and simpler use of LCA of green chemicals in the future. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Goal and scope: The life cycle inventory of landfill emissions is a key point in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of waste management options and is highly subject to discussion. Result sensitivity to data inventory is accounted for through the implementation of scenarios that help examine how waste landfilling should be modeled in LCA. Method: Four landfill biogas management options are environmentally evaluated in a Life Cycle Assessment perspective: (1) no biogas management (open dump), conventional landfill with (2) flaring, (3) combined heat and power (CHP) production in an internal combustion engine and (4) biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses. Average, maximum and minimum literature values are considered both for combustion emission factors in flares and engines and for trace pollutant concentrations in biogas. Results: Biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses appears as the most relevant option with respect to most non-toxic impact categories and ecotoxicity, when considering average values for trace gas concentrations and combustion emission factors. Biogas combustion in an engine for CHP production shows the best performances in terms of climate change, but generates significantly higher photochemical oxidant formation and marine eutrophication impact potentials than flaring or biogas upgrading for use as a fuel in buses. Interpretation and discussion: However the calculated environmental impact potentials of landfill biogas management options depend largely on the trace gas concentrations implemented in the model. The use of average or extreme values reported in the literature significantly modifies the impact potential of a given scenario (up to two orders of magnitude for open dumps with respect to human toxicity). This should be taken into account when comparing landfilling with other waste management options. Also, the actual performances of a landfill top cover (in terms of oxidation rates) and combustion technology (in terms of emission factors) appear as key parameters affecting the ranking of biogas management options. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Defining and measuring sustainability of bioenergy systems are difficult because the systems are complex, the science is in early stages of development, and there is a need to generalize what are inherently context-specific enterprises. These challenges, and the fact that decisions are being made now, create a need for improved communications among scientists as well as between scientists and decision makers. In order for scientists to provide information that is useful to decision makers, they need to come to an agreement on how to measure and report potential risks and benefits of diverse energy alternatives in a way that allows decision makers to compare options. Scientists also need to develop approaches that contribute information about problems and opportunities relevant to policy and decision making. The need for clear communication is especially important at this time when there is a plethora of scientific papers and reports and it is difficult for the public or decision makers to assess the merits of each analysis. We propose three communication guidelines for scientists whose work can contribute to decision making: (1) relationships between the question and the analytical approach should be clearly defined and make common sense; (2) the information should be presented in a manner that non-scientists can understand; and (3) the implications of methods, assumptions, and limitations should be clear. The scientists' job is to analyze information to build a better understanding of environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic aspects of the sustainability of energy alternatives. The scientific process requires transparency, debate, review, and collaboration across disciplines and time. This paper serves as an introduction to the papers in the special issue on "Sustainability of Bioenergy Systems: Cradle to Grave" because scientific communication is essential to developing more sustainable energy systems. Together these four papers provide a framework under which the effects of bioenergy can be assessed and compared to other energy alternatives to foster sustainability. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Understanding the environmental effects of alternative fuel production is critical to characterizing the sustainability of energy resources to inform policy and regulatory decisions. The magnitudes of these environmental effects vary according to the intensity and scale of fuel production along each step of the supply chain. We compare the spatial extent and temporal duration of ethanol and gasoline production processes and environmental effects based on a literature review and then synthesize the scale differences on space-time diagrams. Comprehensive assessment of any fuel-production system is a moving target, and our analysis shows that decisions regarding the selection of spatial and temporal boundaries of analysis have tremendous influences on the comparisons. Effects that strongly differentiate gasoline and ethanol-supply chains in terms of scale are associated with when and where energy resources are formed and how they are extracted. Although both gasoline and ethanol production may result in negative environmental effects, this study indicates that ethanol production traced through a supply chain may impact less area and result in more easily reversed effects of a shorter duration than gasoline production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - While farming has been the subject of frequent critical analysis with respect to its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse gas emissions, there has been relatively little consideration of the potentially positive role of agriculture in responding to a future greatly influenced by climate change. One possible realm for agriculture to contribute successfully to this future is through biofuels cultivation. This paper uses the state of Kansas as an example to examine factors that are influencing farmer decision-making during a time of heightened debates about climate and energy. Drawing on interviews with key informants and Kansas farmers, we apply and refine a conceptual model for understanding farmer decisions. We find that farmers have largely positive perceptions of the natural environment. Climate change, especially, is not a salient concern at this time. Factors that appear most likely to influence farmer decisions to adopt a new practice include the relative advantage of that practice and the ability to learn about and discuss it through existing social networks. Successful policy incentives must provide farmers with a continued sense of both independence and contribution to greater societal good. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Indicators of the environmental sustainability of biofuel production, distribution, and use should be selected, measured, and interpreted with respect to the context in which they are used. The context of a sustainability assessment includes the purpose, the particular biofuel production and distribution system, policy conditions, stakeholder values, location, temporal influences, spatial scale, baselines, and reference scenarios. We recommend that biofuel sustainability questions be formulated with respect to the context, that appropriate indicators of environmental sustainability be developed or selected from more generic suites, and that decision makers consider context in ascribing meaning to indicators. In addition, considerations such as technical objectives, varying values and perspectives of stakeholder groups, indicator cost, and availability and reliability of data need to be understood and considered. Sustainability indicators for biofuels are most useful if adequate historical data are available, information can be collected at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, organizations are committed to use indicator information in the decision-making process, and indicators can effectively guide behavior toward more sustainable practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - The sustainability of future bioenergy production rests on more than continual improvements in its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The emergence of new biomass feedstocks, an expanding array of conversion pathways, and expected increases in overall bioenergy production are connecting diverse technical, social, and policy communities. These stakeholder groups have different - and potentially conflicting - values and cultures, and therefore different goals and decision making processes. Our aim is to discuss the implications of this diversity for bioenergy researchers. The paper begins with a discussion of bioenergy stakeholder groups and their varied interests, and illustrates how this diversity complicates efforts to define and promote "sustainable" bioenergy production. We then discuss what this diversity means for research practice. Researchers, we note, should be aware of stakeholder values, information needs, and the factors affecting stakeholder decision making if the knowledge they generate is to reach its widest potential use. We point out how stakeholder participation in research can increase the relevance of its products, and argue that stakeholder values should inform research questions and the choice of analytical assumptions. Finally, we make the case that additional natural science and technical research alone will not advance sustainable bioenergy production, and that important research gaps relate to understanding stakeholder decision making and the need, from a broader social science perspective, to develop processes to identify and accommodate different value systems. While sustainability requires more than improved scientific and technical understanding, the need to understand stakeholder values and manage diversity presents important research opportunities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - Increased emphasis is being placed on developing bioenergy production capacity in the United States and Populus species or hybrids have been identified as strong candidates for the southeastern United States. Thirty-one Populus clones were planted in South Carolina and survival and growth assessments were completed after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 10th growing seasons. Survival and growth differed significantly among clones. Age-to-age correlations for survival and growth traits were made and results suggest that for most clones, age 10 survival was strongly correlated with first-year survival. A small group of clones exhibited delayed mortality indicating poor longer-term adaptability. For growth, clonal selections based on age 3 volumes could be made and rank changes involve moderate to poorly performing clones. Clones with the greatest age 3 volumes, 184-411, WV416, and 52-225, ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd for age 10 volume. These clones represent both T × D hybrids and pure Populus deltoides clones suggesting growth is a function of specific clonal characteristics rather than overall species or hybrid traits. The growth obtained under these test conditions is generally less than the maximum growth rates of the same clones obtained in various tests. Potential reasons for this variation are discussed. To develop Populus as a commercially viable bioenergy crop for the southeastern United States, concurrent research to identify site requirements, adaptability, and appropriate management regimes is needed. Further breeding and clonal selection will be critically important, but it is unlikely that this alone will be sufficient to assure high productivity. © 2013.

AB  - Agriculture is the greatest source of wetland loss in the Prairie Pothole Region of North and South Dakota (Dakota PPR). Demand for corn ethanol, expiration of agricultural conservation contracts, and increasing commodity prices may have stimulated alteration of wetlands for row crop production. The purpose of this study was to determine recent wetland-to-row-crop transition rates within the Dakota PPR, using GIS analysis to intersect the 2011 National Agricultural Statistics Service's Cropland Data Layer (CDL) with wetlands mapped by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and the U.S. Geological Survey's National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The NWI depicts wetlands as they existed in the 1980s, whereas the NLCD depicts wetlands as of 2001. On an annualized basis, the NWI wetland loss rate was 0.28 % (-5,203 ha/yr) and the NLCD wetland loss rate was 0.35 % (-6,223 ha/yr). Fewer losses occurred along the western and northern edges of the Dakota PPR, which are less conducive to row crops due to climate and topographic limitations. The map of apparent wetland losses generated by this study provides a means for monitoring and enforcement agencies to quickly identify potential violations of compliance with Swampbuster or other wetland regulations. © 2013 Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - In Tuvalu the sap from the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) is known as " toddy" This paper examines toddy's current use as a foodstuff, the contribution of the sale of toddy products to household incomes and the potential use of sour toddy as a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production for use as a petroleum substitute in Tuvalu.The productivity and current uses of coconut woodlands are also assessed. At current levels of production and use, less than 1% of coconut palms are used for toddy production by 1133 producers. Over 5 dm3 of fresh toddy are produced annually and average toddy production per tree ranges from 1.7 to 4.3 dm3 d-1.The sale of toddy products provides 22-24% of annual household income for producers.The production of bioethanol from toddy has been demonstrated by the NGO Alofa Tuvalu. However, it is not currently cost competitive with petroleum, although in terms of productivity, the current toddy harvest could produce enough bioethanol to replace 31% of the nation's petroleum.It is evident that there is a large untapped biomass energy potential in Tuvalu which should be utilised if the Government of Tuvalu is going to fulfil their commitment to be carbon neutral by 2020. © 2012 .

AB  - The leguminous tree, Millettia pinnata (pongamia) produces oilseed suitable for biodiesel production. Assessment of oil production and genetic, morphological and physiological traits are required. Collections from the Forest Products Commission in Kununurra, Western Australia were compared with accessions from India, Indonesia, Queensland and the Northern Territory in Australia. Molecular diversity, examined using the internal transcribed spacer region, indicated distinctiveness of genotypes from Java, Indonesia. Seed traits varied across trees with the smallest seeds from Indonesia and the largest from Kununurra. Oil content varied across trees with a minimum of 28 % in an Indonesian accession and the highest of 45 % from Kununurra. Major fatty acids across trees were oleic (51 %), linoleic (19 %), palmitic (11 %) stearic (6 %), linolenic (4.5 %) and behenic (4.5 %) acids. Seed weight and oil content per seed of developing seeds increased with a sigmoid pattern and oleic acid was the major fatty acid throughout seed development. Waterlogging and salinity tolerance were assessed. Four month-old seedlings from Kununurra, Western Australia and India were exposed to: non-saline drained control, saline drained, non-saline waterlogged and saline waterlogged treatments. Seedlings were waterlogging tolerant. Salt, applied in weekly increments of 50 mM, led to reduced survival, height growth rate, leaf number and stomatal conductance and increased concentrations of leaf Na+ and Cl-. Salinity tolerance was 200 mM NaCl under saline drained and 150 mM NaCl under waterlogged conditions. Milletia pinnata diversity could be exploited for selection of superior genotypes for oil production on marginal land. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Microbial residues can be a significant component of soil organic matter, and their component amino sugars are integrative indicators of biologically relevant ecosystem properties. We evaluate the impact of soil attributes, microbial functional group biomass, and cropping system type on soil amino sugar profiles in three model biofuel cropping systems in southern Wisconsin, USA. Total soil carbon and clay content explained differences in soil amino sugar profiles, with glucosamine and galactosamine more strongly related to soil carbon and muramic acid associated with clay content. Amino sugars were not correlated to cropping system or to microbial functional group lipid abundance, suggesting amino sugar differences among locations were due to differences in soil legacy properties such as total carbon, clay content and culture age rather than to current biotic drivers. The disconnect between the current biotic composition and legacies of past microbial activity suggests that microbial residues should be considered as trajectories over time rather than static system properties. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol production results in distiller grain, and biodiesel produces glycerol as by-product. However, there is limited information on effects of their addition on evolution of N2O and CO2 from soils, yet it is important to enable our understanding of impacts of biofuel production on greenhouse gas budgets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct effects of adding wet distillers grain (WDG), thin stillage (TS), and glycerol at three rates on greenhouse gas emissions (N2O and CO2) and nutrient supply rates in a cultivated soil from the Canadian prairies. The WDG and TS application rates were: 100, 200, or 400 kg N ha-1, whereas glycerol was applied at: 40, 400, or 4,000 kg C ha-1 applied alone (G - N) or in a combination with 300 kg N ha-1 (G + N). In addition, conventional amendments of urea (UR) and dehydrated alfalfa (DA) were added at the same rates of total N as the by-products for comparative purposes. The production of N2O and CO2 was measured over an incubation period of 10 days in incubation chambers and Plant Root Simulator™ resin membrane probes were used to measure nutrient (NH4+-N, NO3--N, and PO4-3-P) supply rates in the soil during incubation. Per unit of N added, urea tended to result in the greatest N2O production, followed by wet distillers grain and thin stillage, with glycerol and dehydrated alfalfa resulting in the lowest N2O production. Cumulative N2O production increased with increasing the rate of N-containing amendments and was the highest at the high rate of UR treatment. Addition of urea with glycerol contributed to a higher rate of N2O emission, especially at the low rate of glycerol. The DA and WDG resulted in the greatest evolution of CO2 from the soil, with the thin stillage resulting in less CO2 evolved per unit of N added. Addition of N fertilizer along with glycerol enhanced microbial activity and decomposition. The amendments had significant impacts on release of available nutrient, with the UR treatments providing the highest NO3--N supply rate. The TS treatments supplied the highest rate of NH4+-N, followed by WDG compared to the other amendments. The WDG treatments were able to provide the greatest supply of PO4-3-P supply in comparison to the other amendments. Microbial N immobilization was associated with glycerol treatments applied alone. This study showed that the investigated biofuel by-products can be suitable soil amendments as a result of their ability to supply nutrients and N2O emissions that did not exceed that of the conventional urea fertilizer. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) can be used not just for bioethanol production, bur potentially also for soil phytoremediation via removal of heavy metal pollutants. An experiment was carried out to characterize the phytoextraction efficiency of two Jerusalem artichoke genotype (NY2 and NY5) in cadmium (Cd) contaminated soil. After 90 days of growth, NY5 had greater plant biomass and greater Cd accumulation in tissues than NY2. The chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were slightly higher when plants were grown in Cd-contaminated versus control soil. It implies that this examined NY2 and NY5 can extract more Cd than some hyperaccumulators, indicating that NY2 and NY5 can be applied to clean up Cd-contaminated soils. Compared with NY2, NY5 had higher phytoextraction potential due to more biomass and higher concentrations of Cd in tissues, and may therefore be the better candidates for phytoremediation in Cd-contaminated soil. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Agriculture faces unique challenges as increasing world population places unprecedented demands on food, feed, and energy resources. In an effort to become more efficient and sustainable, marginal land, including regulatory brownfields prohibited for food consumption purposes could be utilized for bioenergy crop production. In 2006-2008, we evaluated soybean (Glycine Max (L.) Merr.), canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to determine crop suitability for bioenergy production on a regulatory brownfield site. Sites selected for the study included a remediated brownfield site in Rose Township, Oakland County, and a historically cropped agricultural site at East Lansing, Ingham County, serving as the control. Comparisons of biofuel quality components were conducted. The total oil yield of oilseed crops was not significantly different (p < 0.05) between locations. Concentrations of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) fatty acids differed by location, yet oleic acid concentrations, optimal for quality biodiesel production, were not significantly different across all oilseed crops. Total crystalline cellulose levels from switchgrass were higher at the agricultural land site compared to the brownfield site in 2007 yielding 16% more crystalline cellulose; but there were no differences between locations in 2008. Detectable levels of PCB's were found in soils at the brownfield site; however, transfer to grain or biomass was not detected. Results suggest that brownfield sites have the potential to produce feedstock of suitable quality for conversion to liquid transportation fuels. © 2012.

AB  - The rapid expansion of biofuel production has generated considerable interest within the body of empirical economic literature that has sought to understand the impact of biofuel growth on the global food economy. While the consensus within the literature is that biofuel emergence is likely to have some effect on future world agricultural market, there is a considerable range in the estimated size of the impact. Despite the importance of this topic to policy makers, there has been no study that has tried to reconcile the differences among various outlook studies. This paper undertakes an in-depth review of some key outlook studies which quantify the impacts of biofuels on agricultural commodities, and which are based on either general-equilibrium (GE) or partial-equilibrium (PE) modeling approaches. We attempt to reconcile the systematic differences in the estimated impacts of biofuel production growth on the prospective prices and production of three major feedstock commodities, maize, sugar cane, and oilseeds across these studies. Despite the fact that all models predict positive impacts on prices and production, there are large differences among the studies. Our findings point to a number of key assumptions and structural differences that seem to jointly drive the variations we observe, across these studies. The differences among the PE models are mainly due to differences in the design of scenarios, the presence or absence of biofuel trade, and the structural way in which agricultural and energy market linkages are modeled. The differences among the GE models are likely to be driven by model assumptions on agricultural land supply, the inclusion of the byproducts, and assumptions on crude oil prices and the elasticity of substitution between petroleum and biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To analyse trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production and consumption of animal products in Sweden, life cycle emissions were calculated for the average production of pork, chicken meat, beef, dairy and eggs in 1990 and 2005. The calculated average emissions were used together with food consumption statistics and literature data on imported products to estimate trends in per capita emissions from animal food consumption. Total life cycle emissions from the Swedish livestock production were around 8.5 Mt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) in 1990 and emissions decreased to 7.3 Mt CO2e in 2005 (14% reduction). Around two-Thirds of the emission cut was explained by more efficient production (less GHG emission per product unit) and one-Third was due to a reduced animal production. The average GHG emissions per product unit until the farm-gate were reduced by 20% for dairy, 15% for pork and 23% for chicken meat, unchanged for eggs and increased by 10% for beef. A larger share of the average beef was produced from suckler cows in cow-calf systems in 2005 due to the decreasing dairy cow herd, which explains the increased emissions for the average beef in 2005. The overall emission cuts from the livestock sector were a result of several measures taken in farm production, for example increased milk yield per cow, lowered use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers in grasslands, reduced losses of ammonia from manure and a switch to biofuels for heating in chicken houses. In contrast to production, total GHG emissions from the Swedish consumption of animal products increased by around 22% between 1990 and 2005. This was explained by strong growth in meat consumption based mainly on imports, where growth in beef consumption especially was responsible for most emission increase over the 15-year period. Swedish GHG emissions caused by consumption of animal products reached around 1.1 t CO2e per capita in 2005. The emission cuts necessary for meeting a global temperature-increase target of 2 might imply a severe constraint on the long-Term global consumption of animal food. Due to the relatively limited potential for reducing food-related emissions by higher productivity and technological means, structural changes in food consumption towards less emission-intensive food might be required for meeting the 2 target. © The Animal Consortium 2012.

AB  - The renewable energy directive (RED) of the EU sets mandatory targets for increasing the use of renewable energy in EU member states by 2020. The RED introduces sustainability criteria for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids in order to ensure that their increasing production does not cause serious environmental and social problems. Bio-oil production through fast pyrolysis is one technology under development. The aim of this paper is to explore whether bio-oil derived from logging residues in Finland meets the GHG performance criteria set by the EU. The pyrolysis reactor is assumed to be integrated with a combined heat and power production plant (CHP). Special attention is paid to uncertainty analysis. An emission reduction target of 60% as compared to the reference fuel is exceeded if the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant are considered as separate units, and changes in soil carbon balances are ignored. On the contrary, the particular target is not met using a 20-year time frame for changes in soil carbon balances. The results depend in large measure on the selection of parameters set and the interpretation of the definitions provided in the RED to set the system boundary for the pyrolysis reactor and the CHP plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CW) offer a mechanism to meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards for wastewater treatment while minimizing energy inputs. Additionally, harvested wetland phytomass subjected to anaerobic digestion can serve as a source of biogas methane. To investigate CW wastewater polishing activities and potential energy yield we constructed a pair of secondary wastewater-fed channelized CW modules designed to retain easily harvestable floating aquatic vegetation and maximize exposure of water to roots and sediment. Modules that were regularly harvested averaged a nitrate removal rate of 1.1g N m2 d1; harvesting, sedimentation and gasification were responsible for 30.5%, 8.0% and 61.5% of the N losses, respectively. Selective harvesting of a module to maintain dominance of filamentous algae had no effect on nitrate removal rate but lowered productivity by one-half. The average monthly productivity for unselectively harvested modules was 9.3 1.7g dry wt. m2 d1 (SE). Cessation of harvesting in one module resulted in a significant increase in nitrate removal rate and decrease in phosphate removal rate. Compared to the influent, the effluent of the harvested module had significantly lower levels of estrogenic activity, as determined by a quantitative PCR-based juvenile trout bioassay, and significantly lower densities of E. coli. In mixed vertical-flow reactors anaerobic co-digestion of equal dry weight proportions of harvested aquatic vegetation, wine yeast lees and dairy manure was greatly improved when the manure was replaced with the crude glycerol by-product of biodiesel production. Remaining solids were vermicomposted for use as a soil amendment. Our results indicate that incorporation of constructed wetlands into an integrated treatment system can simultaneously enhance the economic and energetic feasibility of wastewater and organic waste treatment processes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from elephant grass (Miscanthus gigantus) and black bamboo (Phyllostachys nigra) were measured online in semi-field chamber and plant enclosure experiments during growth and harvest using proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), proton-transfer reaction ion-trap mass spectrometry (PIT-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both cultivars are being considered for second-generation biofuel production. Before this study, no information was available on their yearly VOC emissions. This exploratory investigation shows that black bamboo is a strong isoprene emitter (daytime 28,516 ng gdwt-1 h-1) and has larger VOC emissions, especially for wound compounds from the hexanal and hexenal families, than elephant grass. Daytime emissions of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone + propanal and acetic acid of black bamboo were 618, 249, 351, and 1034 ng gdwt-1 h-1, respectively. In addition, it is observed that elephant grass VOC emissions after harvesting strongly depend on the seasonal stage. Not taking VOC emission variations throughout the season for annual and perennial species into account, may lead to an overestimation of the impact on local air quality in dry periods. In addition, our data suggest that the use of perennial grasses for extensive growing for biofuel production have lower emissions than woody species, which might be important for regional atmospheric chemistry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biofuels industry in both the UK and the EU as a whole has expanded significantly in recent years in response to various EU biofuel policy initiatives. Further expansion of biofuel demand will increase the impact of the biofuels sector on agricultural markets. This paper examines the impact that increasing levels of first generation biofuel demand to 10% of total transport fuel use in the UK and other EU Member States would have on agricultural markets within the EU and specifically the UK using a partial equilibrium modelling system. Increasing overall biodiesel demand raises demand for vegetable oil and oilseed and in turn their prices. The increased grain demand in response to the increased bioethanol demand is mostly sourced from changes in EU net trade. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this research we have modified the standard US MARKAL model to include a land resource base, corn stover and miscanthus feedstocks, and new cost information for biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies. We then used this revised MARKAL model to estimate the impacts of four different policy and technology choice scenarios; 1) no government interventions in biofuel markets (no RFS or subsidies), 2) biofuels RFS targets are implemented, 3) no government intervention but technology that combines coal and biomass feedstocks is enabled, and 4) biofuels RFS targets are implemented and combined coal-biomass feedstocks are enabled. Some of the major conclusions are as follows:. •By 2030, with no government intervention, corn ethanol reaches about 15 bil. gal.(57 bil. liters), and thermochemical biofuel reaches 13 bil. gal.(49 bil. liters) for a combined 28 bil. gal.(106 bil. liters) by 2030.•When the RFS is added to the reference case, there is a substantial increase in both corn ethanol and thermochemical biofuel (about 6 bil. gal.(23 bil. liters) total) in the early years when the RFS is binding.•When combined coal-biomass technology is enabled for the reference (market) case, there is a huge increase in thermochemical biofuel after 2020.•When the RFS is added to the case with combined coal-biomass technology, the main impact is in the early years when the RFS is binding.•The average cost of the binding RFS compared with the reference case is 33 ¢/gal.(9 ¢/liter) in 2015 and 12 to 14 ¢/gal. after that. For the coal-biomass cases, the cost is 24 ¢/gal.(6 ¢/liter) in 2015 and zero after that.•Corn stover is generally less expensive, and it is used exclusively in the early years. As production ratchets up substantially in 2025 or 2030, more dedicated energy crops are used.We have demonstrated that the standard MARKAL results can be considerably enhanced by combining richer information on the land supply data from GTAP into MARKAL. Indeed, without use of this land supply data, MARKAL and other energy models cannot reliably be used for biofuels economic and policy analysis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Considering that biofuels are considered as a catalyst for stimulating rural economic development, a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SAA) have developed policies to guide the development of the sector. This paper reviews the extent to which the existing biofuels policies and strategies of SSA countries have embraced public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whether the policies enhance or hinder such partnerships. In general, most SSA countries have no regulatory frameworks that have led to some private firms taking advantage of this inactivity to acquire large amounts of land for the growing of energy crops for biofuels at the expense of food crops, mostly involving smallholder farmers. The paper proposes developing effective PPP arrangements in order to leverage the synergies from the efficiencies of both public and private sectors. Such PPPs are crucial for mobilizing financial resources to drive scientific research and innovations for developing advanced processing technologies for second generation biofuels using lignocellulosic biomass as alternatives to traditional feedstock in order to foster the commercialization of biofuels in SSA. In conclusion, as we now live in a global village, countries must undertake detailed and systematic, country-specific assessments to ascertain the viability and feasibility of biofuels, and define the " rules of the game" in order to protect rural dwellers from loosing land to investors for growing energy crops and ensure equitable distribution of benefits of biofuels investments without posing a threat to environment or intruding on the rights of citizens or communities. Where biofuels are viable, PPPs should be part of the biofuels policy and investment strategy in order to build trust, collective responsibility and joint risk management to achieve shared outcomes for farmers, the investor and the environment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are nowadays considered a questionable environmental alternative to fossil fuels. In that context, this work analyses the environmental impacts when introducing rapeseed on the traditional and current wheat and barley agricultural rotation by means of a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA). The introduction of rapeseed, the correctness of its conversion to obtain straight vegetable oil and its use as self-consumption biofuel in tractors are evaluated. Life cycle assessment is used in this work to evaluate the impacts of different considered scenarios. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted. The results presented show a modest environmental improvement (diminishment of 6 out of the 10 analyzed environmental impacts) when introducing rapeseed to local crop rotations and its partial conversion to oil to be used as fuel in existing diesel engines. Additionally, the ratio between the energy obtained and the total energy input shows moderate positive results when comparing the latter case with the current one. Results from this study can be used to support research and decision making to assess the convenience of introducing alternative fuels in agricultural exploitations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is to be successfully deployed for sugar and biofuel production, agronomic systems must be developed that maximize the duration of the harvest season. Using available sweet sorghum hybrids, the goal of this study was to determine optimum planting dates and hybrid maturity selection to maximize the duration and yield of a harvest season for a subtropical production environment. Ten sweet sorghum hybrids representing three maturity classes (early, medium, and late) and three planting dates (April, May, and June) were evaluated in replicated trials in 2010 and 2011 in College Station, TX, and each maturity class was harvested to maximize biomass and sugar yields. At this location, sweet sorghum hybrids can be continually harvested from late July to early November. During this time, sugar yields are lowest at the beginning of the season (2.6 Mg ha-1) and highest from late August through early October (5.3 Mg ha-1). As expected, yields are maximized by medium and late maturing hybrids planted in April, but early maturity hybrids and late planting dates are necessary to extend the range of the harvest season. The harvest season of sweet sorghum in this environment is very complementary to the sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) harvest season, indicating that these two crops could be grown and harvested in sequence to extend a mill season in most regions of the world where sugarcane is produced. © 2013 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Dwindling fossil resources, surging energy demand and global warming stimulate growing demand for renewable polymer products with low carbon footprint. Going well beyond the limited scope of natural polymers, biomass conversion in biorefineries and chemical carbon dioxide fixation are teamed up with highly effective tailoring, processing and recycling of polymers. "Green monomers" from biorefineries, and "renewable oil", gained from plastics' and bio wastes, render synthetic polymers renewable without impairing their property profiles and recycling. In context of biofuel production, limitations of the green economy concepts are clearly visible. Dreams and reality of "green polymers" are highlighted. Regardless of their new greenish touch, highly versatile and cost-effective polymers play an essential role in sustainable development. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Legislation on biofuels production in the USA and Europe is directing food crops towards the production of grain-based ethanol, which can have detrimental consequences for soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate pollution, biodiversity and human health. An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on 'marginal' lands. Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios. However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (-851 ± 46 grams of CO 2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO 2 e m -2 yr -1)). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 ± 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotation produces on average 41 ± 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of -397 ± 32 gCO 2 e m -2 yr -1; a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 ± 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability, such as water quality and biodiversity, await future study. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cyanobacterial phylum encompasses oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes of a great breadth of morphologies and ecologies; they play key roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. The chloroplasts of all photosynthetic eukaryotes can trace their ancestry to cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria also attract considerable interest as platforms for "green" biotechnology and biofuels. To explore the molecular basis of their different phenotypes and biochemical capabilities, we sequenced the genomes of 54 phylogenetically and phenotypically diverse cyanobacterial strains. Comparison of cyanobacterial genomes reveals the molecular basis for many aspects of cyanobacterial ecophysiological diversity, as well as the convergence of complex morphologies without the acquisition of novel proteins. This phylum-wide study highlights the benefits of diversity-driven genome sequencing, identifying more than 21,000 cyanobacterial proteins with no detectable similarity to known proteins, and foregrounds the diversity of lightharvesting proteins and gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Additionally, our results provide insight into the distribution of genes of cyanobacterial origin in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Moreover, this study doubles both the amount and the phylogenetic diversity of cyanobacterial genome sequence data. Given the exponentially growing number of sequenced genomes, this diversity-driven study demonstrates the perspective gained by comparing disparate yet related genomes in a phylum-wide context and the insights that are gained from it.

AB  - Societal pressure on the global land and freshwater resources is increasing as a result of the rising food demand by the growing human population, dietary changes, and the enhancement of biofuel production induced by the rising oil prices and recent changes in United States and European Union bioethanol policies. Many countries and corporations have started to acquire relatively inexpensive and productive agricultural land located in foreign countries, as evidenced by the dramatic increase in the number of transnational land deals between 2005 and 2009.Often known as "land grabbing," this phenomenon is associated with an appropriation of freshwater resources that has never been assessed before. Herewe gather landgrabbing data frommultiple sources and use a hydrological model to determine the associated rates of freshwater grabbing. We find that land and water grabbing are occurring at alarming rates in all continents except Antarctica. The per capita volume of grabbed water often exceeds the water requirements for a balanced diet andwould be sufficient to improve food security and abate malnourishment in the grabbed countries. It is found that about 0.31 × 1012 m3·y -1 of green water (i.e., rainwater) and up to 0.14 × 10 12 m3·y-1 of blue water (i.e., irrigation water) are appropriated globally for crop and livestock production in 47 × 106 ha of grabbed landworldwide (i.e., in 90% of the reported global grabbed land).

AB  - Growth in biofuel production, which is meant to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy demand, is increasingly seen as a threat to food supply and natural habitats. Using photovoltaics (PV) to directly convert solar radiation into electricity for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is an alternative to photosynthesis, which suffers from a very low energy conversion efficiency. Assessments need to be spatially explicit, since solar insolation and crop yields vary widely between locations. This paper therefore compares direct land use, life cycle GHG emissions and fossil fuel requirements of five different sun-to-wheels conversion pathways for every county in the contiguous U.S.: Ethanol from corn or switchgrass for internal combustion vehicles (ICVs), electricity from corn or switchgrass for BEVs, and PV electricity for BEVs. Even the most land-use efficient biomass-based pathway (i.e., switchgrass bioelectricity in U.S. counties with hypothetical crop yields of over 24 tonnes/ha) requires 29 times more land than the PV-based alternative in the same locations. PV BEV systems also have the lowest life cycle GHG emissions throughout the U.S. and the lowest fossil fuel inputs, except for locations with hypothetical switchgrass yields of 16 or more tonnes/ha. Including indirect land use effects further strengthens the case for PV. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Sweet sorghum is a domesticated grass containing a sugar-rich juice that can be readily utilized for ethanol production. Most of the sugar is stored inside the cells of the stalk tissue and can be difficult to release, a necessary step before conventional fermentation. While this crop holds much promise as an arid land sugar source for biofuel production, a number of challenges must be overcome. One lies in the inherent labile nature of the sugars in the stalks leading to a short usable storage time. Also, collection of sugars from the sweet sorghum stalks is usually accomplished by mechanical squeezing, but generally does not collect all of the available sugars.Results: In this paper, we present two methods that address these challenges for utilization of sweet sorghum for biofuel production. The first method demonstrates a means to store sweet sorghum stalks in the field under semi-arid conditions. The second provides an efficient water extraction method that can collect as much of the available sugar as feasible. Operating parameters investigated include temperature, stalk size, and solid-liquid ratio that impact both the rate of sugar release and the maximal amount recovered with a goal of low water use. The most desirable conditions include 30°C, 0.6 ratio of solid to liquid (w/w), which collects 90 % of the available sugar. Variations in extraction methods did not alter the efficiency of the eventual ethanol fermentation.Conclusions: The water extraction method has the potential to be used for sugar extraction from both fresh sweet sorghum stalks and dried ones. When combined with current sugar extraction methods, the overall ethanol production efficiency would increase compared to current field practices. © 2013 Jia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae feedstock production can be integrated with wastewater and industrial sources of carbon dioxide. This study reviews the literature on algae grown on wastewater and includes a preliminary analysis of algal production based on anaerobic digestion sludge centrate from the Howard F. Curren Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (HFC AWTP) in Tampa, Florida and secondary effluent from the City of Lakeland wastewater treatment facilities in Lakeland, Florida. It was demonstrated that a mixed culture of wild algae species could successfully be grown on wastewater nutrients and potentially scaled to commercial production. Algae have demonstrated the ability to naturally colonize low-nutrient effluent water in a wetland treatment system utilized by the City of Lakeland. The results from these experiments show that the algae grown in high strength wastewater from the HFC AWTP are light-limited when cultivated indoor since more than 50% of the outdoor illumination is attenuated in the greenhouse.An analysis was performed to determine the mass of algae that can be supported by the wastewater nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorous) available from the two Florida cities. The study was guided by the growth and productivity data obtained for algal growth in the photobioreactors in operation at the University of South Florida. In the analysis, nutrients and light are assumed to be limited, while CO2 is abundantly available. There is some limitation on land, especially since the HFC AWTP is located at the Port of Tampa. The temperature range in Tampa is assumed to be suitable for algal growth year round. Assuming that the numerous technical challenges to achieving commercial-scale algal production can be met, the results presented suggest that an excess of 71 metric tons per hectare per year of algal biomass can be produced. Two energy production options were considered; liquid biofuels from feedstock with high lipid content, and biogas generation from anaerobic digestion of algae biomass. The total potential oil volume was determined to be approximately 337,500 gallons per year, which may result in the annual production of 270,000 gallons of biodiesel when 80% conversion efficiency is assumed. This production level would be able to sustain approximately 450 cars per year on average. Potential biogas production was estimated to be above 415,000 kg/yr, the equivalent of powering close to 500 homes for a year. © 2013 Dalrymple et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy production combined with phytoremediation has been suggested to help in solving two critical world problems: the gradual reduction of fossil fuels and soil contamination. The aim of this research was to investigate the potential for the use of Ricinus communis L. (castor oil plant) as an energy crop and plant species to remediate metal-polluted sites. This study was performed in mine tailings containing high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb and Cd. Physico-chemical characterization, total, DTPA-extractable and water-soluble metals in rhizospheric tailings heap samples were carried. Metal concentrations in plant tissues and translocation factors (TFs) were also determined. The Ricinus seed-oil content was high between 41 and 64%, seeds from San Francisco site 6 had the highest oil content, while these from site 7 had the lowest. No trend between oil yield vs seed origin site was observed. Seed-oil content was negatively correlated with root concentration of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd, but no correlation was observed with the extractable-metals. According to its shoot metal concentrations and TFs, castor bean is not a metal accumulator plant. This primary colonizing plant is well suited to cope with the local toxic conditions and can be useful for the stabilization of these residues, and for then decreasing metal bioavailability, dispersion and human health risks on these barren tailings heaps and in the surrounding area. Our work is the first report regarding combined oil production and a phytostabilization role for Ricinus plants in metal mine tailings and may give a new value to suitable metal-polluted areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biogas will be of increasing importance in the future as a factor in reducing greenhouse gas emissions cost-efficiently by the optimal use of available resources and technologies. The goal of this study was to identify the most ecological and economical use of a given resource (organic waste from residential, commercial and industry sectors) using one specific treatment technology (anaerobic digestion) but applying different energy conversion technologies. Average and marginal abatement costs were calculated based on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies. Eight new biogas systems producing electricity, heat, gas or automotive fuel were analyzed in order to identify the most cost-efficient way of reducing GHG emissions. A system using a combined heat and power station (which is connected to waste treatment and digestion operation facilities and located nearby potential residential, commercial or industrial heat users) was found to be the most cost-efficient biogas technology for reducing GHG emissions. Up to € 198 per tonne of CO2 equivalents can be saved by replacing the " business as usual" systems based on fossil resources with ones based on biogas. Limited gas injection (desulfurized and dried biogas, without compression and upgrading) into the gas grid can also be a viable option with an abatement cost saving of € 72 per tonne of CO2 equivalents, while a heating plant with a district heating grid or a system based on biogas results in higher abatement costs (€ 267 and € 270 per tonne CO2 eq). Results from all systems are significantly influenced by whether average or marginal data are used as a reference. Beside that energy efficiency, the reference system that was replaced and the by-products as well as feedstock and investment costs were identified to be parameters with major impacts on abatement costs. The quantitative analysis was completed by a discussion of the role that abatement cost methodology can play in decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using cattails to produce biofuel will add value to the land and will also reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by replacing petroleum products. In order to investigate the feasibility of converting cattails into ethanol, cattails from constructed wetlands on the North Carolina A&T Farm underwent three kinds of pretreatment processes: NaOH, hot water, and dilute sulfuric acid. All three pretreatment methods were able to effectively increase enzymatic digestibility of cattail cellulose. The glucose yields resulting from enzymatic hydrolysis after pretreatment with NaOH, hot water, or dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment were 66.8, 62, and 54.8% of the cellulose (raw cattails basis), respectively. For both dilute sulfuric acid and hot water pretreatment, a high temperature (453–463 K) pretreatment was more effective compared to a lower temperature (394 K) pretreatment. It is recommended that further studies be carried out at a faster heating rate and shorter residence time for the pretreatment process. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC 24858) and Pichia stipitis (ATCC 58784) were used to ferment the sugars released by cattail cellulose. When using diluted pretreated cattails, both stains were able to ferment glucose to produce similar amounts of ethanol. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Palm oil has been a major symbol of colonial Congo as produced by European companies from the fruit picked by African villagers, mostly in natural palm groves. Traditional food for the Congolese population, palm oil only became a major export product when Lever, the British soap maker, was assigned large concessions in the centre of the country in 1911. Later, a large number of smaller companies, Belgian or Portuguese, gained a monopoly on the purchase of fruit in palm oil areas. Factories, social, medical, school facilities and transport networks started to structure some territories, sometimes leading to a true regional construction, as in the Kwilu district. Yet the system presented a dark side: popular reaction movements (as the Pende revolt in 1931) resulting from constraints in recruitment; land litigation due to the assignment of vast concessions; exclusion of Africans from the management; freezing of evolution in village agriculture. Although the Congo had ecome the first African exporter of palm oil and the second at world scale in the 1950s, the system failed to induce a true evelopment process. The second part of the paper examines the deterioration of the system with decolonization: abandonment of most of the oil palm mills and large plantations; departure of big companies partially recovered by local contractors; deconstruction of structures and facilities. Oil export ceased at the end of the last century. Nowadays the industrial production can no longer ensure the supply of soap factories but an artisanal system of palm oil extraction in villages covers most of the urban needs. The third part is devoted to future prospects: improvement of artisanal production; possible revival of agro-industrial production favoured by a growth in world demand; arrival of new investors (notably from Asia) and emergence of new uses - notably as biofuel- but the destruction of forests and land monopolization by foreign companies are a matter of concern.

AB  - There have being increasing debate on the prospects of biofuel becoming the next best alternative to solving the problem of CO2 emission and the escalating fuel prices, but the question is whether this assertion is true and also if it comes without any cost to pay. This paper seeks to find out whether this much praised alternative to solving these problems is a better option or another way for the developed countries to find more areas where they could get cheap land, labour and raw materials for the production of biofuel. This will focus mainly on some effects the growing biofuel production has on food security, livelihood of people, the environment and some land conflicts developing as a result of land grabbing for biofuel production in the developing countries.

AB  - The European Community legislation on biofuels has been first established in 2003 with threefold objective: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduction of energy dependence, and support for agricultural production in a context where a mandatory 10% of the land had to be set aside. This regulation was strengthened in 2009 under the 'Energy Package' by the introduction by the Renewable Energy Directive of a mandatory target of 10% incorporation of renewable energy in fuels by 2020. This legislation is supplemented by a Fuel Quality Directive which imposes a 6% reduction of the carbon footprint of fuels sold for transport by 2020. The high rate of diesel motorization of the personal vehicle fleet in Europe has led to a rapid increase in biodiesel consumption (11 million tons, of which 9 produced in the EU). Rapeseed oil is the main feedstock for biodiesel. A rapid increase of EU rapeseed production allowed to meet this demand, while providing a protein co-product which significantly reduced the EU protein deficit. The debate on the ILUC impact (indirect land use change) of biofuels, as well as the food vs fuel debate, led the European Commission, 3 years after setting its bioenergy policy, to make a proposal which would set a 5% cap on biofuels from food-crops (1st generation) and to introduce "ILUC factors" in the assessment of the greenhouse gas reductions. This proposal could seriously put into question the development of biodiesel... and the cultivation of rapeseed. At the time of writing of this article (July 2013), the Commission proposal is subject of difficult negotiations in Brussels, whose outcome is difficult to predict. © 2013 P.

AB  - The interaction between biofuels and food markets remains a policy issue for a number of reasons. There is a continuing need to understand the role of biofuels in the recent spikes in global food prices. Also, there is an ongoing discussion of changes to biofuel policy as a means to cope with severe weather-induced crop losses. Lastly, there are potential interactions between food markets and advanced biofuels, although most of the latter are expected to be produced from non-food feedstocks. This study reviews the existing literature on the food market impacts of biofuels. Findings suggest that initial conclusions attributing most of the spike in global food prices between 2005 and 2008 to biofuels have been revised. Instead, a multitude of factors, in addition to biofuels, converged during the period. Quantitative estimates of the impacts of biofuels on food markets vary significantly due to differences in modeling approaches, geographical scope, and assumptions about a number of crucial factors. In addition, many studies do not adequately account for the effects of macroeconomic changes, adverse weather conditions and direct market interventions during the recent food price spikes when evaluating the role of biofuels. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - As reported in literature the production of biodiesel should lead to a lower energy consumption than those obtainable with its use. So, to justify its consumption, a sustainable and “low input” production should be carried out. In order to assess the sustainability of Linum usitatissimum, Camelina sativa and Brassica carinata cultivation for biodiesel production in terms of energy used compared to that obtained, the index EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) has been used. At this aim, an experimental field was realised in the south-eastern Sicilian land. During the autumn-winter crop cycle, no irrigation was carried out and some suitable agricultural practices have been carried out taking into account the peculiarity of each type of used seeds. The total energy consumed for the cultivation of oil bearing crops from sowing to the production of biodiesel represents the Input of the process. In particular, this concerned the energy embodied in machinery and tools utilized, in seed, chemical fertilizer and herbicide but also the energy embodied in diesel fuels and lubricant oils. In addition, the energy consumption relating to machines and reagents required for the processes of extraction and transesterification of the vegetable oil into biodiesel have been calculated for each crops. The energy obtainable from biodiesel production, taking into account the energy used for seed pressing and for vegetable oil transesterification into biodiesel, represents the Output of the process. The ratio Output/Input gets the EROEI index which in the case of Camelina sativa and Linum usatissimum is greater than one. These results show that the cultivation of these crops for biofuels production is convenient in terms of energy return on energy investment. The EROEI index for Brassica carinata is lower than one. This could means that some factors, concerning mechanisation and climatic conditions, were not suitable to ensure higher crop yields. © 2013, Copyright A. Restuccia et al.

AB  - Woody Biomasses (from agriculture and forestry activities) are among the most promising renewable energy sources. Current literature describes woody biomass feedstock supply chains supporting biofuels and utilities industries: the potentially productive land area overheads required for biomass production may results in a complex logistic within the whole chain. Its effective enhancement requires significant changes in the logistics environment of energy plants for sustainable energy production and the sequence-dependent procurement chains for biomasses furthermore complicate these changes. According to this, optimizing harvesting and supplying operations turns out to be strategic within the framework of the current energy policy. In this work we present a case study carried out monitoring 57 short rotation forestry (SRF) production sites placed in Emilia Romagna Region, Northern Italy, all supplying the harvested biomass to the same biomass power plant placed in the province of Ravenna (Italy). The overall average yield of these sites was 55 t/ha, the site surfaces ranged from 0.3 to 20 hectares and the distance from the power plant ranged between 8.2 to 102 km with one production site only within 10 km from the power plant. Harvest and transport costs were calculated according to two different harvesting scenarios: i) single phase harvesting (one cutting/chopping machine + tractors and trailers); ii) double phase harvesting (cutting/mowing machine followed after 80 days by chopping machine + tractors and trailers). Results show that, according to the first scenario, at increasing distances overall harvesting and transport costs ranged from 8.9 to 21.0 ± 1.3 €/t (average ± standard deviation), while, with reference to the second scenario, they increased from 10.3 to 23.8 ± 1.5 €/t with the transportation costs accounting from 16 to almost 70% of the total costs. © 2013, Copyright L.

AB  - Human population explosion, progressive industrialization, automobiles and world energy requirements, particularly for the fossil fuel is likely to deplete limited natural resources over short period of time. Therefore, search for an alternative fuel resource is the only way to overcome the upcoming energy crisis. Biofuel, in this context seems to be a sustainable option. Biomasses so far used for biodiesel production include animal fats, vegetable oils like soybean, rapeseed, Jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm, hemp, field pennycress, Pongamia pinnata etc. which require agricultural land for their growth. In the present context, population explosion does not permit the use agricultural land for the cultivation of petro crops and therefore the scientists have to find an energy feedstock which does not require fertile land use. Keeping it in view, emphasis has been given to the autotrophic tiny organisms of algae for biodiesel production, the world over. Certain algal species contains oil producing substrate and are rapidly growing under normal conditions. This algal fat can be processed into biodiesel by trans esterification. Biodiesel production from algae involves identification of high fatty acid storing algal species, their cultivation in open or hybrid photobioreactors, harvesting, oil extraction and process standardization. Biodiesel production from algae had been emphasized by Bhatnagar et al. (2011) which need proper initiative to become energy sustainable. © 2013, Society for Plant Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the role of private actors in the implementation of the sustainability criteria for biofuels outlined in the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union (EU). The article demonstrates that private verifiers' participation is essential for governing greener biofuels in the EU. The article's objective is twofold. First, it analyzes the two methods for the verification of compliance with the biofuels sustainability criteria, focusing on the role of private verifiers. This analysis sheds light on an interface of public and private action that is also an opportune platform for exploring theoretical concepts. Therefore, second, the article examines the relevance of private verifiers' participation in the implementation framework for sustainable biofuels. Drawing on the concepts of European 'new governance' and 'coregulation', the article shows that involving the private sector in the implementation of a legally binding EU Directive adds certain dynamics and constitutes modern regulatory innovation, but at the same time it makes the implementation framework more complex. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Soil conservation is threatened by a number of factors, namely the effects of intensive agricultural practices, the increasing pressure for food production linked to the increasing human population, the consumption patterns in developed and emerging economies, and the conversion of agriculture from the production of commodities (which is itself a goal in need of discussion) to the production of biofuels. The extent of human pressure and the effects of conflicting land use systems need to be addressed. Alternative and conservative agricultural practices need to be explored and widely adopted in order to preserve the soil fertility, assessing their pros and cons. In this paper, the main potential alternative practices are reviewed, focusing in particular on organic farming. It is also argued that in order to better plan to preserve soil health a strategy considering the whole food system is required. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of renewable energies as alternative to fossil fuels has value from different points of view and has effects at environmental, social and economic level. These aspects are often connected to each other and together define the overall sustainability of bioenergy. At European level, the Directive 2009/28/EC gives the basic criteria for the estimation of sustainability of biofuels and indicates a minimum threshold of 35% of greenhouse gas saving for a biofuel in order to be considered sustainable. The Directive gives the possibility to identify standard regional values for the cultivation steps that could be utilized for the certification. This paper aims to give a contribution to the definition of these values considering the RED methodology applied to the sunflower cropped in central Italy which is characterized by a hilly landscape and not-irrigated crops. To determine input and output of sunflower cultivation in the central Italy, the results of PROBIO project, carried out by the Authors, were used. The sustainability of biodiesel produced from sunflower grown in central Italy is variable and depends on the nitrogen input and seasonal climatic conditions that affect the yields. The greenhouse gases savings of the Italian chain is 40% in average, greater than the required 35% and would be possible to assign this value as standard to the biofuel chain biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in central Italy. Using an averaged regional standard value guards against the possibility of considering unsustainable harvesting in unfavourable years and seeing it overestimated in the favourable ones. © 2013, Page Press Publications.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been identified as an alternate source for biofuel, and thus requires immediate establishment of plantations in areas not utilized for food production such as in mine tailings sites. Screenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the survival, growth and copper (Cu) accumulation of non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal J. curcas seedlings or cuttings grown in oven sterilized grassland soil from Caliraya, Laguna and in mine tailing soils from Paracale, Camarines Norte and Mogpog, Marinduque. Grassland soil was sterilized in an oven for three days at 100 °C prior to use. Seedlings or cuttings were either uninoculated or inoculated with Mykovam or MineVAM mycorrhizal inoculants. Results show that Paracale soil supported the highest survival and best growth of seedlings or cuttings. In Mogpog soil, all seedlings died before two months except those inoculated with Mykovam while all cuttings died on the third month. Non-mycorrhizal seedlings did not survive in Caliraya soil while mycorrhizal inoculation increased seedling survival and growth. Cuttings did not respond to inoculation, probably due to low mycorrhizal infection (≤14%) as compared to seedlings (≤100%). Mykovam promoted higher survival and better plant growth than MineVAM because of its higher root colonization. Cu accumulation was higher in the roots of mycorrhizal plants and the lowest was in the leaves especially in the Mykovam-inoculated plants. In conclusion, Mykovam inoculated J. curcas grew better with higher survival rate than the control thus this imply that rehabilitation of grasslands in Caliraya, Laguna and mine tailing areas in Paracale, Camarines Norte can be done for its potential for biofuel production. However, field trials should be conducted.

AB  - Using wood wastes provides an opportunity to avoid fossil carbon emissions from the combustion of natural gas or other fossil fuels. Using a life-cycle assessment, a new biomass boiler sourced by forest residuals, sawmill residuals, and clean demolition material (CDM) was compared with an existing natural gas boiler for supplying heat to a large-scale district heating system. Potential alternative uses of these feedstocks, such as recycled or reprocessed products, and landfill alternatives were also evaluated for their relative impact on carbon emissions. We found a reduction in emissions from natural gas of 0.62 unit of carbon for every unit of carbon in the wood combusted. Temporary losses of forest carbon after initiating the collection of forest residuals were minimal over a short interval. These losses were more than offset by the joint production of wood products displacing fossil emissions. Carbon mitigation in the Pacific Northwest was increased from 5.5 metric tons/ha/y from the production of forest products with no collection of forest residuals to 6.5 metric tons/ha/y after completing the first rotation, an 18 percent reduction in fossil emissions per hectare of forest. The potential to recycle CDM into wood products may ultimately raise the efficiency in avoiding carbon emissions by 40 to 60 percent, although available wood quality and logistics currently favor use of CDM as biofuel feedstock. In the absence of any "incentives" or value for carbon mitigation, feedstock collection costs relative to low-cost fossil fuel will substantially limit the use of waste woods for biofuel or recycling alternatives. © Forest Products Society 2013.

AB  - In China, the poor supply logistic and the high feedstock cost are the most critical constraints to the development of forest bioenergy. The aim of this study is to identify the supply logistic from forest land to the final delivery for bioenergy utilization. A case study approach was used to collect the relevant information and data. And two different supply logistics of wood biofuel were designed for two locations in Inner Mongolia, one was from collective forests and the other was from state-owned forests. © 2013 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA.

AB  - The study represents results of theoretical evaluation of forest biomass available for solid biofuel production in pre-commercial thinning in Latvia. The study is based on the National forest inventory (NFI) data; calculations are done for each NFI plot separately. The calculation is done in three steps-selection of the NFI sample plots, which fulfils criteria for the pre-commercial thinning, development of the diameter distribution table, setting the criteria of the thinning intensity, calculation of extractable biomass. Thinning from below (removal of the smallest trees) is considered in calculation. Two types of biomass are accounted-full tree (aboveground biomass) and stem-wood (stem biomass). The study demonstrates that pre-commercial thinning could become an important source of forest biomass in Latvia (15400 GWh of primary energy according to current situation in forests); however, dimensions of trees and harvesting conditions might be challenging for production. The most of the potential biofuel resources are located in stands with average tree higher than 8 m; therefore, it is reasonably to develop and introduce technologies applicable for production of partially delimbed trees.

AB  - Jatropha projects have been set up worldwide as solution to reduce competition between food and biofuel production. Jatropha is mostly produced on marginal land in developing countries and production is labour-intensive. The subject of this study is an existing Jatropha plantation in central Madagascar. The aims are to assess whether large-scale Jatropha plantations offer sufficient income possibilities to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. The results show that incomes and food security improved in 2008 due to income generated on the plantation, but deteriorated between 2008 and 2010 mostly due to a decline in agricultural yields for climatic reasons. We find weak evidence that households working for the plantation experienced less reduction in incomes and expenditures than control households. The majority of households did not reduce agricultural production; plantation workers are mostly poorer farmers who need an additional income source.

AB  - Forests are potential sources for a wide range of alternative fuels, which could reduce dependency on fossil fuels and carbon emissions, but sustainability of producing biofuels from forests has not been well-studied. Therefore, we investigated effects of woody biomass harvest, intercropping perennial grasses, and combinations of these treatments on herpetofauna in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in a randomized and replicated field experiment in eastern North Carolina, USA. We sampled amphibians and small reptiles with drift fence arrays from April to July during 1 and 2 years after treatment establishment. We had 425 captures of 15 species of herpetofauna across the 2 sampling seasons, but did not observe large general effects of biomass removal or planting of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in pine plantations on detection, diversity, or relative abundance. However, planned contrasts indicated Simpson's index of diversity was greater in plots managed for switchgrass only compared with pine plantations during year 2, and that captures of southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) were less common in switchgrass plots than in pine plantations intercropped with switchgrass. Neither intercropping switchgrass with pine nor removal of harvest residuals caused herpetofauna diversity or abundance of common species to differ from traditional plantation management during the first 2 years following treatment establishment. With the exception of switchgrass-only plots, which had lower herpetofauna species evenness, the potential practices we considered for biofuels production are unlikely to have short-term effects on herpetofauna relative to traditional pine management. Future research should monitor herpetofauna through succession and consider landscape-scale effects and other potential feedstock sources. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate the sustainability, in terms of greenhouse gases emission saving, of a new potential bio-ethanol production chain in comparison with the most common ones. The innovation consists of producing bio-ethanol from different types of no-food grapes, while usually bio-ethanol is obtained from matrices taken away from crop for food destination: sugar cane, corn, wheat, sugar beet. In the past, breeding programs were conducted with the aim of improving grapevine characteristics, a large number of hybrid vine varieties were produced and are nowadays present in the CRA-VIT (Viticulture Research Centre) Germplasm Collection. Some of them are potentially interesting for bio-energy production because of their high production of sugar, good resistance to diseases, and ability to grow in marginal lands. LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) of grape ethanol energy chain was performed following two different methods: (i) using the spreadsheet “BioGrace, developed within the “Intelligent Energy Europe” program to support and to ease the RED (Directive 2009/28/EC) implementation; (ii) using a dedicated LCA software. Emissions were expressed in CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). The results showed that the sustainability limits provided by the normative are respected to this day. On the contrary, from 2017 this production will be sustainable only if the transformation processes will be performed using renewable sources of energy. The comparison with other bioenergy chains points out that the production of ethanol using grapes represents an intermediate situation in terms of general emissions among the different production chains. © 2013, Copyright G.

AB  - Nowadays world faces crisis caused by growing energy demand. Threat of climate change caused by the increased emission of CO2 from burning of fossil fuels exerts pressure on wider use of renewable energy resources. It is believed that one of important resources of renewable energy are biofuels. In the paper we present that in the most cases it is not true. Wide use of biofuel, especially in European Union, poses threat to sustainable development of today's world. It is going to be presented that the production of biofuels from agricultural crops is, in many cases, unsustainable due to the fact that it reduces the access to food by devoting cultivatable land to crops designated for the production of biofuels. What is more, it has also negative influence on the environment, namely it reduces biodiversity, pollute water and, what is curious, not in all cases the use of biofuels leads to the reduction of CO 2 emission.

AB  - New Zealand is blessed with some of the most productive softwood tree growing land in the world. It can still make better use of this, but it has translated into cheap growing costs. RISI, a US information provider for global forest products, provided estimates of growing costs in 2012 in New Zealand at US$33 a cubic metre, New South Wales at $102 a cubic metre, in the Pacific northwest in the United States at $302 a cubic metre, and $3,850 a cubic metre to grow pine in Finland. This in turn has spawned a large log export industry here. However, if we are to witness a renaissance of the solid wood processing and the pulp and paper industry, our processing cost structure and some government policy settings must change. Many factors such as distance to markets, relative quality of woodfibre, an often unmotivated workforce, restrictive work practices, a mountain of paid holidays compared with some competitors, are outside industry control. Chinese mills operate seven days a week, 12 hours a day, with conversion costs 30 per cent of those in New Zealand and with 70 per cent or more green sawn conversion factors, close to the markets, and with residues worth more than twice what they are in this country. If we could match that, we might start to roll. Is a paradigm shift likely to occur soon? Major changes to exchange rates will help. Some limited processing expansion is probable with two or three players, but each year which goes by with no new pulp and paper expansion we get closer to a really serious problem. New bioenergy or biofuel markets may open up, but so far they tend only to operate overseas when wood fibre is virtually free. It will take a gigantic leap to return the New Zealand industry to the place in the sun it held 25 to 30 years ago.

AB  - Raceway ponds, or "high-rate algal ponds", of various configurations have been used to treat waste-water since the 1950s. They are also known as Oswald ponds after their inventor W. J. Oswald. Large-scale outdoor culture of microalgae and cyanobacteria in raceways is well established (Terry and Raymond 1985; Oswald 1988; Borowitzka and Borowitzka 1989; Becker 1994; Lee 1997; Molina Grima 1999; Pulz 2001; Borowitzka 2005; Spolaore et al. 2006). Raceway culture is used commercially in the United States, Thailand, China, Israel and elsewhere, mostly to produce algae for relatively high-value applications. This chapter is focused on raceways typically used in the production of algal biomass and not in the treatment of wastewater. The engineering design, operation and performance characteristics of raceways are discussed. The biomass productivity of the raceways is assessed in relation to limits imposed by algal biology. The economics of algal oil production in raceways are discussed.

AB  - One of the current targets of European Union (EU) energy policy is to reach at least a 10% share of biofuels in fuel consumed for transportation (petrol and diesel) in 2020. However, it has not been specified how this global target should be distributed among the Member States according to its different starting points and potentials. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a dynamic nonlinear target distribution method for increasing the share of biofuels in fuel consumed for transportation. We applied the proposed distribution based on the following indicators: nonbiofuels in fuel consumed for transportation, nonbiofuels per capita, nonbiofuels per gross domestic product (GDP), and GDP per capita, in the reference year (2005). In addition, a multicriteria analysis was also conducted to weigh the variables in the study. The proposed methodology is innovative, easy-to-use, and attempts to contribute to the political discussion on the importance of territorial weighing of the biofuel consumption target by the real situation in each member state. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Urban planning is an important national issue. It is both a technical and a political process concerned with controlling the use of land and designing the urban environment. Urban renewal can be incorporated into urban planning by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities in decline. We considered how industry and agriculture could coexist in urban plans in this paper. Moringa fields have been in the spotlight all over the world recently. Moringa, native to parts of Africa and Asia, is the sole genus in the flowering plant family Moringaceae. Moringa grows quickly in many types of environments. Much of the plant is edible by humans or by farm animals. Feeding the high-protein leaves to cattle has shown to increase weight gain by up to 32% and milk production by 43 to 65%. The seeds contain 30 to 40% oil that is high in oleic acid, while defatted meal is 61% protein. The defatted meal is a flocculant and can be used in water purification to settle out sediments and undesirable organisms. Moringa is being used as biodiesel in many developing countries. Three advantages of this source of biodiesel are that it is not in direct competition with food consumption, the high yield of Moringa trees allows it to be produced in large quantities, and its biodiesel has a better oxidative stability than other biodiesels. When the pods are harvested to produce biofuel, the trees keep on growing. If Moringa forests are planned and created in a country, refineries can be built nearby, so that country's economic growth can be expected. A plan for creating Moringa farming and forestry in cities and towns is described in this paper. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - For China as the world's third largest ethanol producer, greenhouse gas emissions of corn-ethanol production are analyzed for the entire processes of corn cultivation, ethanol conversion and wastewater treatment. Besides the greenhouse gas emissions associated with primary fossil energy use embodied in all the energy and material flows into corn-ethanol processes, the increased greenhouse gas emissions due to soil tilling and erosion, methane emissions from burning corn stalk and the wastewater are carefully estimated. For per kg corn-ethanol produced, a net positive greenhouse gas emission of 11.61 kg CO2-equiv. is revealed corresponding to a striking increase of 5.99 times in greenhouse emissions when corn-ethanol is used as a substitute for gasoline. Moreover, ethanol production might lead to a highly remarkable 98% GHG reduction compared to gasoline by an ecological systems design of the production chain with constructed wetland, biogas and combined heat and power fully employed, though existing technology is illustrated to be far from carbon neutral under various allocations for co-products. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: This article examines the scope of voluntary certification schemes, based on the sustainability criteria of the European Renewable Energy Directive for biofuel production in the context of social sustainability and land use issues in Brazil. Possibilities and limitations of such certification schemes are discussed against the background of the rapid-changing Brazilian agricultural sector. Methods: Brazil was chosen as a case study being both one of the first countries where ethanol certification projects are implemented and a potential certified ethanol-exporting country. To capture social effects concerning land use connected to an increased ethanol production, semi-structured expert interviews were conducted within an explorative approach in São Paulo in the years 2011 and 2012. The study addresses the following question: what is the scope of certification concerning social sustainability in the light of a rising demand on agricultural land? Results: An increasing demand for biofuels and other agricultural goods, as cash crops, leads to a concentration process of agricultural production. Land price hikes in infrastructural well-connected agricultural areas and the uneven distribution of land in Brazil are leading to newly arising negative effects on social sustainability. We assume that certification schemes have a limited scope in the above mentioned environments. Conclusions: As the scale of certification schemes is based on production-chain-governance, indirect and macro effects concerning social sustainability in Brazil cannot be addressed by this instrument. Hence, there is a strong need for comprehensive public regulation on land use issues on a national and international level in order to flank land use concentration in dynamic agricultural sectors, such as the Brazilian one. © 2013 Mohr and Bausch; licensee Springer.

AB  - Background: Biomass fuel is the main source of rural household energy in many developing countries in South and Southeast Asia. This paper examines the preference and attitude towards biomass fuels of consumers living in rural areas of Bangladesh. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data of 240 households from four upazilas located in four distinct agro-ecological zones of Bangladesh. Different inferential statistical tests were carried out to analyze the information. Results: The results revealed that branches, leaves, cow dung, rice straw and stem wood were the most commonly used biomass fuels, whereas the most preferred biomass fuels were firewood (branches and stem wood) followed by cow dung, bamboo and jute stalk. Due to the short supply of firewood, the rural households opted for inferior types of biomass such as leaves, twigs, rice straw and other crop residues. Samanea saman, Albizia procera and Mangifera indica are the main preferred firewood tree species. The analysis showed that the consumption patterns of and preferences for biomass fuels significantly varied between the regions and the socio-economic groups. The economic inability of consumers to afford commercial fuels was the main reason for the widespread use of biomass fuels. Nevertheless, the majority of the rural households posed positive attitudes towards an on-farm and off-farm afforestation programme as a response to a future supply of biomass fuel. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that firewood was the most preferred biomass fuel and, as a consequence, the current consumption was not sustainable. Therefore, extensive farming of various fast growing firewood species both in private and public lands has been solicited to bridge the gap between demand and supply. © 2013 Hassan et al.

AB  - Production of biofuels via enzymatic hydrolysis of complex plant polysaccharides is a subject of intense global interest. Microbial communities are known to express a wide range of enzymes necessary for the saccharification of lignocellulosic feedstocks and serve as a powerful reservoir for enzyme discovery. However, the growth temperature and conditions that yield high cellulase activity vary widely, and the throughput to identify optimal conditions has been limited by the slow handling and conventional analysis. A rapid method that uses small volumes of isolate culture to resolve specific enzyme activity is needed. In this work, a high throughput nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS)-based approach was developed for screening a thermophilic cellulolytic actinomycete, Thermobispora bispora, for β-glucosidase production under various growth conditions. Media that produced high β-glucosidase activity were found to be I/S + glucose or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), Medium 84 + rolled oats, and M9TE + MCC at 45°C. Supernatants of cell cultures grown in M9TE + 1% MCC cleaved 2.5 times more substrate at 45°C than at all other temperatures. While T. bispora is reported to grow optimally at 60°C in Medium 84 + rolled oats and M9TE + 1% MCC, approximately 40% more conversion was observed at 45°C. This high throughput NIMS approach may provide an important tool in discovery and characterization of enzymes from environmental microbes for industrial and biofuel applications. © 2013 Cheng, Hiras, Deng, Bowen, Simmons, Adams, Singer and Northen.

AB  - Brazil aims to increase palm oil production to meet the growing national and global demand for edible oil and biodiesel while preserving environmentally and culturally significant areas. As land use change (LUC) is the result of complex interactions between socio-economic and biophysical drivers operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales, the type and location of LUC depend on drivers such as neighboring land use, conversion elasticity, access to infrastructure, distance to markets, and land suitability. The purpose of this study is to develop scenarios to measure the impact of land conversion under three different enforcement scenarios (none, some, and strict enforcement). We found that converting 22.5 million hectares of land can produce approximately 29 billion gallons (110 billion liters) of biodiesel a year. Of that, 22-71% of the area can come from forest land, conservation units, wetland and indigenous areas, emitting 14-84 gCO 2e MJ-1. This direct land use emission alone can be higher than the carbon intensity of diesel that it intends to displace for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. This letter focuses narrowly on GHG emissions and does not address socio-economic-ecological prospects for these degraded lands for palm oil or for other purposes. Future studies should carefully evaluate these tradeoffs. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The world's agricultural systems face the challenge of meeting the rising demands from population growth, changing dietary preferences, and expanding biofuel use. Previous studies have put forward strategies for meeting this growing demand by increasing global crop production, either expanding the area under cultivation or intensifying the crop yields of our existing agricultural lands. However, another possible means for increasing global crop production has received less attention: increasing the frequency of global cropland harvested each year. Historically, many of the world's croplands were left fallow, or had failed harvests, each year, foregoing opportunities for delivering crop production. Furthermore, many regions, particularly in the tropics, may be capable of multiple harvests per year, often more than are harvested today. Here we analyze a global compilation of agricultural statistics to show how the world's harvested cropland has changed. Between 2000 and 2011, harvested land area grew roughly 4 times faster than total standing cropland area. Using a metric of cropland harvest frequency (CHF) - the ratio of land harvested each year to the total standing cropland - and its recent trends, we identify countries that harvest their croplands more frequently, and those that have the potential to increase their cropland harvest frequency. We suggest that a possible 'harvest gap' may exist in many countries that represents an opportunity to increase crop production on existing agricultural lands. However, increasing the harvest frequency of existing croplands could have significant environmental and social impacts, which need careful evaluation. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this study we evaluate and demonstrate the occurrence of nine natural and one synthetic steroid hormone, including estrogens, androgens and progestagens in biogas final digestate byproduct (digestion liquid) commonly used as an agricultural fertilizer. We investigated two biogas sites that utilize different anaerobic digestion technologies (mesophilic and thermophilic) from swine manure and other organic wastes. Individual hormone concentration levels were observed up to 1478 ng g-1 dry weight or 22.5 mg kg -1 N with estrone and progesterone reaching highest concentration levels. Evaluation of the potential environmental burden through the application in agriculture was also assessed on the basis of predicted environmental concentrations. This study indicates that the biogas digestion process does not completely remove steroid hormones from livestock manure and use of final digestate byproduct on croplands contributes to the environmental emission of hormones. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential of first generation biofuels to mitigate climate change is still largely debated in the scientific and policy-making arenas. It is currently assessed through life cycle assessment (LCA), a method for accounting for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a given product from "cradle-to-grave", which is widely used to aid decision making on environmental issues. Although LCA is standardized, its application to biofuels leads to inconclusive results often fraught by a high variability and uncertainty. This is due to differences in quantifying the environmental impacts of feedstock production, and the difficulties encountered when considering land use changes (LUC) effects. The occurrence of LUC mechanisms is in part the consequence of policies supporting the use of biofuels in the transport sector, which implicitly increases the competition between various possible uses of land worldwide. Here, we review the methodologies recently put forward to include LUC effects in LCAs, and examples from the US, Europe and France. These cross analysis show that LCA needs to be adapted and combined to other tools such as economic modeling in order to provide a more reliable assessment of the biofuels chains. © 2013 W.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental emissions associated with the production of a typical white wine produced in Sardinia, with particular reference to CO2 emissions. The main objective is to determine the main environmental impacts of the overall production process and to identify what steps have the greatest level of criticity. Methods: An attributional and partial Life Cycle Assessment analysis was used with GaBi software. Results: The analysis shows that the main problems were the production and combustion of diesel in the viticulture phase, above all during the vine planting phase, and the production of glass bottles in the phase of wine bottling within the winery processes. Conclusions and recommendations: To overcome these critical points, some suggestions come from the most recent literature, such as the use of biofuels in the first case and the use of lighter bottles in the second. More in-depth analysis is needed to compare these alternatives in order to assess the effective reduction of environmental emissions. © 2013 UniCeSV, University of Florence.

AB  - The potential power generation from land-based bioenergy is predicted globally using a computer model. Simultaneous consideration of land use, cost and carbon restrictions enables practical evaluation of net power output. Comparisons are made with wind and solar power, and a sensitivity analysis is used to explore the effects of different policy assumptions. Biomass is shown to offer only moderate power-generating potential, and would satisfy less than half of current demand even if all suitable existing arable land were used to grow bioenergy crops. However, bioenergy can be cheap to generate given current economics, and is able to remove atmospheric carbon in some cases if coupled with carbon capture and storage. Wind turbines are able to provide more power globally, but photovoltaic solar panels are the only source considered with the potential to satisfy existing demand. Since land-based bioenergy is also restricted by the need to grow food for an expanding population, and technological developments are likely to greatly increase the viability of other renewable sources, the role of land-based bioenergy appears relatively limited and short-term. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A model has been created that compares the demand and supply of food energy globally or at a country level. The model can be used to identify the amount and type of land use change required to satisfy increased food energy demand and so can be used to estimate indirect land use change if agricultural crops are used to the production of biomass for energy.The results from the model imply that for every increase of 1TJ of food energy demand there is 18ha of deforestation worldwide. The model suggests that if the current trend continues then the EU Renewable Energy Directive will cause between 28 and 53 million hectares of deforestation and another 20 and 38 million hectares of deforestation will occur due to the U.S. Ethanol Program.This model also suggests that the deforestation caused by the conversion of a hectare of food-producing land to biofuel production depends on the amount of food energy that the land produced. For example, the conversion of a hectare of pulses in India causes 0.04ha of deforestation; a hectare of sugar cane in Kenya causes 2.2ha of deforestation due to high yields and high energy value; a hectare of grassland used for milk production in Europe, if converted, causes only 0.03ha of deforestation due to lower yield and energy value; and 0.37ha of deforestation would be required to compensate for the loss of one hectare of cereal-producing land in Canada. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass from trees provides a renewable feedstock for biofuels, lumber, pulp, paper, and other uses. Dissecting the mechanism underlying natural variation of the complex traits controlling growth and lignocellulose biosynthesis in trees can enable marker-assisted breeding to improve wood quality and yield. Here, we combined linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based association analysis with traditional linkage analysis to detect the genetic effect of a Populus tomentosa cellulose synthase gene, PtoCesA4. PtoCesA4 is strongly expressed in developing xylem and leaves. Nucleotide diversity and LD in PtoCesA4, sampled from the P. tomentosa natural distribution, revealed that PtoCesA4 harbors high single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity (πT = 0.0080 and Θw = 0.0098) and low LD (r2 ≥ 0.1, within 1400 bp), demonstrating that the potential of a candidate-gene-based LD approach in understanding the molecular basis underlying quantitative variation in this species. By combining single SNP, multi-SNP, and haplotype-based associations in an association population of 460 individuals with single SNP linkage analysis in a family-based linkage populations (1200 individuals), we identified three strong associations (false discovery rate Q&lt;0.05) in both populations. These include two nonsynonymous markers (SNP49 associated with a-cellulose content and SNP59 associated with fiber width) and a noncoding marker (SNP18 associated with a-cellulose content). Variation in RNA transcript abundance among genotypic classes of SNP49 was confirmed in these two populations. Therefore, combining different methods allowed us to examine functional PtoCesA4 allelic variation underlying natural variation in complex quantitative traits related to growth and lignocellulosic biosynthesis. © 2013 Du et al.

AB  - The availability of about 18 million hectares of grassland in Pará State, Brazil, and the possibility of increasing the livestock density display a good perspective for the oil palm expansion in pasture land. A life cycle assessment is performed for a prospective palm-based biorefinery to view two regional and one global environmental impact and the consequences of the land-use change in terms of GHG emissions. Oil palm cultivation in an area of ~110,000hectares of land can annually produce ~39,000tons of bioethanol, ~340,000tons of biodiesel, ~268GW h net electricity and other co-products. The life cycle GHG emissions reduction for biodiesel and bioethanol as compared to fossil diesel and gasoline would be 76.9-79.3% and 83.7-88.6%. The advantage of grassland rehabilitation by oil palm plantation is the removal of ~188t CO2/ha from the atmosphere during the plant lifetime. The entire inflows and outflows for the conversion processes are schemed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Well-to-wake (WTWa) analysis of bio-based aviation fuels, including hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) from various oil seeds, Fischer-Tropsch jet (FTJ) from corn-stover and co-feeding of coal and corn-stover, and pyrolysis jet from corn stover, is conducted and compared with petroleum jet. WTWa GHG emission reductions relative to petroleum jet can be 41-63% for HRJ, 68-76% for pyrolysis jet and 89% for FTJ from corn stover. The HRJ production stage dominates WTWa GHG emissions from HRJ pathways. The differences in GHG emissions from HRJ production stage among considered feedstocks are much smaller than those from fertilizer use and N2O emissions related to feedstock collection stage. Sensitivity analyses on FTJ production from coal and corn-stover are also conducted, showing the importance of biomass share in the feedstock, carbon capture and sequestration options, and overall efficiency. For both HRJ and FTJ, co-product handling methods have significant impacts on WTWa results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - New organisms and biological systems designed to satisfy human needs are among the aims of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology seeks to model and construct biological components, functions and organisms that do not exist in nature or to redesign existing biological systems to perform new functions. Synthetic genomics, on the other hand, encompasses technologies for the generation of chemically-synthesized whole genomes or larger parts of genomes, allowing to simultaneously engineer a myriad of changes to the genetic material of organisms. Engineering complex functions or new organisms in synthetic biology are thus progressively becoming dependent on and converging with synthetic genomics. While applications from both areas have been predicted to offer great benefits by making possible new drugs, renewable chemicals or clean energy, they have also given rise to concerns about new safety, environmental and socio-economic risks - stirring an increasingly polarizing debate. Here we intend to provide an overview on recent progress in biomedical and biotechnological applications of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology as well as on arguments and evidence related to their possible benefits, risks and governance implications. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - A strong interest has been focused from several years on the algae pathway for energy production, especially for transportation fuels called third generation biofuel or G3 biofuel, and mainly from microalgae route, considering it could be a high potential alternative strategy for renewable energy and fuel production. Algae, and especially microalgae, present significant advantages compared with land resources, such as much higher productivity and lack of competition with food applications. Nevertheless, based on current knowledge, the production of an algae biomass for energy remains a difficult target to reach, due to the numerous existing hurdles such as the energetic yield and the economic positioning, without neglecting the environmental and societal aspect. Unlike first generation (G1) and a few second generation biofuel (G2) processes, G3 biofuel processes are far from the industrialization step. In 2010, under the initiative of IFP Energies nouvelles, Airbus, Safran, EADS IW and the “Acade mie des Technologies”, launched a French national study of the potential of the algae sector as resources for the so called G3 biofuel production. This study was called “Algogroup” and led by IFP Energies nouvelles. The objective was to obtain a shared vision of the deployment possibilities. It led to the creation of this Algogroup task force with the previous partners, adding Sofiproté ol, INRA1, IFREMER1, CEVA1 and the Agrimip pole to combine all available knowledge and determine the responses which could be given to the existing questions. The Algogroup objective was to facilitate vision sharing between participating organisations and industrials on the technical improvements, the probabilities of success, the R and D needs and the development perspectives, while paying close attention to the obstacles which have to be alleviated to improve the positioning of the algae pathway. To reach this target, Algogroup has explored several axes, which enabled a thorough analysis of the potentials and limits of the technology: from the species selection to the harvesting (lipid extraction/recovery), including environmental and economical aspects. This paper focuses on some main aspects of the Algogroup study related to economical positioning and environmental terms, specially Life Cycle Analysis (LCA).Alarge share of the work was dedicated to microalgae, but since it was also considered important to examine the potential role of macroalgae, a specific analysis was conducted on this aspect. It has enabled the group to issue some recommendations such as a need for an integrated approach, need for tools to run comprehensive technico-economic assessments, including co-products valorisation. Despite the limited amount of reliable information currently available on the algofuel sectors, especially in terms of environmental balance, numerous challenges still remain to be taken up to make these sectors credible and profitable, both technically, economically and environmentally. On the economic aspect the estimated costs for future microalgae biofuels remain in a very broad range from $2/Gal to $7/Gal. There remains great potential to decrease microalgae oil production costs, but this has to be considered very carefully given the large amount of underlying assumptions. Moreover, as yet underlined, microalgae biofuels are not currently being produced at a commercial scale, thus these are only potential scenarios, which will have to be confirmed. And finally, several technologies can be used to produce microalgae oil and location possibilities are proposed. Another key point is that, in a large majority of scenarios, the economic viability of the pathway relies on the valorisation of what one usually calls co-products. Valorisation of co-products is not considered a valid option in the long-term as no market identified today could absorb the quantities associated to a new fuel market. Besides, environmental studies have demonstrated that the energetic balance was not favourable at present, based on current processes, but the variation range of the results let some space for significant improvements. The balance of greenhouse gas emissions was favourable, and there also the variation range was very wide. As regards the other environmental impact categories, however, the uncertainties are too great to draw any conclusions. Because of the heterogeneity of approaches and results for the development of the algae pathway, we must bear in mind that without reliable and robust assessments of these sectors it will not be possible to direct their technical development sustainably. Macroalgae as a resource for biofuels production are very far from being a commercial reality, but do present some advantages such, for green algae, exhibiting several similarities with current G1 and G2 feedstock, being producers of starch and unlignified cellulose. Nevertheless, they also contain other specific compounds. Red and brown macroalgae are currently the most produced species, but their composition calls for the development of new transformation processes. Although technically feasible at lab-scale, the economic viability of such processes is being endangered by the complexity of the processes involved and the numerous steps required as well as by non-technical issues such as competition with other markets like green chemistry. To have a true share of the future fuel mix, macroalgae production needs to be increase by a dozentime fold. This increase should not be done without social acceptance or at the expenses of the environment. This issue was adressed for microalgae, but data on macroalgae are currently lacking to be able to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on this very specific environment. There are also additional problems to be taken into account, such as the lack of legislation or conflicts of usage with existing sea activities for example. Potential for high tonnage production seems real, but the challenge is to federate existing actors and new ones to build a new agro-industry. As a conclusion, no true leveraging option, leading to significant breakthroughs has really emerged as a short term solution, but wide spaces for significant improvement could be envisaged and more laboratory and pilot works have to be achieved before being able to move to a higher scale, leading to the first step toward industrial production. © 2013, IFP Energies nouvelles.

AB  - We study the effects on the food price of introducing biofuels as a substitute for fossil fuel in the energy market. Energy is supplied by a price-leading oil cartel and a competitive fringe of farmers producing biofuel. Biofuel production shares a finite land resource with food production. A positive relationship results between energy and food prices. We establish that the equilibrium price of food will be growing as long as the oil stock is being depleted, and beyond if demand is growing. An analysis of the effects of the productivity of land use in either the food or the biofuel sectors is carried out. It is shown that, with a highly inelastic demand for food, an increase in the productivity of land in agriculture will decrease the price of food in the short-run, only to increase it in the long-run as the stock of fossil fuel is depleted. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Renewable Identification Number (RIN) system is a tracking mechanism that enforces the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard by monitoring obligated parties' compliance with the biofuel consumption mandates. This paper incorporates the RIN system into the design of a biofuel supply chain that addresses independent decisions of non-cooperative farmers, biofuel manufacturers, and blenders. Game-theoretic models are developed to examine the impacts of the RIN system on individual stakeholders' decisions (e.g., on farmland use, bio-refinery investment, biofuel production) and the competition between food and biofuel industries, in both a perfectly competitive scenario and a monopoly scenario. For the perfectly competitive scenario, Nash equilibrium can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. For the monopoly scenario, a bi-level Stackelberg leader-follower model is developed, from which we found that a rigid mandate on blenders may suppress the total biofuel production. To avoid such unintended consequences, a relaxed unit-RIN based penalty scheme is proposed and shown to improve the overall biofuel supply chain performance. Managerial insights are drawn from a numerical case study for the state of Illinois. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is a key driver of the accelerating environmental change affecting populations around the world. Many of these changes and our response to them can affect respiratory health. This is an expert opinion review of recent peer-reviewed literature, focused on more recent medical journals and climate-health relevant modeling results from non-biomedical journals pertaining to climate interactions with air pollution. Global health impacts in low resource countries and migration precipitated by environmental change are addressed. The major findings are of respiratory health effects related to heat, air pollution, shifts in infectious diseases and allergens, flooding, water, food security and migration. The review concludes with knowledge gaps and research need that will support the evidence-base required to address the challenges ahead. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a goal that one billion gallons of renewable jet fuel is consumed by the US aviation industry each year from 2018. We examine the economic and emissions impacts of this goal using renewable fuel produced from a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process from renewable oils. Our approach employs an economy-wide model of economic activity and energy systems and a detailed partial equilibrium model of the aviation industry. If soybean oil is used as a feedstock, we find that meeting the aviation biofuel goal in 2020 will require an implicit subsidy from airlines to biofuel producers of $2.69 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. If the aviation goal can be met by fuel from oilseed rotation crops grown on otherwise fallow land, the implicit subsidy is $0.35 per gallon of renewable jet fuel. As commercial aviation biofuel consumption represents less than 2% of total fuel used by this industry, the goal has a small impact on the average price of jet fuel and carbon dioxide emissions. We also find that, under the pathways we examine, the cost per tonne of CO2 abated due to aviation biofuels is between $50 and $400. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The world contains abundant energy resources. The challenge is extracting and utilizing these resources affordably, in an environmentally responsible way, and in a dense enough form to be useful to humans. The link between energy, the environment, and the economy is unavoidable and involves the geosciences at its core. Carbon-based fuels such as wood, hay, and coal powered human society for millennia. Then, in the early twentieth century, petroleum in various refined forms came into use for lighting, heating, and early combustion engines. Today, fossil fuels-coal, petroleum products, and natural gas-represent an important 85% of the global energy mix, but they are not without challenges. Coal's greatest challenges are environmental: the impact of surface mining; water contamination; discharge of airborne pollutants including sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury; and the emission of CO 2 . The emerging technologies of carbon capture and sequestration may offer the prospect of solving one of coal's problems; large, stationary sources of CO 2 (such as coal-fired power plants) are the most efficient targets for carbon capture. However, capturing CO 2 is expensive. Oil and, to a much lesser degree, natural gas also produce CO 2 and other emissions when combusted. Oil and natural gas require drilling, entailing the associated environmental impacts of oil-field operations; yet there remain considerable global oil and natural gas resources. The current frontiers for conventional oil and natural gas production include ultra-deep water, the Arctic, sediments deposited beneath major salt formations, and other extreme operational environments. As existing and new conventional oil and natural gas reserves decline, unconventional reservoirs-shale gas, coal bed natural gas, tight gas, shale oil, oil shale, oil sands, and perhaps eventually natural gas hydrates-will represent a growing part of the fossil-fuel mix. Nuclear energy-today fission, and tomorrow, perhaps, fusion-is very dense, has no emissions, is highly efficient, and is very affordable on a kilowatt-hour basis. Adoption of nuclear energy is limited by the high initial cost of building a power plant, public perception, issues of waste handling, the fear of proliferation, and the very real need to make reactors safe from natural and human-caused disasters. "Renewable" forms of energy-those that are generated by "renewable" motion such as wind and moving water; or "renewable" sources of heat such as geothermal and solar; or those that are grown such as biofuels-will increase as a proportion of the energy mix. These sources are currently limited in growth rate by their lower energy density and, for some, their intermittency. Intermittency-the wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine-must be addressed by significant improvements in energy storage technologies: in chemical batteries; as pumped water or compressed air; as heat stored in molten salt, buildings, and other forms; as kinetic energy in fly wheels; as electrons in advanced capacitors; or by various other technologies. But these energy storage technologies need to be made efficient, affordable, and scalable before they will be deployed broadly. Because the transition from a fossil-energy present to an alternate-energy future involves the interplay between energy, environment, economy, and policy, almost without exception all forms of energy involve the geosciences. Coal mining requires geologic understanding. Large-scale geologic carbon sequestration, which might someday make coal more environmentally friendly, will rely on a whole new discipline involving advanced subsurface characterization and monitoring. The subsurface understanding and technology required for conventional and unconventional oil and gas exploration and extraction are substantial. From the scale of nanopores to tectonic plates, the use of advanced seismic imaging, ever more-quantified field and laboratory experimentation, airborne remote sensing, and much more is required to unlock the fossil-fuel resources that remain trapped in the Earth. Nuclear energy relies on sources of uranium, plutonium, thorium, and many other mined products. And eventually, geologic repositories will be required to store the waste products of nuclear power generation. In terms of renewable energy, production of biofuels involves soil science, hydrogeology, fertilizers, weather, and climate. Harnessing geothermal energy involves the ability to characterize the subsurface geothermal resource. Generating power from tides and waves involves oceanography and analysis of coastal change. Utilizing wind depends on weather pattern studies and geomorphology for the siting of turbines, as well as the mining of copper, carbon, and other materials. Producing solar energy involves the geosciences, with the need for silicon, gallium, cadmium, copper, and other materials. As large-scale energy-storage solutions become necessary, input from the geosciences will range from characterizing the subsurface for compressed-air storage to mining rare-earth elements for chemical batteries. The involvement of geosciences in energy does not stop with subsurface understanding or the construction of a power plant. "Above-ground" environmental and policy challenges covering the full lifecycle of any form of energy are as great as the "below-ground" technical challenges. Environmental geologists, biologists, energy economists, and policymakers must come together to develop sensible policies and regulatory rules that make it possible for industry, government, academe, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to work together to deliver balanced solutions. © 2013 The Geological Society of America.

AB  - Local and regional land use changes, such as the expansion of cropland for cellulosic biofuels, and the population density of white-tailed deer can affect the health and body mass of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. We collected hunterharvest data for 1,731 white-tailed deer from DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa from 2003 to 2010. We used linear mixed-effects models and information theoretic methods to estimate effects of density of white-tailed deer and proportion of total landcover area converted from cropland to cool-or warm-season grassland on body mass of white-tailed deer. Density of white-tailed deer at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge ranged from 36.5 to 50.6 deer/km2, and the proportion of landcover at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge that remained cropland each year ranged from 14.9 to 23.2%. Body mass was inversely related to population density (21.4 kg/5.5 deer/km2) and proportion of cropland (21.3 kg/3.1% conversion of total land area from cropland to grassland). We used auxiliary harvest data collected at Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge to validate our models and found our models performed well. We estimate densities of white-tailed deer must be reduced by 1.7 (SE = 0.6) deer/km2 for every 1% change in total landcover from cropland to grassland in order for white-tailed deer to maintain body mass. Our results indicate increased harvest of white-tailed deer, resulting in a reduction in population density, may offset negative effects that a decline in the amount of available cropland could have on the body mass and health of white-tailed deer.

AB  - There has been great attention focused on the effects of first and second generation biofuels on global warming. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) have mandated production levels and performance criteria of biofuels in the United States. The thermochemical conversion of biomass to ethanol shows potential as a biofuel production pathway. The objective of this research was to examine the alcohol yields and GHG emissions from the thermochemical conversion process for six different feedstocks on a gate-to-gate basis. GHG analyses and life cycle assessments were performed for natural hardwood, loblolly pine, eucalyptus, miscanthus, corn stover, and switchgrass feedstocks using a NREL thermochemical model and SimaPro. Alcohol yield and GHG emission for the hybrid poplar baseline feedstock conversion were 105,400 L dry metric ton-1 and 2.8 kg CO2 eq. per liter, respectively. Compared with the baseline, loblolly pine produced the highest alcohol yields, an 8.5% increase, and the lowest GHG emissions per liter of ethanol, a 9.1% decrease. Corn stover, due to its high ash content, had the lowest yields and the highest GHG emissions per liter of ethanol. The results were highly sensitive to the ash and water content of the biomass, indicating that biomass properties can significantly affect the environmental impact of the thermochemical ethanol conversion process.

AB  - The mangroves are among the most productive and biologically important environments. The possible presence of cellulolytic enzymes and microorganisms useful for biomass degradation as well as taxonomic and functional aspects of two Brazilian mangroves were evaluated using cultivation and metagenomic approaches. From a total of 296 microorganisms with visual differences in colony morphology and growth (including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungus), 179 (60.5%) and 117 (39.5%) were isolated from the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Bahia (BA) samples, respectively. RJ metagenome showed the higher number of microbial isolates, which is consistent with its most conserved state and higher diversity. The metagenomic sequencing data showed similar predominant bacterial phyla in the BA and RJ mangroves with an abundance of Proteobacteria (57.8% and 44.6%), Firmicutes (11% and 12.3%) and Actinobacteria (8.4% and 7.5%). A higher number of enzymes involved in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds were found in the BA mangrove. Specific sequences involved in the cellulolytic degradation, belonging to cellulases, hemicellulases, carbohydrate binding domains, dockerins and cohesins were identified, and it was possible to isolate cultivable fungi and bacteria related to biomass decomposition and with potential applications for the production of biofuels. These results showed that the mangroves possess all fundamental molecular tools required for building the cellulosome, which is required for the efficient degradation of cellulose material and sugar release. © Thompson et al.

AB  - This chapter describes the life cycle approach to energy chain analysis and the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA). Consequential LCA (cLCA) is discussed in comparison with attributional LCA (aLCA). The methodological approach of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is also presented. The methods, with emphasis on cLCA, are discussed in the context of improving the knowledge of unintended consequences from various forms of renewable energy. The chapter presents a series of examples where cLCA are used to predict in advance, unanticipated impacts of different forms of renewable energy technologies throughout their life cycle, with particularly focus on the impact of biofuels production. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a scenario optimization model to address weather uncertainty in the Biomass Supply Chain (BSC). The modeling objective was to minimize the cost of biomass supply to biorefineries over a one-year planning period using monthly time intervals under different weather scenarios. The model is capable of making strategic, tactical and operational decisions related to BSC system. The performance of the model was demonstrated through a case study developed for Abengoa biorefinery in Kansas. Sensitivity analysis was done to demonstrate the effect of input uncertainty in yield, land rent and storage dry matter loss on the model outputs. The model results show that available harvest work hours influence major cost-related decisions in the BSC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interplay between nitrogen fertilization (N), yield, nitrous oxide emissions (N2O), and diesel fuel utilization associated with harvest and transport logistics of biomass crops remains poorly understood. In this research, we show that intensification (in terms of N) of bioenergy cropping to maximize yield supports not only minimized land use but also maximized logistics efficiency in terms of diesel use. This paradigm was examined within the scope of the billion-ton biofuels vision and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 using potential yields on marginal and prime agricultural land. Sixteen scenarios were investigated that considered the primary factors with agriculture bioenergy; biomass yield (11.2 and 22.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1), two nitrogen fertilizer application rates (50 and 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1), two Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) factors for synthetic nitrogen to nitrous oxide (1.5 and 5%), and three harvest/transportation efficiencies (50, 65, and 80%). These scenarios resulted in energy consumption between 747 and 1351 MJ Mg-1 and GHGE between 72 and 311 kg CO2 eq Mg-1. GHGE emissions are strongly related to the emission of nitrous oxide from soils due to nitrogen fertilization and could represent over 80% of the GHGE relative to biomass harvest logistics. These data imply that synthetic N supplementation to maximize yield could reduce the burden due to diesel fuel for harvest, but would rapidly become the most significant contributor to GHGE. Minimizing the impact of N fertilization will be critical for reducing the GHGE associated with biomass production. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells are a promising technology for simultaneous treatment and energy recovery from food waste leachate. This study evaluates the effects of NaCl (0-150mM) and pH on the treatment of food waste leachate using microbial fuel cells. The food waste leachate amended with 100mM NaCl enabled the highest maximum power density (1000mW/m3) and lowest internal resistance (371Ω). Increasing the anodic pH gradually from acidic to alkaline conditions (pH 4-9) resulted in a gradual increase in maximum power density to 9956mW/m3 and decrease in internal cell resistance to 35.3Ω. The coulombic efficiency obtained under acidic conditions was only 17.8%, but increased significantly to 60.0% and 63.4% in the neutral and alkaline pH's MFCs, respectively. Maintaining a narrow pH window (6.3-7.6) was essential for efficient bioelectricity production and COD removal using microbial fuel cells for the treatment of food waste leachate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental consequences of using fossil fuels and concerns about petroleum supplies have spurred the search for renewable transportation biofuels. To solve global warming problems and ensure sustainable development of the economy, it is necessary to increase the use of renewable biomass resources. Biofuels have 2 faces: One pointing toward greenhouse gas reductions and the other toward increasing food insecurity, deforestation. The explosion in research on the production and subsequent use of biofuels has huge implications for science and future policy directions. The interdisciplinary nature of biofuels research makes the benefits open access to biologists, chemists, engineers, genomicists, and biotechnologists. Technologies to produce the first-generation liquid fuels, such as ethanol from starch and sugar and biodiesel from vegetable oils, are commercially installed. Systems integration and the integration of bioengineering with chemical engineering for cost-effective production is the road map to use second-generation fuels, such as cellulose ethanol, P-Series fuels, synthetic bio FT diesel and DME. Transportation biofuels, such as synfuel hydrocarbons or cellulosic ethanol, if produced from low-input biomass grown on agriculturally marginal land or from waste biomass, could provide much greater supplies and environmental benefits than food-based biofuels. The alternatives, like biofuels and hydrogen can be used in existing engine technologies and hydrogen can be efficiently used in upcoming technologies, such as fuel cells, which hold great potential in the forèseeable future. The biomass particularly appears to be an attractive alternative to hydrocarbons for producing both biofuels and hydrogen. © 2013 - Kalpana Corporation.

AB  - Large-scale conversion of traditional agricultural cropping systems to biofuel cropping systems is predicted to have significant impact on the hydrologic cycle. Changes in the hydrologic cycle lead to changes in rainfall and its erosive power, and consequently soil erosion that will have onsite impacts on soil quality and crop productivity, and offsite impacts on water quality and quantity. We examine regional change in rainfall erosivity and soil erosion resulting from biofuel policy-induced land use/land cover (LULC) change. Regional climate is simulated under current and biofuel LULC scenarios for the period 1979-2004 using the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model coupled to the NOAH land surface model. The magnitude of change in rainfall erosivity under the biofuel scenario is 1.5-3 times higher than the change in total annual rainfall. Over most of the conterminous United States (~56%), the magnitude of the change in erosivity is between -2.5% and +2.5%. A decrease in erosivity of magnitude 2.5-10% is predicted over 23% of the area, whereas an increase of the same magnitude is predicted over 14% of the area. Corresponding to the changes in rainfall erosivity and crop cover, a decrease in soil loss is predicted over 60% of the area under the biofuel scenario. In Kansas and Oklahoma, the states in which a large fraction of land area is planted with switchgrass under the biofuel scenario, soil loss is estimated to decrease 12% relative to the baseline. This reduction in soil loss is due more to changes in the crop cover factor than changes in rainfall or rainfall erosivity. This indicates that the changes in LULC, due to future cellulosic biofuel feedstock production, can have significant implications for regional soil and water resources in the United States and we recommend detailed investigation of the trade-offs between land use and management options. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Crops grown for bioenergy production are a mandated component of the United States energy portfolio. Giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) is a leading bioenergy crop similar in habit to the invasive plant giant reed (Arundo donax). To characterize the environmental tolerance of giant miscanthus, we compared the soil moisture stress tolerance of giant miscanthus and giant reed under glasshouse conditions. We subjected both species to soil moisture conditions of severe drought (-4.2 MPa), mild drought (-0.5 MPa), field-capacity (control), and flooded soils. These conditions were applied to two cohorts: one in which soil moisture conditions were imposed on newly planted rhizome fragments, and one in which conditions were imposed on established plants after 8 weeks of growth in field-capacity soil. After 16 weeks, we harvested all plants, measured above- and belowground biomass, and evaluated the reproductive viability of rhizome fragments. The total biomass of each species under flooded conditions was not different from the field-capacity control groups regardless of cohort. However, drought did affect the two cohorts differently. In the cohort treated after 8 weeks of growth, mild and severe drought conditions resulted in 56% and 66% reductions in biomass, averaged over both species, compared with the controls. In the cohort treated for the entire 16 weeks, mild and severe drought conditions resulted in 92% and 94% reductions in biomass. Rhizome fragments from both species and both cohorts showed 100% viability following flooded and control treatments; drought treatments reduced rhizome viability in both species, with a greater impact on giant miscanthus. Although giant miscanthus does not appear to have the potential to escape and establish in relatively dry upland ecosystems, it does show tolerance to flooded conditions similar to giant reed. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy crops are often classified (and subsequently regulated) according to species that have been evaluated as environmentally beneficial or detrimental, but in practice, management decisions rather than species per se can determine the overall environmental impact of a bioenergy production system. Here, we review the greenhouse gas balance and 'management swing potential' of seven different bioenergy cropping systems in temperate and tropical regions. Prior land use, harvesting techniques, harvest timing, and fertilization are among the key management considerations that can swing the greenhouse gas balance of bioenergy from positive to negative or the reverse. Although the management swing potential is substantial for many cropping systems, there are some species (e.g., soybean) that have such low bioenergy yield potentials that the environmental impact is unlikely to be reversed by management. High-yielding bioenergy crops (e.g., corn, sugarcane, Miscanthus, and fast-growing tree species), however, can be managed for environmental benefits or losses, suggesting that the bioenergy sector would be better informed by incorporating management-based evaluations into classifications of bioenergy feedstocks.

AB  - The European Commission has a mandate from the EU's Renewable Energy and Fuel Quality Directives to propose a methodology, consistent with the best available science, to address indirect land use change (iLUC). One proposed solution to the iLUC problem is the application of iLUC factors in European fuels policy - it is widely expected that should the EU adopt such iLUC factors, they would be based on iLUC modelling using the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) MIRAGE model. Taking the iLUC factors from IFPRI MIRAGE as our central estimate, we use Monte Carlo analysis on a simple model of potential biofuel pathways for Europe to assess the likely average carbon saving from three possible European biofuel policy scenarios: no action on iLUC; raised GHG thresholds for direct emissions savings; and the introduction of iLUC factors. We find that without iLUC factors (or some other effective iLUC minimization approach) European biofuel mandates are unlikely to deliver significant GHG emissions benefits in 2020, and have a substantial probability of increasing net GHG emissions. In contrast, the implementation of iLUC factors is likely to significantly increase the carbon savings from EU biofuel policy. With iLUC factors, it is likely that most permitted pathways would conform to the Renewable Energy Directive requirement for a minimum 50% GHG reduction compared to fossil fuels. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Worldwide demand for crops is increasing rapidly due to global population growth, increased biofuel production, and changing dietary preferences. Meeting these growing demands will be a substantial challenge that will tax the capability of our food system and prompt calls to dramatically boost global crop production. However, to increase food availability, we may also consider how the world's crops are allocated to different uses and whether it is possible to feed more people with current levels of crop production. Of particular interest are the uses of crops as animal feed and as biofuel feedstocks. Currently, 36% of the calories produced by the world's crops are being used for animal feed, and only 12% of those feed calories ultimately contribute to the human diet (as meat and other animal products). Additionally, human-edible calories used for biofuel production increased fourfold between the years 2000 and 2010, from 1% to 4%, representing a net reduction of available food globally. In this study, we re-examine agricultural productivity, going from using the standard definition of yield (in tonnes per hectare, or similar units) to using the number of people actually fed per hectare of cropland. We find that, given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people (more than the projected 2-3 billion people arriving through population growth). Even small shifts in our allocation of crops to animal feed and biofuels could significantly increase global food availability, and could be an instrumental tool in meeting the challenges of ensuring global food security. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Integrated assessment models suggest that the large-scale deployment of bioenergy could contribute to ambitious climate change mitigation efforts. However, such a shift would intensify the global competition for land, with possible consequences for 1.5 billion smallholder livelihoods that these models do not consider. Maintaining and enhancing robust livelihoods upon bioenergy deployment is an equally important sustainability goal that warrants greater attention. The social implications of biofuel production are complex, varied and place-specific, difficult to model, operationalize and quantify. However, a rapidly developing body of social science literature is advancing the understanding of these interactions. In this letter we link human geography research on the interaction between biofuel crops and livelihoods in developing countries to integrated assessments on biofuels. We review case-study research focused on first-generation biofuel crops to demonstrate that food, income, land and other assets such as health are key livelihood dimensions that can be impacted by such crops and we highlight how place-specific and global dynamics influence both aggregate and distributional outcomes across these livelihood dimensions. We argue that place-specific production models and land tenure regimes mediate livelihood outcomes, which are also in turn affected by global and regional markets and their resulting equilibrium dynamics. The place-specific perspective suggests that distributional consequences are a crucial complement to aggregate outcomes; this has not been given enough weight in comprehensive assessments to date. By narrowing the gap between place-specific case studies and global models, our discussion offers a route towards integrating livelihood and equity considerations into scenarios of future bioenergy deployment, thus contributing to a key challenge in sustainability sciences. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - While grain crops are meeting much of the initial need for biofuels in the US, cellulosic or second generation (2G) materials are mandated to provide a growing portion of biofuel feedstocks. We sought to inform development of a 2G crop portfolio by assessing the profitability of novel cropping systems that potentially mitigate the negative effects of grain-based biofuel crops on food supply and environmental quality. We analyzed farm-gate costs and returns of five systems from an ongoing experiment in central Iowa, USA. The continuous corn cropping system was most profitable under current market conditions, followed by a corn-soybean rotation that incorporated triticale as a 2G cover crop every third year, and a corn-switchgrass system. A novel triticale-hybrid aspen intercropping system had the highest yields over the long term, but could only surpass the profitability of the continuous corn system when biomass prices exceeded foreseeable market values. A triticale/sorghum double cropping system was deemed unviable. We perceive three ways 2G crops could become more cost competitive with grain crops: by (1) boosting yields through substantially greater investment in research and development, (2) increasing demand through substantially greater and sustained investment in new markets, and (3) developing new schemes to compensate farmers for environmental benefits associated with 2G crops. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are promising as sustainable alternative fuels, but lignin inhibits access of enzymes to cellulose, and by-products of lignin degradation can be toxic to cells. The fast growth, high efficiency and specificity of enzymes employed in the anaerobic litter deconstruction carried out by tropical soil bacteria make these organisms useful templates for improving biofuel production. The facultative anaerobe Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 was initially cultivated from Cloud Forest soils in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico, based on anaerobic growth on lignin as sole carbon source. The source of the isolate was tropical forest soils that decompose litter rapidly with low and fluctuating redox potentials, where bacteria using oxygen-independent enzymes likely play an important role in decomposition. We have used transcriptomics and proteomics to examine the observed increased growth of SCF1 grown on media amended with lignin compared to unamended growth. Proteomics suggested accelerated xylose uptake and metabolism under lignin-amended growth, with up-regulation of proteins involved in lignin degradation via the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pathway, catalase/peroxidase enzymes, and the glutathione biosynthesis and glutathione S-transferase (GST) proteins. We also observed increased production of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, other electron transport chain proteins, and ATP synthase and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This suggested the use of lignin as terminal electron acceptor. We detected significant lignin degradation over time by absorbance, and also used metabolomics to demonstrate moderately significant decreased xylose concentrations as well as increased metabolic products acetate and formate in stationary phase in lignin-amended compared to unamended growth conditions. Our data show the advantages of a multi-omics approach toward providing insights as to how lignin may be used in nature by microorganisms coping with poor carbon availability. © 2013 DeAngelis, Sharma, Varney, Simmons, Isern, Markillie, Nicora, Norbeck, Taylor, Aldrich and Robinson.

AB  - A major challenge for next decades is development of competitive renewable energy sources, highly needed to compensate fossil fuels reserves and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among different possibilities, which are currently under investigation, there is the exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and biodiesel in particular. Some algae species have the ability of accumulating large amount of lipids within their cells which can be exploited as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Strong research efforts are however still needed to fulfill this potential and optimize cultivation systems and biomass harvesting. Light provides the energy supporting algae growth and available radiation must be exploited with the highest possible efficiency to optimize productivity and make microalgae large scale cultivation energetically and economically sustainable. Investigation of the molecular bases influencing light use efficiency is thus seminal for the success of this biotechnology. In this work factors influencing light use efficiency in algal biomass production are reviewed, focusing on how algae genetic engineering and control of light environment within photobioreactors can improve the productivity of large scale cultivation systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Today, biofuels represent one of the most common options for larger scale substitution of conventional fuels. Due to the trans-sectoral nature of biofuels, a multitude of factors and actors determine the according policies of governments and the beliefs of societies. Especially since some impacts of biomass cultivation for bioenergy production are not yet fully understood. This article aims at showing the drivers that led to an introduction of biofuel policies in Germany and explains Germany's pioneering role in the promotion of bioenergy. Thereby the focus lies on the role of the main actors and their composition of so called discourse coalitions. The analysis indicates that the origin of the biofuel industry was a result of national and supranational market interventions, as well as it was intermittently an instrument of supporting renewable energies. Along the seesaw of Germany's biofuel policies seven discourse coalitions were identified who compete for discursive hegemony in order to gain political influence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sugarcane is one of Brazil's most important industries, mainly because of ethanol, one of its products. Ethanol has a low production cost and low GHG emissions per unit of energy produced, as compared to other fossil fuels. However, several authors have expressed concern about the high water consumption expected in the coming years for biofuel production. This work presents a proposal to reduce water consumption in the industrial stage, taking into account demand and supply quality restrictions. A water supply mix is suggested, with direct reuse of 648. L/t of cane, and another 176. L/t of cane covered indirectly by recycled streams. This reduces the required external withdrawal to 405. L/t of cane - a value within the limit mandated for the sugarcane industry in the State of Sao Paulo. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Microalgae are considered as potential sources for biodiesel production due to the higher growth rate than terrestrial plants. However, the large-scale application of algal biodiesel would be limited by the downstream cost of lipid extraction and the availability of water, CO2 and nutrients. A possible solution is to integrate algae cultivation with existing biogas plant, where algae can be cultivated using the discharges of CO2 and digestate as nutrient input, and then the attained biomass can be converted directly to biomethane by existing infrastructures. This integrated system is investigated and evaluated in this study. Algae are cultivated in a photobioreactor in a greenhouse, and two cultivation options (greenhouse with and without heating) are included. Life cycle assessment of the system was conducted, showing that algal biomethane production without greenhouse heating would have a net energy ratio of 1.54, which is slightly lower than that (1.78) of biomethane from ley crop. However, land requirement of the latter is approximately 68 times that of the former, because the area productivity of algae could reach at about 400t/ha (dry basis) in half a year, while the annual productivity of ley crop is only about 5.8t/ha. For the case of Växtkraft biogas plant in Västerås, Sweden, the integrated system has the potential to increase the annual biomethane output by 9.4%. This new process is very simple, which might have potential for scale-up and commercial application of algal bioenergy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biorefineries are small integrated plants aiming at the recovery of specific biomass wastes via their conversion to high-value biofuels and chemicals. Pyrolysis is among the promising technologies to achieve this goal. Three major factors influence the development of a pyrolysis process: the type of biomass, process operating conditions and choice of reactor technology. In this chapter, pyrolysis as a solution to sustain biorefineries is reviewed. The chapter first discusses the various biomass feedstocks and their important characteristics. Secondly, the pyrolysis concepts and kinetics are reviewed in light of their importance in process design and modelling. The chapter also discusses the influence of several process conditions and reactor technologies on pyrolysis reaction and pyrolysis products behaviour. Finally, strategies for product optimization and avoiding purity issues are analyzed. The emphasis of this chapter is put on technologies that have been developed at commercial scale. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Biodiesel has emerged as one of the most growing biofuels to replace diesel fuel. Its preference as one of the most popular alternative fuels was based on its characteristics as it is environment friendly, sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Biodiesel is mandated by many governments worldwide for incorporation into their diesel supply base. Biodiesel is easily produced through transesterification reactions of vegetable oils (triglycerides). However, current commercial usage of refined vegetable oils for biodiesel production is impractical and uneconomical due to high feedstock cost and priority as food resources. Low-grade oils, typically waste cooking oils, brown greases, crude corn oils, etc., can be better alternatives; however, the high free fatty acids (FFAs) content in such oils has become the main constrain for those potential feedstocks, and therefore pretreatment methods become necessary to prepare such feedstocks to make biodiesel. The chapter highlights the pretreatment methods to utilize and convert the FFAs from various feedstocks to biodiesel and presents the advantages and limitations of using enzymes and conventional catalysts, distillation, blending, and glycerolysis methods to lower FFAs in the feedstocks. An overview on the current status of biodiesel production, the feedstocks and the FFAs factors are also discussed. With the proper pretreatment methods, the high-FFAs feedstocks can indeed become the next ideal feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The carbon and environmental footprints associated with the global production of biofuels have been computed from a baseline of 2007-2009 out until 2019. Estimates of future global biofuel production were adopted from OECD-FAO and related projections. In order to determine the footprints associated with these (essentially '. first generation') biofuel resources, the overall environmental footprint was disaggregated into bioproductive land, built land, carbon, embodied energy, materials and waste, transport, and water components. The global carbon footprint of biofuels was estimated to be 0.248. billion (bn) global hectares (gha) in 2010; arising to 0.449. bn gha by 2019. The total environmental footprint for the global production of biofuels was estimated to be 0.720. billion gha for 2010; rising to 1.242. bn gha by 2019. Bioproductive land use proved to give rise to the highest element of the footprint, with the 'carbon footprint' as the next highest, followed by the water footprint, and then the transport component. The waste, built land, and embodied energy components contributed an insignificant amount to the total environmental footprint. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of ozonolysis on Miscanthus×. giganteus, Miscanthus sinensis 'Gracillimus', Saccharum arundinaceum and Saccharum ravennae, collectively referred to as 'energy grasses'. Studies were conducted at three different ozone concentrations (40, 50 and 58. mg/l) using two ozone flow configurations - uni-directional and reversed flow. Pretreatment conditions for each variety were optimized based on lignin content and glucan recovery in ozonated solids. Results showed that ozonolysis was effective in removing up to 59.9% lignin without cellulose degradation. However, subsequent hydrolysis of pretreated solids with Cellic® CTec2 at 0.06. g/g raw biomass provided glucan conversion lower than untreated samples suggesting enzyme inhibition by lignin degradation products formed during ozonolysis. Future studies investigating hydrolysis efficiency of washed pretreated solids with higher enzyme loadings are therefore warranted to optimize the hydrolysis process and make it functionally feasible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The extent of inhibition of two strains of Clostridium thermocellum by a Populus hydrolysate was investigated. A Monod-based model of wild type (WT) and Populus hydrolysate tolerant mutant (PM) strains of the cellulolytic bacterium C. thermocellum was developed to quantify growth kinetics in standard media and the extent of inhibition to a Populus hydrolysate. The PM was characterized by a higher growth rate (μmax=1.223 vs. 0.571h-1) and less inhibition (KI,gen=0.991 vs. 0.757) in 10% v/v Populus hydrolysate compared to the WT. In 17.5% v/v Populus hydrolysate inhibition of PM increased slightly (KI,gen=0.888), whereas the WT was strongly inhibited and did not grow in a reproducible manner. Of the individual inhibitors tested, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was the most inhibitory, followed by galacturonic acid. The PM did not have a greater ability to detoxify the hydrolysate than the WT. © 2013.

AB  - Harvesting of marine Chlorella sp. by autoflocculation and flocculation by addition of coagulant with pH adjustment was investigated in this study. Autoflocculation provided low efficiency. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the coagulant dosage and pH for flocculation. Aluminium sulfate and ferric chloride were investigated coagulants. The empirical models from RSM are in a good agreement with the experimental results. The optimum flocculation was achieved at ferric chloride dosage 143. mg/L, pH 8.1 and settling time 40. min. Biomass concentration also presented the significant effect on harvesting efficiency. Lipid extracted from marine Chlorella sp. cultivated in urea fertilizer medium with hexane as a solvent is suitable to produce biodiesel according to it contains high proportion of saturated fatty acids. The crude lipid should be purified to remove some impurities before making biodiesel. As the free fatty acid content was higher than 1% a two-step biodiesel production is recommended. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production using microalgae is attractive in a number of respects. Here a number of pros and cons to using microalgae for biofuels production are reviewed. Algal cultivation can be carried out using non-arable land and non-potable water with simple nutrient supply. In addition, algal biomass productivities are much higher than those of vascular plants and the extractable content of lipids that can be usefully converted to biodiesel, triacylglycerols (TAGs) can be much higher than that of the oil seeds now used for first generation biodiesel. On the other hand, practical, cost-effective production of biofuels from microalgae requires that a number of obstacles be overcome. These include the development of low-cost, effective growth systems, efficient and energy saving harvesting techniques, and methods for oil extraction and conversion that are environmentally benign and cost-effective. Promising recent advances in these areas are highlighted. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Deoxy-liquefaction of cotton seed in husk was carried out to produce hydrocarbon oil at different temperatures (400-500°C). Results indicated that at 450°C, the obtained oil had a maximum alkanes value of 49.58% with a low oxygen content (1.4%) resulting in the increase of HHV (43.8MJkg-1), whereas the oil contained considerable nitrogenous compounds. In the presence of γ-Al2O3-CuO catalyst, at 450°C nitrogen content in the oil dropped 20%, exhibiting the activity of catalysis for denitrification, when the content of alkanes rose to 54.91%; by vacuum distillation, the oil was then separated into light/heavy fractions which showed that they both possessed rich carbon and hydrogen with low oxygen contents. The light fractions were much the same as that of gasoline, while the heavy fractions were close to diesel, which laid the foundation of further treatment and applications. © 2013 .

AB  - Biofuels are promoted worldwide as an alternative to partially replace fossil fuels. After more than a decade of implementation, important questions have been raised concerning: i) the impacts generated by the change of use and land coverage; ii) the impacts on prices and food production, iii) the impacts on water and the related ecosystem services, and iv) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the changes of land use. This article discusses these issues in the current situation of biofuels with emphasis in the tropical countries. Available studies show that despite their small contribution to the world energy matrix, the large-scale expansion of biofuels can generate negative impacts such as increase in the competition for water and land, especially in the vulnerable ecosystem and social structures in tropical countries.

AB  - This chapter describes the physiology of kenaf from seed germination and root development till the effects of water and nutrients stress on grown plants. Review on kenaf agro-physiology of experiments carried out worldwide are presented and discussed mainly at the canopy and whole-plant level with the aim to help producers to make decisions and planning of production. However, few literature reports experimental results on the physiology of this multipurpose crop especially in terms of assimilation rate and its relation with environmental and agronomic factors. Knowledge on gas exchange rate and stomatal conductance may be a key support in understanding the physiology of Kenaf in terms of water requirements, its ability of light conversion into carbonaceous molecules influencing crop production potential and, indirectly, the carbon sequestration activity. In kenaf seedling development takes place when temperatures are higher than 10 °C, supporting the idea that kenaf is a macrothermal plant and optimal sowing has to be carried out during spring-summer, depending on the area of cultivation. Kenaf is very sensitive to reduced soil water availability, however, under moderate water stress conditions the crop maintains root development while reducing final biomass yield. Recent studies from Greece and Italy showed that even though kenaf uses CO2, solar radiation, water, and nitrogen less efficiently than C4crops its assimilation rates can reach 50-58 kg of CO2ha-1h-1. However, great differences in terms of net photosynthesis have been reported by various authors, which may be related to the different environmental variables and agronomic managements during field and controlled experimental environments, such as air temperature, light intensity, water supply, nutrients availability, relative humidity, wind, cultivar, plant density, and soil type. Similar results were reported in the literature regarding stomatal conductance and transpiration rates. In experiments carried out during the night, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate determined water looses probably affecting the water requirement of the crop. Kenaf could be described as opportunistic in relation to water availability, with a high rate of stomatal conductance and transpiration when soil water is available but with markedly reduced leaf conductance and transpiration rate when water is limited. Extinction coefficient for light (KL) and nitrogen (KN), under water limited conditions, were found to be always smaller than under irrigated conditions, as a result of irregular adjustment of leaf orientation to incident radiation particularly during midday. Vertical Specific Leaf Nitrogen (SLN) distributions were found in canopies when leaf area index (LAI) was &gt;1.5. It was observed a strong association between SLN and PAR distributions in irrigated kenaf canopies. Due to its tropical origin, kenaf behaves as a short-day plant remaining vegetative until daylength falls below 12.9 or 12.45 h. Flowering of late-maturity cultivars is under photoperiodic control; conversely, photoperiod does not influence the flowering of early maturity cultivars. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) in kenaf is positively associated with specific leaf nitrogen. RUE decreased under water deficit and nitrogen supply. Water use efficiency (WUE) decreased as the level of irrigation increased. It was higher than other C3crops, but lower as compared to C4crops tested in the same environments. Information on nutrient use efficiency (NUE) for kenaf is scarce and not well quantified to date. Higher NUE values were reported for micronutrients than for macronutrients. This last characteristic needs further investigation, since improvement of NUE is an essential and challenging prerequisite for the expansion of bioenergy crop productions into less fertile soils and marginal lands. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.

AB  - Microalgae-based biodiesel has several benefits over other resources such as less land use, potential cultivation in non-fertile locations, faster growth and especially a high lipid-to-biodiesel yield. Nevertheless, the environmental and economic behavior for high scale production depends on several variables that must be addressed in the scale-up procedure. In this sense, rigorous modeling and multicriteria evaluation are performed in order to achieve optimal topology for third generation biodiesel production. Different scenarios and the most promising technologies tested at pilot scale are assessed. Besides, the sensitivity analysis allows the detection of key operating variables and assumptions that have a direct effect on the lipid content. The deviation of these variables may lead to an erroneous estimation of the scale-up performance of the technology reviewed in the microalgae-based biodiesel process. The modeling and evaluation of different scenarios of the harvesting, oil extraction and transesterification help to identify greener and cheaper alternatives. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pyrolytic and oxidative behaviour of the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (25DMF) has been studied in a range of experimental facilities in order to investigate the relatively unexplored combustion chemistry of the title species and to provide combustor relevant experimental data. The pyrolysis of 25DMF has been re-investigated in a shock tube using the single-pulse method for mixtures of 3% 25DMF in argon, at temperatures from 1200 to 1350. K, pressures from 2 to 2.5. atm and residence times of approximately 2. ms.Ignition delay times for mixtures of 0.75% 25DMF in argon have been measured at atmospheric pressure, temperatures of 1350-1800. K at equivalence ratios (φ) of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 along with auto-ignition measurements for stoichiometric fuel in air mixtures of 25DMF at 20 and 80. bar, from 820 to 1210. K.This is supplemented with an oxidative speciation study of 25DMF in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) from 770 to 1220. K, at 10.0. atm, residence times of 0.7. s and at φ= 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.Laminar burning velocities for 25DMF-air mixtures have been measured using the heat-flux method at unburnt gas temperatures of 298 and 358. K, at atmospheric pressure from φ= 0.6-1.6. These laminar burning velocity measurements highlight inconsistencies in the current literature data and provide a validation target for kinetic mechanisms.A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism containing 2768 reactions and 545 species has been simultaneously developed to describe the combustion of 25DMF under the experimental conditions described above. Numerical modelling results based on the mechanism can accurately reproduce the majority of the experimental data. At high temperatures, a hydrogen atom transfer reaction is found to be the dominant unimolecular decomposition pathway of 25DMF. The reactions of hydrogen atom with the fuel are also found to be important in predicting pyrolysis and ignition delay time experiments.Numerous proposals are made on the mechanism and kinetics of the previously unexplored intermediate temperature combustion pathways of 25DMF. Hydroxyl radical addition to the furan ring is highlighted as an important fuel consuming reaction, leading to the formation of methyl vinyl ketone and acetyl radical. The chemically activated recombination of HȮ2 or CH3Ȯ2 with the 5-methyl-2-furanylmethyl radical, forming a 5-methyl-2-furylmethanoxy radical and ȮH or CH3Ȯ radical is also found to exhibit significant control over ignition delay times, as well as being important reactions in the prediction of species profiles in a JSR. Kinetics for the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl side-chain of the fuel by molecular oxygen and. HȮ2 radical are found to be sensitive in the estimation of ignition delay times for fuel-air mixtures from temperatures of 820 to 1200. K.At intermediate temperatures, the resonantly stabilised 5-methyl-2-furanylmethyl radical is found to predominantly undergo bimolecular reactions, and as a result sub-mechanisms for 5-methyl-2-formylfuran and 5-methyl-2-ethylfuran, and their derivatives, have also been developed with consumption pathways proposed. This study is the first to attempt to simulate the combustion of these species in any detail, although future refinements are likely necessary.The current study illustrates both quantitatively and qualitatively the complex chemical behaviour of what is a high potential biofuel. Whilst the current work is the most comprehensive study on the oxidation of 25DMF in the literature to date, the mechanism cannot accurately reproduce laminar burning velocity measurements over a suitable range of unburnt gas temperatures, pressures and equivalence ratios, although discrepancies in the experimental literature data are highlighted. Resolving this issue should remain a focus of future work. © 2013 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Recent metabolic engineering practice was briefly reviewed including the case where a mixture of multiple sugars obtained from lignocellulose, etc. was used as a carbon source to produce a variety of biofuels and biochemicals for the realization of green society. In the wild type Escherichia coli, sequential utilization of carbon sources is observed as known as diauxie phenomenon due to carbon catabolite repression (CCR), where much attention has been focused on co-consumption of multiple sugars to improve the productivities of the target metabolites. Although co-consumption of multiple sugars can be attained by modulating phosphotransferase system (PTS) and mgsA, pgi, etc. in E. coli, the glucose uptake rate inherently became lower, and thus the productivity of such metabolite as ethanol may not be improved, where this may be improved by amplifying the non-PTS pathway genes such as galP and glk. It should be noted that the modulation of PTS gene might change the robustness from the systems biology point of view. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of pre-treatment methods on saccharification and hydrogen fermentation of Chlorella pyrenoidosa biomass were investigated. When raw biomass and biomass pre-treated by steam heating, by microwave heating, and by ultrasonication were used as feedstock, the hydrogen yields were only 8.8-12.7 ml/g total volatile solids (TVS) during dark fermentation. When biomass was pre-treated by steam heating with diluted acid and by microwave heating with diluted acid, the dark hydrogen yields significantly increased to 75.6 ml/g TVS and 83.3 ml/g TVS, respectively. Steam heating with diluted acid is the preferred pre-treatment method of C. pyrenoidosa biomass to improve hydrogen yield during dark fermentation and photofermentation, which is followed by methanogenesis to increase energy conversion efficiency (ECE). A total hydrogen yield of 198.3 ml/g TVS and a methane yield of 186.2 ml/g TVS corresponding to an overall ECE of 34.0% were obtained through the three-stage process (dark fermentation, photofermentation, and methanogenesis). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Emission modelling permits us to quantitatively assess the effects of emission abatement strategies. In urban areas, such strategies are designed mainly to reduce the emissions from the on-road traffic sector. This work analyses the impact of several mobility strategies on urban emissions in the coastal city of Barcelona, Spain, when the High Elective Resolution Modelling Emission System (HERMES) is applied at a very high resolution (1 km × 1 km and 1 h). The analysis was conducted by projecting the emissions data obtained from a base case scenario in 2004 onto three future scenarios set in 2015, where each future scenario represented a set of traffic mobility management measures. Specific developments were considered per emission sector, including power generation, industrial activities, domestic-commercial, solvents, on-road traffic, biogenic emissions, ports and airports, to best compare the present base case scenario with the future mobility scenarios generated for 2015. These emission scenarios for 2015 take into account the population projections and the variations in port and airport activities among other factors, while the main focus is on the on-road traffic sector, the types of vehicles used, such as technologically improved buses and hybrid vehicles, as well as the types of fuels used, including natural gas and biofuels. The results of the emission model indicate that the mobility management strategies, the technological improvements and the use of alternative fuels reduce the emissions from on-road traffic by approximately 75% (in terms of nitrogen oxides emission reductions in the city centre of Barcelona). This decrease leads to a 35% reduction in overall nitrogen oxides emissions, even if some sectors individually experience increases based on their specific projections. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Hybrid poplars have demonstrated high productivity as short rotation woody crops (SRWC) in the Midwest USA, and the hybrid aspen "Crandon" (Populus alba L. × P. grandidenta Michx.) has exhibited particularly promising yields on marginal lands. However, a key obstacle for wider deployment is the lack of economic returns early in the rotation. Alleycropping has the potential to address this issue, especially when paired with crops such as winter triticale which complete their growth cycle early in the summer and therefore are expected to exert minimal competition on establishing trees. In addition, well-placed fertilizer in low rates at planting has the potential to improve tree establishment and shorten the rotation, which is also economically desirable. To test the potential productivity of "Crandon" alleycropped with winter triticale, plots were established on five topographic positions with four different rates of fertilizer placed in the planting hole. Trees were then harvested from the plots after each of the first three growing seasons. Fertilization resulted in significant increases in branch, stem, and total aboveground biomass across all years, whereas the effects of topographic position varied by year. Allocation between branches and stems was found to be primarily a function of total aboveground biomass. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - A bioeconomy can be defined as an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources. This paper provides an overview of the bioeconomy in Europe, examining it from a policy framework and concept perspective. The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy is discussed particularly through biofuels for transport and biorefineries. The study finds that the definitions of the bioeconomy are evolving and vary depending on the actor, but display similarities such as the emphasis on economic output and a broad, cross-sectoral focus. While there is great optimism about the benefits and opportunities associated with developing an advanced bioeconomy in Europe, significant risks and trade-offs are also expressed. Furthermore, the bioeconomy concept has been criticised for presenting a technical fix and pre-empting alternative visions. To advance a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy, this paper calls for attention on two important themes: participatory governance that engages the general public and key stakeholders in an open and informed dialogue as well as a commitment by government and industry to innovation that drives concerted efforts on sustainable development of the bioeconomy. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - Strategies for sustainably using biofuels must be thoroughly assessed at several levels. First, the use of biofuels must comply with sustainable development's main dimensions. Second, the use of biofuels must comply with sustainable transport's main dimensions. Third, gains from using biofuels strategies must compare favorably to gains from other sustainable transport strategies, such as altering transport patterns and reducing transport volume. Fourth, the gains must compare favorably to gains from improving conventional fossil-fuel-based advanced vehicles. Fifth, the gains must compare favorably to gains from using other alternative fuels. Sixth, the gains from using one generation of biofuels (e.g., first generation) must compare favorably to gains from using others (e.g., second through fourth generations). Performing scientifically sound and fair comparisons demands reliable theoretical perspectives and a well-established methodological basis. Industrial ecology theory and life cycle assessment methodology, respectively, are well-suited for these tasks. ©2013 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgae have great potential as alternative productive platforms for sustainable production of bioenergy, food, feed and other commodities. Process optimization to realize the claimed potential often comprises strains selection and improvement and also developing of more efficient cultivation, harvesting and downstream processing technology. In this work we show that inoculation with the bacterium Rhizobium strain 10II resulted in increments of up to 30% in chlorophyll, biomass and lipids accumulation of the oleaginous microalgae Ankistrodesmus sp. strain SP2-15. Inoculated cultures have reached a high lipid productivity of up to 112mgL-1d-1 after optimization. The resulting biomass presented significant levels of Ω3 fatty acids including stearidonic acid, suggesting potential as an alternative land-based source of essential fatty acids. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Challenges to global food security are: (i) population increase from 7 billion in 2011 to 9.2 billion in 2050, (ii) climate change, (iii) soil degradation by erosion, salinization, organic matter and nutrient depletion, and elemental imbalance, (iv) decreased availability of water, (v) land competition for urbanization, brick making, biofuel, and non-agricultural uses, and (vi) preferences toward animal-based diet. Global hotspots food insecurity are South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Adopting concepts of ecohydrology, enhancing green water in the root zone, can create climate-resilient agriculture to advance food security and improve the environment. An effective governance is needed to implement policies which promote restorative land uses and recommended management practices. Furthermore, payments for ecosystem services may be a useful strategy to promote sustainable intensification of agriculture by resources-poor farmers. © 2013 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology.

AB  - Social sustainability of the palm biofuel industry stresses on the need to produce favorable social and distributional effects like employment, food security, conservation of cultures, equality in sharing between involving parties, technological advancement and training, etc., that would continue to benefit the future generation. The expansion of the oil palm biofuel industry in reaction to the climate change mitigation has necessitated the industry over social, environmental, and political sustainability of palm feedstocks production. Though the production of oil palm biomass and subsequent conversion into biofuels have positive social impacts, some research reports reveal the high rate of unemployment, homelessness and poverty among rural folks who are engaged in oil palm cultivation. This chapter outlines the factors that affect the socio-political sustainability of palm biofuels where real situations on the ground are discussed and suggestions made. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - The oil palm presents a comparatively advantageous source of feedstock for biofuels production compared to other first-generation biofuel feedstocks. Among the sources of feedstocks for biofuel production currently available and developed in the world, the oil palm is the prime option which fulfills the sustainability criteria for high productivity, efficiency, competitive price discounts, and above all it is cost effective. Biofuels produced from oil palm biomass would be considered sustainable only when all the production chains from oil palm cultivation to biofuels production (including the production of input materials and energy) are within the acceptable production criteria for sustainable oil palm and biofuels developments. In order for the oil palm industry to fully accomplish the objectives of sustainable oil palm biofuels production, Malaysia and Indonesia are currently ensuring the implementation of stringent sustainability standards via best management practices especially for the production of palm biofuels so as to improve yield and reduce the amount of input resources. This chapter highlights on some best management practices involving globally accepted initiatives for sustainable oil palm agriculture, palm oil milling, and refining as well as different production routes to palm biofuels production. Integration of different production routes for various types of palm biofuels through effective utilization of wastes for sustainable development are also elaborated in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Algae biodiesel is a promising but expensive alternative fuel to petro-diesel. To overcome cost barriers, detailed cost analyses are needed. A decade-old cost analysis by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated that the costs of algae biodiesel were in the range of $0.53-0.85/L (2012 USD values). However, the cost of land and transesterification were just roughly estimated. In this study, an updated comprehensive techno-economic analysis was conducted with optimized processes and improved cost estimations. Latest process improvement, quotes from vendors, government databases, and other relevant data sources were used to calculate the updated algal biodiesel costs, and the final costs of biodiesel are in the range of $0.42-0.97/L. Additional improvements on cost-effective biodiesel production around the globe to cultivate algae was also recommended. Overall, the calculated costs seem promising, suggesting that a single step biodiesel production process is close to commercial reality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of palm biofuels provides the prospects for new economic opportunities for most people in rural communities in developing countries. Oil palm cultivation and palm oil milling provide wide avenues for people in terms of job creation, investment opportunities, etc. In spite of all the benefits of palm biofuels, they are also found to cause negative socio-economic impacts to the society. The economic impacts of oil palm and palm biofuels production are elaborated in this chapter. Oil palm biomass is a cheap source of feedstock for palm biofuels compared to other feedstocks used for biofuel production. In this chapter, biodiesel production from palm oil and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) are found to be economically viable compared to fossil diesel and biodiesel from other oils. Bioethanol and biomethanol production from oil palm biomass are also found to be cost competitive compared to gasoline and other cellulosic ethanol. Other potential types of palm biofuels are assessed for economic sustainability and improvement options are also suggested in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

However, due to the fall in revenues in the sales of sugar, the land area under cane cultivation is decreasing as well as the amount of electricity produced by bagasse. In order to enhance the sustainability of the cane industry, the use of sugar cane with higher percentage of fibre content is being investigated for increasing the production of bagasse and thus cogenerated electricity. Policy implications are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the aim of minimizing the dependency on fossil fuels whilst improving the economic viability and environmental performances of oil palm production for biofuels production, emission control from these systems become invincible. However, with best management practices couples with stringent adherence to basic environmental sustainability principles, these hurdles may be surmounted. The environmental sustainability dimension of impact assessment for this chapter is based on life cycle assessment for common palm biofuels like biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-methanol via BtL route, biogas and bio-electricity from oil palm biomass. Possible improvement options are also outlined in this chapter to ensure more positive energy balance and almost zero emissions from each of the biofuels production systems considered. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2013.

AB  - Oil dependency and global warming have stimulated R&D activities on the utilization of secondary biofuels. This article investigates the suitability of coconut shell-derived producer gas (a secondary gaseous biofuel) as a substitute for coal gas from an environmental perspective using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Thermochemical gasification in an air-fluidized bed with steam injection is the gaseous fuel production process. LCA is carried out with respect to Indian conditions based on primary and modified Ecoinvent 2.0 data using IMPACT 2002+ environmental impact assessment methodology. The study indicates that coconut shell-derived producer gas life cycle is capable of saving 18.3% of emissions causing global warming potential, 64.1% of emissions causing ozone depletion potential, and 71.5% of nonrenewable energy consumption. The analysis of energy and exergy consumptions of the two life cycles reveal that the renewable fraction in the total energy demand is 62.9% for producer gas life cycle, while it is only 2.8% for coal gas life cycle. Allocation of the by-product, coconut palm residues, is the major responsible factor for this reduction in environmental burden. Based on the existing fertilization practice and the utilization of electricity from the Indian electric grid, substantial green house gas (GHG) emission savings cannot be achieved for producer gas life cycle over coal gas life cycle. However, the green electricity-aided catalytic gasification of coconut shell produced by organic farming can result in 43.4% reduction in GHG emissions, meeting European Union renewable energy directive. © 2013 Sreejith et al.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have evaluated the land use consequences of biofuel programs and the associated carbon fluxes. However, all of these studies have effectively ignored the distinction between rainfed and irrigated lands and neglected the facts that irrigated croplands typically have much higher yields than their rainfed counterparts in the same region and that expansion in irrigated crops are limited in some regions due to water scarcity and irrigation constraint. This paper shows that these omissions introduce systematic biases in the measurement of biofuel-induced land use change emissions. Methods: A new computable general equilibrium model which distinguishes irrigated and rainfed agriculture is developed. The new model is an enhanced version of the publicly available Global Trade Analysis Project model with Biofuels (GTAP-BIO) which has been widely used in this field frequently. To distinguish irrigated and rainfed agriculture, the biophysical component of the GTAP-BIO model is extensively modified using the most recent published data in this area. The economic component of the model is also modified to handle the distinction between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Results: We find that ignoring the irrigated-rainfed distinction modestly underestimates global land use change, but results in sharply different geographic patterns of cropland expansion, with stronger rainfed expansion in more carbon-rich environments. This points to a significant underestimate of land use emissions in earlier studies. Conclusions: To provide more accurate estimates of biofuel-induced land use emissions, it is critical to incorporate the role of irrigation in crop production, taking into account the fact that expansion in irrigation is constrained in some regions across the world. © 2013 Taheripour et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - The physical surface of the Earth is in constant change due to climate forcing and human activities. In the Midwestern United States, urban area, farmland, and dedicated energy crop (e.g., switchgrass) cultivation are predicted to expand in the coming decades, which will lead to changes in hydrological processes. This study is designed to (1) project the land use and land cover (LULC) by mid-century using the FORecasting SCEnarios of future land-use (FORE-SCE) model under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario (future condition) and (2) assess its potential impacts on the water cycle and water quality against the 2001 baseline condition in the Cedar River Basin using the physically based soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). We compared the baseline LULC (National Land Cover data 2001) and 2050 projection, indicating substantial expansions of urban area and pastureland (including the cultivation of bioenergy crops) and a decrease in rangeland. We then used the above two LULC maps as the input data to drive the SWAT model, keeping other input data (e.g., climate) unchanged to isolate the LULC change impacts. The modeling results indicate that quick-response surface runoff would increase significantly (about 10.5%) due to the projected urban expansion (i.e., increase in impervious areas), and the baseflow would decrease substantially (about 7.3%) because of the reduced infiltration. Although the net effect may cause an increase in water yield, the increased variability may impede its use for public supply. Additionally, the cultivation of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass in the newly added pasture lands may further reduce the soil water content and lead to an increase in nitrogen loading (about 2.5% increase) due to intensified fertilizer application. These study results will be informative to decision makers for sustainable water resource management when facing LULC change and an increasing demand for biofuel production in this area. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are expected to be a major contributor to renewable energy in the coming decades under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). These fuels have many attractive properties including the promotion of energy independence, rural development, and the reduction of national carbon emissions. However, several unresolved environmental and economic concerns remain. Environmentally, much of the biomass is expected to come from agricultural expansion and/or intensification, which may greatly affect the net environmental impact, and economically, the lack of a developed infrastructure and bottlenecks along the supply chain may affect the industry's economic vitality. The approximately 30 million acres (12 million hectares) under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) represent one land base for possible expansion. Here, we examine the potential role of the CRP in biofuels industry development, by (1) assessing the range of environmental effects on six end points of concern, and (2) simulating differences in potential industry growth nationally using a systems dynamics model. The model examines seven land-use scenarios (various percentages of CRP cultivation for biofuel) and five economic scenarios (subsidy schemes) to explore the benefits of using the CRP. The environmental assessment revealed wide variation in potential impacts. Lignocellulosic feedstocks had the greatest potential to improve the environmental condition relative to row crops, but the most plausible impacts were considered to be neutral or slightly negative. Model simulations revealed that industry growth was much more sensitive to economic scenarios than land-use scenarios - similar volumes of biofuels could be produced with no CRP as with 100% utilization. The range of responses to economic policy was substantial, including long-term market stagnation at current levels of first-generation biofuels under minimal policy intervention, or RFS-scale quantities of biofuels if policy or market conditions were more favorable. In total, the combination of the environmental assessment and the supply chain model suggests that large-scale conversion of the CRP to row crops would likely incur a significant environmental cost, without a concomitant benefit in terms of biofuel production. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The absence of a globally-consistent and binding commitment to reducing greenhouse emissions provides a rationale for partial policies, such as renewable energy mandates, product emission standards, etc to target lifecycle emissions of the regulated products or services. While appealing in principle, regulation of lifecycle emissions presents several practical challenges. Using biofuels as an illustrative example, we highlight some outstanding issues in the design and implementation of life cycle-based policies and discuss potential remedies. We review the literature on emissions due to price effects in fuel markets, which are akin to emissions due to indirect land use change, but are, unlike the latter, ignored under all current life cycle emissions-based regulations. We distinguish the current approaches to regulating indirect emissions into hard and soft approaches and discuss their implications. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We assess the potential for future biodiversity loss due to three interacting factors: energy withdrawal from ecosystems due to biomass harvest, habitat loss due to land-use change, and climate change. We develop four scenarios to 2050 with different combinations of high or low agricultural efficiency and high or low meat diets, and use species-energy and species-area relationships to estimate their effects on biodiversity. In our scenarios, natural ecosystems are protected except when additional land is necessary to fulfil the increasing dietary demands of the global population. Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is used as a means of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (and offsetting fossil fuel emissions). BECCS is based on waste biomass, with the addition of bio-energy crops only when already managed land is no longer needed for food production. Forecast biodiversity loss from natural biomes increases by more than a factor of five in going from high to low agricultural efficiency scenarios, due to destruction of productive habitats by the expansion of pasture. Biodiversity loss from energy withdrawal on managed land varies by a factor of two across the scenarios. Biodiversity loss due to climate change varies only modestly across the scenarios. Climate change is lowest in the 'low meat high efficiency' scenario, in which by 2050 around 660 million hectares of pasture are converted to biomass plantation that is used for BECCS. However, the resulting withdrawal of energy from managed ecosystems has a large negative impact on biodiversity. Although the effects of energy withdrawal and climate change on biodiversity cannot be directly compared, this suggests that using bio-energy to tackle climate change in order to limit biodiversity loss could instead have the opposite effect. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Second generation ethanol bioconversion technologies are under demonstration-scale development for the production of lignocellulosic fuels to meet the US federal Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS2). Bioconversion technology utilizes the fermentable sugars generated from the cellulosic fraction of the feedstock, and most commonly assumes that the lignin fraction may be used as a source of thermal and electrical energy. We examine the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and techno-economic cost tradeoffs for alternative uses of the lignin fraction of agricultural residues (corn stover, and wheat and barley straw) produced within a 2000 dry metric ton per day ethanol biorefinery in three locations in the United States. We compare three scenarios in which the lignin is (1) used as a land amendment to replace soil organic carbon (SOC); (2) separated, dried and sold as a coal substitute to produce electricity; and (3) used to produce electricity onsite at the biorefinery. Results from this analysis indicate that for life cycle GHG intensity, amending the lignin to land is lowest among the three ethanol production options (-25 to -2 g CO 2e MJ-1), substituting coal with lignin is second lowest (4-32 g CO2e MJ-1), and onsite power generation is highest (36-41 g CO2e MJ-1). Moreover, the onsite power generation case may not meet RFS2 cellulosic fuel requirements given the uncertainty in electricity substitution. Options that use lignin for energy do so at the expense of SOC loss. The lignin-land amendment option has the lowest capital cost among the three options due to lower equipment costs for the biorefinery's thermal energy needs and use of biogas generated onsite. The need to purchase electricity and uncertain market value of the lignin-land amendment could raise its cost compared to onsite power generation and electricity co-production. However, assuming a market value ($50-$100/dry Mg) for nutrient and soil carbon replacement in agricultural soils, and potentially economy of scale residue collection prices at higher collection volumes associated with low SOC loss, the lignin-land amendment option is economically and environmentally preferable, with the lowest GHG abatement costs relative to gasoline among the three lignin co-product options we consider. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The cultivation of Miscanthus sinensis x giganteus on a polluted soil near Copsa Mica - Romania has started in 2008. Since then every March and August the roots and stems have been analyzed, showing a very low amount of heavy metals in the aerial parts in February, when the harvesting takes place. The combustion properties of the material are similar to those of lignite, but without sulphur and with low ash amount. Because cultivation of edible plants poses the risk of heavy metal entering into the food chain, and soil remediation is unlikely, the cultivation of this plant and its subsequent usage as biofuel could become a feasible solution for the sustainable use of the soils polluted with Cd and Pb.

AB  - Access to affordable and renewable sources of energy is crucial to reducing poverty and enhancing rural development in countries of the global South. Straight vegetable oil was recently identified as a possible alternative to conventional biomass for rural energy supply. In this context, the Jatropha curcas Linn. species has been extensively investigated with regard to its potential as a biofuel feedstock. In contrast, only little is known about Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, which is an indigenous and endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential and suitability of J. mahafalensis as a biofuel feedstock. Seed samples were collected in the area of Soalara in south-western Madagascar in February and September 2011. Two agro-ecological zones (coastal area and calcareous plateau) and two plant age groups (below and above 10. years) were considered. These four sample groups were analyzed with regard to oil properties, element contents, and fatty acid profiles. Measured values differed greatly between the two harvests, probably owing to different climatic or storage conditions. No direct relation between age of trees or location and oil quality could be established. The analyses indicate that J. mahafalensis oil can be used in oil lamps, cooking stoves and stationary combustion engines for electrification or for biodiesel production. However, modifications in storage and extraction methods, as well as further processing steps are necessary to enable its utilization as a straight vegetable oil and feedstock for biodiesel production. If these technical requirements can be met, and if it turns out that J. mahafalensis oil is economically competitive in comparison with firewood, charcoal, paraffin and petroleum, it can be considered as a promising feedstock for rural energy supply. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) are a promising means to enhance the EU renewable energy sources while mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there are concerns that the GHG mitigation potential of bioelectricity may be nullified due to GHG emissions from direct land use changes (dLUCs). In order to evaluate quantitatively the GHG mitigation potential of bioelectricity from SRWC we managed an operational SRWC plantation (18.4ha) for bioelectricity production on a former agricultural land without supplemental irrigation or fertilization. We traced back to the primary energy level all farm labor, materials, and fossil fuel inputs to the bioelectricity production. We also sampled soil carbon and monitored fluxes of GHGs between the SRWC plantation and the atmosphere. We found that bioelectricity from SRWCs was energy efficient and yielded 200-227% more energy than required to produce it over a two-year rotation. The associated land requirement was 0.9m2kWhe-1 for the gasification and 1.1m2kWhe-1 for the combustion technology. Converting agricultural land into the SRWC plantation released 2.8 ± 0.2tCO2eha-1, which represented ~89% of the total GHG emissions (256-272gCO2ekWhe-1) of bioelectricity production. Despite its high share of the total GHG emissions, dLUC did not negate the GHG benefits of bioelectricity. Indeed, the GHG savings of bioelectricity relative to the EU non-renewable grid mix power ranged between 52% and 54%. SRWC on agricultural lands with low soil organic carbon stocks are encouraging prospects for sustainable production of renewable energy with significant climate benefits. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Twenty four accessions of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) were planted on a degraded sodic land in Lucknow, India, in which growth and yield traits were measured over five years (2006-2010). There was a large variation in growth and yield among these accessions, and the average seed yield (118 g plant -1) and oil content (30%) of JCL on the sodic land were sufficiently low to make it an economically feasible venture for biofuel production. The seed:fruit, kernel:seed ratios and the 100 seed test weight were also measured. In order to make it an economically viable proposition, some preliminary screening were done to assort the superior accessions (CSMCRI-C1, NBPGR-Urlikanchan, NBPGR-Chhatrapati, and NBPGR-Hansraj), on the basis of growth and yield traits, that have attained an average height of 264.6-344.6 cm, with an 8.5- to 10-cm collar diameter, 41-57 branches per plant, a 209- to 290-cm canopy spread, a 178-246 g plant-1 seed yield, and a 27-38% oil content at five years. Though they do not correlate well between growth/yield and gas exchange parameters (photosynthetic rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency), even then these markers are useful to screen out a large number of accessions at an early stage before the yield starts or stabilizes to increase the land use efficiency. The changes in soil properties after five years of the plantations showed reduction in soil pH and electrical conductivity, with a parallel increase in organic carbon, organic nitrogen, microbial biomass, and dehydrogenase activity, indicating that JCL had a modest ability to reclaim the sodic soils. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper provides an assessment of first generation biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) development in Thailand in terms of feedstock used, production trends, planned targets and policies and discusses the biofuel sustainability issues-environmental, socio-economic and food security aspects. The policies, measures and incentives for the development of biofuel include targets, blending mandates and favorable tax schemes to encourage production and consumption of biofuels. Biofuel development improves energy security, rural income and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but issues related to land and water use and food security are important considerations to be addressed for its large scale application. Second generation biofuels derived from agricultural residues perform favorably on environmental and social sustainability issues in comparison to first generation biofuel sources. The authors estimate that sustainably-derived agricultural crop residues alone could amount to 10.4 × 106 bone dry tonnes per year. This has the technical potential of producing 1.14-3.12 billion liters per year of ethanol to possibly displace between 25%-69% of Thailand's 2011 gasoline consumption as transportation fuel. Alternatively, the same amount of residue could provide 0.8-2.1 billion liters per year of diesel (biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel) to potentially offset 6%-15% of national diesel consumption in the transportation sector. © 2013 by the authors.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper was to carry out a systematic analysis of the particularities and trends pertaining to the development of biofuels in Brazil-a country which has demonstrated its leadership in this field during the last 40 years. The Brazilian experiences with biofuels are often used as references for decision making by other developed and developing countries. The transferability of Brazil's biofuels practices would be appreciated by many researchers and energy policy markers across the world. This work uses an adapted 5W2H (what, when, where, why, who, how, and how much) analysis technique to answer a variety of questions about the subject. The data, facts, and figures herein are offered as resources for other researchers and policy makers seeking benchmarking. Also, this work discusses the main certainties and uncertainties of the sugarcane agro-industry, and also goes into detail about the ethanol supply chain structure, its management, and particularities. Finally, this research analyzes the central aspects of biofuels implementation in Brazil, lists the most important aspects to consider during a selection of possible standard biofuels, and presents the main aspects of the National Program of Biodiesel Production and its sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The colonial unicellular freshwater green alga Botryococcus braunii has recently attracted attention from the biofuel industry because of its unique traits to biosynthesize extraordinarily large amounts of hydrocarbon oils resembling petroleum constituents and to accumulate the oils within the colony. The purpose of this study was to evaluate B. braunii in terms of codon compatibility with other organisms in view of genetic engineering applications. Here, GC contents and codon usage were compared among three strains of B. braunii (BOT-88-2, BOT-22, and BOT-70), three other species of Chlorophyta (green algae), five species of the Streptophyta (land plants), and eight species of other phyla including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and mammals. Interestingly, B. braunii exhibited GC contents remarkably lower than the other Chlorophyta species and it also had an unbiased codon usage unlike other green microalgae. Codon usage of B. braunii rather resembled bacteria, animals, and land plants. our results indicated that genes derived from various nonmicroalgal species could readily be expressed in B. braunii with relatively minor codon usage optimization, and vice versa.

AB  - Development of biofuel serves for a range of objectives including increased energy security, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and supporting for the agricultural sector. Since the biofuel is often underproduction in the beginning due to economic cost, a number of countries have deliberately implemented policies aimed to increase its production and consumption. However, what impacts such policies would impose and to what extent they should be are still in question. Thus a comprehensive economic and environmental evaluation of biofuel policies is in great need. In China such study has been rarely conducted. This paper provides a broad comparison of the most recent and so far the best models used to assess the impact of policy change in western countries and gives recommendations for future biofuel policy research and practice in China. Finally we propose a simplified theoretical ASOM model based on FASOM structure as a starting step to develop such a comprehensive evaluation framework in China. & 2013 International Information Institute.

AB  - Physic nut {Jatropha curcos) is an important commercial bio-diesel |plant species and is being advocated for development of waste and dry land. The collar and root rot caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae is an important soil borne disease which causes considerable yield loss in this crop. In this study, the effects of culture media, temperature, photoperiod, carbon and nitrogen sources and pH on mycelial growth and pycnidial production were evaluated. Among the growth media tested, potato dextrose agar supported the highest growth followed by potato sucrose agar and corn meal agar. Among several carbon sources tested, carboxy methyl cellulose and sucrose were found superior for growth and pycnidial production. The nitrogen sources viz., ammonium oxalate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were recorded maximum mycelial growth and pycnidial production. The fungus grows at pH 5.0-9.0 and optimum growth was observed at pH 7.0. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - In this investigation ozonolysis in the presence of ethanol was used to depolymerise lignin, resulting in a low conversion of oxygenated aromatics over short reaction times, or a range of saturated esters over 24. h. Short chain oxygenates can be used as fuel additives, displacing a percentage of a hydrocarbon fuel while leading to improvement in some of the fuel properties. The utility of the resulting bio-oils was therefore assessed by blending with a range of fuels. Guaiacol, a potential antioxidant, was formed over short reaction times and was found to be completely miscible with low-sulphur petrol (ULSP), diesel, aviation kerosene and rapeseed methyl ester. The mainly aliphatic proportion of the bio-oil produced over 24. h could be blended with the fuels replacing a maximum of 12-17. wt.% of the hydrocarbon fuel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set a life-cycle emission reduction threshold to only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; this type of single-dimensional threshold could lead to the unintended trading of one environmental problem for another. Many of the environmental impacts resulting over the life cycle of oil-crop biodiesel fuels manifest in the agricultural phase of production in the form of water quality degradation. This study investigated the extent to which different biofuels meet the RFS GHG requirement, and presents alternative strategies for minimizing unintended consequences. In addition to life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP) and photochemical smog formation potential (PSP) from microalgal diesel were compared to the impacts resulting from petroleum-based diesel, soybean diesel and canola diesel. The results showed tradeoffs between GWP and eutrophication potential when microalgal diesel was compared to soybean diesel. Future RFS criteria should include EP and PSP metrics, however establishing thresholds like the GHG management approach may not be appropriate for these other impacts. Two possible strategies to setting life-cycle eutrophication standards are to establish a threshold based on first generation biofuels, as opposed to petro-fuels or to set maximum levels of EP loads for major watersheds or coastal areas. To decrease PSP, together with existing standards for tailpipe emissions, future RFSs should include the well-to-pump emissions from biofuels and petroleum fuels accounting for temporal and spatial variations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. Microalgae can produce biocompounds that are easily converted into biofuels, depending upon growing conditions. The idea of using microalgae as a source of fuel is now being taken seriously because of the escalating price of petroleum and the emerging concern about global warming that is associated with burning fossil fuels. Microalgae-derived agar to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural conversion paves the route for algal biomass to liquid fuel transformation. Ionic liquid played a major role in direct conversion of agar to liquid fuel-additive 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural. Acidic ionic liquids and solid acids would be major components of catalysts for algal biomass transformation to fuels.

AB  - This study presents a possible implementation of a second generation bioethanol production chain within the Province of Siena (Tuscany, Italy) by means of a biorefinery, and its consequences for the regional GHG balance in order to meet the European requirements for partial substitution of 10% bioethanol for gasoline by 2020. According to the last GHG balance of the territory of the Province of Siena, the transport sector represents the main contributor to the overall GHG emissions within the Province. A biorefinery project is hypothesized, fed by residual straw (from the local production of wheat, barley and oat) and residual geothermal heat (from local geothermal power plant) in order to produce bioethanol. The target of the production plant was about 8200 tons/year of bioethanol, representing the amount needed to replace 10% of the gasoline consumed in 2008 in the Province of Siena. The results of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the entire production chain have been included within the GHG balance of the Province of Siena in order to assess the effect of this substitution. The emissions derived from the production chain have been added to the current gross CO2eq emissions, and the CO 2eq avoided, thanks to the substitution of bioethanol, has been subtracted. The main results of this paper are: 1) the territory of the Province of Siena produces enough straw to implement the bioethanol production chain (38,000 tons/year of ethanol out of 147,000 tons/year of straw); 2) the emissions deriving from the entire bioethanol production chain are about 601.51 kg CO2eq per ton of bioethanol produced (about 4932 tons of CO 2eq are the emissions associated to the production of 8200 tons of bioethanol); 3) the use of the produced bioethanol in Siena's transport sector could bring about a reduction of 15,393 tons of CO2eq in emissions, equal to 6% of the net CO2eq emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been proposed as a sustainable bioenergy crop because of its high yield potential, adaptation to marginal sites, and tolerance to water and nutrient limitations. A better understanding of the potential effects of biomass energy crop production practices on soil biological properties and organic matter dynamics is critical to its production. Our objective was to evaluate changes in C pools under a warm-season perennial switchgrass in different soils compared to typically-grown crops collected at College Station, Dallas, and Stephenville, TX in February 2001. Sampling depths were 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm. Switchgrass increased soil organic C (SOC), soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), mineralizable C, and particulate organic matter C (POM-C) compared to conventional cropping systems. Soil C concentrations were in the order: long-term coastal bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] &lt; switchgrass or kleingrass (Panicum coloratum L.) planted in 1992 &gt; switchgrass 1997 &gt; conventional cropping systems. Soil C concentrations tended to increase with increasing clay content. Greater microbial biomass C followed the order of Dallas &gt; College Station &gt; Stephenville, and ranged from approximately 180 mg C kg-1 soil at Stephenville to 1900 mg C kg-1 soil at Dallas. Particulate organic C was more sensitive than other fractions to management, increasing as much as 6-fold under long-term coastal bermudagrass compared to conventional cropping systems. Our study indicated that conversion of conventional cropping systems into switchgrass production can sequestrate more SOC and improve soil biological properties in the southern USA. © 2013 Soil Science Society of China.

AB  - The efficient production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks will require the efficient fermentation of the sugars in hydrolyzed plant material. Unfortunately, plant hydrolysates also contain many compounds that inhibit microbial growth and fermentation. We used DNA-barcoded mutant libraries to identify genes that are important for hydrolysate tolerance in both Zymomonas mobilis (44 genes) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (99 genes). Overexpression of a Z. mobilis tolerance gene of unknown function (ZMO1875) improved its specific ethanol productivity 2.4-fold in the presence of miscanthus hydrolysate. However, a mixture of 37 hydrolysate-derived inhibitors was not sufficient to explain the fitness profile of plant hydrolysate. To deconstruct the fitness profile of hydrolysate, we profiled the 37 inhibitors against a library of Z. mobilis mutants and we modeled fitness in hydrolysate as a mixture of fitness in its components. By examining outliers in this model, we identified methylglyoxal as a previously unknown component of hydrolysate. Our work provides a general strategy to dissect how microbes respond to a complex chemical stress and should enable further engineering of hydrolysate tolerance. © 2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw is not only important for long-term soil productivity, but also as a raw material for biofuel, livestock feed, building, packing, and bedding. Inventory figures in the USA for potential straw availability are largely based on whole states and counties. Site-specific information is needed to determine where sufficient straw is available for removal within farm fields. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and feasibility of light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements of crop height for predicting the straw yield of wheat at site-specific field locations and apply this information to determining where excess straw is available beyond soil conservation needs. An inexpensive lidar sensor was mounted on the top of a Case International Harvester 1470 combine and aimed to point forwards at a 45° angle over the combine's reel. Lidar-measured crop height was correlated with manually measured crop height in small plots (r2 = 0.79) and was a good predictor of straw productivity across three farm fields (r2 = 0.85). Crop height was better correlated with straw yield than grain yield or grain protein concentration. Crop height predicted by lidar could then be used to estimate straw yield from a predetermined linear relationship between crop height and straw yield. A straw yield map was generated during harvest by programming the lidar sensor to compute the average of 91 readings in each scan. A map of harvestable straw was computed by subtracting the amount of straw required to maintain soil organic carbon from a map of total straw yield. Lidar is potentially useful for measuring crop biomass on a combine harvester and determining where in farm fields excess crop residue can be removed for commercial purposes. Further work with lidar is needed to resolve the issue of flying chaff. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Methane production by anaerobic digestion (AD) of macroalgae (seaweed) is a promising algal bioenergy option. Work presented here is primarily based on the AD of Laminaria hyperborea using batch and continuously stirred tank reactors. Extrapolation of data from batch studies to long term continuous reactors was unreliable. A conservative organic loading rate (OLR) of 1gL-1d-1 was used due to difficulties experienced in achieving steady state performance at an OLR of 1.5gL-1d-1. Biogas composition and methane yields (60-70%) were near to values expected from terrestrial feedstocks. Biomass washout, as imposed by the dilution rate (i.e., hydraulic residence), had considerable bearing on the biogas generation profile, particularly at ≫3 hydraulic residences. Inhibition of methanogen growth was linked to nutrient deficiency and potentially antimicrobial compounds associated with the feedstock. Anaerobic digestion of L. hyperborea proved feasible over extended operational periods. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The political will to reduce global GHG emissions has largely contributed to increased global biofuel production and trade. The expanding cultivation of energy crops may drive changes in the terrestrial ecosystems such as land cover and biodiversity loss. When biomass replaces fossil energy carriers, sustainability criteria are therefore crucial to avoid adverse impacts and ensure a net positive GHG balance. The European Union has set mandatory sustainability criteria for liquid biofuels in its Renewable Energy Directive (RED) 2009/28/EC to ensure net positive impacts of its biofuel policy. The adoption of sustainability criteria in other world regions and their extension to solid and gaseous biomass in the EU is ongoing. This paper examines the effect of the EU RED sustainability criteria on the availability of biomass resources at global and regional scale. It quantifies the relevance of sustainability criteria in biomass resource assessments taking into account the criteria's spatial distribution. This assessment does not include agricultural and forestry residues and aquatic biomass. Previously unknown interrelations between sustainability criteria are examined and described for ten world regions. The analysis concludes that roughly 10% (98.5 EJ) of the total theoretical potential of 977.2 EJ occurs in areas free of sustainability concerns. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Summary: Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) has emerged as a tool for estimating environmental impacts of changes in product systems that go beyond physical relationships accounted for in attributional LCA (ALCA). This study builds on recent efforts to use more complex economic models for policy-based CLCA. A partial market equilibrium (PME) model, called the U.S. Forest Products Module (USFPM), is combined with LCA to analyze an energy demand scenario in which wood use increases 400 million cubic meters in the United States for ethanol production. Several types of indirect economic and environmental impacts are identified and estimated using USFPM-LCA. A key finding is that if wood use for biofuels increases to high levels and mill residue is used for biofuels and replaced by natural gas for heat and power in forest products mills, then the increased greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas could offset reductions obtained by substituting biofuels for gasoline. Such high levels of biofuel demand, however, appear to have relatively low environmental impacts across related forest product sectors. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - Branches from three transgenic poplar lines and their wild type line 107 were used to study the effect of lignocellulosic composition and structure on the production of glucose and ethanol. Experimental results showed that the transgenic line 18-1 had the high cellulose content and amorphous fibril structure. After poplar meals were pretreated with 10% NaOH and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid, their lateral order index decreased significantly. The highest glucose yield in enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol yield from the substrate of 18-1 was much higher than that from feedstock of 107 by 192.7% and 108.7%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that lignocellulose from the 18-1 could be destroyed by chemicals more easily than those from other lines. These results demonstrated that changing lignocellulose structure could be more effective on improving the digestibility and enzymatic hydrolysis of poplar biomass than increasing the cellulose content in biomass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: A normalization step is widely exercised in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies in order to better understand the relative significance of impact category results. In the normalization stage, normalization references (NRs) are the characterized results of a reference system, typically a national or regional economy. Normalization is widely practiced in LCA-based decision support and policy analysis (e.g., LCA cases in municipal solid waste treatment technologies, renewable energy technologies, and environmentally preferable purchasing programs, etc.). The compilation of NRs demands significant effort and time as well as an intimate knowledge of data availability and quality. Consequently only one set of published NRs is available for the United States, and has been adopted by various studies. In this study, the completeness of the previous NRs was evaluated and significant data gaps were identified. One of the reasons for the significant data gaps was that the toxic release inventory (TRI) data significantly underestimate the potential impact of toxic releases for some sectors. Also the previous NRs did not consider the soil emissions and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) runoffs to water and chemical emissions to soils. Filling in these data gaps increased the magnitude of NRs for "human health cancer," "human health noncancer," "ecotoxicity," and "eutrophication" significantly. Such significant changes can alter or even reverse the outcome of an LCA study. We applied the previous and updated NRs to conventional gasoline and corn ethanol LCAs. The results demonstrate that NRs play a decisive role in the interpretation of LCA results that use a normalization step. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - Growing concerns over emissions of green-house gases causing climate change as well as energy security concerns have spurred the interest in bioenergy production pushed by EU targets to fulfil the goal of 20. per cent renewable energy in 2020, as well as the goal of 10. per cent renewable fuels in transport by 2020. Increased bioenergy production is also seen to have political and economic benefits for rural areas and farming regions in Europe and in the developing world. There are, however, conflicting views on the potential benefits of large scale bioenergy production, and recent debates have also drawn attention to a range of environmental and socio-economic issues that may arise in this respect. One of these challenges will be that of accommodating forest uses - including wood for energy, and resulting intensification of forest management - with biodiversity protection in order to meet EU policy goals. We note that the use of biomass and biofuels spans over several economic sector policy areas, which calls for assessing and integrating environmental concerns across forest, agriculture, energy and transport sectors.In this paper, we employ frame analysis to identify the arguments for promoting bioenergy and assess the potential policy conflicts in the relevant sectors, through the analytical lens of environmental policy integration. We conclude that while there is considerable leverage of environmental arguments in favour of bioenergy in the studied economic sectors, and potential synergies with other policy goals, environmental interest groups remain sceptical to just how bioenergy is currently being promoted. There is a highly polarised debate particularly relating to biofuel production. Based on our analysis, we discuss the potential for how those issues could be reconciled drawing on the frame conflict theory, distinguishing between policy disagreements and policy controversies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forests of the Midwestern United States are an important source of fiber for the wood and paper products industries. Scientists, land managers, and policy makers are interested in using woody biomass and/or harvest residue for biofuel feedstocks. However, the effects of increased biomass removal for biofuel production on forest production and forest system carbon balance remain uncertain. We modeled the carbon (C) cycle of the forest system by dividing it into two distinct components: (1) biological (net ecosystem production, net primary production, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, vegetation, and soil C content) and (2) industrial (harvest operations and transportation, production, use, and disposal of major wood products including biofuel and associated C emissions). We modeled available woody biomass feedstock and whole-system carbon balance of 220 000 km2 of temperate forests in the Upper Midwest, USA by coupling an ecosystem process model to a collection of greenhouse gas life-cycle inventory models and simulating seven forest harvest scenarios in the biological ecosystem and three biofuel production scenarios in the industrial system for 50 years. The forest system was a carbon sink (118 g C m-2 yr-1) under current management practices and forest product production rates. However, the system became a C source when harvest area was doubled and biofuel production replaced traditional forest products. Total carbon stores in the vegetation and soil increased by 5-10% under low-intensity management scenarios and current management, but decreased up to 3% under high-intensity harvest regimes. Increasing harvest residue removal during harvest had more modest effects on forest system C balance and total biomass removal than increasing the rate of clear-cut harvests or area harvested. Net forest system C balance was significantly, and negatively correlated (R2 = 0.67) with biomass harvested, illustrating the trade-offs between increased C uptake by forests and utilization of woody biomass for biofuel feedstock. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Interest in bioenergy crops is increasing due to their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. We combined process-based and geospatial models to estimate the potential biomass productivity of miscanthus and its potential impact on soil carbon stocks in the croplands of the continental United States. The optimum (climatic potential) rainfed productivity for field-dried miscanthus biomass ranged from 1 to 23 Mg biomass ha-1 yr-1, with a spatial average of 13 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and a coefficient of variation of 30%. This variation resulted primarily from the spatial heterogeneity of effective rainfall, growing degree days, temperature, and solar radiation interception. Cultivating miscanthus would result in a soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration at the rate of 0.16-0.82 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 across the croplands due to cessation of tillage and increased biomass carbon input into the soil system. We identified about 81 million ha of cropland, primarily in the eastern United States, that could sustain economically viable (&gt;10 Mg ha-1 yr-1) production without supplemental irrigation, of which about 14 million ha would reach optimal miscanthus growth. To meet targets of the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 using miscanthus as feedstock, 19 million ha of cropland would be needed (spatial average 13 Mg ha-1 yr-1) or about 16% less than is currently dedicated to US corn-based ethanol production. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. produces seeds rich in non-edible oil suitable for biodiesel but it has been categorized as invasive. Although not scientifically verified, this allegation has resulted in a cultivation ban in several countries. In this article we report an integrated series of observations and experimental findings from invasiveness research in Zambia. We studied the impacts of J. curcas plantations on adjacent land use systems focusing on spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, seed dispersal mechanisms, seed predation by animals, and germination success of dispersed seeds. No spontaneous regeneration was observed in land use systems adjacent to J. curcas plantations. Primary seed dispersal was limited, predominantly under the canopy of the mother plant. Rodents and shrews dispersed and predated J. curcas seeds and fruits. They transported the seeds up to 23 m from the sources and repositioned them in their burrows up to 0.7 m deep, but none of these seeds could establish. Germination experiments in adjacent land use systems revealed 4% germination success at the soil surface, and 65% if buried artificially at 1-2 cm depth, yet the latter is unlikely to occur under natural conditions. These findings show that J. curcas seeds may be dispersed by animals to adjacent land use systems, but no natural recruitment was observed given low germination on the surface and none in burrows. Altogether these results suggest that the plant currently does not show an elevated risk of invasion to adjacent land use systems, at least in the investigated case study. But more long-term studies, also in other growing areas are needed to corroborate these results. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper three microalgae strains (Neochloris oleoabundans, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus) were cultivated on an agro-zootechnical digestate in comparable conditions. The material used as growth media was obtained from a pilot plant anaerobic digestor used to digest several mixes of cattle slurry and raw cheese whey. The main aims were to compare the algae growth, their tolerance with respect to the various dilutions of digestate, their nutrient removal efficiency and their role in the transformation of nitrogen compounds. C. vulgaris presented the highest elimination capacity of ammonium in 1:10 digestate sample; it was also observed that only 4% of ammonia was removed with stripping, microalgal and bacterial consortium recovered the remaining 96%. The three strains almost completely removed different nitrogen forms and phosphate in 11d. The results show that microalgal biomass production offers real opportunities for addressing issues such CO2 sequestration, biofuel production and wastewater treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Attractive subsidies for the production of green electricity from solid biofuels, causes an increasing demand of energy wood in Austria and furthermore discussions about the forest energy wood potential. Data of the national forest inventory were analyzed to assess the ecological fuel wood Potenzial for Lower Austria, a federal state of Austria. Different assortments of fuel wood were defined and their amount was calculated stemwise using different functions. The results were summed up for categories like type of ownership, terrain inclination, political district and so on. On nutrient-poor sites the utilization of branches was excluded. The development of the fuel wood Potenzial and the stand volume was estimated by a growth simulator for a time period of 10 and 20 years, respectively. Probability functions were developed to foresee the removal or utilization of trees. Three utilization scenarios were assumed: no chance in utilization (I), harvest thinning backlogs within 10 (II) and 20 (III) years. This gives for the study area with 764.000 ha of forest land a yearly amount of 690,000 (I); 830,000 (II) and 680,000 m3 solid (III) at the stand level. At the same time approximately 3.2 Mio. 4.2 Mio. and 3.4 Mio. of saw logs and industrial wood will be accumulate. Overall scenarios it can be concluded that up to 20% additional volume could be used as fuel wood. Compared to existing studies about fuel wood Potenzial, with use a top-down principle to estimate the amount, here the bottom-up principle was applied by stemwise calculation of assortment volumes. How much of the fuel wood Potenzial is harvestable or will be available on the market depends on a variety of factors. However, more investigations are necessary to quantify the availability. Beside ecological impacts due to biomass removal a possible decrease of growth must be considered.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to carry out an analysis on socioeconomic risks and benefits of biofuel production on different stages of biofuel production chain. Biofuels have gained increasing attention as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a potential way to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while contributing rural development in developing countries. In this paper socioeconomic risks and benefits related to biofuel production in developing countries were studied by going through related literature. In addition to greenhouse gas emission reductions, biofuel production is also expected to improve rural development. However, according to several studies, they pose some social and economic risks among the local farmers. First of all, the land for biofuel production is often acquired by clearing forest or replacing food production. Second of all, farming may cause some socioeconomic issues if farmers lose the control of their land. On the other hand, sustainable biofuel production could improve rural development and employment in developing countries. The results show that sustainability certificates should be developed further to avoid risks and gain benefits. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - Food security can be defined in terms of availability, access, and use of food. The study assesses whether the measures taken by Addax Bioenergy in the Makeni community in Sierra Leone are effective and sufficient to ensure food security locally as well as regionally. Land and water availability, agricultural intensification and infrastructure, self-sufficiency/market dependency and alternative income options have been identified as the main factors affecting food security in the project area. The main measures employed by Addax involve the use of an 'environmental, social and health impact assessment' (ESHIA) to identify and propose measures to mitigate any impacts that would adversely affect the food security of the region. The results show that the proposed measures for mitigating negative impacts on food security are in some instances inappropriate and inadequate, leaving the affected communities exposed to risks and shocks of food insecurity. It is also found that the insufficiency of mitigation measures is a result of weak governance and lack of oversight that may leave the community at the mercy of Addax Bioenergy. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - Bio-oil and hydrochar were produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Salix psammophila (SP) branch residues with recycled processing water, in order to address the lack of water in deserts or sandy lands and the difficulty of water treatment in a batch reactor. The results indicated that the recycling of the HTL processing water could significantly improve the yield of bio-oil from 30.3% to 46.9%. The gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of the obtained bio-oil confirmed the presence of value-added chemicals, such as phenolics, acetic acid, and furans. The acetic acid in the processing water played a key role in the HTL. The heavy oil had a high content (maximum of 42.7 wt%) of the low boiling point fraction (<300 °C), indicating its potential for further applications. The higher heating value of the hydrochar was about 27 MJ/kg, equivalent to the heating value of medium-rank and high-rank coals. These results show that HTL using recycled processing water has great potential for utilization of desert biomass wastes.

AB  - A qualified estimate for pretreatment of the macroalgae Chaetomorpha linum for ethanol production was given, based on the experience of pretreatment of land-based biomass. C. linum was subjected to hydrothermal pretreatment (HTT), wet oxidation (WO), steam explosion (STEX), plasma-assisted pretreatment (PAP) and ball milling (BM), to determine effects of the pretreatment methods on the conversion of C. linum into ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). WO and BM showed the highest ethanol yield of 44. g ethanol/100. g glucan, which was close to the theoretical ethanol yield of 57. g ethanol/100. g glucan. A 64% higher ethanol yield, based on raw material, was reached after pretreatment with WO and BM compared with unpretreated C. linum, however 50% of the biomass was lost during WO. Results indicated that the right combination of pretreatment and marine macroalgae, containing high amounts of glucan and cleaned from salts, enhanced the ethanol yield significantly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to screen nine annual or perennial novel plants for biogas production cultivated in years 2007-2010 in Finland. The most promising novel plants for biogas production were found to be brown knapweed, giant goldenrod and Japanese millet producing 14-27t total solids/ha and 4000-6100Nm3CH4/ha. The specific methane yields of all studied plants varied from 170 to 381Nm3CH4/t volatile solids (VS), depending on harvest time and plant species. Co-digestion of brown knapweed with cow manure in continuously stirred tank reactor was investigated and the highest methane yield was 254 NL CH4/kg VS, when the share of brown knapweed was 50% in the feed VS (organic loading rate (OLR) 2kg VS/m3/d). The cultivation managements and sustainability of novel plants for biogas production have to be investigated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Though initiated only at smaller scales so far, "Project Gaia" offers an innovative Ethiopian model for using byproducts from the sugar industry to create an ethanol fuel that can be utilized by cleaner burning cookstoves, predominately internally displaced refugees. Backed by the Shell Foundation and a collection of NGOs, Project Gaia has distributed almost 4000 ethanol combusting stoves throughout refugee camps in Ethiopia. After summarizing the research methods utilized by the authors and introducing readers to the energy situation in Ethiopia, this study describes the history, benefits, and challenges of Project Gaia. Though the number of distributed stoves is small, they have lessened the burden of collecting fuelwood for Ethiopian refugees, reduced deforestation around refugee camps, displaced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved the health of cooks and children-all for roughly one-third the cost of kerosene, the most prevalent substitute fuel for cooking. However, if Project Gaia is to continue to deliver these benefits, a pernicious set of educational, political, and logistical barriers must be overcome. The final part of the study details these barriers, and it concludes by pointing out the significance of government consistency, technological appropriateness, and the coupling of energy services with commercial enterprises for efforts like Project Gaia. © 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - In contrast to a few years ago, when cellulosic ethanol via enzymatic hydrolysis was the only widely recognized technology for commercially producing cellulosic biofuels, a diversity of approaches are currently under commercial development. While no commercial-scale (≥20 million gallons per year) cellulosic biofuel facilities are operating at present, at least ten biorefinery projects employing six different pathways are expected to begin operations by 2014. These biorefineries will employ the following pathways: (i) catalytic pyrolysis and hydrotreating to hydrocarbons; (ii) gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to hydrocarbons; (iii) gasification and methanol-to-gasoline synthesis; (iv) dilute acid hydrolysis, fermentation to acetic acid, and chemical synthesis to ethanol; (v) enzymatic hydrolysis to ethanol; and (vi) consolidated bioprocessing (single-step enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation) to ethanol. This review provides an overview of the six pathway technologies, comprehensive descriptions of each of the ten biorefinery projects, and a discussion of the current direction of cellulosic biofuel commercialization efforts and its implications for the revised Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Research on biofuels has been focused on improving yield of the conversion process while reducing the capital cost. Currently, 88% of the US ethanol production capacity and 96% of the planned expansion of capacity utilizes a dry milling process, which has a higher ethanol yield and a lower capital cost per gallon capacity than a wet milling process. However, the fact that all the corn ethanol plants that were bankrupted or idled during the 2008 economy recession used dry milling processes while all the plants that used wet milling processes had survived suggests that the efficiency driven approach may be flawed. This paper compares the economic performances of a typical dry milling plant with those of a typical wet milling plant under scenarios when market conditions are favorable or unfavorable to the corn ethanol production. The results show that the wet milling plant exhibits better performance under both scenarios due to its operational flexibility (e.g. having starch, high fructose corn syrup, gluten meal, gluten feed, and corn oil in its product portfolio). It is argued that the development of biofuel technologies should take operational flexibility into consideration in order to absorb disruptions from unexpected feedstock supply and volatile market conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study is aimed at assessing the challenge of liquid transportation fuel in Nigeria, which necessitated the entrance of the country into the biofuel race. The study found that despite being an important member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (OPEC), Nigeria still suffers from fuel scarcities. Reasons for the short supply of refined petroleum products (particularly gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel) in Nigeria include poor capacity utilization of the nation's refineries, disruption of crude oil supply to the refineries and political instability in the Niger Delta region (Nigeria's oil province). Nigeria now relies heavily on foreign nations for the supply of these fuels. The country spends substantial part of her foreign exchange on fuel importation. The Federal Government now wishes to reverse this trend by initiating the automotive biofuel programme. The Nigerian automotive biofuel programme involved the construction of 9 plants comprising of 4 sugarcane and 2 cassava bioethanol projects and 3 biodiesel projects. These projects would involve the investment of $1.27 billion into the Nigerian economy for the production of 445 million L of ethanol, 192 MW of green electricity and 120 million L of biodiesel annually. © Maxwell Scientific Organizaation, 2013.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how ex ante scale dynamics analysis can contribute to better understanding of interactions between scales and levels, and how these interactions influence solution space in policy processes. In so doing, we address opportunities and challenges of conducting ex ante scale dynamics analysis as part of an action-oriented social science research approach that seeks to enhance its contribution to more scale-sensitive policy development. The policy debate on sustainable biofuels in Mozambique provides the empirical context in which we analyze interactions across administrative, institutional, and economic scales and levels, and how these interactions influence the space in which policy solutions can be explored and designed. On the basis of the analysis, we conclude that ex ante scale dynamics analysis can contribute to: (1) increasing awareness of interactions between scales and levels, and their implications for policy, (2) identifying immediate and potential matches and mismatches between scales and levels, and developing (adaptive) capacity to address them, and (3) identifying stakeholders and their scale- and level-related interests that can provide the basis for collaborative multi-stakeholder learning. Consequently, ex ante scale dynamics analysis can provide an important contribution to balancing and harmonizing interactions across different scales and levels, from which innovative and scale-sensitive policy responses can emerge. As part of an actionoriented, social science research approach, careful attention needs to be paid to processes of scale and level inclusion and exclusion when conducting scale dynamics analysis. © 2013 by the author(s).

AB  - Influences of operating conditions such as temperature (270-380°C), time (10-120min), reactor loading (0.5-5.5g), and K2CO3 loading (0-50wt.%) on the product (e.g. crude bio-oil, water soluble, gas and solid residue) distribution from the hydrothermal processing of duckweed were determined. Of the four variables, temperature and K2CO3 loading were always the most influential factors to the relative amount of each component. The presence of K2CO3 is unfavorable for the production of bio-oil and gas. Hydrothermal processing duckweed produces a bio-oil that is enriched in carbon and hydrogen and has reduced levels of O compared with the original duckweed feedstock. The higher heating values of the bio-oil were estimated within the range of 32-36MJ/kg. Major bio-oil constituents include ketones and their alkylated derivatives, alcohols, heterocyclic nitrogen-containing compounds, saturated fatty acids and hydrocarbons. The gaseous products were mainly CO2 and H2, with lesser amounts of CH4 and CO. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This life cycle assessment evaluates and quantifies the environmental impacts of the production of hydrogen and transportation fuels from the fast pyrolysis and upgrading of corn stover. Input data for this analysis come from Aspen Plus modeling, a GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) model database and a US Life Cycle Inventory Database. SimaPro 7.3 software is employed to estimate the environmental impacts. The results indicate that the net fossil energy input is 0.25 MJ and 0.23 MJ per km traveled for a light-duty vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Bio-oil production requires the largest fossil energy input. The net global warming potential (GWP) is 0.037 kg CO2eq and 0.015 kg CO2eq per km traveled for a vehicle fueled by gasoline and diesel fuel, respectively. Vehicle operations contribute up to 33% of the total positive GWP, which is the largest greenhouse gas footprint of all the unit processes. The net GWPs in this study are 88% and 94% lower than for petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel (2005 baseline), respectively. Biomass transportation has the largest impact on ozone depletion among all of the unit processes. Sensitivity analysis shows that fuel economy, transportation fuel yield, bio-oil yield, and electricity consumption are the key factors that influence greenhouse gas emissions. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Macroalgae, so-called seaweeds, have recently attracted attention as a possible feedstock for biorefinery. Since macroalgae contain various carbohydrates (which are distinctively different from those of terrestrial biomasses), thorough assessments of macroalgae-based refinery are essential to determine whether applying terrestrial-based technologies to macroalgae or developing completely new technologies is feasible. This comprehensive review was performed to show the potentials of macroalgae as biorefinery feedstocks. Their basic background information was introduced: taxonomical classification, habitat environment, and carbon reserve capacity. Their global production status showed that macroalgae can be mass-cultivated with currently available farming technology. Their various carbohydrate compositions implied that new microorganisms are needed to effectively saccharify macroalgal biomass. Up-to-date macroalgae conversion technologies for biochemicals and biofuels showed that molecular bioengineering would contribute to the success of macroalgae-based biorefinery. It was concluded that more research is required for the utilization of macroalgae as a new promising biomass for low-carbon economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biorefinery manufacturing process for producing chemicals and liquid fuels from biomass is a promising approach for securing energy and resources. To establish cost-effective fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass, the consolidation of sacccharification and fermentation processes is a desirable strategy, but requires the development of microorganisms capable of cellulose/hemicellulose hydrolysis and target chemical production. Such an endeavor requires a large number of prerequisites to be realized, including engineering microbial strains with high cellulolytic activity, high product yield, productivities, and titers, ability to use many carbon sources, and resistance to toxic compounds released during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Researchers have focused on either engineering naturally cellulolytic microorganisms to improve product-related properties or modifying non-cellulolytic organisms with high product yields to become cellulolytic. This article reviews recent advances in the development of microorganisms for the production of renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels, as well as ethanol, from lignocellulosic materials through consolidated bioprocessing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are viewed as promising alternatives to conventional fossil fuels because they have the potential to eliminate major environmental problems created by fossil fuels. Among the still developing biofuel technologies, biodiesel production from algae offers a greater prospect for large-scale practical use, as algae are capable of producing much more yield than other biofuels. While research on algae-based biofuel is still in its developing stage, extensive work on laboratory- and pilot-scale algae harvesting systems with promising prospects has been reported. This paper presented a discussion of the literature review on recent advances in algae separation, harvesting and drying for biofuel production. The review and discussion focus on destabilization of algae, algae harvesting technologies and algae drying processes. Challenges and prospects of algae harvesting are also outlined. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are a promising source for proteins, lipids and carbohydrates for the food/feed and biofuel industry. In comparison with soya and palm oil, microalgae can be grown in a more efficient and sustainable way. To make microalgae production economically feasible it is necessary to optimally use all produced compounds. To accomplish this focus needs to be put on biorefinery techniques which are mild and effective. Of the techniques described, Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) seems to be the most developed technique compared to other cell disruption applications. For separation technology ionic liquids seems most promising as they are able to both separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. But additional studies need to be evolved in the coming years to investigate their relevance as novel cell disruption and separation methods. We propose a complete downstream processing flow diagram that is promising in terms of low energy use and state of the art knowledge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Earth faces an urgent need for climate change mitigation, and carbon storage is discussed as an option. Approaches for assessing the benefit of temporary carbon storage in relation to carbon footprinting exist, but many are based on a 100-year accounting period, disregarding impacts after this time. The aim of this paper is to assess the consequences of using such approaches that disregard the long timescale on which complete removal of atmospheric CO2 occurs. Based on these findings, an assessment is made on what are relevant timescales to consider when including the value of temporary carbon storage in carbon footprinting. Methods: Implications of using a 100-year accounting period is evaluated via a literature review study of the global carbon cycle, as well as by analysing the crediting approaches that are exemplified by the PAS 2050 scheme for crediting temporary carbon storage. Results and discussion: The global carbon cycle shows timescales of thousands of years for the transport of carbon from the atmosphere to pools beyond the near-surface layers of the Earth, from where it will not readily be re-emitted as a response to change in near-surface conditions. Compared to such timescales, the use of the 100-year accounting period appears hard to justify. We illustrate how the use of the 100-year accounting period can cause long-term global warming impacts to be hidden by short-term storage solutions that may not offer real long-term climate change mitigation. Obtaining long-term climatic benefits is considered to require storage of carbon for at least thousand years. However, it has been proposed that there may exist tipping points for the atmospheric CO2 concentration beyond which irreversible climate changes occur. To reduce the risk of passing such tipping points, fast mitigation of the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration is required and in this perspective, shorter storage times may still provide climatic benefits. Conclusions: Both short- and long-term perspectives should be considered when crediting temporary carbon storage, addressing both acute effects on the climate and the long-term climate change. It is however essential to distinguish between short- and long-term mitigation potential by treating them separately and avoid that short-term mitigation is used to counterbalance long-term climate change impacts from burning of fossil fuels. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this study is to characterise and compare fast pyrolysis product yields from straw, high yielding perennial grasses and hardwoods. Feedstocks selected for this study include: wheat straw (Triticum aestivum), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), willow short rotation coppice (Salix viminalis) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica). The experimental work is divided into two sections: analytical (TGA and Py-GC-MS) and laboratory scale processing using a continuously fed bubbling fluidized bed reactor with a capacity of up to 1 kg/h. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) has been used to quantify pyrolysis products and simulate fast pyrolysis heating rates, in order to study potential key light and medium volatile decomposition products found in these feedstocks. Py-GC-MS quantification results show that the highest yields of furfural (0.57 wt.%), 2-furanmethanol (0.18 wt.%), levoglucosan (0.73 wt.%), 1,2-benzenediol (0.27 wt.%) and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (0.38 wt.%) were found in switch grass, and that willow SRC produced the highest yield of phenol (0.33 wt.%). The bio-oil higher heating value was highest for switch grass (22.3 MJ/kg). Water content within the bio-oil is highest in the straw and perennial grasses and lowest in the hardwood willow SRC. The high bio-oil and char heating value and low water content found in willow SRC, makes this crop an attractive energy feedstock for fast pyrolysis processing, if the associated production costs and harvest yields can be maintained at current reported values. The bio-oil from switch grass has the highest potential for the production of high value chemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biomethane is a gaseous energy vector with a distribution system (the natural gas grid) in place. Biomethane may be produced through thermal gasification of Willow and may be used as a source of renewable heat. Two scales were assessed: a 50MWth facility based on indigenous Willow and a 300MWth facility based at an international port importing wood chip. The model suggested that eleven 50MWth gasifiers, each requiring 6800ha of Willow, in a rural environment, with gas grid injection to the distribution grid, would satisfy the shortfall in the 2020 target for renewable energy supply in the heat market in Ireland. Alternatively two number 300MWth facilities each requiring importation of 1,000,000 t/yr of wood chip, situated adjacent to an international port would satisfy the shortfall. This is seen as less attractive as the feed stock is not indigenous and in times of austerity does not facilitate local rural employment. The capital cost of the facilities for both scales is less than that required to provide the same quantity of renewable heat through domestic wood pellet boilers in domiciles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Open biomass burning (excluding biofuels) is an important contributor to air pollution in the Asian region. Estimation of emissions from fires, however, has been problematic, primarily because of uncertainty in the size and location of sources and in their temporal and spatial variability. Hence, more comprehensive tools to estimate wildfire emissions and that can characterize their temporal and spatial variability are needed. Furthermore, an emission processing system that can generate speciated, gridded, and temporally allocated emissions is needed to support air-quality modeling studies over Asia. For these reasons, a biomass-burning emissions modeling system based on satellite imagery was developed to better account for the spatial and temporal distributions of emissions. The BlueSky Framework, which was developed by the USDA Forest Service and US EPA, was used to develop the Asian biomass-burning emissions modeling system. The sub-models used for this study were the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), CONSUME, and the Emissions Production Model (EPM). Our domain covers not only Asia but also Siberia and part of central Asia to assess the large boreal fires in the region. The MODIS fire products and vegetation map were used in this study. Using the developed modeling system, biomass-burning emissions were estimated during April and July 2008, and the results were compared with previous studies. Our results show good to fair agreement with those of GFEDv3 for most regions, ranging from 9.7 % in East Asia to 52% in Siberia. The SMOKE modeling system was combined with this system to generate three-dimensional model-ready emissions employing the fire-plume rise algorithm. This study suggests a practicable and maintainable methodology for supporting Asian air-quality modeling studies and to help understand the impact of air-pollutant emissions on Asian air quality.

AB  - With a target production of 1000ton of dry algae/yr, lipid content of 30wt.%, and productivity of 30g/m2-d in a 340-day annual operation, four common scenarios of microalgae bioenergy routes were assessed in terms of cost, energy, and CO2 inputs and outputs. Scenario 1 (biodiesel production), Scenario 2 (Scenario 1 with integrated anaerobic digestion system), Scenario 3 (biogas production), and Scenario 4 (supercritical gasification) were evaluated. Scenario 4 outperformed other scenarios in terms of net energy production (1282.42kWh/ton algae) and CO2 removal (1.32ton CO2/ton algae) while Scenario 2 surpassed the other three scenarios in terms of net cost. Scenario 1 produced the lowest energy while Scenario 3 was the most expensive bioenergy system. This study evaluated critical parameters that could direct the proper design of the microalgae bioenergy system with an efficient energy production, CO2 removal, and economic feasibility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A variety of biofuel and biorefinery products have been produced from engineered Escherichia coli till date. Most of these products had been derived from simple sugars in its pure form, rather than deriving it from alternative, renewable and carbon neutral sources, such as marine alga biomass. Engineering E. coli to use algal hydrolysate can make these an attractive carbon source for the industrial production of value added fuels and chemicals. This work reports the engineering of E. coli by a combination of gene deletion and synthetic pathway incorporation, for the efficient utilization of algal hydrolysate to produce BA (2,3 butanediol. +. acetoin) under microaerobic condition. Engineered strain produced ~19. g/L of total BA from algal hydrolysate in defined M9 salt media at a yield of 0.43. g/g. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of biofuel from cellulosic residues can have both environmental and financial benefits. A particular benefit is that it can alleviate competition for land conventionally used for food and feed production. In this research, we investigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate from citrus waste, a byproduct of the citrus processing industry. The study represents the first life cycle-based evaluations of citrus waste biorefineries. Two biorefinery configurations are studied - a large biorefinery that converts citrus waste into ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate, and a small biorefinery that converts citrus waste into biomethane, limonene and digestate. Ethanol is assumed to be used as E85, displacing gasoline as a light-duty vehicle fuel; biomethane displaces natural gas for electricity generation, limonene displaces acetone in solvents, and digestate from the anaerobic digestion process displaces synthetic fertilizer. System expansion and two allocation methods (energy, market value) are considered to determine emissions of co-products. Considerable GHG reductions would be achieved by producing and utilizing the citrus waste-based products in place of the petroleum-based or other non-renewable products. For the large biorefinery, ethanol used as E85 in light-duty vehicles results in a 134% reduction in GHG emissions compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles when applying a system expansion approach. For the small biorefinery, when electricity is generated from biomethane rather than natural gas, GHG emissions are reduced by 77% when applying system expansion. The life cycle GHG emissions vary substantially depending upon biomethane leakage rate, feedstock GHG emissions and the method to determine emissions assigned to co-products. Among the process design parameters, the biomethane leakage rate is critical, and the ethanol produced in the large biorefinery would not meet EISA's requirements for cellulosic biofuel if the leakage rate is higher than 9.7%. For the small biorefinery, there are no GHG emission benefits in the production of biomethane if the leakage rate is higher than 11.5%. Compared to system expansion, the use of energy and market value allocation methods generally results in higher estimates of GHG emissions for the primary biorefinery products (i.e., smaller reductions in emissions compared to reference systems). © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Increasing demand for crop-based biofuels, in addition to other human drivers of land use, induces direct and indirect land use changes (LUC). Our system dynamics tool is intended to complement existing LUC modeling approaches and to improve the understanding of global LUC drivers and dynamics by allowing examination of global LUC under diverse scenarios and varying model assumptions. We report on a small subset of such analyses. This model provides insights into the drivers and dynamic interactions of LUC (e.g., dietary choices and biofuel policy) and is not intended to assert improvement in numerical results relative to other works. Demand for food commodities are mostly met in high food and high crop-based biofuel demand scenarios, but cropland must expand substantially. Meeting roughly 25% of global transportation fuel demand by 2050 with biofuels requires >2 times the land used to meet food demands under a presumed 40% increase in per capita food demand. In comparison, the high food demand scenario requires greater pastureland for meat production, leading to larger overall expansion into forest and grassland. Our results indicate that, in all scenarios, there is a potential for supply shortfalls, and associated upward pressure on prices, of food commodities requiring higher land use intensity (e.g., beef) which biofuels could exacerbate. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The productive cellulosic crops switchgrass and Miscanthus are considered as viable biofuel sources. To meet the 2022 national biofuel target mandate, actions must be taken, e.g., maize cultivation must be intensified and expanded, and other biofuel crops (switchgrass and Miscanthus) must be cultivated. This raises questions on the use efficiencies of land and water; to date, the demand on these resources to meet the national biofuel target has rarely been analyzed. Here, we present a data-model assimilation analysis, assuming that maize, switchgrass and Miscanthus will be grown on currently available croplands in the US. Model simulations suggest that maize can produce 3.0-5.4 kiloliters (kl) of ethanol for every hectare of land, depending on the feedstock to ethanol conversion efficiency; Miscanthus has more than twice the biofuel production capacity relative to maize, and switchgrass is the least productive of the three potential sources of ethanol. To meet the biofuel target, about 26.5 million hectares of land and over 90 km3 of water (of evapotranspiration) are needed if maize grain alone is used. If Miscanthus was substituted for maize, the process would save half of the land and one third of the water. With more advanced biofuel conversion technology for Miscanthus, only nine million hectares of land and 45 km3 of water would probably meet the national target. Miscanthus could be a good alternative biofuel crop to maize due to its significantly lower demand for land and water on a per unit of ethanol basis. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are increasingly promoted worldwide as a means for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport. However, current regulatory frameworks and most academic life cycle analyses adopt a deterministic approach in determining the GHG intensities of biofuels and thus ignore the inherent risk associated with biofuel production. This study aims to develop a transparent stochastic method for evaluating UK biofuels that determines both the magnitude and uncertainty of GHG intensity on the basis of current industry practices. Using wheat ethanol as a case study, we show that the GHG intensity could span a range of 40-110 gCO2e MJ-1 when land use change (LUC) emissions and various sources of uncertainty are taken into account, as compared with a regulatory default value of 44 gCO2e MJ-1. This suggests that the current deterministic regulatory framework underestimates wheat ethanol GHG intensity and thus may not be effective in evaluating transport fuels. Uncertainties in determining the GHG intensity of UK wheat ethanol include limitations of available data at a localized scale, and significant scientific uncertainty of parameters such as soil N2O and LUC emissions. Biofuel polices should be robust enough to incorporate the currently irreducible uncertainties and flexible enough to be readily revised when better science is available. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The expansion of biofuel production can lead to an array of negative environmental impacts. Therefore, the European Union (EU) has recently imposed sustainability criteria on biofuel production in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). In this article, we analyse the effectiveness of the sustainability criteria for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. We first use a global agriculture and forestry model to investigate environmental effects of the EU member states National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) without sustainability criteria. We conclude that these targets would drive losses of 2.2 Mha of highly biodiverse areas and generate 95 Mt CO 2 eq of additional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in a second step, we demonstrate that the EU biofuel demand could be satisfied 'sustainably' according to RED despite its negative environmental effects. This is because the majority of global crop production is produced 'sustainably' in the sense of RED and can provide more than 10 times the total European biofuel demand in 2020 if reallocated from sectors without sustainability criteria. This finding points to a potential policy failure of applying sustainability regulation to a single sector in a single region. To be effective this policy needs to be more complete in targeting a wider scope of agricultural commodities and more comprehensive in its membership of countries. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Global land use research to date has focused on quantifying uncertainty effects of three major drivers affecting competition for land: the uncertainty in energy and climate policies affecting competition between food and biofuels, the uncertainty of climate impacts on agriculture and forestry, and the uncertainty in the underlying technological progress driving efficiency of food, bioenergy and timber production. The market uncertainty in fossil fuel prices has received relatively less attention in the global land use literature. Petroleum and natural gas prices affect both the competitiveness of biofuels and the cost of nitrogen fertilizers. High prices put significant pressure on global land supply and greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial systems, while low prices can moderate demands for cropland. The goal of this letter is to assess and compare the effects of these core uncertainties on the optimal profile for global land use and land-based GHG emissions over the coming century. The model that we develop integrates distinct strands of agronomic, biophysical and economic literature into a single, intertemporally consistent, analytical framework, at global scale. Our analysis accounts for the value of land-based services in the production of food, first- and second-generation biofuels, timber, forest carbon and biodiversity. We find that long-term uncertainty in energy prices dominates the climate impacts and climate policy uncertainties emphasized in prior research on global land use. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Using prairie biomass as a renewable source of energy may constitute an important opportunity to improve the environmental sustainability of managed land. To date, assessments of the feasibility of using prairies for bioenergy production have focused on marginal areas with low yield potential. Growing prairies on more fertile soil or with moderate levels of fertilization may be an effective means of increasing yields, but increased fertility often reduces plant community diversity. At a fertile site in central Iowa with high production potential, we tested the hypothesis that nitrogen fertilization would increase aboveground biomass production but would decrease diversity of prairies sown and managed for bioenergy production. Over a 3 year period (years 2-4 after seeding), we measured aboveground biomass after plant senescence and species and functional-group diversity in June and August for multispecies mixtures of prairie plants that received no fertilizer or 84 kg N ha-1 year-1. We found that nitrogen fertilization increased aboveground biomass production, but with or without fertilization, the prairies produced a substantial amount of biomass: averaging (±SE) 12.2 ± 1.3 and 9.1 ± 1.0 Mg ha-1 in fertilized and unfertilized prairies, respectively. Unfertilized prairies had higher species diversity in June, whereas fertilized prairies had higher species diversity in August at the end of the study period. Functional-group diversity was almost always higher in fertilized prairies. Composition of unfertilized prairies was characterized by native C4 grasses and legumes, whereas fertilized prairies were characterized by native C3 grasses and forbs. Although most research has found that nitrogen fertilization reduces prairie diversity, our results indicate that early-spring nitrogen fertilization, when used with a postsenescence annual harvest, may increase prairie diversity. Managing prairies for bioenergy production, including the judicious use of fertilization, may be an effective means of increasing the amount of saleable products from managed lands while potentially increasing plant diversity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - ILUC is the abbreviation for Indirect Land Use Change. ILUC predictions mainly depend on the assumptions about how the additional agricultural demand for biomass production is covered. But iLUC due to agricultural growth varied strongly in the past among the different regions worldwide. Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between the development of the agricultural production and the land use changes and investigated which options (expansion of the agricultural area, increasing productivity, forest clearing etc.) supplied the feedstock demand for the growing agriculture sector in the past. Our investigations altogether show what the essential option for the increase of the biomass production has been and how it is related to the intensification of the usage of existing agricultural area, globally and even in countries with a high deforestation rate. Besides this the analysis of the main drivers of land use change in the past due to agriculture growth is essential for iLUC predictions and prevention policy. One driver was the loss of agricultural land in important areas all over the world. Our analysis shows that governance has a central influence on the development of land use. If the decoupling of production increase from the expansion of agricultural area for biomass production into nature areas wants to be achieved, it will have to happen via governance in the relevant countries. Therefore, instruments have to be developed and implemented that are able to regulate land use sophistically corresponding to the individual countries. © IJTech 2013.

AB  - Evaluating the potential of alternative energy crops across large geographic regions, as well as over time, is a necessary component to determining if biofuel production is feasible and sustainable in the face of growing production demands and climatic change. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a native perennial herbaceous grass, is a promising candidate for cellulosic feedstock production. In this study, current and future (from 2080 to 2090) productivity is estimated across the central and eastern United States using ALMANAC, a mechanistic model that simulates plant growth over time. The ALMANAC model was parameterized for representative ecotypes of switchgrass. Our results indicate substantial variation in switchgrass productivity both within regions and over time. States along the Gulf Coast, southern Atlantic Coast, and in the East North Central Midwest have the highest current biomass potential. However, these areas also contain critical wetland habitat necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and agricultural lands necessary for food production. The southern United States is predicted to have the largest decrease in future biomass production. The Great Plains are expected to experience large increases in productivity by 2080-2090 due to climate change. In general, regions where future temperature and precipitation are predicted to increase are also where larger future biomass production is expected. In contrast, regions that show a future decrease in precipitation are associated with smaller future biomass production. Switchgrass appears to be a promising biofuel crop for the central and eastern United States, with local biomass predicted to be high (>10 Mg/ha) for ~50% of the area studied for each climate scenario. In order to minimize land conversion and loss of biodiversity, areas that currently have and maintain high productivity under climate change should be targeted for their long-term growth potential. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Summary: Global declines in pollinating insects have been linked with agricultural intensification and land-use change. Increased production of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects, (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv) nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types, nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.

AB  - A previous Iowa State University (ISU) analysis published in 2010 investigated the technical and economic feasibility of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of biomass, and concluded that the pathway could produce cellulosic biofuels for a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $2.11/gal. The 2010 ISU study was largely theoretical in that no commercial-scale fast pyrolysis facilities were being constructed at the time of publication. The present analysis expands upon the 2010 ISU study by performing an updated techno-economic analysis of the fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway. Recent advances in pathway technology and commercialization and new parameters suggested by the recent literature are accounted for. The MFSP for a 2000 MTPD facility employing fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to convert corn stover to gasoline and diesel fuel is calculated to quantify the economic feasibility of the pathway. The present analysis determines the MFSP of gasoline and diesel fuel produced via fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing to be $2.57/gal. This result indicates that the pathway could be competitive with petroleum, although not as competitive as suggested by the 2010 ISU study. The present analysis also demonstrates the sensitivity of the result to process assumptions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reviews the production capacity of Polish agriculture with respect to biomass used for energy production. The forecast production potential of agricultural biomass in Poland in 2020 includes three key areas: the expected consumption of renewable energy according to energy type, the energy potential of agriculture and barriers to the use of biomass. Studies have shown that in Poland, total energy consumption will significantly increase (over 10% by 2020). Growth of demand for renewable energy will primarily result from strong growth of demand for transport bio fuels and electricity. In 2020, approximately 80% of final energy from renewable sources will come from biomass. More than three-quarters of the biomass will be generated from agriculture. In Poland, crops from 1.0 to 4.3 million ha can be used for energy production. The study shows changes in the structure of biomass use, and the analysis confirms the declining share of biomass for heat production and the increasing share of biomass for electricity and bio fuels. The main obstacles to the continued use of agricultural biomass are a lack of local markets for biomass energy and poor financial support for energy crop production.

AB  - Biofuel production from microalgal biomass could be an alternative solution to conventional biofuels typically dependent on food and high land/water demanding crops. However, the economic and energetic viability of microalgal biofuels is limited by their harvesting processes. The finding of innovative, low cost and efficient harvesting method(s) is imperative. In this study, the Electro-Coagulation (EC) was studied as a process to harvest the marine Nannochloropsis sp. microalga. Several EC operational conditions were studied and the best EC recovery efficiency (&gt;97%) was achieved using a current density of 8.3mAcm-2 for 10min. The quality of the recovered microalgal biomass was evaluated in terms of total lipids, fatty acid and pigment profile where no significant differences were observed after EC treatment. The energy requirements of the harvesting process were estimated and the combination of EC and centrifugation processes proved to decrease significantly the energy demand when compared with the individual process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine the community characteristics that lead to locating a biodiesel plant. Utilizing data that includes all biodiesel plants in the United States, we employ spatial econometrics to evaluate those characteristics that lead to a plant siting. While public policies associated with biofuels may be endogenous to location decisions, we find them unimportant except in the case of consumption mandates. Despite evidence of plant clusters, it does not appear that operating plants are critical to the siting of a new plant. Results provide insights for community leaders relative to actions that can increase the probability a plant will be built. © 2013 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Current biofuel feedstock crops such as corn lead to large environmental losses of N through nitrate leaching and N2O emissions; second-generation cellulosic crops have the potential to reduce these N losses. We measured N losses and cycling in establishing miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. fertilized with 56 kg N ha-1 yr-1), and mixed prairie, along with a corn (Zea mays L.)-corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (corn fertilized at 168-202 kg N ha-1). Nitrous oxide emissions, soil N mineralization, mid-profile nitrate leaching, and tile flow and nitrate concentrations were measured. Perennial crops quickly reduced nitrate leaching at a 50-cm soil depth as well as concentrations and loads from the tile systems (year 1 tile nitrate concentrations of 10-15 mg N L-1 declined significantly by year 4 in all perennial crops to &lt;0.6 mg N L-1, with losses of &lt;0.8 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Nitrous oxide emissions were 2.2 to 7.7 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the corn-corn-soybean rotation but were &lt;1.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1 by year 4 in the perennial crops. Overall N balances (atmospheric deposition + fertilization + soybean N2 fixation - harvest, leaching losses, and N2O emissions) were positive for corn and soybean (22 kg N ha-1 yr-1) as well as switchgrass (9.7 kg N ha-1 yr-1) but were -18 and -29 kg N h-1 yr-1 for prairie and miscanthus, respectively. Our results demonstrate rapid tightening of the N cycle as perennial biofuel crops established on a rich Mollisol soil. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America,and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - A well-to-wheels (WTW) analysis of pyrolysis-based gasoline was conducted and compared with petroleum gasoline. To address the variation and uncertainty in the pyrolysis pathways, probability distributions for key parameters were developed with data from literature. The impacts of two different hydrogen sources for pyrolysis oil upgrading and of two bio-char co-product applications were investigated. Reforming fuel gas/natural gas for H2 reduces WTW GHG emissions by 60% (range of 55-64%) compared to the mean of petroleum fuels. Reforming pyrolysis oil for H2 increases the WTW GHG emissions reduction up to 112% (range of 97-126%), but reduces petroleum savings per unit of biomass used due to the dramatic decline in the liquid fuel yield. Thus, the hydrogen source causes a trade-off between GHG reduction per unit fuel output and petroleum displacement per unit biomass used. Soil application of biochar could provide significant carbon sequestration with large uncertainty. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environmental impact of the water consumption of four typical crop rotations grown in Spain, including energy crops, was analyzed and compared against Spanish agricultural and natural reference situations. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used for the assessment of the potential environmental impact of blue water (withdrawal from water bodies) and green water (uptake of soil moisture) consumption. The latter has so far been disregarded in LCA. To account for green water, two approaches have been applied: the first accounts for the difference in green water demand of the crops and a reference situation. The second is a green water scarcity index, which measures the fraction of the soil-water plant consumption to the available green water. Our results show that, if the aim is to minimize the environmental impacts of water consumption, the energy crop rotations assessed in this study were most suitable in basins in the northeast of Spain. In contrast, the energy crops grown in basins in the southeast of Spain were associated with the greatest environmental impacts. Further research into the integration of quantitative green water assessment in LCA is crucial in studies of systems with a high dependence on green water resources. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - Alginate lyase is a promising biocatalyst because of its application in saccharification of alginate for the production of biochemicals and renewable biofuels. This study described the isolation of a new alginate metabolizing bacterium, Flavobacterium sp. S20, from sludge samples and the characterization of its alginate lyase Alg2A. The alginate lyase gene, alg2A, was obtained by constructing and screening the genomic library of the strain S20 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Substrate specificity assays indicated Alg2A preferred poly-α-l-guluronate as a substrate over poly-β-d- mannuronate. In the saccharification process of a high content (10 %, w/v) of sodium alginate, the recombinant alginate lyase Alg2A yielded 152 of mM the reducing sugars after 69 h of reaction, and the amounts of oligosaccharides with a different degree of polymerization (DP) generated by Alg2A gradually accumulated without significant variation in the distribution of oligosaccharide compositions. These results indicated that Alg2A possessed high enzymatic capability for saccharifying the alginate, which could be used in saccharifying the alginate biomass prior to the main fermentation process for biofuels. In addition, Alg2A had a different endolytic reaction mode from both the two commercial alginate lyases and other alginate lyases from polysaccharide lyase family 7 owing to high yields of penta-, hex-, and hepta-saccharides in the hydrolysis products of Alg2A. Thus, Alg2A could be a good tool for the large-scale preparation of alginate oligosaccharides with high DP. © 2012 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Sewage sludge rich in carbohydrates and other nutrients could be a good feedstock for fuel/chemical production. In this study, fungal and engineered bacterial cultivations were integrated with a modified anaerobic digestion to accumulate fatty acids on sewage sludge. The anaerobic digestion was first adjusted to enable acetogenic bacteria to accumulate acetate. A fungus (Mortierella isabellina) and an engineered bacterium (Escherichia coli created by optimizing acetate utilization and fatty acid biosynthesis as well as overexpressing a regulatory transcription factor fadR) were then cultured on the acetate solution to accumulate fatty acids. The engineered bacterium had higher fatty acid yield and titer than the fungus. Both medium- and long-chain fatty acids (C12:0-C18:0) were produced by the engineered bacterium, while the fungus mainly synthesized long-chain fatty acids (C16:0-C18:3). This study demonstrated a potential path that combines fungus or engineered bacterium with anaerobic digestion to achieve simultaneous organic waste treatment and advanced biofuel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An energy-saving ethanol fermentation technology was developed using uncooked fresh sweet potato as raw material. A mutant strain of Aspergillus niger isolated from mildewed sweet potato was used to produce abundant raw starch saccharification enzymes for treating uncooked sweet potato storage roots. The viscosity of the fermentation paste of uncooked sweet potato roots was lower than that of the cooked roots. The ethanol fermentation was carried out by Zymomonas mobilis, and 14.4. g of ethanol (87.2% of the theoretical yield) was produced from 100. g of fresh sweet potato storage roots. Based on this method, an energy-saving, high efficient and environment-friendly technology can be developed for large-scale production of fuel ethanol from sweet potato roots. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is significant interest in utilizing microalgae as a source for biofuel and bioactive products such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Diatoms are a class of single-celled microalgae which make silica cell walls and require silicic acid as a substrate for cell division. Therefore, manipulation of soluble silicon delivery to the culture offers a route to control the cell cycle and secondary or stress-induced metabolite production. A multi-stage, semi-continuous photobioreactor cultivation process was developed to produce lipid-rich algal biomass from the centric diatom Cyclotella sp. In the initial phase, algal cells were grown until the silicic acid in the medium was depleted. Next, fresh medium containing silicic acid was perfused for durations of 48, 72 or 96. h. The silicic acid was rapidly consumed by the cells, which resulted in cell growth while silicon depleted conditions were maintained. Perfusions of 48 and 72. h yielded high lipid concentrations (> 45% of dry cell weight) while maintaining biomass generation, and showed higher lipid productivity than when silicon was added as a single pulse. Seven fatty acids were identified by GC-MS, including the three main fatty acids: palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid and eicosapentanoic acid. The lipid fatty acid distribution remained constant once silicon starvation was achieved, regardless of perfusion strategy. This study illustrates that controlled delivery of silicic acid to a cell culture of Cyclotella sp. can enhance lipid production. Additionally, a mechanistic model to predict biomass and lipid production of under silicon-stress conditions has been developed, which will aid in the development of future silicon-stress based bioprocesses for the production of fatty acids or high-valued metabolites. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The marine based algal biofuel may be the best possible options for future energy, particularly for India where freshwater and land resources are limited. We have characterized a novel marine microalga, isolated from an Indian Ocean using genotypic and biochemical studies, which contain high lipids (48%) on dry wt. basis, among marine-microalgae reported from the Indian subcontinent. The classification of new species based on DNA barcodes studies using 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA has indicated its genetic similarity to green algae Parachlorella kessleri. Subsequently, FAME analysis has showed that it contain about 43%, saturated fatty acids, which makes new algal species highly suitable for further exploration and commercial production of the biodiesel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glutamic acid can hardly produce hydrogen via dark- or photo-fermentation without pretreatment. In this study, a novel process of acidogenic pretreatment with bacteria and zeolite treatment for NH4+ removal was proposed to use glutamic acid as feedstock in photo-fermentation for efficient hydrogen production. Glutamic acid pretreated with acidogenic bacteria produces soluble metabolite products. After zeolite treatment, the acidulated solution, which mainly contains acetate, butyrate, and NH4+, shows a decrease in NH4+ concentration from 36.7. mM to 3.2. mM (NH4+ removal efficiency of 91.1%). After NH4+ removal, the treated solution is incubated with photosynthetic bacteria, exhibiting a maximum hydrogen yield of 292.9. mL/g(-glutamic acid) during photo-fermentation. The residual solution from photo-fermentation is reused by methanogenic bacteria to produce a maximum methane yield of 102.7. mL/g. The heating value conversion efficiency from glutamic acid to gas fuel significantly increases from 18.9% during photo-fermentation to 40.9% in the combined photo-fermentation and methanogenesis process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The EU aspires to global leadership in developing 'sustainable biofuels' which can substitute for fossil fuels and thus reduce GHG emissions, while also enhancing energy security and rural development. Yet EU biofuel targets provide extra incentives for dispossessing rural communities in the global South, especially through land grabs and agro-industrial production methods. Since 2007 North-South NGO networks have denounced 'agrofuels' for such harm, thus provoking a high-profile controversy. Despite those criticisms, the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED) set a mandatory target for European transport fuel to contain 10% renewable energy - in practical terms, meaning mainly biofuels by the 2020 deadline. In managing the consequent tensions, the EU system has elaborated a prior vision of a feasible, desirable future through sustainable biofuels. This combines several elements: mandatory targets incentivising investment in biofuels, R&D funds stimulating future novel biofuels, techniques commoditising natural resources in the name of protecting them, sustainability criteria homogenising the environment, and rural development models dependent on agro-industrial methods; those elements have become linked through circular reasoning. The EU's political accountability is reduced to carbon accounting; in turn it is channelled into expert debates over modelling methods and uncertainties. Arguments about indirect land-use change (ILUC) became an implicit proxy for wider conflicts over the EU's 10% target. Through the ILUC debate, biofuel critics have been drawn into expert procedures which obscure people's experiences of harm in the global South. By these methods, the EU system can pursue global leadership for 'sustainable biofuels', while depoliticising its global plunder of resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of slave labour (as it is known in Brazil) among sugar cane workers within a globalising production network. It employs the Global Production Network (GPN) framework to argue that the dynamics of production networks are fundamental to the reproduction of unfree and degrading labour in this case. First, the power exercised by buyers is a key aspect of processes resulting in slave labour. Conversely, efforts to combat slave labour have been strengthened by acknowledging and working through this power. Second, the state exercises governance within the production network rather than only providing its institutional context. Beyond these dynamics, however, wider processes are involved in making labour available on particular terms and conditions. Third, then, processes of racialisation facilitate the imposition of restrictions on workers' mobility, degrading conditions and intensification of work. Labour is, in other words, devalued. This implies that the ways in which competing judgments over value are resolved merit as much attention in GPN analysis as is currently given to the creation, enhancement and capture of value. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Xylans are the major hemicelluloses in grasses, but their effects on biomass saccharification remain unclear. In this study, we examined the 79 representative Miscanthus accessions that displayed a diverse cell wall composition and varied biomass digestibility. Correlation analysis showed that hemicelluloses level has a strong positive effect on lignocellulose enzymatic digestion after NaOH or H2SO4 pretreatment. Characterization of the monosaccharide compositions in the KOH-extractable and non-KOH-extractable hemicelluloses indicated that arabinose substitution degree of xylan is the key factor that positively affects biomass saccharification. The xylose/arabinose ratio after individual enzyme digestion revealed that the arabinose in xylan is partially associated with cellulose in the amorphous regions, which negatively affects cellulose crystallinity for high biomass digestibility. The results provide insights into the mechanism of lignocellulose enzymatic digestion upon pretreatment, and also suggest a goal for the genetic modification of hemicelluloses towards the bioenergy crop breeding of Miscanthus and grasses. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Biological sequestration can increase the carbon stocks of non-atmospheric reservoirs (e.g. land and land-based products). Since this contained carbon is sequestered from, and retained outside, the atmosphere for a period of time, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is temporarily reduced and some radiative forcing is avoided. Carbon removal from the atmosphere and storage in the biosphere or anthroposphere, therefore, has the potential to mitigate climate change, even if the carbon storage and associated benefits might be temporary. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting (CF) are increasingly popular tools for the environmental assessment of products, that take into account their entire life cycle. There have been significant efforts to develop robust methods to account for the benefits, if any, of sequestration and temporary storage and release of biogenic carbon. However, there is still no overall consensus on the most appropriate ways of considering and quantifying it. Method: This paper reviews and discusses six available methods for accounting for the potential climate impacts of carbon sequestration and temporary storage or release of biogenic carbon in LCA and CF. Several viewpoints and approaches are presented in a structured manner to help decision-makers in their selection of an option from competing approaches for dealing with timing issues, including delayed emissions of fossil carbon. Results: Key issues identified are that the benefits of temporary carbon removals depend on the time horizon adopted when assessing climate change impacts and are therefore not purely science-based but include value judgments. We therefore did not recommend a preferred option out of the six alternatives presented here. Conclusions: Further work is needed to combine aspects of scientific and socio-economic understanding with value judgements and ethical considerations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: Biofuels have received special research interest, driven by concerns over high fuel prices, security of energy supplies, global climate change as well as the search of opportunities for rural economic development. This work examines the production of biodiesel derived from the transesterification of crude rapeseed oil, one of the most important sources of biodiesel in Europe, paying special attention to the environmental profile-associated to the manufacture life cycle (i.e., cradle-to-gate perspective). Methods: To do so, a Spanish company with an average annual biodiesel production of 300,000 t was assessed in detail. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study covers the whole life cycle, from the production of the crude rapeseed oil to the biodiesel production and storage. The inventory data for the foreground system consisted of average annual data obtained by on-site measurements in the company, and background data were taken from databases. Seven impact categories have been assessed in detail: abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, land competition, and photochemical oxidant formation. An energy analysis was carried out based on the cumulative nonrenewable fossil and nuclear energy demand as an additional impact category. Furthermore, well-to-wheels environmental characterization results were estimated and compared per ton-kilometer for the biodiesel (B100) and the conventional diesel so as to point out the environmental drawbacks and strengths of using biodiesel as transport fuel in a 28 t lorry. Results and discussion: The results showed that the cultivation of the rapeseed was the main key issue in environmental terms (68 %-100 % depending on the category) mainly because of fertilizer doses and intensive agricultural practices required. With regard to the biorefinery production process, pretreatment and transesterification sections considerably contribute to the environmental profile mostly due to electricity and chemical requirements. Concerning the well-to-wheels comparison, using B100 derived from rapeseed oil instead of petroleum-based diesel would reduce nonrenewable energy dependence (-20 %), GHG emissions (-74 %), and ozone layer depletion (-44 %) but would increase acidification (+59 %), eutrophication (+214 %), photochemical smog (+119 %), and land competition. Conclusions: The information presented in this study could help to promote the use of renewable transport biofuels. However, the extensive implementation of biodiesel (particularly rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel) in our society is enormously complex with many issues involved not only from environmental but also economical and social points of view. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: The results of published Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of biofuels are characterized by a large variability, arising from the diversity of both biofuel chains and the methodologies used to estimate inventory data. Here, we suggest that the best option to maximize the accuracy of biofuel LCA is to produce local results taking into account the local soil, climatic and agricultural management factors. Methods: We focused on a case study involving the production of first-generation ethanol from sugar beet in the Picardy region in Northern France. To account for local factors, we first defined three climatic patterns according to rainfall from a 20-year series of weather data. We subsequently defined two crop rotations with sugar beet as a break crop, corresponding to current practice and an optimized management scenario, respectively. The six combinations of climate types and rotations were run with the process-based model CERES-EGC to estimate crop yields and environmental emissions. We completed the data inventory and compiled the impact assessments using Simapro v.7.1 and Ecoinvent database v2.0. Results: Overall, sugar beet ethanol had lower impacts than gasoline for the abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidation categories. In particular, it emitted between 28 % and 42 % less greenhouse gases than gasoline. Conversely, sugar beet ethanol had higher impacts than gasoline for acidification and eutrophication due to losses of reactive nitrogen in the arable field. Thus, LCA results were highly sensitive to changes in local conditions and management factors. As a result, an average impact figures for a given biofuel chain at regional or national scales may only be indicative within a large uncertainty band. Conclusions: Although the crop model made it possible to take local factors into account in the life-cycle inventory, best management practices that achieved high yields while reducing environmental impacts could not be identified. Further modelling developments are necessary to better account for the effects of management practices, in particular regarding the benefits of fertiliser incorporation into the topsoil in terms of nitrogen losses abatement. Supplementary data and modelling developments also are needed to better estimate the emissions of pesticides and heavy metals in the field. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Treatment of wastewater while producing microalgal biomass is receiving ever-increasing attention, particularly in the biofuels arena. In this study, a wastewater chlorophyte isolate, Kirchneriella sp., was tested for its ability to be mass cultivated, utilize nutrients from defined media and wastewater, and produce bioproducts of commercial interest. Growth studies were carried out in various systems at scales up to 60L, with Kirchneriella sp. showing an excellent amenability to being cultured. Biomass concentrations of greater than 1gL-1 were consistently achieved, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake was rapid, and stable medium-term cultures were maintained. Nitrogen limitation affected biomass yield, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield, and cetane index. In contrast, a low phosphorus condition had no effect. Kirchneriella sp. showed an ability to produce several products of commercial value, including carbohydrate-rich biomass, FAME/biodiesel and the pigments β,β-carotene and lutein. © 2012.

AB  - The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates large increases in ethanol for transport, from about 6 billion gallons current annual production to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The act mandates that large portions of ethanol be cellulosic ethanol. Although there are a number of potential feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol, it is highly likely that much of the feedstock will come from the timber base as raw wood, especially in the early years before grass production, and alternative feedstock, has become well-developed and infrastructure networks created. This article uses a well-known timber projections model to estimate the impact of the potential near doubling of demand for industrial type resulting from the mandates and finds that real prices could raise 15-20%. It also projects a large increase in the importation of processed wood products as domestic wood products production is crowded out by high raw wood prices. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The use of forest wastes for the production of bioenergy and liquid biofuels has the potential to offset the use of fossil energy sources. Some studies suggest biofuel and bioenergy produced from the removal of forest waste-products considered to be uneconomical to harvest-generates significant well-to-tank greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings by displacing energy produced from fossil resources. In parallel, an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfire both empirically observed and predicted by climate change models has highlighted the need to actively manage forests to increase the resilience of forests to wildfire. Integrated analysis that takes into account the dynamic interactions between carbon (C) pools resulting from forest management practices; forest fire behavior; and the fate of forest biomass in debris, forest products, and energy production will provide a consistent framework for policy planning that maximize the overall benefits of GHG policy. This integrated approach will have a better chance of balancing the trade-offs and maximizing synergies between C management and sustainability goals. This article outlines a life cycle accounting framework for evaluating the GHG benefits of utilizing forest biomass for bioenergy production under various forest management strategies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Forest fires pose a great risk to nearby communities and dwellings. Many forest managers work to reduce such risks by managing fuels. This article explains the economic and logistical factors of a forest biomass utilization option instead of the conventional disposal method of on-site piling and burning for fuel reduction. Benefits from biomass utilization are multiple and include reduced impacts to air quality, improved forest health, economic opportunities, local renewable energy production, and climate change mitigation. Trials in the Superior National Forest examined the feasibility of using conventional equipment to extract and utilize forest biomass compared with disposal of biomass with pile and burn techniques. Factors that increase the costs of biomass utilization include: machinery down-time, distance to end users, low biomass price, size of the harvest unit, forwarding distance, the number of machines hauled to sites to complete small-sized operations, the modest amount of biomass removed per acre and applying prescriptions that were not designed for extraction logistics. Interviews with forest machine operators during and after the trials helped clarify factors and logistics considerations, which could be applied to help reduce the cost of future operations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This research uses GTAP model to assess the expected future effects of national and global biofuels policies on agriculture markets and food prices in Pakistan. Our results show that by 2020, global mandates on biofuels will significantly affect the prices, production and trade of major feedstock crops such as sugarcane, maize, soybean and rapeseed, especially in the USA, Brazil and EU. Global biofuels developments are projected to increase the prices of maize, rapeseed, soybean, and sugarcane in Pakistan. Pakistan will benefit from improved trade balance in agriculture under the global-only scenario. Under Pakistan plus three-producer's biofuels scenario, the price and production of sugarcane in Pakistan will increase substantially. Under this scenario, the country will face considerable loss in agricultural trade. Consequently, food-security of net-buyers may be threatened. The income of feedstock farmers will increase. Higher crude oil prices will strongly influence commodity markets via increased production of biofuels and agricultural production costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a stochastic production planning model for a biofuel supply chain under demand and price uncertainties. The supply chain consists of biomass suppliers, biofuel refinery plants and distribution centers. A stochastic linear programming model is proposed within a single-period planning framework to maximize the expected profit. Decisions such as the amount of raw materials purchased, the amount of raw materials consumed and the amount of products produced are considered. Demands of end products are uncertain with known probability distributions. The prices of end products follow Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Benders decomposition (BD) with Monte Carlo simulation technique is applied to solve the proposed model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model and the decomposition algorithm, a representative supply chain for an ethanol plant in North Dakota is considered. To investigate the results of the proposed model, a simulation framework is developed to compare the performances of deterministic model and proposed stochastic model. The results from the simulation indicate the proposed model obtain higher expected profit than the deterministic model under different uncertainty settings. Sensitivity analyses are performed to gain management insight on how profit changes due to the uncertainties affect the model developed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To meet rising energy demands in a sustainable manner, the United States Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) mandates the production of 3.78. billion L (1. billion gallons) of biomass-based biodiesel per year by 2020. Urban marginal lands, herein defined as lots with poor agricultural potential and unfit for residential purposes, can be used to cultivate biodiesel feedstock, which can contribute toward the RFS2. GIS is particularly well suited to identify the amount and location of these urban marginal lands. Biofuel crop production is one way for urban neighborhoods to reclaim vacant, blighted properties and also generate green energy for consumption.Combining soil classification data with urban development data, a GIS framework was developed to determine the amount of urban marginal land available in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This location was chosen because small-scale sunflower crops are already being grown on urban marginal lands for biodiesel production. This paper evaluates two methods for identifying marginal lands for biofuel cultivation. The first is based on NRCS soil classifications derived from previous literature approaches. When compared with the locations of a nonprofit that is actually cultivating marginal lands, the NRCS soil classification method captures less than 35% of the marginal lands being cultivated in Pittsburgh, and 2400. ha (6000. acres) of marginal land in total that could be used to grow sunflowers for biodiesel production. We modify the NRCS marginal soil classification method to include certain types of urban commercial lands and lands not currently classified as marginal, and create a framework that identifies almost 90% of the marginal lands currently under cultivation in Pittsburgh, with approximately 3500. ha (8700 acres) of available marginal lands. Pittsburgh's marginal lands could be used to produce up to 129,000. L (34,100. gallons) of sunflower-based biodiesel. This could contribute a maximum of 0.1% to Pennsylvania's biofuel mandate and 0.003% to the RFS2. While a city's individual contribution may be incremental on the national scale, multiple cities and regions may be able to contribute to the RFS2. In addition, there is an unquantified social benefit that results from community engagement and revitalization, which is part of the mission of the Pittsburgh nonprofit. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are often presented as a contribution toward the solution of the problems related to the world's strong dependency on fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gas effects and urban pollution, in addition to being a way to support rural development. Biomass is the most important renewable energy source and the state of Amazon in Brazil, which is completely covered by the Amazon rainforest, has great potential as a source of biomass. The aim of this research was to study the conversion process of the seed residue of Amazon-tucumã (Astrocaryum aculeatum) into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis. The seed residue was ground and samples with a diameter smaller than 2 mm were pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized bed of inert silica sand. The residence time of gases was maintained at 1.4 s with the reactor temperatures ranging from 400 to 600 °C. All liquid and solid products generated during the process were weighed, analyzed, and characterized (HHV, GC-MS, ultimate analysis and ash mineral analysis). The produced bio-oil was a homogeneous fuel, with a maximum liquid yield of 60 wt% at 500 °C, with a water-free high heating value (HHV) of 20.2 MJ/kg. The highest water-free HHV (30.5 MJ/kg) was found at 550 °C, for which the liquid yield was around 55 wt%. The results demonstrated that there is a great potential for using the bio-oil from Amazon-tucumã for bio-fuel production in addition to the production of some high-value compounds, such as levoglucosan and guaiacol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - US renewable fuels policy strongly encourages biomass crop production, which should lead to expansion of biomass heating scenarios. Chemical composition of grass biomass can be extremely variable, depending on species, soil fertility, and harvest management. Biomass quality concerns have hindered the development of grass biomass for residential combustion, with no comprehensive evaluation system for grass pellet quality. Quality labeling will strengthen the fledgling grass biomass heating market, gain consumer confidence, and help to control combustion related emissions. The proposed system sums qualitatively different parameters into one Quality Index for relative evaluation and ranking of grass pellets for residential combustion potential. Parameters were selected and weighted for their relative importance based on available literature. Weighting was accomplished by adjusting the compositional working range for each parameter. A limit also was established for each parameter, beyond which the pellet lot was considered as unacceptable for residential combustion, regardless of the total Quality Index score. The model structure allows for effective evaluation and ranking of grass pellet lots regardless of the specific values ultimately chosen for acceptable limits and working ranges by the industry. Applying the Quality Index to a range of grass pellet types resulted in a reasonable ranking of pellets based on physical characteristics and composition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Third generation biodiesel production from microalgae currently necessitates many stages, some of which are complex and energy consuming, cell disruption is such an example. Microalgal strains which are prime candidates for oil extraction normally possess a robust cell wall which prevents the release of intracellular products, and breaking them can be energy intensive. This study investigated several laboratory scale methods (solid and liquid shear, thermolysis, and microwave and laser treatments) to disrupt Nannochloropsis oculata cells with a view to monitor the treatment efficiency and induced damage traits. Bright field microscopy analysis was used to quantify the reduction of intact cells as a function of time, whilst measuring the treatment's cumulative energy requirements. A figure of merit was defined to assess the relative energy consumption, taking into consideration the percentage disruption, energy consumed and the volume fraction utilised of the system. The greatest disruption was achieved with laser treatment, with a mean value of 96.53. ±0.92% (standard error of the mean, n=30; 16.0. MJ/L of laser power, scaled to per litre); microwave treatment 94.92 ± 1.38% (74.6. MJ/L); mechanical solid shear yielded cell disruption of 92.95. ±0.97% (540. MJ/L); thermolysis 87.72 ± 1.82% (20.1. MJ/L); liquid shear ultrasonication was least effective with a mean disruption of 67.66 ± 1.97% (132. MJ/L). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been widely planted without knowing its standard package of practice for optimizing the yield. Therefore, a standardized agro-technology of Jatropha is required. With this purpose, in this study an elite accession of Jatropha was planted at seven sites in India, covering a range of edapho-climatic conditions. Three experimental trials (spacing, pruning and irrigation and fertilizer) were carried out wherein its growth and yield performance were assessed for five years (2007-2012) at all the sites. The growth characters like plant height and number of branches showed significant variations among the sites and the effects of treatments were not uniform across the sites, indicating that site-specific package of practices should be followed instead of adopting the general recommendations. The seed yield was disappointing to recommend it randomly for large scale plantations on degraded lands in India. But results from the multi-location trials have shown good prospects at semi-arid (Bhavnagar) and drylands (Hyderabad); where plants in close spacing (2 × 2 m) produced significantly higher seed yield per unit area upto 1.4 t ha-1 (Bhavnagar) in comparison to wide spacing. Pruning showed a negative effect on seed yield during initial five years. We found that the following prescription was sufficient to optimize the yield on India's degraded soils: irrigation at a 30 day interval, and for each planting hole 2 kg of Farm Yard Manure (organic manure) and nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium at 10 g, 20 g, and 10 g, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research develops a linear programming (LP) model to assess various options for sugar and biofuel production from sugarcane and other feedstock in Hawaii. More specifically, the study focuses on finding optimal sugar and biomass feedstock that would maximize producer profits in the production of sugar, ethanol and electricity. Feedstock included in the model were sugarcane, banagrass, energy cane and sweet sorghum. Given available land resources for growing energy crops on the island of Maui, four land resource scenarios were considered. If available land resources were used in the production of sugarcane and energy crops with added utilization of non-prime lands, Hawaii's ethanol goal for year 2020 could be achieved while maintaining two-thirds of Hawaii's current sugar production. Crop yields and unit production costs are key factors in determining optimal quantities of feedstock in the optimization model tested in this study. © 2012.

AB  - The aim of this work was to characterize ingestates and their corresponding digestates obtained in two full-scale biogas production plants processing a) mixtures of organic wastes in co-digestion, and b) pig slurry in order to assess the organic matter transformation during anaerobic digestion by means of chemical analysis and 13CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy. Results proved that digestates obtained by different organic substrates exhibited significant chemical differences related to the different initial composition of substrates. We proposed the use of the aliphaticity index in order to highlight the different chemical nature of ingestates and their corresponding digestates. In order to verify whether the AD process leads to stabilized final products regardless the initial composition of biomass in view of a possible agronomical use of digestate, a comparison of CPMAS 13C NMR data of a number of ingestates and digestates available in literature was carried out. Results indicated that most of the aromatic structures present in the substrate tend to degrade during the process and that anaerobic digestion proceeds through preferential degradation of carbohydrates such as cellulose and hemicellulose and, as a consequence, concentration of more chemically recalcitrant aliphatic molecules occurs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy and energy services are the backbone of growth and development in India and is increasingly dependent upon the use of fossil based fuels that lead to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and related concerns. Algal biofuels are being evolved as carbon (C)-neutral alternative biofuels. Algae are photosynthetic microorganisms that convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to various sugars and lipids Tri-Acyl-Glycols (TAG) and show promise as an alternative, renewable and green fuel source for India. Compared to land based oilseed crops algae have potentially higher yields (5-12 g/m2/d) and can use locations and water resources not suited for agriculture. Within India, there is little additional land area for algal cultivation and therefore needs to be carried out in places that are already used for agriculture, e. g. flooded paddy lands (20 Mha) with village level technologies and on saline wastelands (3 Mha). Cultivating algae under such conditions requires novel multi-tier, multi-cyclic approaches of sharing land area without causing threats to food and water security as well as demand for additional fertilizer resources by adopting multi-tier cropping (algae-paddy) in decentralized open pond systems. A large part of the algal biofuel production is possible in flooded paddy crop land before the crop reaches dense canopies, in wastewaters (40 billion litres per day), in salt affected lands and in nutrient/diversity impoverished shallow coastline fishery. Mitigation will be achieved through avoidance of GHG, C-capture options and substitution of fossil fuels. Estimates made in this paper suggest that nearly half of the current transportation petro-fuels could be produced at such locations without disruption of food security, water security or overall sustainability. This shift can also provide significant mitigation avenues. The major adaptation needs are related to socio-technical acceptance for reuse of various wastelands, wastewaters and waste-derived energy and by-products through policy and attitude change efforts. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane produced in Brazil has several environmental advantages. However, burning residues, which leads to GHG and black carbon (BC) emissions, has been used to facilitate manual harvest. BC emissions have a net warming effect and cause health problems. Mechanized harvest without burning is gradually replacing manually harvested burned sugarcane. Global warming potential (GWP) and human health indicators of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil, in the pre-mechanization (100% burned), current (∼50% burned) and future (100% without burning) scenarios, were calculated. In the past, the GWP of ethanol production was 1.1kgCO2eqL-1 and BC emissions were 32.6kgCO2eqL-1. The human health impact in disability adjusted life years (DALY) was 3.16E-05DALYL-1 ethanol. The current ethanol production process has a GWP 46% smaller, while BC emissions are seven times smaller than before mechanization started. The human health impact is currently 7.72E-06DALYL-1. In the future, with complete mechanization and the integration of first and second generation ethanol, the expected GWP emissions will be 70% smaller, and BC emissions will be 216 times smaller than when all sugarcane was harvested with burning. These results show that ethanol production in Brazil is improving in terms of global warming and human health aspects. Other upstream aspects of ethanol production such as direct and indirect land use change, and downstream impacts such as the emissions of acetaldehydes were not considered in this study, which focused on a major technological shift in residue management in the agricultural phase of sugarcane ethanol production. A broader assessment of the sustainability of ethanol must account for those issues, as well as economic and social aspects. Sugarcane-derived ethanol produced in Brazil has been considered one of the most sustainable biofuels options, but it is essential to identify and promote practices and policies that further improve its production, such as the phase out of pre-harvest sugarcane burning and the increase in ethanol yield per unit of area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is currently great interest in microalgae as sources of renewable energy and biofuels. Many algae species have a high lipid content and can be grown on non-arable land using alternate water sources such as seawater. This paper discusses in detail the issue of sustainability of commercial-scale microalgae production of biofuels with particular focus on land, water, nutrients (N and P) and CO2 requirements and highlights some of the key issues in the very large scale culture of microalgae which is required for biofuels. The use of genetically modified algae is also considered. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Early in the history of life, algae changed the planet's atmosphere by producing oxygen, thus paving the way for the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. In an era in which the consumption of fossil fuels is a prime topic of concern, few people realize that the oil we currently exploit comes mostly from Cretaceous deposits of marine algae. Moving from ancient times to the present, the algae remain more important than most people realize. Today, the production of oxygen by algae (ca. 50% of all oxygen production) is another reason for saying "our lives depend on algae." Those who love seafood should thank the algae because algae are the primary producers upon which aquatic ecosystems depend. Thanks should come from all who are vegetarians or omnivores, because all land plants derive from a freshwater class of green algae and all land-animals-including the cows that provide the steaks for meat-lovers-depend directly or indirectly on land plants for food and often for shelter as well. As we use up the oil deposits provided by the ancient algae, we are turning to the modern algae for help. Given the photosynthetic abilities of the algae, they are one of the major focuses for sustainable biofuel production and CO2 consumption. Finally, the algae that give us the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the fuel for our cars (past and, perhaps, future), are also a source of active pharmaceutical compounds that can be used against drug-resistant bacterial strains, viruses (including Herpes Simplex and AIDS), and cancers. Roses are pretty and oak trees are impressive, but no other groups of "plants" have done so much, for so long, and, for so many as have the algae! © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - Algae biomass is an attractive biofuel feedstock when grown with high productivity on marginal land. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) produces more oil from algae than lipid extraction (LE) does because protein and carbohydrates are converted, in part, to oil. Since nitrogen in the algae biomass is incorporated into the HTL oil, and since lipid extracted algae for generating heat and electricity are not co-produced by HTL, there are questions regarding implications for emissions and energy use. We studied the HTL and LE pathways for renewable diesel (RD) production by modeling all essential operations from nutrient manufacturing through fuel use. Our objective was to identify the key relationships affecting HTL energy consumption and emissions. LE, with identical upstream growth model and consistent hydroprocessing model, served as reference. HTL used 1. 8 fold less algae than did LE but required 5. 2 times more ammonia when nitrogen incorporated in the HTL oil was treated as lost. HTL RD had life cycle emissions of 31,000 gCO2 equivalent (gCO2e) compared to 21,500 gCO2e for LE based RD per million BTU of RD produced. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased when yields exceeded 0. 4 g HTL oil/g algae because insufficient carbon was left for biogas generation. Key variables in the analysis were the HTL oil yield, the hydrogen demand during upgrading, and the nitrogen content of the HTL oil. Future work requires better data for upgrading renewable oils to RD and requires consideration of nitrogen recycling during upgrading. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Six microalgal species were examined in this study to determine their effectiveness in the coupling of piggery wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. The dry biomasses of Ourococcus multisporus, Nitzschia cf. pusilla, Chlamydomonas mexicana, Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris, and Micractinium reisseri were 0.34 ± 0.08, 0.37 ± 0.13, 0.56 ± 0.35, 0.53 ± 0.30, 0.49 ± 0.26, and 0.35 ± 0.08 g dwt/L, respectively. The highest removal of nitrogen (62%), phosphorus (28%), and inorganic carbon (29%) were achieved by C. mexicana. In the absence of microalgae, the spontaneous precipitation of phosphorus, calcium, and inorganic carbon occurred at slightly alkaline pH. The highest lipid productivity and lipid content (0.31 ± 0.03 g/L and 33 ± 3%, respectively) were found in C. mexicana. The fatty acid compositions of the studied species were mainly palmitic, linoleic, α-linolenic, and oleic. The results of our study suggest that C. mexicana is one of the most promising candidates for simultaneous nutrient removal and high-efficient biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global demand for bio-fuels continues unabated. Rising concerns over environmental pollution and global warming have encouraged the movement to alternate fuels, the world ethanol market is projected to reach 86 billion litres this year. Bioethanol is currently produced from land-based crops such as corn and sugar cane. A continued use of these crops drives the food versus fuel debate. An alternate feed-stock which is abundant and carbohydrate-rich is necessary. The production of such a crop should be sustainable, and, reduce competition with production of food, feed, and industrial crops, and not be dependent on agricultural inputs (pesticides, fertilizer, farmable land, water). Marine biomass could meet these challenges, being an abundant and carbon neutral renewable resource with potential to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions and the man-made impact on climate change. Here we examine the current cultivation technologies for marine biomass and the environmental and economic aspects of using brown seaweeds for bio-ethanol production. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Enzyme-based biofuel cells implanted into living lobsters or designed as fluidic systems mimicking human blood circulation were used for powering electronic devices. Two lobsters with implanted biofuel cells connected in series were able to generate open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.2 V and an electrical watch, selected as a model electronic device, was activated by the power extracted from the "living battery". The fluidic system composed of five cells filled with human serum solution connected in series generated Voc of ca. 3 V and was able to power a pacemaker. Sustainable operation of the pacemaker was achieved with the system closely mimicking human physiological conditions characteristic of normal and pathophysiological glucose concentrations with the fluidic rate typical for a blood circulation upon resting or performing physical exercises. While the "cyborg" lobsters demonstrate a model system with future possible military, homeland security and environmental monitoring applications, the system activating a pacemaker presents practicality for biomedical applications. The first demonstration of the pacemaker activated by the physiologically produced electrical energy shows promise for future electronic implantable medical devices powered by electricity harvested from the human body. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - The use of algae for biofuel production is expected to play an important role in securing energy supply in the next decades. A consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and an energy analysis of seaweed-based biofuel production were carried out in Nordic conditions to document and improve the sustainability of the process. Two scenarios were analyzed for the brown seaweed (Laminaria digitata), namely, biogas production (scenario 1) and bioethanol. +. biogas production (scenario 2). Potential environmental impact categories under investigation were Global Warming, Acidification and Terrestrial Eutrophication. The production of seaweed was identified to be the most energy intensive step. Scenario 1 showed better performance compared to scenario 2 for all impact categories, partly because of the energy intensive bioethanol separation process and the consequently lower overall efficiency of the system. For improved environmental performance, focus should be on optimization of seaweed production, bioethanol distillation, and management of digestate on land. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate energy, economic, and environmental performances of seven categories of biodiesel feedstocks by using the mixed-unit input-output life cycle assessment method. Various feedstocks have different environmental performances, indicating potential environmental problem-shift. Jatropha seed, castor seed, waste cooking oil, and waste extraction oil are preferred feedstocks for biodiesel production in the short term. Positive net energy yields and positive net economic benefits of biodiesel from these four feedstocks are 2.3-52.0% of their life cycle energy demands and 74.1-448.4% of their economic costs, respectively. Algae are preferred in the long term mainly due to their less arable land demands. Special attention should be paid to potential environmental problems accompanying feedstock choice: freshwater use, ecotoxicity potentials, photochemical oxidation potential, acidification potential and eutrophication potential. Moreover, key processes are identified by sensitivity analysis to direct future technology improvements. Finally, supporting measures are proposed to optimize China's biodiesel development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing demand for woody biomass increases the price of this limited resource, motivating the growing interest in using woody materials of lower quality as well as non-woody biomass fuels for heat production in Europe. The challenges in using non-woody biomass as fuels are related to the variability of the chemical composition and in certain fuel properties that may induce problems during combustion. The objective of this work has been to evaluate the technical and environmental performance of a 15. kW pellet boiler when operated with different pelletized biomass fuels, namely straw (Triticum aestivum), Miscanthus (Miscanthus× giganteus), maize (Zea mays), wheat bran, vineyard pruning (from Vitis vinifera), hay, Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and wood (from Picea abies) with 5% rye flour. The gaseous and dust emissions as well as the boiler efficiency were investigated and compared with the legal requirements defined in the FprEN 303-5 (final draft of the European standard 303-5). It was found that the boiler control should be improved to better adapt the combustion conditions to the different properties of the agricultural fuels. Additionally, there is a need for a frequent cleaning of the heat exchangers in boilers operated with agricultural fuels to avoid efficiency drops after short term operation. All the agricultural fuels satisfied the legal requirements defined in the FprEN 303-5, with the exception of dust emissions during combustion of straw and Sorghum. Miscanthus and vineyard pruning were the best fuels tested showing comparable emission values to wood combustion. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED) requires biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 35% compared to fossil fuels in order to count towards mandatory biofuel quota or to be eligible for financial support schemes. This reduction target will rise to 50% in 2017. For biofuel producers this implies that they want or need to calculate their emissions. The purpose of this paper is to compare two calculation tools for economic operators that are on their way to the market: the "BioGrace tool" and the "Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) GHG tool" for GHG calculations under the Renewable Energy Directive (both of which are freely available). Greenhouse gas emissions from four production pathways were calculated: ethanol from wheat, ethanol from sugarcane, biodiesel from rapeseed and biodiesel from palm oil. In addition, three land use change (LUC) scenarios were calculated: for expansion of the biofuel cultivation area to grassland and to forest (10-30% canopy cover) and for improvement of agricultural practices. Both tools follow the methodology of the European Renewable Energy Directive and exactly the same input data along the production chain was used. Despite this, the results were significantly different. GHG emissions of the pathway ethanol from wheat were 21% lower when calculated with the BioGrace tool than with the RSB GHG tool. Differences were most pronounced in the cultivation phase with 20% deviation between the tools for biodiesel from palm oil and 35% deviation for ethanol from wheat and sugarcane. In practice this means that an economic operator can enhance the GHG performance of his biofuel by 20-35% by using a different calculation tool without improving the production process. We identified the use of different standard values in the two tools, in particular for the production of N-fertilisers, for chemicals and electricity and one methodological choice regarding the calculation of field N2O emissions as source of these differences. This methodological point is not specified in the Renewable Energy Directive, giving economic operators and tool developers free choice. GHG emissions from land use changes varied by -14% to 49% due to differences in carbon stock data, methodological differences in allocation and a lack of precise land use type definitions. We conclude from the results that there is a need for a deep harmonisation in the calculation process that goes beyond the methodological framework set up in current legislation. These findings are relevant because they show a policy gap, a regulatory gap that needs to be addressed by policy makers in order to guarantee a level playing field on the market and to create an incentive to improve the GHG performance of biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several key indicators of the sustainability of biofuels are related to the land used to produce the feedstock. Most of the agronomic costs and energy use (fertilizers, herbicides, soil preparation, and harvesting) are more related to the cropped area than to the feedstock quantity produced; this is also the case of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O) and land use change (LUC) impacts, both direct (dLUC) and indirect (iLUC), socio-economic impacts (land tenure, land prices and traditional crop displacement), impacts on biodiversity and on the environment (soil, water and air). Today, biofuels use only a little more than 2% of the world arable land but if their use to displace fossil fuels increases, as indicated by some low carbon scenarios, the land demand for the production of feedstocks could become a constraint to the expansion. It is quite apparent that the biofuel yields, present and future, should be one of the main characteristics to be evaluated in the initial screening process. This work uses the cases of corn and sugarcane ethanol to draw some comparisons on the use of these biofuels to meet the targets of some of the International Energy Agency (IEA) biofuel use scenarios in terms of land demand and also will use some of the most important study results concerning the GHG emission reduction potential, including LUC and iLUC impacts, when meeting the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of the European Union (EU) and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) of the USA. Some technology improvements will be considered including the integration of first and second generation technologies in the same site processing corn or sugarcane for ethanol. The results of the simulations indicated that the land demands for the 2030 projected ethanol production in the two alternatives seems not to give reasons for concern on a global scale, but are large enough to produce significant local impacts. The GHG abatement potential is strongly dependent on the biofuel alternative considered. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol production from sugarcane under Brazilian conditions has resulted in positive economic, energetic and environmental indicators, primarily due to a high agro-industrial yield, recycling of by-products and bagasse utilization for power generation. Following the trends of improvement in the overall processes and increasing environmental constraints, the extensive use of labor and previous burning in sugarcane harvesting has been progressively replaced by mechanical harvesting without the need for burning. Currently, this operation is performed in three ways: manual harvesting with previous burning, mechanical harvesting with previous burning, and mechanical harvesting of green sugarcane. Generally, the main reason for use of previous burning in sugarcane fields is the elimination of straw to facilitate manual cutting. However, studies indicate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and, mainly, other pollutants. associated with this practice. In Brazil, specific environmental laws and protocols have established a progressive reduction in previous burning aimed at total elimination in the next decade. In addition, an increase in the use of mechanical harvesting due to high productivity compared with manual cutting has been observed. In this context, this study has estimated the specific GHG emissions (tonCO2eq/ha) in sugarcane harvesting as a function of the simultaneous reduction of previous burning and increase in the use of mechanization. The estimates were applied to the sugarcane harvesting area of the São Paulo State, which is responsible for approximately half of Brazilian production. Considering the period between 1990 and 2009, the GHG emissions from sugarcane fields were estimated considering the shares of areas with mechanical harvesting and previous burning use, agricultural yield, diesel consumption by machinery, and straw/stalk ratio. The estimation was carried out using two approaches: an estimation that considered only the share of areas with harvesting practices, and a complete estimation, in which all parameters were accounted for over the years. In a Business as Usual scenario (BAU), the specific GHG emissions progressed from 1.015 to 0.633tonCO2eq/ha using the first approach, and from 1.053 to 0.639tonCO2eq/ha with the second. The reduction represented a change of 37.6% and 39.3% in the last 20years, respectively. The progressive decrease in previous burning was determining factor for this observation, responsible for an average of 80% of total emissions from harvesting operations. Two additional Reference Scenarios were considered: the sugarcane was manually harvested in the first scenario and mechanically harvested in the second. When compared with the BAU scenario, the average reduction of GHG emissions was 17.4% and 26.7%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - According to directives 2003/30/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, Member States should promote the use of biofuel. Consequently, since 2011 all fuels on the market used for transport purpose must contain a fraction of 5.75% renewable energy sources. Ethanol in gasoline is a promising solution to reach this objective. In addition to decrease the dependence on fossil fuel, ethanol contributes to reducing air pollutant emissions during combustion (carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbons), and has a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions. These considerations rely on numerous emission studies performed in standard conditions (20-30 °C), however, very few emission data are available for cold ambient temperatures, as they prevail in winter times in e.g., Northern Europe. This paper presents a chassis dynamometer study examining the effect of ethanol (E75-E85) versus gasoline (E5) at standard and low ambient temperatures (22 °C and -7 °C, respectively). Emissions of modern passenger cars complying with the latest European standards (Euro4 and Euro5a) were recorded over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Common Artemis Driving Cycle (CADC). Unregulated compounds such as methane, ammonia, and small chain hydrocarbons were monitored by an online Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectrometer. In addition, a number of ozone precursors (carbonyls and volatile organic hydrocarbons) were collected and analyzed offline by liquid and gas chromatography in order to evaluate the ozone formation potential (OFP) of the exhaust. Results showed higher unregulated emissions at -7 °C than at 22 °C, regardless of the ethanol content in the fuel blend. More carbonyls were associated with oxygenated fuel, and acetaldehyde emissions were found particularly enhanced at -7 °C with E75. In addition, elevated methane emission was measured at low ambient temperature when ethanol fuel was used. Moreover, the OFP of the exhaust gas at -7 °C increased with the amount of ethanol in gasoline when the cold start excess emissions were included. However, regardless of the ambient temperature, the ammonia and toluene emissions associated to E75-E85 were lower than with E5. © 2012.

AB  - Over decades, Thailand energy consumption has been concentrated in three main sectors, namely manufacturing, power and transportation. Energy consumption in transportation sector has also been dominated by road transport due to limited coverage by rail and water transportation. Hence, road transport has been a major contributor for greenhouse gas emission in Thailand over recent years. Along with global warming concern throughout the world, Thailand has taken various adaptation and mitigation measures, especially the strong policy push to use carbon-neutral biofuel in transportation sector due to Thailand competitive advantage in agriculture sector. National Renewable Energy Plan (2008-2022) has set challenging targets of 9 and 4.5 million liters/day of ethanol and biodiesel consumption by 2022, respectively. Various blends of ethanol in gasoline (10%, 20% and 85%) and biodiesel in diesel (up to 5%) have been commercially available. However, since current consumption of diesel is twice as much of gasoline, ethanol blend in gasoline would widen the imbalance consumption of gasoline and diesel. The present study however offers an insight into a possibility to use ethanol as diesel substitute. A case study of ethanol bus technology was investigated by recourse to energy demand modeling. Necessary data, such as a number of vehicles (NVs) for various vehicle types, vehicle kilometer of travel (VKT) and fuel economy (FE) were collected, with reasonable assumptions made for those unavailable data, to construct predicative energy demand model. Scenario analysis on ethanol bus introduction was conducted to assess reduction of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission by increasing the use of ethanol to achieve ethanol consumption target in 2022. Successful demonstration of ethanol bus operation in Thailand will be briefly mentioned to give confidence for larger project implementation in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biorefinery of the future will be an integrated complex that makes a variety of products (e.g., biofuels, chemicals, power and protein) from a variety of feedstocks. The objective of this work was to evaluate the environmental benefits, compared to the traditional sugarcane ethanol system, of the integrated production of ethanol and biodiesel through a sugarcane-soybean biorefinery concept in Brazil. The environmental aspects considered here were the fossil energy use and the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions associated with ethanol production. In the Integrated System, soybean would be cultivated in part of the sugarcane reforming areas, which represents ∼17% of the total sugarcane area. Sugarcane and soybean oil would be processed in a combined ethanol-biodiesel plant, which would use only bagasse as fuel. All the demand for utilities of the biodiesel plant would be provided by the distillery. The output products of the combined plant would comprise sugarcane ethanol, soybean biodiesel (which would be used as diesel (B5) substitute in the sugarcane cultivation), bioelectricity and glycerin. The results indicate that the Integrated System can reduce the fossil energy consumption from 75 to 37kJ/MJ of ethanol, when compared to the traditional system. For GHG emissions, the value would drop from 22.5 to 19.7g CO2eq/MJ of ethanol. This analysis shows that the Integrated System is an important option to contribute to ethanol's life cycle independence from fossil resources. This is an attractive environmental aspect, but socio-economic (as well as other environmental) aspects should also be analyzed in order to assess the sustainability of such systems in a broader perspective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Union (EU) has set a binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids. In this study, the GHG emissions of various biofuel chains considered as relevant in large-scale production in Finland were calculated in accordance with the EU sustainability criteria. Special attention was paid to uncertainties and the sensitivities of certain parameters. According to the results, it is impossible in many cases to unambiguously conclude whether or not a biofuel chain passes the emission-saving limit provided by the EU. This may reduce the willingness to invest in biofuel production. Major sources of uncertainties and sensitivities are nitrous oxide emissions from soil and nitrogen fertilisation, emissions of process heat production and soil carbon stock changes in biomass production. Several propositions are made in order to reduce the uncertainty of the results and to make the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels more harmonised and accurate. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents a survey of the most important techno-economic factors for the implementation of biorefineries based on agricultural residues, in the form of straw, and biochemical conversion into ethanol and biogas, together with production of electricity and heat. The paper suggests locations where the necessary conditions can be met in Sweden. The requirements identified are regional availability of feedstock, the possibility to integrate with external heat sinks, appropriate process design and the scale of the plant. The scale of the plant should be adapted to the potential, regional, raw-material supply, but still be large enough to give economies of scale. The integration with heat sinks proved to be most important to achieve high energy-efficiency, but it was of somewhat less importance for the profitability. Development of pentose fermentation, leading to higher ethanol yields, was important to gain high profitability. Promising locations were identified in the county of östergötland where integration with an existing 1st generation ethanol plant and district heating systems (DHSs) is possible, and in the county of Skåne where both a significant, potential straw supply and integration potential with DHSs are available. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic feedstock show enormous potential as an economically and environmentally sustainable renewable energy source. Switchgrass (panicum virgatum) is considered as one of the best second generation feedstock for bioethanol production. In order to commercialize the production of switchgrass-based bioethanol, it is essential to design an efficient switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain (SBSC) and effectively manage the logistics operation. This paper proposes an integrated mathematical model to determine the optimal comprehensive supply chain/logistics decisions to minimize the total SBSC cost by considering existing constraints. A case study based on North Dakota state (ND) in the United States illustrates the application of the proposed model. The results demonstrate that by using only 61% of the available marginal land for production of switchgrass feedstock, 100% of the annual gasoline energy equivalent requirement of ND can be economically and sustainably met from the produced bioethanol. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide insights for efficiently managing the entire SBSC and minimizing the total cost. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although large amounts of residue from agriculture and forestry are presently available for the production of bioenergy, to ensure a sustainable, long-term supply of biomass, it is necessary to establish and grow perennial energy crops on marginal agricultural land that is specifically intended to produce biomass for energy. Preliminary research has identified several perennial crops as potential biofuel crops including perennial grasses, poplars and willows. The high content of cellulose in these species indicates that the materials could be a potential feedstock for bioethanol production too. To select highly productive white poplar and willow clones suitable for these purposes, progenies of Villafranca (Populus alba) and willow clones from different species, mainly Salix matsudana, Salix jessoensis, Salix fragilis and Salix alba, were tested. The preliminary results obtained from plantations set up with 1111 plants per hectare are presented. Higher than the average productivity has been obtained from half-sib progenies of the clone 'Villafranca'. Among the families obtained with the willow breeding work, including intra-specific hybrids of S. alba, some crosses showed higher growth rates and biomass dry matter yields compared to their parents' mean values. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study provides a spatially comprehensive assessment of sustainable agricultural residue removal potential across the United States for bioenergy production. Earlier assessments determining the quantity of agricultural residue that could be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at the regional and national scale faced a number of computational limitations. These limitations included the number of environmental factors, the number of land management scenarios, and the spatial fidelity and spatial extent of the assessment. This study utilizes integrated multi-factor environmental process modeling and high fidelity land use datasets to perform the sustainable agricultural residue removal assessment. Soil type represents the base spatial unit for this study and is modeled using a national soil survey database at the 10-100. m scale. Current crop rotation practices are identified by processing land cover data available from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer database. Land management and residue removal scenarios are identified for each unique crop rotation and crop management zone. Estimates of county averages and state totals of sustainably available agricultural residues are provided. The results of the assessment show that in 2011 over 150 million metric tons of agricultural residues could have been sustainably removed across the United States. Projecting crop yields and land management practices to 2030, the assessment determines that over 207 million metric tons of agricultural residues will be able to be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at that time. This biomass resource has the potential for producing over 68 billion liters of cellulosic biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With more than 95% of India's surface transport dependent on imported fossil fuel, India has made a concerted effort to promote biofuel. The newly announced biofuel policy of India stipulates a blending target of 20% for both bioethanol and biodiesel. In the case of biodiesel, complement to fossil fuel diesel, India's predominant transport fuel, this target is to be achieved by cultivating non-edible oil seed plants in wastelands and fallow land. In spite of best effort, very little progress has been made on the ground. As the result, the deadline for blending target of 20% for biodiesel has been postponed from 2011-2012 to 2006-2017. This paper makes an attempt to understand the factors behind the tardy progress in India's biodiesel scene and suggests policy remedies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The perspectives of the depletion of fossil energy resources, together with the consequences of climate change, have provoked the development of numerous national and pluri-national energy policies. However, there have been few overall studies on the evolution of these resources. This paper uses a dynamic model to study the exhaustion patterns of world fossil and nuclear fuels and their possible replacement by renewable energy sources. The results show that peak oil will be the first restriction and it will not be easily overcome. Electric vehicles can produce some interesting savings, but they are insufficient to avoid the decline in oil. Biofuels are even more limited, due to the enormous extensions of fertile land they require and their low productivity. This shows that overcoming the decline in oil will need much more ambitious policies than the mere substitution of technology. If the "oil-economy" relationship does not change substantially, world economic growth may be seriously limited or even negative. In contrast, the production of electrical energy is not such a worrying problem in the short and middle-term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify and develop potential solutions on how to facilitate the financing of bioenergy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. We focus on four main areas that have been identified from empirical research in achieving this objective; these are: (i) financing, (ii) markets; (iii) trade and (iv) policy. The sources utilised consist of primary and secondary data compilation and analysis. Of particular relevance are the results of a market survey undertaken on funding opportunities, where the perspectives of both, project developers as well as project financiers are taken into account. Results indicate that the four areas cannot be treated autonomously, as they not only overlap but impact each other. There are a number of difficulties for biofuel ventures, not least the nature of the projects themselves, but also around the financing and political landscape of these enterprises. Common solutions which cross cut the four areas are the need to raise awareness and the skillsets, in areas including, financing opportunities, markets, policy, technical aspects among a range of stakeholders involved in biofuel ventures. There is also a necessity to create a supporting framework for the emerging carbon trading-related activities in Africa. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Indicators are needed to assess both socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of bioenergy systems. Effective indicators can help to identify and quantify the sustainability attributes of bioenergy options. We identify 16 socioeconomic indicators that fall into the categories of social well-being, energy security, trade, profitability, resource conservation, and social acceptability. The suite of indicators is predicated on the existence of basic institutional frameworks to provide governance, legal, regulatory and enforcement services. Indicators were selected to be practical, sensitive to stresses, unambiguous, anticipatory, predictive, estimable with known variability, and sufficient when considered collectively. The utility of each indicator, methods for its measurement, and applications appropriate for the context of particular bioenergy systems are described along with future research needs. Together, this suite of indicators is hypothesized to reflect major socioeconomic effects of the full supply chain for bioenergy, including feedstock production and logistics, conversion to biofuels, biofuel logistics and biofuel end uses. Ten indicators are highlighted as a minimum set of practical measures of socioeconomic aspects of bioenergy sustainability. Coupled with locally prioritized environmental indicators, we propose that these socioeconomic indicators can provide a basis to quantify and evaluate sustainability of bioenergy systems across many regions in which they will be deployed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using case studies from five typical climatic locations, this study revealed that current quantification of water demand (WD) and water footprint (WF) of freshwater algae cultivation in raceway ponds suffer from uncertainty and variability in the methodologies and assumptions used. Of particular concern, the WF metric had an intrinsically poor geographical resolution and could be biased towards high-productivity arid locations because local levels of water stress are not accounted for. Applying current methodologies could therefore cause the selection of locations that are neither economically viable nor environmentally sustainable. An improved methodology should utilize more accurate evaporation models, determine realistic limits for the maximum hydraulic retention times and process water recycling ratios, and apply weighting to the WF to reflect localized water stress or use an alternative metric such as the equivalent years of rainfall required to support a productivity of 1GJm-2. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growing expansion of biofuel production in the European Union is a direct consequence of the political framework specifically implemented to reduce the impact of oil price rises and to achieve fuel security and environmental goals. These policies have activated a new relationship between fossil fuel and vegetable oil prices. Combining a multiple structural change approach with rolling cointegration, the article identifies four structural breaks in the relationships between the price of mineral and vegetable oils. Results show that policy instruments are responsible for these structural changes in the long-run relationships between prices. The analysis also shows that from the implementation of the directive 2003/30/EC the price dynamic of rapeseed oil has shifted from its own market to the diesel market, making it subject to interactions with the more complex reality of mineral oil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines the integration properties of total renewable energy production, as well as production of biofuels and biomass in the United States. To do so we use Lagrange Multiplier (LM) univariate unit root tests with up to two structural breaks. We conclude that each production series has a unit root. The result suggests that random shocks, encompassing changes to regulation, to renewable energy production may lead to permanent departures from predetermined target levels. Furthermore, this result implies that permanent positive shocks (such as renewable portfolio standards) that increases the production of renewable energy resources will realize more in terms of positively altering the energy mix between renewable energy and energy from fossil fuels than temporary policy stances (such as investment tax credits over a predetermined time horizon). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We carried out an analysis of black carbon (BC) surface mass concentration, its radiative effects, and sources of origin in an urban atmosphere in east India, during winter season, through ground-based measurements and application of modelling tools. BC surface mass concentration exhibited diurnal variation with their higher values and a larger variability during evening to early morning hours than during daytime (1100-1600h, Local Time, LT) hours. Daytime mean surface BC mass concentration and BC mass fraction in total aerosol (size range 0.23-20μm) and in submicronic aerosol (size range 0.23-1μm) during the study period, corresponding to the well-mixed atmospheric layer were 11μgm-3, 3-10%, and 9-16% respectively. The mean BC optical depth (BC-AOD) and BC-AOD fraction at 0.5μm were estimated in an optical model as 0.11 and 13% respectively. Mean shortwave aerosol radiative forcing due to BC at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) during the study period was found to be +0.94Wm-2, which is about 59% the global mean radiative forcing due to carbon-dioxide gases. Estimates from BC simulations in a general circulation model showed BC surface concentration and BC optical depth in east India are primarily attributed to emissions from biofuel and fossil fuel combustion. Most of BC surface concentration (95%) and BC optical depth (60%) are contributed by emissions arising from the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) but there is a significant influence to BC columnar loading through elevated transport channels attributed mainly to emissions from open biomass burning from distant regions outside IGP. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been considered as one of the promising non-fossil fuels, but its development also have promoted a drastic debate due to its current production status, such as oilseeds dependency, arable land requirement, high cost and long-term impact on food prices. Therefore alternative resources with considerable lower cost that could be used for biodiesel production have been studied. Immature life stage of some insects is able to consume various organic wastes for fat accumulation. This high fat containing insect has the potential to serve as biodiesel feedstock. In this study, larval grease extracted from yellow mealworm beetle (Tenebrio molitor L.) (YMB), a post-harvest scavenger, was investigated for finding its potential as a substitute of oilseeds. Decayed vegetables were used to feed YMB and after 9weeks, then the grease was extracted for biodiesel production. About 34.2g biodiesel was obtained from 234.8g dried YMB larval biomass. The main fatty acids of YMB biodiesel were linolenic acid (19.7%), palmitic acid (17.6%), linoleic acid (16.3%) and stearic acid (11.4%). Most of the properties of the YMB biodiesel fed on decayed vegetables met the standard EN 14214, including ester content (96.8%), density (860kg/m3), flash point (127°C), cetane number (58), water content (300mg/kg), and methanol content (0.2%). From comprehensive analysis on the effect to society, economy and environment, it can be concluded that YMB can recycle organic wastes into clean energy with low cost. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brassica carinata (Ethiopian mustard) has previously been identified as a potential crop species suitable for marginal land in the North American prairies due to its relatively high salt tolerance. Two genetically related B. carinata lines with brown-seeded (BS) and yellow-seeded (YS) phenotypes were assessed for their tolerance to sodium sulfate. Specifically, each line was greenhouse-grown under 0, 50 and 100. mM of salt, and analyzed after four weeks and eight weeks of treatment. Generally, the height of the BS line was greater than the YS line under both salt treatments, indicating enhanced salt tolerance of the BS line. NMR-based metabolite profiling and PCA analyses indicated a more pronounced shift in key stem metabolites after four weeks of treatment with the YS line compared to the BS line. For example, tryptophan and formate levels increased in the YS line after four weeks of 100. mM salt treatment, while proline and threonine levels varied uniquely compared to other metabolites of the lines. Together, the data indicate that the brown-seeded line has greater sodium tolerance than the yellow-seed line, provide clues to the biochemical underpinnings for the phenotypic variation, and highlight the utility of B. carinata as a biorefinery crop for saline land. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This paper assesses the environmental impacts of producing bio-energy, bio-fuels and bio-materials from Australian sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), and nominates the bio-production pathways offering the best environmental gains. A system-based, consequential approach was taken, which is different to past approaches that have commonly judged bio-production by comparing individual bio-products with their fossil-fuel counterparts. Possible diversified scenarios were developed, and the changes in environmental impacts from the system as a whole (per 100 t sugarcane processed) were assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). Scenarios based on utilisation of co-products from existing sugarcane production (ethanol from molasses, and electricity and ethanol from surplus bagasse) were found to give modest reductions in non-renewable energy (NRE) use and global warming potential (GWP), and involve no or few trade-offs. Of these, ethanol and electricity from bagasse offer the best benefits. Scenarios necessitating expanded cane growing for dedicated production of ethanol and polylactide (PLA) plastics from cane juice were found to result in more substantial NRE and GWP savings, but involve the trade-offs associated with expanded agricultural production (land use, water use and potential water quality impacts). Of these, PLA production offers the better outcomes, amongst the scenarios. However, eco-efficient cane growing was found to be an equally important improvement strategy and should be implemented to enhance the benefits and mitigate some of the trade-off from bio-production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ambitious renewable energy targets have been implemented in the EU that can only be atstained if further policy measures are taken to boost, among others, bioenergy production on agricultural land. The aim of this article is to explore consequences for land use, environment, and policy if bioenergy crop production will be expanded in Austria considering constrained arable land availability. In a policy experiment, we assess the bio-physical and economic production potentials of bioenergy crops and explore the trade-offs between food, feed and bioenergy crop production on arable lands in Austria. In particular, we analyze how costly it is to expand domestic bioenergy crop production by employing an integrated modeling framework using an elaborated set of bio-physical and economic data. The results indicate that an expansion of bioenergy crop production for first and second generation biofuels would imply significant adjustment costs for the agricultural sector. Furthermore, increasing feedstock production would have significant impacts on land use and fertilizer intensity levels. The economic analysis considers regional contexts and bio-physical site conditions, which should better reflect the differences in opportunity costs, and hence, lead to higher feedstock costs as estimated in previous studies. Subsidies on domestic bioenergy crop production induce higher regional food and feed prices as well as leads to higher land prices in a land constrained economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Populus tomentosa is an economically important tree crop that produces wood for lumber, pulp, paper, and biofuels. Wood quality traits are likely to be strongly affected by the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA), which regulates growth. GA20Ox encodes one of the major regulatory enzymes of GA biosynthesis and may therefore play a large role in growth and wood quality. Here, linkage disequilibrium (LD) studies were used to identify significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PtGA20Ox and growth and wood-quality traits of P. tomentosa. We isolated a full-length GA20Ox cDNA from Populus tomentosa by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR; this 1401 bp cDNA clone had an open reading frame of 1158 bp and encoded a protein of 385 amino acids. PtGA20Ox transcripts were maximally expressed in the mature xylem of vascular tissues, suggesting that PtGA20Ox is highly expressed and specifically associated with secondary xylem formation. Resequencing the PtGA20Ox locus of 36 individuals identified 55 SNPs, and the frequency of SNPs was 1/31 bp. The 29 most common SNPs (frequency&gt;0.1) were genotyped in an association population (426 individuals) that was also phenotyped for key growth and wood quality traits. LD did not extend over the entire gene (r2&lt;0.1, within 500 bp), demonstrating that a candidate-gene-based LD approach may the best way to understand the molecular basis underlying quantitative variation in this species. SNP- and haplotype-based association analyses indicated that four SNPs (false discovery rate Q&lt;0.05) and 14 haplotypes (P&lt;0.05) were significantly associated with growth and wood properties. The phenotypic variance explained by each SNP ranged from 3.44% to 14.47%. The SNP markers identified in this study can be applied to breeding programs for the improvement of growth and wood-property traits by marker-assisted selection. © 2012 Tian et al.

AB  - Eucalypt species are a group of flowering trees widely used in pulp production for paper manufacture. For several decades, the wood pulp industry has focused research and development efforts on improving yields, growth rates and pulp quality through breeding and the genetic improvement of key tree species. Recently, this focus has shifted from the production of high quality pulps to the investigation of the use of eucalypts as feedstocks for biofuel production. Here the structure and chemical composition of the heartwood and sapwood of Eucalyptus dunnii, E. globulus, E. pillularis, E. urophylla, an E. urophylla-E. grandis cross, Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata, and Acacia mangium were compared using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and biochemical composition analysis. Some trends relating to these compositions were also identified by Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy. These results will serve as a foundation for a more comprehensive database of wood properties that will help develop criteria for the selection of tree species for use as biorefinery feedstocks. © 2012 Çetinkol et al.

AB  - Background: The use of lignocellulosic materials for second generation ethanol production would give several advantages such as minimizing the conflict between land use for food and fuel production, providing less expensive raw materials than conventional agricultural feedstock, allowing lower greenhouse gas emissions than those of first generation ethanol. However, cellulosic biofuels are not produced at a competitive level yet, mainly because of the high production costs of the cellulolytic enzymes. Therefore, this study was aimed at discovering new cellulolytic microorganisms and enzymes.Results: Different bacteria isolated from raw composting materials obtained from vegetable processing industry wastes were screened for their cellulolytic activity on solid medium containing carboxymethylcellulose. Four strains belonging to the actinomycetes group were selected on the basis of their phenotypic traits and cellulolytic activity on solid medium containing carboxymethylcellulose. The strain showing the highest cellulolytic activity was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as belonging to Streptomyces genus and it was designated as Streptomyces sp. strain G12. Investigating the enzymes responsible for cellulase activity produced by Streptomyces G12 by proteomic analyses, two endoglucanases were identified. Gene coding for one of these enzymes, named CelStrep, was cloned and sequenced. Molecular analysis showed that the celstrep gene has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 379 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 37 amino acid residues. Comparison of deduced aminoacidic sequence to the other cellulases indicated that the enzyme CelStrep can be classified as a family 12 glycoside hydrolase. Heterologous recombinant expression of CelStrep was carried out in Escherichia coli, and the active recombinant enzyme was purified from culture supernatant and characterized. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose following a Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a KM of 9.13 mg/ml and a vmax of 3469 μM min-1. The enzyme exhibits a half life of around 24 h and 96 h at 60°C and 50°C, respectively and shows a retention of around 80% of activity after 96 h at 40°C.Conclusions: In this manuscript, we describe the isolation of a new cellulolytic strain, Streptomyces sp. G12, from industrial waste based compost, the identification of the enzymes putatively responsible for its cellulolytic activity, the cloning and the recombinant expression of the gene coding for the Streptomyces sp. G12 cellulase CelStrep, that was characterized showing to exhibit a relevant thermoresistance increasing its potential for cellulose conversion. © 2012 Amore et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the macro-environmental dimensions through which Brazilian scientists and government officials have framed issues surrounding liquid biofuels over a period of time. This study analyzes scientific papers published by researchers affiliated with Brazilian institutions and official documents of the Brazilian government related to liquid biofuels. Documents published during a ten-year period (1997-2006) were collected from electronic sources. Text-mining procedures were applied through a framework of macro-environmental dimensions and their corresponding d-words in order to extract high-quality content. Results indicate that the macro-environment developed by Brazilian scientists differs from the one created by the government. Variations in describing macro-environmental dimensions existed for both the Brazilian government and for scientists during the period of analysis. Similarity tests reveal significant differences between the scientific documents and the government documents, indicating that Brazilian public policy regarding liquid biofuels is dissociated from the scientific findings of Brazilian researchers. © The Author 2012.

AB  - Fossil fuels will remain a key element in the development of global economy in coming decades. Therefore the accumulation of CO2 in the air caused by fossil fuel consumption must be prevented because of the environmental concerns. Therefore the global issue of CO2 production has been under concentration in recent years through declarations such as the Kyoto protocol and also by industry leaders. To solve this problem and stabilize CO2 levels, the leaders must look towards adopting CO2 management strategies across their various enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to review three different and currently used methods of reducing CO2 emissions.

AB  - Background: Fermentation production of biofuel ethanol consumes agricultural crops, which will compete directly with the food supply. As an alternative, photosynthetic cyanobacteria have been proposed as microbial factories to produce ethanol directly from solar energy and CO2. However, the ethanol productivity from photoautotrophic cyanobacteria is still very low, mostly due to the low tolerance of cyanobacterial systems to ethanol stress. Results: To build a foundation necessary to engineer robust ethanol-producing cyanobacterial hosts, in this study we applied a quantitative transcriptomics approach with a next-generation sequencing technology, combined with quantitative reverse-transcript PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, to reveal the global metabolic responses to ethanol in model cyanobacterial Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The results showed that ethanol exposure induced genes involved in common stress responses, transporting and cell envelope modification. In addition, the cells can also utilize enhanced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) accumulation and glyoxalase detoxication pathway as means against ethanol stress. The up-regulation of photosynthesis by ethanol was also further confirmed at transcriptional level. Finally, we used gene knockout strains to validate the potential target genes related to ethanol tolerance. Conclusion: RNA-Seq based global transcriptomic analysis provided a comprehensive view of cellular response to ethanol exposure. The analysis provided a list of gene targets for engineering ethanol tolerance in cyanobacterium Synechocystis. © 2012 Wang et al.

AB  - Multistructural canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature multidimensional tunneling (MS-CVT/SCT) is employed to calculate thermal rate constants for hydrogen-atom abstraction from carbon-1 of n-butanol by the hydroperoxyl radical over the temperature range 250-2000 K. The M08-SO hybrid meta-GGA density functional was validated against CCSD(T)-F12a explicitly correlated wave function calculations with the jul-cc-pVTZ basis set. It was then used to compute the properties of all stationary points and the energies and Hessians of a few nonstationary points along the reaction path, which were then used to generate a potential energy surface by the multiconfiguration Shepard interpolation (MCSI) method. The internal rotations in the transition state for this reaction (like those in the reactant alcohol) are strongly coupled to each other and generate multiple stable conformations, which make important contributions to the partition functions. It is shown that neglecting to account for the multiple-structure effects and torsional potential anharmonicity effects that arise from the torsional modes would lead to order-of-magnitude errors in the calculated rate constants at temperatures of interest in combustion. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels, like any emerging technology, have the potential to cause ethical dilemmas by exposing the colliding values of multiple stakeholders. Policy is an instrument used to buffer these collisions. In the case of biofuels, policy must seek to balance the postulated positive and negative environmental and socioeconomic effects of biofuels expansion and the associated development of new feedstocks. At best, this is a precarious endeavor. The biofuels community faces extreme ethical scrutiny to account for not only the direct effects of widespread adoption but the indirect effects as well. For example, biofuels used in the U.S. and E.U. must account for not only their own carbon footprint, but any emissions associated with market-mediated land-use change in other countries. This type of accounting requires development of new analytical methodologies and improved data coverage. In large part, the interactions between stakeholders surrounding these controversies will determine what role biofuels play in a range of issues including: (1) our future energy portfolio; (2) the strategies adopted to mitigate climate change; (3) changes in agriculture including the types of feedstocks used and how these feedstocks are grown; and (4) how to best manage the increasing demands of humans on resources and the environment. The acceptance of biofuel feedstocks as "renewable" or "sustainable" epitomizes the myriad ethical issues accompanying biofuel expansion. In this chapter, several biofuel feedstocks and the criteria by which different stakeholders judge them is examined to illustrate some of the alignments and conflicts in stakeholder values and how they affect feedstock choices, especially in the nascent cellulosic ethanol industry. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The development and expansion of sustainable biomass-based transportation fuels is part of a much larger energy context. While there is a tendency to look for a "silver bullet" solution to the interrelated climate and energy dilemma, the problem's very nature means that the solution is multidimensional, requiring flexibility and forethought to deal with inherent uncertainties. Regional and local drivers for development in emerging, pre-emergent, and less developed countries add more complexity by creating multiple priorities for resource allocation. To provide an accessible vision of the future and choose a sustainable path that includes biofuels, it is necessary to compare forward-looking scenarios that encompass both global sources and global impacts. These scenarios must accurately reflect the regionally accessible potential resources as well as the sectoral balance and cross-sectoral competition for those resources, but control the level of detail. This paper introduces biofuel feedstocks and technologies and discusses how biofuels can provide an engine for sustainable development while also considering the influence of regional factors on scenarios and potential estimates. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Economics is a discipline that aims to analyze resource allocation by individuals and societies. It investigates allocation choices by individuals, which may include purchases, employment, life decisions, as well as resource allocations by firms and governments. It also aims to explain and evaluate outcomes of markets and selection of policies. Economists distinguish between choices that are optimal from the perspective of individual agents and choices that are optimal from a social perspective. They suggest policies that will induce private choices to coincide with social optimum. However, economists do not run the world and actual policy choices are typically different from what economists prescribe. Often then, the economist is charged with the task of assessing the impact of actual policies and proposing ways to improve them. Although tools of the trade are used to analyze the economics of biofuel, the body of information and the subsequent conclusions that are arrived at are often as diverse. We will use the basic tools of supply and demand to understand how biofuels fit within a stylized market for energy, and explore how climate change considerations may affect biofuel utilization. Then, we expand our analysis to deal with the impact of biofuel on food and fuel choices, followed by an analysis of actual biofuel policies while taking into account political economy considerations as well as uncertainty and enforcement issues. Finally, we provide an overview of results of some quantitative studies that predict the outcomes of introducing biofuels and assess their future. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Prices of major food commodities, such as corn, soybeans, rice, and wheat, increased by two to four fold between 2001 and 2007. A number of existing studies have identified several influences on these price increases, including increased food demand with economic growth, expansion of biofuels, food price increases due to exchange rate fluctuations, increases in energy prices, as well as speculation, trade policy and weather shocks. The study shows that commodity inventory demands also are an important influence, and that not accounting for this factor leads to misleading conclusions about other price influences. A simulation model shows that when the effects of inventory expansion are taken into account, the estimated overall impact on prices of economic growth, increased energy prices, biofuel expansion, and exchange rate fluctuations is roughly 12 percent smaller. This is a significant finding in light of the controversies surrounding various influences on food prices, and indicates that inventory management is an important policy measure to dampen food price increases. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increased bioenergy production can diversify energy portfolios, introduce renewable energy options, and help reduce the carbon footprint of the energy industry. Large-scale bioenergy implementation also has the potential to have negative environmental consequences as well. It is critically important to understand and minimize the potential unintended consequences of a transition to bioenergy. Biofuel development is complex and involves a variety of stakeholders with differing objectives. This makes reaching a consensus difficult. Biofuels are an emerging industry with some uncertainty as to how they will ultimately develop. The environmental profile of bioenergy development is unclear, with significant tradeoffs and conflicting evidence regarding the purported environmental benefits of bioenergy. Increased bioenergy production also has the potential to impact nitrogen, phosphorus, and water cycles. Carbon emissions also need further investigation, especially with respect to changing land use. This chapter will discuss the inherent tradeoffs between carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and land use that exist with bioenergy, and discuss preferable bioenergy development scenarios. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the endeavor of optimizing the sustainability of bioenergy production in Denmark, this consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluated the environmental impacts associated with the production of heat and electricity from one hectare of Danish arable land cultivated with three perennial crops: ryegrass (Lolium perenne), willow (Salix viminalis) and Miscanthus giganteus. For each, four conversion pathways were assessed against a fossil fuel reference: (I) anaerobic co-digestion with manure, (II) gasification, (III) combustion in small-to-medium scale biomass combined heat and power (CHP) plants and IV) co-firing in large scale coal-fired CHP plants. Soil carbon changes, direct and indirect land use changes as well as uncertainty analysis (sensitivity, MonteCarlo) were included in the LCA. Results showed that global warming was the bottleneck impact, where only two scenarios, namely willow and Miscanthus co-firing, allowed for an improvement as compared with the reference (-82 and -45 t CO2-eq. ha-1, respectively). The indirect land use changes impact was quantified as 310 ± 170 t CO2-eq. ha-1, representing a paramount average of 41% of the induced greenhouse gas emissions. The uncertainty analysis confirmed the results robustness and highlighted the indirect land use changes uncertainty as the only uncertainty that can significantly change the outcome of the LCA results. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Azadirachta indica A.Juss (neem) is a tropical tree, popular for its multiple possible uses. The oil extracted from neem kernels is used in cosmetics, as medicines, as insecticides and for energy needs (biofuel). The oldest oil extraction method is cold pressing. However, the optimal parameters of extraction and the quality of extracted oil are poorly known. The purpose of this research was to identify the optimal extracting parameters of neem oil by cold pressing and to characterize the extracted oil. The results showed that at 25 °C, the optimum yield by pressing of whole kernels was obtained with a pressure of 30.4 MPa ± 4.1 and a maximum degree of filling of the pressing cage. We showed that maintaining this pressure for 6 min could lead to an extraction rate of 40.1% ± 1.1. The oil yield increased with the speed of kernel compression. Reducing the particle size had a positive effect on oil yield when the cage load did not exceed half of the cage capacity. The best oil yield of 40.3% ± 0.0 for ground kernels was obtained with a pressure of 33.7 MPa ± 2.9 and a cage filled in the quarter of its capacity. The content levels of water, iron, copper and phosphorus in the oil extracted by pressing were respectively 0.14%; 11.8; 0.1 and 17 ppm. These characteristics indicate, inter alia, that neem oil obtained by cold pressing is of appropriate quality for use in biodiesel production.

AB  - Background: Brachypodium distachyon s. l. has been widely investigated across the world as a model plant for temperate cereals and biofuel grasses. However, this annual plant shows three cytotypes that have been recently recognized as three independent species, the diploids B. distachyon (2n = 10) and B. stacei (2n = 20) and their derived allotetraploid B. hybridum (2n = 30). Methodology/Principal Findings: We propose a DNA barcoding approach that consists of a rapid, accurate and automatable species identification method using the standard DNA sequences of complementary plastid (trnLF) and nuclear (ITS, GI) loci. The highly homogenous but largely divergent B. distachyon and B. stacei diploids could be easily distinguished (100% identification success) using direct trnLF (2.4%), ITS (5.5%) or GI (3.8%) sequence divergence. By contrast, B. hybridum could only be unambiguously identified through the use of combined trnLF+ITS sequences (90% of identification success) or by cloned GI sequences (96.7%) that showed 5.4% (ITS) and 4% (GI) rate divergence between the two parental sequences found in the allopolyploid. Conclusion/Significance: Our data provide an unbiased and effective barcode to differentiate these three closely-related species from one another. This procedure overcomes the taxonomic uncertainty generated from methods based on morphology or flow cytometry identifications that have resulted in some misclassifications of the model plant and its allies. Our study also demonstrates that the allotetraploid B. hybridum has resulted from bi-directional crosses of B. distachyon and B. stacei plants acting either as maternal or paternal parents. © 2012 López-Alvarez et al.

AB  - Water shortage necessitated South Indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the waste waters by presently about 30%. The purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide C/N ratios, around 250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. Our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (NO3-) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as external N-sources anticipating a better N-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants.Estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and changing CO2-, CH4-, N2O releases due to the presence of nitrate or N2O suggest that acid tolerant Lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (pH 3.5). They were very less or not found in the outflows (pH 7.3). Assumingly, the phyla Bacteroidetes (Prevotella spp.), Proteobacteria (Rhizobium spp., Defluvibacter sp.), Firmicutes (Megasphaera spp., Dialister spp., Clostridium spp.) and Synergistetes (Thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. Anaerobes, about 400cellsml-1 in the inflows, increased to about 106cellsml-1 in the outflows. The methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. In the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml-1 denitrifying bacteria and up to 104cfu fungi were found.Despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added N2O decreased considerably. Thus, wide C/N ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the N2O emissions low by using N2O either as electron acceptor or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. The biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more CO2 and the outflow samples released more CH4. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In China, barren hills and wasteland amount to more than 54 million hectares; in addition, saline and alkaline soils, sandy areas, mining fields, oil-exploitation regions, and other marginal lands cover nearly 100 million hectares. Among the degraded lands, most energy-forest (oil producing) species are suitable for planting and growing. Cultivation of energy forests is thus regarded as the main way to develop forestry-biomass energy resources for the future. China is home to more than 4 million hectares of oil plants, and 154 kinds of energy trees produce seeds containing over 40% percent oil. Presently, the nation's total biomass resources that can potentially be converted into energy are about 500 million tons. China will establish 13.33 million hectares of forests by 2020 to produce liquid and solid biofuels for power generation and transport. This area is an increase from the planned 833,333 hectares in 2010 and will provide enough biomass to produce over 6 million t of biodiesel a year and power generators with capacity of 15 gigawatts. The energy forests will contribute massively to China's already successful attempts aimed at reducing desertification and land degradation. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The issue of fast-growing crops originally goes back to early 1970th. Fast-growing crops initially dominated as a way of obtaining the raw material for producing cellulose. In subsequent years, with the development of technology, the range of benefits of this type crops began to increase - for example crops found use in the purification of industrial pressure land (reclamation of degraded areas e.g. coal mining) or were used in the production of biofuels (bioethanol, biogas, biomass). With the increasing interest in fast-growing crops, scientific research has been initiated to assess the impact of such crops on the natural environment. One way to analyze the impact of crops on the environment is to measure the emitted or absorbed carbon dioxide and water vapor. Measuring systems consisting of advanced wind sensors, CO 2 and H2O gas analyzers, temperature sensors (air, soil), radiation sensors (shortwave and longwave), rain gauges, snow sensors and soil heat sensors are used for this purpose. All these devices are installed in systems to determine the mass and energy change in the studied area. The eddy covariance method (EC) technique involving the high frequency measurement the vertical velocity component and the scalar (temperature, water vapor and CO 2 mixing ratios) as used to obtain the fluxes half hourly.

AB  - The concept of combining bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identifi ed as one mechanism to achieve energy production with a net negative atmospheric carbon emission. Conventional geological carbon capture and storage involves large capital outlay and recurring expense. Therefore there is increased interest in coupling biological carbon capture and sequestration with biomass production. Systems such as low-input high-diversity native grasslands and biochar production have been heralded as carbon negative biofuels. Another potential production system for bioenergy with biological carbon capture and storage (BEBCCS) is the large-scale cultivation of seaweed (macroalgae) for biofuels. Marine biofuels offer considerable advantages over terrestrial fi rst-generation biofuels in terms of their low land use, fresh water and fertilizer requirements. In addition, they also offer considerable potential in the fi eld of BEBCCS. Macroalgae rapidly accumulate biomass and as part of this process, a signifi cant proportion (estimates range up to 60%) of the carbon they fix photosynthetically is released into the water. A proportion of this released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is highly labile and enters the bacterial loop and is rapidly remineralized back to CO2. However, a proportion is known to be resistant to biological degradation and enters the refractory DOC pool. The marine DOC pool is the largest organic carbon pool on the planet and the refractory component is known to have a turnover period of 100s-1000s years. The release of refractory DOC from macroalgae combined with biofuel production offers the potential for large scale carbon negative fuel production. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transportation cost is an important factor to determine the optimal size of a biofuel refinery. In this article, we analyze the impact of logistic costs on the optimal size of a biofuel refinery by analyzing the trade-off between the switchgrass transportation cost and the economic scale of cellulosic ethanol production. To calculate the transportation cost, grids are used to calculate the variable distance from the fields to the refinery, and both fixed and variable transportation costs are considered. We examine the transportation cost with both round and square bales, and various yields and bulk densities. The results help a decision maker to determine critical factors that influence transportation costs of switchgrass. We also investigate the effect of refinery capacity increase on the transportation cost. The results can provide valuable insight into the economic scale of cellulosic ethanol production. © 2012 by the American Society for Engineering Management.

AB  - There is a critical need to investigate how land application of dedicated biofuel oilseed meals affects soil ecosystems. In this study, mustard (Brassica juncea) and flax (Linum usitatissimum) seed meals and sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor) were added to soil at levels of 0, 1, 2.5, and 5% (w/w). Both the type of amendment and application rate affected soil organic C, total C & N, and C & N mineralization. Mustard meal amendment initially inhibited C mineralization as compared to flax, but >50% of mustard and flax organic C was mineralized within 51 d. Nitrogen mineralization was similar for flax and mustard, except for the 2.5% rate for which a lower proportion of mustard N was converted to nitrate. The mustard meal greatly impacted microbial community composition, appearing to select for specific fungal populations. The potential varying impacts of different oilseed meals on soil ecosystems should be considered when developing recommendations for land application. © 2012 Autumn S. Wang et al.

AB  - This study updates the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for soybean biodiesel with revised system boundaries and the inclusion of indirect land use change using the most current set of agricultural data. The updated results showed that life cycle GHG emission from biodiesel use was reduced by 81.2% compared to 2005 baseline diesel. When the impacts of lime application and soil N2O emissions were excluded for more direct comparison with prior results published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the reduction was 85.4%. This is a significant improvement over the 78.5% GHG reduction reported in the NREL study. Agricultural lime accounted for 50.6% of GHG from all agricultural inputs. Soil N2O accounted for 18.0% of total agricultural emissions. The improvement in overall GHG reduction was primarily due to lower agricultural energy usage and improved soybean crushing facilities. This study found that soybean meal and oil price data from the past ten years had a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.73); hence, it is argued that soybean meal and oil are both responsible for indirect land use change from increased soybean demand. It is concluded that when there is a strong price correlation among co-products, system boundary expansion without a proper co-product allocation for indirect land use change produces erroneous results. When the emissions associated with predicted indirect land use change were allocated and incorporated using U.S. EPA model data, the GHG reduction for biodiesel was 76.4% lower than 2005 baseline diesel. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - This study was carried out in the Yazoo River basin (YRB) in northwestern Mississippi to assess the potential crop yield of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Model-simulated long-term streamflow, and soybean and corn yields for the watershed were compared with available observed data. The results showed good agreement between simulated and observed values. The average yield predicted by the calibrated SWAT model was 11 Mg ha-1 (from 8 to 13 Mg ha-1) for switchgrass and 34 Mg ha-1 (from 25 to 45 Mg ha-1) for miscanthus. Both switchgrass and miscanthus yields were determined higher in the central part of the YRB than in other areas. The economic analysis estimated the average farm-gate breakeven prices of switchgrass and miscanthus at $111 Mg-1 and $39 Mg-1, respectively. The breakeven prices of both switchgrass and miscanthus were estimated lower in the central regions of the YRB than in the other areas of the watershed due to higher crop yields. Conversely, the breakeven prices of both crops were higher in the northern regions of the watershed due to lower crop yields. This study demonstrated that SWAT-simulated bioenergy crop yields at the watershed scale can be used effectively in watershed-scale economic analysis to determine the farm-gate breakeven price, which may provide useful information to producers and watershed managers who are charged with significant land use decisions. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the optimum amplitude and frequency of operation for the rotary shaker drum of an experimental canopy shaker used for harvesting Jatropha curcas L. A constrained optimization technique that required the removal of yellow and brown fruits to be as high as possible and the removal of green fruits to be as low as possible was used to determine the optimum operating parameters. The optimum operating condition that retained 90% of the green fruits on the plant was found to be an amplitude of 7.2 cm (2.9 in.) and a frequency of 2.4 Hz. The removal efficiencies for yellow and brown fruits were found to be 75.8% and 80.2%, respectively, for this operating condition. When the objective function of the optimization procedure was changed to limit the amount of green fruits harvested to be no more than 10% of the total fruits harvested to ensure oil quality, the optimum operating parameters were found to be an amplitude of 8.0 cm (3.2 in.) and a frequency of 3.2 Hz for the shaker drum. The removal efficiencies for the yellow and brown fruits for this operating condition were 83% and 89%, respectively. An evaluation of plant damage revealed that no serious damage occurred to Jatropha curcas L. plants when the vibratory shaker drum was operated even under aggressive harvesting conditions that involved an amplitude of 7.6 cm and a frequency of 5.0 Hz. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Background: Industrial production of biofuels and other products by cellulolytic microorganisms is of interest but hindered by the nascent state of genetic tools. Although a genetic system for Clostridium thermocellum DSM1313 has recently been developed, available methods achieve relatively low efficiency and similar plasmids can transform C. thermocellum at dramatically different efficiencies. Results: We report an increase in transformation efficiency of C. thermocellum for a variety of plasmids by using DNA that has been methylated by Escherichia coli Dam but not Dcm methylases. When isolated from a dam+dcm+E. coli strain, pAMG206 transforms C. thermocellum 100-fold better than the similar plasmid pAMG205, which contains an additional Dcm methylation site in the pyrF gene. Upon removal of Dcm methylation, transformation with pAMG206 showed a four- to seven-fold increase in efficiency; however, transformation efficiency of pAMG205 increased 500-fold. Removal of the Dcm methylation site from the pAMG205 pyrF gene via silent mutation resulted in increased transformation efficiencies equivalent to that of pAMG206. Upon proper methylation, transformation efficiency of plasmids bearing the pMK3 and pB6A origins of replication increased ca. three orders of magnitude. Conclusions: E. coli Dcm methylation decreases transformation efficiency in C. thermocellum DSM1313. The use of properly methylated plasmid DNA should facilitate genetic manipulation of this industrially relevant bacterium. © 2012 Guss et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This study provides a quantitative estimate of grain that would be available for biofuel production under different scenarios of dietary requirements in the world in 2050 based on the projected information available in 2007 on population, productivity increase, dietary requirements, and land use types. Our major findings are as follows: (1) if dietary requirements do not increase by more than 20% from the current level, crop yields from current cropland must increase by more than 57% just to meet dietary demand; (2) the restriction of pastureland for milk and meat production purposes would imply insufficient food production for a moderate diet consumption scenario in 2050; (3) If food demand increases by 20% of the current consumption level, a 60% increase in crop yield and a 16% conversion of pasturelands would meet grain demand and leave surplus grain to supply 23% of liquid fuel demand. We also highlight the potential roles played by biotechnology, research and development fundings, irrigation, and cropping intensity to boost crop production and ultimately make more land available for biofuel production if such an option continues to be considered in future. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - On a political level, Swedish transport ethanol has always been embedded in visions of an alternative, brighter future. Arguments in support of ethanol have been reiterated throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, exhibiting a striking stability over time. At the same time, the contexts in which arguments for ethanol have been raised have undergone dramatic shifts. This article investigates the historical contingencies of three empirical cases, covering the interwar years, the aftermath of the oil crises of the 1970s and the 21st century's concerns over global warming. It concludes with the observation that despite political convictions about ethanol's commercial, military and environmental potential, domestic production has not managed to take off on its own. It has relied on state support such as tax exemptions, it has been dependent on other industries for feedstock provision and its technical superiority is still waiting for market confirmation. © 2012 the Historical Associations of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

AB  - Biofuel policy in the United States sets minimum use mandates for different biofuels, but the cellulosic mandate, introduced in 2010 has been waived and reduced to nearly zero since then. This waiver has shifted the burden of compliance to other biofuels, but other options exist. We examine some alternatives using a structural model of biofuel, agricultural, and mandate markets. Our estimates show that crop price levels, crop and livestock farm income, compliance costs, and greenhouse gas emissions are all sensitive to whether and how the cellulosic mandate is waived. Mandate analysis that does not consider Environmental Protection Agency implementation, or waiver analysis that disregards the hierarchical nature of the mandates could be misleading. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus is a perennial grass considered to be one of the most promising biofuel and bioenergy crops because of its high biomass and quality, and low requirement for fertilizers and pesticides. Market demand for Miscanthus is rapidly increasing. However, M. × giganteus is a triploid that cannot produce viable seeds, and it has traditionally been propagated through rhizome division, which is low throughput and labor-intensive. Plant tissue culture provides the potential to propagate M. × giganteus in vitro while maintaining the original plant characteristics. Although protocols exist for M. × giganteus micropropagation, the multiplication rate and plant quality need to be improved to meet commercial demands. For this research, we have assessed callus induction, callus multiplication, plantlet regeneration, shoot multiplication, shoot quality improvement, rooting, plant acclimatization, and survival in the greenhouse and in the field. Through these studies, we have developed an efficient system for high-quality, large-scale micropropagation of M. × giganteus. The plants produced from our protocol exhibited more than 99% survival in soil due to the production of vigorous shoots and roots. © 2012 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Widespread land use changes, and ensuing effects on ecosystem services, are expected from expanding bioenergy production. Although most U.S. production of ethanol is from corn, it is envisaged that future ethanol production will also draw from cellulosic sources such as perennial grasses. In selecting optimal bioenergy crops, there is debate as to whether it is preferable from an environmental standpoint to cultivate bioenergy crops with high ecosystem services (a "land-sharing" strategy) or to grow crops with lower ecosystem services but higher yield, thereby requiring less land to meet bioenergy demand (a "land-sparing" strategy). Here, we develop a simple model to address this question. Assuming that bioenergy crops are competing with uncultivated land, our model calculates land requirements to meet a given bioenergy demand intensity based upon the yields of bioenergy crops. The model combines fractional land cover of each ecosystem type with its associated ecosystem services to determine whether land-sharing or land-sparing strategies maximize ecosystem services at the landscape level. We apply this model to a case in which climate protection through GHG regulation-an ecosystem's greenhouse gas value (GHGV)-is the ecosystem service of interest. Our results show that the relative advantages of land sparing and land sharing depend upon the type of ecosystem displaced by the bioenergy crop; as the GHGV of the unfarmed land increases, the preferable strategy shifts from land sharing to land sparing. Although it may be preferable to replace ecologically degraded land with high-GHGV, lower yielding bioenergy crops, average landscape GHGV will most often be maximized through highyielding bioenergy crops that leave more land for uncultivated, high-GHGV ecosystems. Although our case study focuses on GHGV, the same principles will be applicable to any ecosystem service whose value does not depend upon the spatial configuration of the landscape. Whenever bioenergy crops have substantially lower ecosystem services than the ecosystems with which they are competing for land, the most effective strategy for meeting bioenergy demand while maximizing ecosystem services on a landscape level is one of land sparing: focusing simultaneously on maximizing the yield of bioenergy crops while preserving or restoring natural ecosystems. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The use of microalgae and cyanobacteria for the production of biofuels and other raw materials is considered a very promising sustainable technology due to the high areal productivity, potential for CO2 fixation and use of non-arable land. The production of oil by microalgae in a large scale plant was studied using emergy analysis. The joint transformity calculated for the base scenario was 1.32E + 5 sej/J, the oil transformity was 3.51E + 5 sej/J, the emergy yield ratio (EYR) was 1.09 and environmental loading ratio was 11.10 and the emergy sustainability index (ESI) was 0.10, highlighting some of the key challenges for the technology such as high energy consumption during harvesting, raw material consumption and high capital and operation costs. Alternatives scenarios and the sensitivity to process improvements were also assessed, helping prioritize further research based on sustainability impact. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Realistic economic assessment of land-intensive alternative energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, and biofuels) requires information on land availability and price. Accordingly, we created a comprehensive, national-scale model of these parameters for the United States. For algae-based biofuel, a minimum of 1.04E + 05 km2 (1.3% of coterminous United States land area) of land is needed to meet the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 advanced biofuels target of 1.04E + 8 m3 yr-1, to be achieved by the year 2022. We locate and quantify land categories where land acquisition costs and economic disruption are minimized. A data-driven model calculates the incentive to sell and a fair compensation value (real estate and lost future income). 1.02E + 06 km2 (14% of CONUS) of low-slope, non-protected land is relatively available including croplands, pasture/grazing, and forests. Within this total there is 2.64E + 5 km2 of shrub and barren land available. The Federal government has 7.68E + 4 km2 available for lease. Targeting unproductive lands minimizes land costs and impacts to existing industries. However, many shrub and barren lands are limited by other resources (water) and logistics, so land use conversion requires careful consideration in tradeoff analysis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Union (EU) set a binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids. In this study, the GHG emissions of biodiesel chain from sunflower, rapeseed and soybean were calculated in compliance with the European Union Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC (RED).Input data used for the agricultural step were referred to the Umbrian region for sunflower and rapeseed and to the Veneto region for soybean, while data obtained from the main Italian biodiesel plants were employed for the processing step. Results showed that GHG emissions were higher than default values reported in the RED for sunflower and rapeseed and lower for soybean. Only sunflower biodiesel does not reach the minimum value of GHG saving (35%). The main differences with data used in the RED concern cultivation step, while the processing step has overall the same values of GHG emissions. Finally, three case studies were examined in order to identify possible improvements to make the analyzed supply chains more sustainable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The energetic, environmental, and economic performance of four bioenergy plant species (Αcacia cyanophylla, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Populus nigra, and Arundo donax), irrigated with pre-treated effluent in a three-year-field trial, was investigated. Results showed that irrigation was more energy demanding compared to other practices. A. cyanophylla achieved 34, 83, and 189% higher above ground biomass energy yield than E. camaldulensis, A. donax, and P. nigra, respectively. A. cyanophylla and E. camaldulensis had higher energy requirements but they achieved higher net energy yield and energy ratio. P. nigra (3.49 € GJ-1) and A. donax (2.34 € GJ-1) were found to have higher energy production cost compared to E. camaldulensis (1.65 € GJ-1) and A. cyanophylla (1.24 € GJ-1). P. nigra and A. donax had the highest nutrient use efficiency for nitrogen (NUE-N) and phosphorus (NUE-P), respectively. It was concluded that species with low NUE, which is opposite to current directions, and high water use efficiency (WUE) (i.e. plant species with relatively low water demands and great biomass allocation in leaves), are more suitable when irrigation with strong effluent occur and N removal is primary objective. Such plant species have comparatively lower energy requirements, which is consistent with the current trend for low energy inputs in agriculture. To mitigate the losses in plant biomass and reduce the adverse environmental impacts from nutrients, additional practices should be adopted. Our results help us to draw important conclusions in order to set criteria in the selection of suitable bioenergy crops and practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biomass for energy production has increasingly been encouraged in the United States, in part motivated by the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to fossil fuels. However, the GHG-intensity of biomass-derived energy is highly dependent on how the biomass is obtained and used. We explore scenario uncertainty in GHG estimates in the Calculating Uncertainty in Biomass Emissions (CUBE) model and find that direct land-use change emissions that result during the biomass production often dominate the total "farm-to-hopper" GHGs. CUBE represents each land-use change decision as a conversion of land from one of four specified baseline ecosystem to produce one of seven feedstock crops, both distinct by geographic region, and then determines the implied changes in soil organic carbon, root carbon, and above-ground biomass. CUBE therefore synthesizes and organizes the existing literature to represent direct land-use change emissions in a way that can be more readily incorporated into life cycle assessment. Our approach to representing direct land-use change literature has been applied to a specific set of data and offers immediate implications for decisionmakers, but it can also be generalized and replicated in the future, making use of improved scientific data on the magnitude and rates of direct land-use change emissions as it becomes available. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluates the carbon fluxes and trends and examines the environmental sustainability (e.g., carbon budget, source or sink) of the potential biofuel feedstock sites identified in the Greater Platte River Basin (GPRB). A 9-year (2000-2008) time series of net ecosystem production (NEP), a measure of net carbon absorption or emission by ecosystems, was used to assess the historical trends and budgets of carbon flux for grasslands in the GPRB. The spatially averaged annual NEP (ANEP) for grassland areas that are possibly suitable for biofuel expansion (productive grasslands) was 71-169 g C m-2 year-1 during 2000-2008, indicating a carbon sink (more carbon is absorbed than released) in these areas. The spatially averaged ANEP for areas not suitable for biofuel feedstock development (less productive or degraded grasslands) was -47 to 69 g C m-2 year-1 during 2000-2008, showing a weak carbon source or a weak carbon sink (carbon emitted is nearly equal to carbon absorbed). The 9-year pre-harvest cumulative ANEP was 1166 g C m-2 for the suitable areas (a strong carbon sink) and 200 g C m-2 for the non-suitable areas (a weak carbon sink). Results demonstrate and confirm that our method of dynamic modeling of ecosystem performance can successfully identify areas desirable and sustainable for future biofuel feedstock development. This study provides useful information for land managers and decision makers to make optimal land use decisions regarding biofuel feedstock development and sustainability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diversified grasslands that contain native plant species can produce biofuels, support sustainable grazing systems, and produce other ecosystem services. However, ecosystem service production can be disrupted by invasion of exotic perennial plants, and these plants can have soil-microbial "legacies" that may interfere with establishment and maintenance of diversified grasslands even after effective management of the invasive species. The nature of such legacies is not well understood, but may involve suppression of mutualisms between native species and soil microbes. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that legacy effects of invasive species change colonization rates, diversity, and composition of arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with seedlings of co-occurring invasive and native grassland species. In a glasshouse, experimental soils were conditioned by cultivating three invasive grassland perennials, three native grassland perennials, and a native perennial mixture. Each was grown separately through three cycles of growth, after which we used T-RFLP analysis to characterize AMF associations of seedlings of six native perennial and six invasive perennial species grown in these soils. Legacy effects of soil conditioning by invasive species did not affect AMF richness in seedling roots, but did affect AMF colonization rates and the taxonomic composition of mycorrhizal associations in seedling roots. Moreover, native species were more heavily colonized by AMF and roots of native species had greater AMF richness (number of AMF operational taxonomic units per seedling) than did invasive species. The invasive species used to condition soil in this experiment have been shown to have legacy effects on biomass of native seedlings, reducing their growth in this and a previous similar experiment. Therefore, our results suggest that successful plant invaders can have legacies that affect soil-microbial associations of native plants and that these effects can inhibit growth of native plant species in invaded communities.

AB  - Co-digestion of cattle slurry and maize has been shown to have benefits for both, improving the biogas yield of the slurry and stability of digestion of the maize. The effect of increasing the total loading rate from 3 to 6g VS l-1 day-1 on the co-digestion of cattle slurry and maize, mixed at equal volatile solids volumes, was investigated in laboratory-scale continuously stirred digesters. These were compared with similar digesters evaluating the increase of 1.5 to 3 g VS l-1 day-1 loading rates of slurry and maize digested separately. Compared with mono-digestion of the substrates, where the digestion of maize failed at loading rates greater than 2.5 g VS l-1 day-1, the co-digestion of cattle slurry and maize was feasible at all the loading rates tested with an increase in the volumetric methane yield occurring with loading rate. Even at the lowest rate of loading, the addition of equal amounts of volatile solids of maize to slurry leads to an increase in volumetric methane yield of 219%. © IWA Publishing 2012.

AB  - In this paper, we explore GHG emission scenarios up to 2050 in Asia and the world as part of the Asian Modeling Exercise and assess technology options for meeting a 2.6W/m2 radiative forcing target using AIM/Enduse[Global] and AIM/Impact[Policy]. Global GHG emissions in 2050 are required to be reduced by 72% relative to a reference scenario, which corresponds to a 57% reduction from the 2005 level, in order to meet the above target. Energy intensity improvement contributes a lot to curbing CO2 emission in the short-term. Meanwhile, carbon intensity reduction and CO2 capture play a large role for further emission reduction in the mid to long-term. The top five key technologies in terms of reduction amount are CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation and biofuel, which, in total, account for about 60% of global GHG emissions reduction in 2050. We implement additional model runs, each of which enforced limited availability of one of the key technology. The result shows that the 2.6W/m2 target up to 2050 is achievable even if availability of any one of the key technologies is limited to half the level achieved in the default simulation. However, if the use of CCS or biomass is limited, the cumulative GHG abatement cost until 2050 increases considerably. Therefore CCS and biomass have a vital role in curbing costs to achieve significant emission reductions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fallowing with green fertilizer can benefit agricultural ecosystem services (AES). Farmers in Taiwan do not implement fallow practices and plant green fertilizer because the current subsidy level (46,000 NT$ per ha) is too low to manage fallowing. This paper defines the objective of government agriculture policy or the farmer's objective as maximization of farm productivity, approximated to the value of social welfare and AES. Farms, which do not follow proper fallowing practices, often have poorly maintained fallow land or left farmland abandoned. This results in negative environmental consequences such as cutworm infestations in abandoned land, which in turn can affect crops in adjacent farmlands. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, it determines the proper fallowing subsidy based on the concept of payment for ecosystem services to entice more farmers to participate in fallowing. Second, it simulates the benefit of planting green manure in fallow land to the supply of AES based on the rate of farmers who are willing to participate in fallow land practices and essential parameters that can affect soil fertility change. The approach involves a series of interviews and a developed empirical model. The value of AES when the rate of farmer participation is 100% represents a 1.5% increase in AES (448,317,000 NT$) over the value at the current participation rate of 14%. This study further concludes that the appropriate fallowing subsidy has a large positive impact on AES and social welfare (e. g., benefit from food and biofuel supplies) and is seen as a basis of ecological governance for sustainable agro-ecosystems. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Transformation of the south-western Australian landscape from deep-rooted woody vegetation systems to shallow-rooted annual cropping systems has resulted in the severe loss of biodiversity and this loss has been exacerbated by rising ground waters that have mobilised stored salts causing extensive dry land salinity. Since the original plant communities were mostly perennial and deep rooted, the model for sustainable agriculture and landscape water management invariably includes deep rooted trees. Commercial forestry is however only economical in higher rainfall (&gt;700mmyr-1) areas whereas much of the area where biodiversity is threatened has lower rainfall (300-700mmyr-1). Agroforestry may provide the opportunity to develop new agricultural landscapes that interlace ecosystem services such as carbon mitigation via carbon sequestration and biofuels, biodiversity restoration, watershed management while maintaining food production. Active markets are developing for some of these ecosystem services, however a lack of predictive metrics and the regulatory environment are impeding the adoption of several ecosystem services. Nonetheless, a clear opportunity exists for four major issues - the maintenance of food and fibre production, salinisation, biodiversity decline and climate change mitigation - to be managed at a meaningful scale and a new, sustainable agricultural landscape to be developed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cynara cardunculus can be grown as high biomass crop for energy or biofuel. Marginal land rather than farmland should be used for such crops. Here we evaluated the tolerance of Cynara plants to Cd and As using controlled-environment conditions and hydroponic culture. The aim was to ascertain whether this species could be potentially useful for phytoremediation of marginal soils with excess Cd or As burdens. Plants were exposed to 5. μM Cd or to 5 or 10. μM As in the form of arsenate or arsenite. Root elongation, malonyldialdehyde production and total concentrations of total acid soluble thiols were used as indicators of stress response. Biomass production and root and shoot accumulation of Cd and As were determined. The plants exhibited considerable tolerance to Cd and As. Biomass was hardly affected by the potentially toxic concentrations of Cd and As. Cadmium was preferentially accumulated in old leaves. Contrastingly, As was efficiently retained in the roots. Results indicate that C. cardunculus can be a useful species for phytoextraction of Cd from polluted soils. On soils rich in arsenic, cardoon could be grown as an energy crop that can help to stabilize these soils. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper studies the land use change impacts of fuels and biofuels. We test the theoretical hypothesis, which says that changes in fuel prices cause changes in land use both directly and indirectly and that, because of price inter-dependencies, biofuels reinforce the land use change impacts. We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to five major traded agricultural commodities, the cultivated area of agricultural land and crude oil price. Our data consists of yearly observations extending from 1950 to 2007 for the US. The empirical findings confirm that markets for crude oil and cultivated agricultural land are interdependent: an increase in oil price by 1. dollar/barrel increases land use between 54,000 and 68,000. ha. We also find that the increase of bioenergy sector accelerates land use change in the US, i.e. food commodities are being substituted for bioenergy crops. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a Green Biorefinery processing green biomass, one possible application for the press-cake fraction is as biomass fuel for combustion. In an industrial setting, the preservation of herbage as silage and its subsequent fractionation into press-juice and press-cake fractions represent the two major process steps in the utilization of green biomass. This study investigated (i) the effects of ensiling and fractionation on the chemical composition of three common temperate grassland species harvested at different stages of maturity and (ii) the suitability of the herbage of these species for thermal combustion. The high contents of ash, N, Cl and K in perennial ryegrass, cocksfoot and red clover, at both pre- and post-ensiling, make these materials less suitable for combustion in certain applications. The loss of soluble/fermentable organic matter during ensiling increased the relative proportions of fibre, ash and N in the herbage, but these changes were relatively minor. In contrast, the substantial reduction in the concentration of compounds such as ash, N, Cl and K during fractionation improved the suitability of the press-cake fraction for combustion compared with the parent material. Press-cake prepared from later-harvested grass herbage with lower ash, S and N contents would be more suitable for combustion. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Increasingly, ethical concerns are being raised regarding bioenergy production. However, the ethical issues often do not stand out very clearly. The aim of the present paper is to improve on this situation by analyzing the bioenergy discussion from the perspective of land use. From this perspective, bioenergy production may give rise to ethical problems because it competes with other forms of land use. This may generate ethical problems mainly for two reasons. First, bioenergy production may compete, directly or indirectly, with food production; and as consequence the food security of poor people may be adversely affected (social aspects arguments). Secondly, the production of bioenergy may directly or indirectly lead to deforestation and other changes of land use that have a negative effect on greenhouse gas emissions (environmental arguments). So from this perspective the main challenge raised by bioenergy production is to secure responsible land use. The purpose of the paper is not to advocate, or promote, a specific ethical position on bioenergy, but to structure the main arguments found. The paper falls in two parts. One part addresses social aspects arguments for using agricultural land for bioenergy-where food insecurity, malnourishment, and significant food poverty are the main concerns. The second part scopes environmental implications-notably greenhouse gas emissions impact, as affected by deforestation and other (indirect) land-use changes. Alongside showing some of the current dilemmas presented by wider land-use changes, arguments are analyzed from two ethical angels: a consequentialist and a deontological. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane is a prime bioethanol feedstock. Currently, sugarcane ethanol is produced through fermentation of the sucrose, which can easily be extracted from stem internodes. Processes for production of biofuels from the abundant lignocellulosic sugarcane residues will boost the ethanol output from sugarcane per land area. However, unlocking the vast amount of chemical energy stored in plant cell walls remains expensive primarily because of the intrinsic recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass. We report here the successful reduction in lignification in sugarcane by RNA interference, despite the complex and highly polyploid genome of this interspecific hybrid. Down-regulation of the sugarcane caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene by 67% to 97% reduced the lignin content by 3.9% to 13.7%, respectively. The syringyl/guaiacyl ratio in the lignin was reduced from 1.47 in the wild type to values ranging between 1.27 and 0.79. The yields of directly fermentable glucose from lignocellulosic biomass increased up to 29% without pretreatment. After dilute acid pretreatment, the fermentable glucose yield increased up to 34%. These observations demonstrate that a moderate reduction in lignin (3.9% to 8.4%) can reduce the recalcitrance of sugarcane biomass without compromising plant performance under controlled environmental conditions. © 2012 The Authors Plant Biotechnology Journal © 2012 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Net benefits of bioenergy crops, including maize and perennial grasses such as switchgrass, are a function of several factors including the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestered by these crops. Life cycle assessments (LCA) for bioenergy crops have been conducted using models in which SOC information is usually from the top 30 to 40 cm. Information on the effects of crop management practices on SOC has been limited so LCA models have largely not included any management practice effects. In the first 9 years of a long-term C sequestration study in eastern Nebraska, USA, switchgrass and maize with best management practices had average annual increases in SOC per hectare that exceed 2 Mg C year -1 (7. 3 Mg CO 2 year -1) for the 0 to 150 soil depth. For both switchgrass and maize, over 50 % of the increase in SOC was below the 30 cm depth. SOC sequestration by switchgrass was twofold to fourfold greater than that used in models to date which also assumed no SOC sequestration by maize. The results indicate that N fertilizer rates and harvest management regimes can affect the magnitude of SOC sequestration. The use of uniform soil C effects for bioenergy crops from sampling depths of 30 to 40 cm across agro-ecoregions for large scale LCA is questionable. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), a multistemmed tree that grows on grasslands and rangelands in the South Central USA (Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico), may have potential as a bioenergy feedstock due to a large amount of existing standing biomass and significant regrowth potential following initial harvest. The objective of this research was to determine the cost to harvest, store, and deliver mesquite biomass feedstock to a bioelectricity plant under the assumption that the rights to harvest mesquite could be acquired in long-term leases. The advantage of mesquite and similar rangeland shrubs as bioenergy feedstocks is that they do not grow on land better suited for growing food or fiber and thus will not impact agricultural food markets as corn grain ethanol has done. In addition, there are no cultivation costs. Results indicated that mesquite biomass density (Mg ha -1) and harvesting costs are major factors affecting cost of delivered biomass. Annual biomass consumption by the bioelectricity plant and percent of the total system area that contains biomass density that is suitable for harvest significantly affected land- related factors including total system area needed per bioelectricity plant and transport costs. Simulation results based on actual biomass density in Texas showed that higher and more spatially consistent biomass density would be an important factor in selecting a potential location for the bioelectricity plant. Harvesting mesquite has the potential for bioenergy feedstock given certain densities and total land areas since higher harvest and transport costs are offset by essentially no production costs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - As part of pioneering efforts to assess the potential of native microalgae as biofuel feedstock in South-Eastern Buenos Aires, 34 monoalgal cultures (corresponding to the Phylum Chlorophyta) were established and 21 were selected for further growth and biomass composition characterization. Novel RNA sequences in the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region were identified. Some strains showed desirable traits as biodiesel feedstock such as (i) apparent maximal doubling times of 6h, (ii) lipids accumulation of up to 43% of their dry biomass, (iii) high ration of mono-unsaturated to poly-unsaturated fatty acids, (iv) high response to CO2 supplementation, and (v) complete sedimentation in 4h. Data of the outdoors performance of some strains suggested they might represent valuable resources for future research towards the regional development of the technology for microalgae-based biofuels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite growing interest and investments in biological fuels, little is known of how the public form opinions toward this alternative fuel technology. This study examines public opinion of biofuels by focusing on several factors that can be expected to influence citizens' opinions about the issue. First, we tested the results of a framing experiment that was embedded within a public opinion survey. This experiment explored how the public responded to the term "biofuels" as compared to the term "ethanol." Our results suggest that, overall, respondents tended to react more favorably to the former as opposed to the latter term. Second, we examined the impacts of sociodemographics on public attitudes toward biofuels. We found that while sociodemographics did little to consistently explain attitudes toward biofuels there was clear evidence of ideological influences on attitudes, with self-identifying Democrats showing more positive attitudes overall. Finally, we explored the interaction between political partisanship and our experimental manipulation. We found evidence that our wording manipulation differed based on the political party identification of our respondents, with Democrats fluctuating greatly in their assessments depending upon whether they were asked to evaluate "biofuels" or "ethanol.". © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The need to mitigate climate change makes production of liquid biofuels a high priority. Substituting fossil fuels by biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas has gained widespread attention as Jatropha cultivation is claimed to offer green house gas emission reductions. Farmers respond worldwide to this increasing demand by converting forests into Jatropha, but whether Jatropha-based biodiesel offers carbon savings depends on the carbon emissions that occur when land use is changed to Jatropha. This paper provides an impact assessment of a small-scale Jatropha project in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. The paper outlines the estimated impacts on above and below-ground carbon stocks when land use is changed to increase Jatropha production. The results show that expansion of Jatropha production will most likely lead to the conversion of miombo forest areas to Jatropha, which implies a reduction in above and below-ground carbon stocks. The carbon debts created by the land use change can be repaid by replacing fossil fuels with Jatropha-based biodiesel. A repayment time of almost two centuries is found with optimistic estimates of the carbon debt, while the use of pessimistic values results in a repayment time that approaches the millennium. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid expansion of biofuel production and consumption has raised concerns over the social and environmental sustainability of biofuel feedstock production, processing and trade. The European Union (EU) has thus balanced its commitment to biofuels as one option for meeting its renewable energy targets with sustainability criteria for economic operators supplying biofuels to member states. Seven voluntary "EU sustainability schemes" were approved in July, 2011 as a means to verify compliance. While mandated sustainability criteria have a strong environmental focus, a number of these voluntary schemes have social sustainability as a significant component of the requirements put forward for achieving certification. As several of these voluntary schemes are incipient, thereby limiting evidence on their effectiveness in practice, this analysis is based on a comparative analysis of the substantive content or 'scope' of these schemes and the likely procedural effectiveness of the same. Findings show that while some schemes have considerable coverage of social sustainability concerns, poor coverage of some critical issues, the presence of schemes lacking any social sustainability requirements, and gaps in procedural rules are likely to undermine the likelihood that social sustainability is achieved through these schemes or the EU sustainability policies lending credibility to them. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we use a technological model of Ireland's future car stock to simulate the impact of a range of policy measures on the baseline trend in energy demand in the period to 2030. The policies and measures modelled comprise meeting deployment targets for electric vehicles and compressed natural gas vehicles, an EU regulation for the improvement of vehicle efficiency, implementation of a national biofuel obligation, as well as several behavioural measures (encouraging modal shifting and reduced travel demand). The impact of the different measures simulated is measured in terms of their contribution to meeting Ireland's ambitious targets for energy savings, for renewable energy penetration and for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. The results point to a possible improvement of 32% in car stock efficiency, the achievement of 7.8% renewable energy share of road and rail transport and a 22% reduction in non-ETS private car CO 2 emissions relative to 2009 levels. A scenario analysis on meeting the EV penetration target shows a significant range of CO 2 emissions reductions depending on the cars (and mileage) displaced and on the electricity generation portfolio. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - China promulgated the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy in 2007, which included sub-targets of 2010 and 2020 for various renewable energy technologies. Almost all the 2010 sub-targets have been met and even surpassed except non-grain fuel ethanol. There is debate surrounding the questions of whether and how the country will be able to meet the 2020 biofuels target. This paper provides the assessment of potential technology pathways to achieve the 2020 target regarding their respective resource potential and supply cost. Barriers and policy options are identified based on broad literatures review. And an overview of biofuels projections is presented to provide insight into the comparison of various policy scenarios. The study shows that China can potentially satisfy non-grain fuel ethanol target by 2020 from technology perspective. But she will probably fall far short of this target if current situations continue. Additional policy efforts are needed. Meanwhile, the target of biodiesel production has high probability to be achieved. However, if given support policies, it will develop better. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although sustainable bioenergy development in Africa is critically debated, if projects are developed within a credible framework, opportunities for sustainability arguably can arise. This paper presents research on the characteristics of sustainable biofuel projects as provided in the literature and according to expert opinions obtained by way of a survey involving thirty-eight international experts. Participants were selected for their expertise in the fields of environmental, social and economic sustainability relating to biofuels in Africa. The survey results suggest that projects which display a high degree of transparency, incorporate local stakeholder involvement, and ideally include local villagers as partners are more likely to achieve sustainable biofuel production. Experts also indicated that reconciling diverse stakeholder objectives alongside the principles of sustainable development remains an ongoing challenge. A process is recommended for sustainable biofuel development, which attempts to harmonise efficiency, stakeholder interaction and the integration of diverse stakeholder perspectives. To support the process, it is recommended that an advisory/mediating body that acts according to best practice principles would be of great assistance. Such an advisory/mediating body would be conversant with local land, social, economic and environmental conditions, project sustainability and administration, and also advise on biofuel framework educational needs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Economic, energy, and environmental impacts of 11 types of bioethanol feedstock in China were evaluated using a mixed-unit input-output life cycle assessment model. Corn grain and wheat grain had higher negative economic, energy, and environmental impacts. Sweet sorghum, cassava, sugar beet, and sugarcane showed better economic performance but increasing negative energy and environmental impacts. Cellulose-based feedstocks in general showed positive economic, energy, and environmental performance; but may lead to increasing negative impacts on freshwater use, global warming, toxicity, and aquatic ecotoxicity. Sugarcane-based bioethanol had the potential to provide positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts in China. Scrap paper-derived ethanol could also become promising under significant government support. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India has developed a national biofuel policy to increase energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate rural development. In this policy, the government has set blending targets for mixing ethanol and biodiesel with gasoline and diesel, respectively. In India, ethanol is produced from irrigated sugar-cane while biodiesel is produced from jatropha, which is said to require no irrigation. This paper analyzes the possible impacts of an increase in sugar-cane and jatropha production on water management and use. It finds that India's biofuel policy is likely to place additional pressure on scarce water resources. Although the development of biofuels may be necessary, care must be taken to anticipate its likely impacts on water resources. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Ecophysiological models that vertically resolve vegetation canopy states are becoming a powerful tool for studying the exchange of mass, energy, and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere. A mechanistic multilayer canopy-soil-root system model (MLCan) developed by Drewry et al. (2010a) has been used to capture the emergent vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric CO 2 for both C 3 and C 4 plants under various climate conditions. However, processing input data and setting up such a model can be time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, a graphical user interface that has been developed for MLCan is presented. The design of this interface aims to provide visualization capabilities and interactive support for processing input meteorological forcing data and vegetation parameter values to facilitate the use of this model. In addition, the interface also provides graphical tools for analyzing the forcing data and simulated numerical results. The model and its interface are both written in the MATLAB programming language. Finally, an application of this model package for capturing the ecohydrological responses of three bioenergy crops (maize, miscanthus, and switchgrass) to local environmental drivers at two different sites in the Midwestern United States is presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the environmental consequences of anaerobic mono- and co-digestion of pig manure to produce bio-energy, from a life cycle perspective. This included assessing environmental impacts and land use change emissions (LUC) required to replace used co-substrates for anaerobic digestion. Environmental impact categories considered were climate change, terrestrial acidification, marine and freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, land use, and fossil fuel depletion. Six scenarios were evaluated: mono-digestion of manure, co-digestion with: maize silage, maize silage and glycerin, beet tails, wheat yeast concentrate (WYC), and roadside grass. Mono-digestion reduced most impacts, but represented a limited source for bio-energy. Co-digestion with maize silage, beet tails, and WYC (competing with animal feed), and glycerin increased bio-energy production (up to 568%), but at expense of increasing climate change (through LUC), marine eutrophication, and land use. Co-digestion with wastes or residues like roadside grass gave the best environmental performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mallee eucalypt crops from the low-rainfall dryland agricultural regions of southern Australia may become a major source of woody biomass for production of liquid biofuels through pyrolysis and biorefinery. Pyrolysis studies have commonly focused on the woody fraction and relatively little is known about the pyrolysis behaviour of leaves that make up a substantial portion of the overall plant biomass. In this study, mallee leaves were pyrolysed in a fluidized-bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 300 to 580 °C. The collected bio-oil products were characterised with various analytical techniques, including Karl Fischer titration, thermogravimetry, GC/MS, UV-fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopies. Our results show that, during pyrolysis, leaves behave very differently from the wood of the same mallee trees. Leaves tend to give a higher yield of char and a lower yield organics in bio-oil than the wood. The bio-oils produced from leaves and wood show distinctly different compositions. Eucalyptol, a chemical compound present in eucalyptus leaves, was found in high concentration in the bio-oils from the leaves. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large-scale production of feedstock crops for biofuels will lead to land use changes. We quantify the effects of realistic land use change scenarios for biofuel feedstock production on isoprene emissions and hence atmospheric composition and chemistry using the HadGEM2 model. Two feedstocks are considered: oil palm for biodiesel in the tropics and short rotation coppice (SRC) in the mid-latitudes. In total, 69 Mha of oil palm and 9 Mha of SRC are planted, each sufficient to replace just over 1% of projected global fossil fuel demand in 2020. Both planting scenarios result in increases in total global annual isoprene emissions of about 1%. In each case, changes in surface concentrations of ozone and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (bSOA) are substantial at the regional scale, with implications for air quality standards. However, the changes in tropospheric burden of ozone and the OH radical, and hence effects on global climate, are negligible. Over SE Asia, one region of oil palm planting, increases in annual mean surface ozone and bSOA concentrations reach over 3 ppbv (+11%) and 0.4 μg m-3 (+10%) respectively for parts of Borneo, with monthly mean increases of up to 6.5 ppbv (+25%) and 0.5 μg m-3 (+12%). Under the SRC scenario, Europe experiences monthly mean changes of over 0.6 ppbv (+1%) and 0.1 μg m-3 (+5%) in June and July, with peak increases of over 2 ppbv (+3%) and 0.5 μg m-3 (+8 %). That appreciable regional atmospheric impacts result from low level planting scenarios demonstrates the need to include changes in emissions of reactive trace gases such as isoprene in life cycle assessments performed on potential biofuel feedstocks. © 2012 Author(s).

AB  - In this study, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment has been performed with the aim of finding out how the environmental impact derived from biodiesel production (using raw sunflower oil or waste cooking oils) could be affected by the degree of decentralization of the production (number of production plants in a given territory). The decentralized production of biodiesel has been proposed for several reasons, such as the possibility of small scale production, the fact that there is no need to use high technology or make large investments, and because small plants do not need highly specialized technical staff. Thus, hypothetical territories (considering scenarios in which the production and area were theoretically modified), as well as real territories, have been analyzed to determine which environmental indicators were most affected. Results showed that the optimum degree of centralization was different for each analyzed case. In general, in small territories centralized production was more suitable for the environment, decentralization being more advisable as the territory increased in area. For each of the cases analyzed, an optimum number of plants, which minimized the environmental impacts, was found. This work illustrates the importance of considering the number of industrial plants in the production design, not only from an economic aspect but also from an environmental point of view. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With increasing demand for biofuels, jatropha is considered as one of the biofuel crops, which is suitable for growth under adverse conditions including drought and salinity which mainly occur in arid and semi-arid environment. We report here to what extent salt stress affected water loss, canopy water vapor conductance, leaf growth and Na and K concentrations of leaves of 3-year old and young plants. Adult (on peat substrate) and young (in hydroponic system) plants were exposed to seven (0-300 mmol NaCl L -1) and five salt levels (0-200 mmol NaCl L -1), during 20 and 6 days, respectively. In both experiments, plants responded rapidly to salt stress by reducing water loss. The threshold value of responses was between 0 and 5 dS m -1. Leaf area increment of young jatropha had a threshold value of 5 dS m -1 implying that jatropha responds sensitive to external salt application in term of canopy development, conductance and CO 2 assimilation rate. The rapid decrease of canopy conductance indicates that jatropha is effectively protecting leaves from massive Na import into leaves over short time periods. Our data indicate that use of wastewater in (semi-)arid areas should be carefully considered if high productivity is the key of plantation management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There are millions of acres of chemically contaminated lands on which biofuel crops can be planted for dual purposes of biomass production and land reclamation. Phytoremediation is a proven technology for environmental cleanup, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical environments. There are advantages in that multiple growing seasons and increased soil temperature accelerate the clean-up processes. Seeds of 13 tropical and temperate plant species were germinated and grown for 10 days in petroleum contaminated soil containing 3148 μg/g of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results indicate that the presence of PAHs enhanced both emergence and early seedling growth with some of the species tested. Kiawe tree germination rate was 7-fold higher in PAH soils than that in the control media. The potential biofuel grasses sugarcane, banagrass, switch grass, vetiver and miscanthus showed degradation of PAHs in at least one of the amended PAH-contaminated soils in 35 days of growth. Banagrass biomass production in all the treatments was far greater than the other four species. No plant control pots were most effective to reduce PAHs in the un-amended PAH soil. Vetiver degraded all PAHs when planted in the PAH soil amended with 1/3 of the Promix soil (a 2/3 PAH soil volume). Among five biofuel crops tested, banagrass produced a tripled amount or more of biomass than all the other species in the LF-14 un-amended PAH soil or its amended soils. The dry weight (dw) biomass of banagrass averaged ∼3 g/day/3-L pot in all PAH soils and 6 g/day/3-L pot in Promix as harvested at the ground level. Banagrass in 90-cm spacing could produce approximately 30 tons/ha/yr of dry matter in a 70-day crop season. The results warrant further investigation of biofuel crops for phytoremediation and biomass production purposes. Future plantings may be considered using these and other crops in combination with applicable contaminants to help clean up the contaminated environment and reduce petroleum dependency.

AB  - Comprehensive European or global regulation on sustainable biofuels does not yet exist. In the near future, it is likely that 10 percent of the energy used for transportation in the EU will consist mostly of biofuels, the majority of which will be imported from third countries. As the EU only has legislative jurisdiction regarding its Member States, the asymmetry between the locations of feedstock, the production of biofuel and the end users creates particular legal challenges for the sustainability scheme. It is not enough that to just correct the evident deficiencies of the current scheme; the EU sustainability scheme must provide a comprehensive answer to the complex sustainability challenges. One option could be a global approach driven by the EU leadership position. This article evaluates the legal applicability of the EU sustainability scheme against the global scenario of biofuels. Indirect land-use change is explored as the culminating issue of biofuel sustainability. The article also analyses the current regulatory approach, from the view that is it adequate in terms of securing the sustainable production of biofuels, especially in relation to the notion on 'global' biofuels. Combating climate change forces new environmental problems to stand out, which also creates new legal challenges. In the field of dynamic climate change law, biofuel sustainability is an apt example of this.

AB  - Many efforts have been taken to find energy alternatives to reduce anthropogenic influences on climate. Recent studies have shown that using land for bioenergy plantations may be more cost effective and provide a greater potential for CO2 abatement than using land for carbon sequestration. Native southern U.S. pines(i.e., loblolly) have excellent potential as bioenergy feedstocks. However, the land-cover change due to expansion of biofuels may impact climate through biophysical feedbacks. Here, the authors access the local and remote consequences of greater forest management and biofuel feedstock expansion on climate and hydrology using a global climate model, the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The authors examine a plausible U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) biofuel feedstock goal by afforesting 50 million acres of C4 grasslands in the southeastern United States with an optimized loblolly plant functional type. Changes in sensible and latent heat fluxes are related to increased surface roughness, reduced bareground evaporation, and changes in stomatal conductance. In the coupled simulations, these mechanisms lead to a 1°C cooling, higher atmospheric stability, and a more shallow planetary boundary layer over the southeastern United States during the summer; in winter, a cooling of up to 0.25°C between 40° and 60°N,a weakened Aleutian low, and a wetter Australia occurs. A weakened Aleutian low shifts the North Pacific storm track poleward in the future loblolly scenarios. These local and global impacts suggest that biophysical feedbacks need to be considered when evaluating the benefits of bioenergy feedstock production. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - An increasing number of investors is looking at algae as a viable source of biofuels, beside cultivation for human/animal feeding or to extract high-value chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, present biomass productivities are far below theoretical estimations implying that a large part of the available photosynthetically active radiation is not used in photosynthesis. Light utilisation inefficiency and rapid light attenuation within a mass culture due to high pigment optical density of wild type strains have been proposed as major limiting factors reducing solar-to-biomass conversion efficiency. Analysis of growth yields of mutants with reduced light-harvesting antennae and/or reduced overall pigment concentration per cell, generated by either mutagenesis or genetic engineering, could help understanding limiting factors for biomass accumulation in photobioreactor. Meanwhile, studies on photo-acclimation can provide additional information on the average status of algal cells in a photobioreactor to be used in modelling-based predictions. Identifying limiting factors in solar-to-biomass conversion efficiency is the first step for planning strategies of genetic improvement and domestication of algae to finally fill the gap between theoretical and industrial photosynthetic productivity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are capable of directly converting sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into hydrocarbon fuel or precursors thereof. Many biological and non-biological factors will influence the ability of such a production system to become economically sustainable. We evaluated two factors in engineerable cyanobacteria which could potentially limit economic sustainability: (i) tolerance of the host to the intended end-product, and (ii) stoichiometric potential for production. Alcohols, when externally added, inhibited growth the most, followed by aldehydes and acids, whilst alkanes were the least inhibitory. The growth inhibition became progressively greater with increasing chain-length for alcohols, whilst the intermediate C6 alkane caused more inhibition than both C3 and C11 alkane. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was more tolerant to some of the tested chemicals than Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, particularly ethanol and undecane. Stoichiometric evaluation of the potential yields suggested that there is no difference in the potential productivity of harvestable energy between any of the studied fuels, with the exception of ethylene, for which maximal stoichiometric yield is considerably lower. In summary, it was concluded that alkanes would constitute the best choice metabolic end-product for fuel production using cyanobacteria if high-yielding strains can be developed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Development of sustainable energy is a pivotal step towards solutions for today's global challenges, including mitigating the progression of climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuels derived from agricultural crops have already been commercialized. However the impacts on environmental sustainability and food supply have raised ethical questions about the current practices. Cyanobacteria have attracted interest as an alternative means for sustainable energy productions. Being aquatic photoautotrophs they can be cultivated in non-arable lands and do not compete for land for food production. Their rich genetic resources offer means to engineer metabolic pathways for synthesis of valuable bio-based products. Currently the major obstacle in industrial-scale exploitation of cyanobacteria as the economically sustainable production hosts is low yields. Much effort has been made to improve the carbon fixation and manipulating the carbon allocation in cyanobacteria and their evolutionary photosynthetic relatives, algae and plants. This review aims at providing an overview of the recent progress in the bioengineering of carbon fixation and allocation in cyanobacteria; wherever relevant, the progress made in plants and algae is also discussed as an inspiration for future application in cyanobacteria. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of new technologies for production of alternative fuel became necessary to circumvent finite petroleum resources, associate rising costs, and environmental concerns due to rising fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Several alternatives have been proposed to develop a sustainable industrial society and reduce greenhouse emissions. The idea of biological conversion of CO2 to fuel and chemicals is receiving increased attention. In particular, the direct conversion of CO2 with solar energy to biofuel by photosynthetic microorganisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria has several advantages compared to traditional biofuel production from plant biomass. Photosynthetic microorganisms have higher growth rates compared with plants, and the production systems can be based on non-arable land. The advancement of synthetic biology and genetic manipulation has permitted engineering of cyanobacteria to produce non-natural chemicals typically not produced by these organisms in nature. This review addresses recent publications that utilize different approaches involving engineering cyanobacteria for production of high value chemicals including biofuels. © 2012.

AB  - This paper describes the isolation and partial biomass characterization of high triacylglycerol (TAG) mutants of Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus obliquus, two algal species considered as potential source of biodiesel. Following UV mutagenesis, 2000 Chlorella and 2800 Scenedesmus colonies were screened with a method based on Nile Red fluorescence. Several mutants with high Nile Red fluorescence were selected by this high-throughput method in both species. Growth and biomass parameters of the strongest mutants were analyzed in detail. All of the four Chlorella mutants showed no significant changes in growth rate, cell weight, cell size, protein and chlorophyll contents on a per cell basis. Whereas all contained elevated total lipid and TAG content per unit of dry weight, two of them were also affected for starch metabolism, suggesting a change in biomass/storage carbohydrate composition. Two Scenedesmus mutants showed a 1.5 and 2-fold increased cell weight and larger cells compared to the wild type, which led to a general increase of biomass including total lipid and TAG content on a per cell basis. Such mutants could subsequently be used as commercial oleaginous algae and serve as an alternative to conventional petrol. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) from algae are considered to be a potentially viable source of biodiesel and thereby renewable energy, but at the moment very little is known about the biosynthetic pathway in these organisms. Here we compare what is currently known in eukaryotic algal species, in particular the characteristics of algal diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the last enzyme of de novo TAG biosynthesis. Several studies in plants and mammals have shown that there are two DGAT isoforms, DGAT1 and DGAT2, which catalyse the same reaction but have no clear sequence similarities. Instead, they have differences in functionality and spatial and temporal expression patterns. Bioinformatic searches of sequenced algal genomes reveal that most algae have multiple copies of putative DGAT2s, whereas other eukaryotes have single genes. Investigating whether these putative isoforms are indeed functional and whether they confer significantly different phenotypes to algal cells will be vital for future efforts to genetically modify algae for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algal biofuel production offers great potential as a sustainable source of bioenergy without competing for arable land with food crops. However, many challenges must be overcome to enable this to be done commercially at the scale required to produce biofuels. Here we explain how an understanding of algal ecology could lead to more reliable raceway-based microalgal cultivation, drawing from established principles of community ecology to highlight practices that could be applied to protect algal cultures from unwanted contaminants. Using theoretical concepts, we show how an understanding of local community dynamics at the species level might be used to enhance productivity by encouraging certain community structures over others. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Microalgae have been extensively investigated and exploited because of their competitive nutritive bioproducts and biofuel production ability. Chlorella are green algae that can grow well heterotrophically and photoautotrophically. Previous studies proved that shifting from heterotrophy to photoautotrophy in light-induced environments causes photooxidative damage as well as distinct physiologic features that lead to dynamic changes in Chlorella intracellular components, which have great potential in algal health food and biofuel production. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the trophic transition remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization strategy was employed to screen and characterize genes that are differentially expressed in response to the light-induced shift from heterotrophy to photoautotrophy. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained from 770 and 803 randomly selected clones among the forward and reverse libraries, respectively. Sequence analysis identified 544 unique genes in the two libraries. The functional annotation of the assembled unigenes demonstrated that 164 (63.1%) from the forward library and 62 (21.8%) from the reverse showed significant similarities with the sequences in the NCBI non-redundant database. The time-course expression patterns of 38 selected differentially expressed genes further confirmed their responsiveness to a diverse trophic status. The majority of the genes enriched in the subtracted libraries were associated with energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and stress defense. Conclusions/Significance: The data presented here offer the first insights into the molecular foundation underlying the diverse microalgal trophic niche. In addition, the results can be used as a reference for unraveling candidate genes associated with the transition of Chlorella from heterotrophy to photoautotrophy, which holds great potential for further improving its lipid and nutrient production. © 2012 Fan et al.

AB  - Background: A modified laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was used to obtain methane by treating hydrous ethanol vinasse. Vinasses or stillage are waste materials with high organic loads, and a complex composition resulting from the process of alcohol distillation. They must initially be treated with anaerobic processes due to their high organic loads. Vinasses can be considered multipurpose waste for energy recovery and once treated they can be used in agriculture without the risk of polluting soil, underground water or crops. In this sense, treatment of vinasse combines the elimination of organic waste with the formation of methane. Biogas is considered as a promising renewable energy source. The aim of this study was to determine the optimum organic loading rate for operating a modified UASB reactor to treat vinasse generated in the production of hydrous ethanol from sugar cane molasses. Results: The study showed that chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 69% at an optimum organic loading rate (OLR) of 17.05 kg COD/m 3-day, achieving a methane yield of 0.263 m3/kg COD added and a biogas methane content of 84%. During this stage, effluent characterization presented lower values than the vinasse, except for potassium, sulfide and ammonia nitrogen. On the other hand, primers used to amplify the 16S-rDNA genes for the domains Archaea and Bacteria showed the presence of microorganisms which favor methane production at the optimum organic loading rate. Conclusions: The modified UASB reactor proposed in this study provided a successful treatment of the vinasse obtained from hydrous ethanol production. Methanogen groups (Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales) detected by PCR during operational optimum OLR of the modified UASB reactor, favored methane production. © 2012 España-Gamboa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Rising energy consumption in coming decades, combined with a changing energy mix, have the potential to increase the impact of energy sector water use on freshwater biodiversity. We forecast changes in future water use based on various energy scenarios and examine implications for freshwater ecosystems. Annual water withdrawn/manipulated would increase by 18-24%, going from 1,993,000-2,628,000 Mm3 in 2010 to 2,359,000-3,271,000 Mm3 in 2035 under the Reference Case of the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Water consumption would more rapidly increase by 26% due to increased biofuel production, going from 16,700-46,400 Mm3 consumption in 2010 to 21,000-58,400 Mm3 consumption in 2035. Regionally, water use in the Southwest and Southeast may increase, with anticipated decreases in water use in some areas of the Midwest and Northeast. Policies that promote energy efficiency or conservation in the electric sector would reduce water withdrawn/manipulated by 27-36 m3GJ-1 (0.1-0.5 m3GJ-1 consumption), while such policies in the liquid fuel sector would reduce withdrawal/manipulation by 0.4-0.7 m3GJ-1 (0.2-0.3 m3GJ-1 consumption). The greatest energy sector withdrawal/manipulation are for hydropower and thermoelectric cooling, although potential new EPA rules that would require recirculating cooling for thermoelectric plants would reduce withdrawal/manipulation by 441,000 Mm3 (20,300 Mm3 consumption). The greatest consumptive energy sector use is evaporation from hydroelectric reservoirs, followed by irrigation water for biofuel feedstocks and water used for electricity generation from coal. Historical water use by the energy sector is related to patterns of fish species endangerment, where water resource regions with a greater fraction of available surface water withdrawn by hydropower or consumed by the energy sector correlated with higher probabilities of imperilment. Since future increases in energy-sector surface water use will occur in areas of high fish endemism (e.g., Southeast), additional management and policy actions will be needed to minimize further species imperilment. © 2012 McDonald et al.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L., SG) is a perennial grass presently used for forage and being developed as a bioenergy crop for conversion of cell wall carbohydrates to biofuels. Up to 50% of the cell wall associated carbohydrates are xylan. SG was analyzed for xylan structural features at variable harvest maturities. Xylan from each of three maturities was isolated using classical alkaline extraction to yield fractions (Xyl A and B) with varying compositional ratios. The Xyl B fraction was observed to decrease with plant age. Xylan samples were subsequently prepared for structure analysis by digesting with pure endo-xylanase, which preserved side-groups, or a commercial carbohydrase preparation favored for biomass conversion work. Enzymatic digestion products were successfully permethylated and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (RP-HPLC-MSn). This method is advantageous compared to prior work on plant biomass because it avoids isolation of individual arabinoxylan oligomers. The use of RP-HPLC- MSn differentiated 14 structural oligosaccharides (d.p. 3-9) from the monocomponent enzyme digestion and nine oligosaccharide structures (d.p. 3-9) from hydrolysis with a cellulase enzyme cocktail. The distribution of arabinoxylan oligomers varied depending upon the enzyme(s) applied but did not vary with harvest maturity.© 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes regional study provides a synthesis of the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in East Asia, a region comprised of China, Japan, North and South Korea, and Mongolia. We estimate the current terrestrial carbon balance of East Asia and its driving mechanisms during 1990-2009 using three different approaches: inventories combined with satellite greenness measurements, terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle models and atmospheric inversion models. The magnitudes of East Asia's terrestrial carbon sink from these three approaches are comparable:-0. 293±0.033 PgC yr-1 from inventory-remote sensing model-data fusion approach,-0.413±0.141 PgC yr-1 (not considering biofuel emissions) or-0.224±0.141 PgC yr-1 (considering biofuel emissions) for carbon cycle models, and-0.270±0.507 PgC yr-1 for atmospheric inverse models. Here and in the following, the numbers behind ± signs are standard deviations. The ensemble of ecosystem modeling based analyses further suggests that at the regional scale, climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 together resulted in a carbon sink of-0.289±0.135 PgC yr-1, while land-use change and nitrogen deposition had a contribution of-0.013±0.029 PgC yr-1 and-0.107±0.025 PgC yr-1, respectively. Although the magnitude of climate change effects on the carbon balance varies among different models, all models agree that in response to climate change alone, southern China experienced an increase in carbon storage from 1990 to 2009, while northern East Asia including Mongolia and north China showed a decrease in carbon storage. Overall, our results suggest that about 13-27% of East Asia's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning have been offset by carbon accumulation in its terrestrial territory over the period from 1990 to 2009. The underlying mechanisms of carbon sink over East Asia still remain largely uncertain, given the diversity and intensity of land management processes, and the regional conjunction of many drivers such as nutrient deposition, climate, atmospheric pollution and CO2 changes, which cannot be considered as independent for their effects on carbon storage. © 2012 Author(s).

AB  - Short rotation woody crops such as Populus spp. and their hybrids (i.e., poplars) are a significant component of the total biofuels and bioenergy feedstock resource in the USA. Production of these dedicated energy crops may result in large-scale land conversion, which leads to questions about their economic, logistic, and ecologic feasibility. To address such concerns, we used available social (i.e., land ownership and cover) and biophysical (i.e., climate and soil characteristics) spatial data to map eligible lands suitable for establishing and growing poplar biomass for bioenergy crops across Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. We confirmed the validity of this mapping technique by sampling and assessing biotic variables within locations identified on the maps. Lastly, we estimated potential poplar productivity within identified areas using a process-based growth model (3-PG) to determine spatial distribution of productive lands across the study area. Overall, eligible lands suitable for poplar production systems totaled 373,630ha across both states, representing 30.8% of the study area and a total potential aboveground yield at the end of a 10-year rotation of 36.2-42.6dryTg. Poplar biomass ranged from 9.5±0.3 to 11.9±0.2dryMgha-1yr-1 across both states, with an overall mean of 10.0±0.1dryMgha-1yr-1. While this novel approach was validated for Minnesota and Wisconsin, our methodology was developed to be useful across a wide range of geographic conditions, irrespective of intra-regional variability in site and climate parameters. Thus, this information is vital for siting poplar energy production systems to increase productivity and associated ecosystem services, and is widely applicable to woody biomass production systems worldwide. © 2012 .

AB  - Recent progress in metabolic engineering has led to autotrophic production of ethanol in various cyanobacterial hosts. However, cyanobacteria are known to be sensitive to ethanol, which restricts further efforts to increase ethanol production levels in these renewable host systems. To understand the mechanisms of ethanol tolerance so that engineering more robust cyanobacterial hosts can be possible, in this study, the responses of model cyanobacterial Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to ethanol were determined using a quantitative proteomics approach with iTRAQ LC-MS/MS technologies. The resulting high-quality proteomic data set consisted of 24 887 unique peptides corresponding to 1509 identified proteins, a coverage of approximately 42% of the predicted proteins in the Synechocystis genome. Using a cutoff of 1.5-fold change and a p-value less than 0.05, 135 and 293 unique proteins with differential abundance levels were identified between control and ethanol-treated samples at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Functional analysis showed that the Synechocystis cells employed a combination of induced common stress response, modifications of cell membrane and envelope, and induction of multiple transporters and cell mobility-related proteins as protection mechanisms against ethanol toxicity. Interestingly, our proteomic analysis revealed that proteins related to multiple aspects of photosynthesis were up-regulated in the ethanol-treated Synechocystis cells, consistent with increased chlorophyll a concentration in the cells upon ethanol exposure. The study provided the first comprehensive view of the complicated molecular mechanisms against ethanol stress and also provided a list of potential gene targets for further engineering ethanol tolerance in Synechocystis PCC 6803. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Phytoremediation has been increasingly used as a more sustainable approach for the remediation of contaminated sites. The costs associated with this remediation method are usually lower than other well-known remediation technologies and some environmental impacts, like atmospheric emissions and waste generation, are inexistent. The biomass produced in phytoremediation could be economically valorized in the form of bioenergy (biogas, biofuels and combustion for energy production and heating), representing an important environmental co-benefit, added to others such as erosion control, improving soil quality and functionality, and providing wildlife habitat. Several case studies are reviewed and some challenges and opportunities identified. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The objective of this work was to simulate, by the RothC model, the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) caused by changes of land use - from the traditional maize-squash (TMC) association to systems with castor bean (Ricinus communis): multilayer (MUL), alleys (CALL) and monoculture (HIG). SOC simulations were performed for 0-20 and 0-40 cm soil depths, for the period 1980-2040, considering the TMC system as the base line. SOC change rates estimated with RothC, for both soil depths, were 0.5-1.2, 0.4-0.8, 0.3-0.5 and 0.04-0.1 Mg ha-1 C per year in the HIG, MUL, CALL and TMC systems, respectively, and were consistent with those reported in the literature. RothC perfomance had 89% efficiency (EF) and R2 = 0.9, which shows that this model can be used with scarce SOC temporal information, information on the history of land use, and with input measurements of aerial and underground plant residues in the soil.

AB  - Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars for biofuels requires expensive pretreatment processes involving the breakdown of the cell wall structure and/ or removal of lignin to increase accessibility of enzymes to the crop structural carbohydrates. Lignin is synthesized from precursors through a complex biosynthesis pathway. One of the important enzymes in this pathway is cinnamoylcoenzyme A reductase (CCR), which catalyzes the transformation of feruloyl and p-coumaryl thioesters to their respective aldehydes. In an attempt to reduce lignin content and potentially accelerate deconstruction of maize (Zea mays L.) stover structural carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, expression of maize CCR (ZmCCR1; EC 1.2.1.44) was downregulated via ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi). Thirty first generation independent ZmCCR1_RNAi transgenic lines were produced. Among 10 out of 30 randomly tested, six lines showed significantly reduced ZmCCR1 transcription. The second generation of these ZmCCR1 downregulated transgenic plants exhibited brown coloration of midribs, husk, and stems and 7.0 to 8.7% reduction in Klason lignin. Also, crystalline cellulose was slightly increased in the lignin downregulated maize stover and further increased conversion of the ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX)-pretreated maize stover into fermentable sugars. The third generation of CCR downregulated plants showed further reduced CCR transcription as compared to their second generation of transgenic (T1) plants. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - The development of bioenergy may provide a solution to achieve the reduction targets for scenic spot emissions. This paper provides a synthesis of questionnaire survey and experimental data to assess the potential of garden waste biomass for renewable energy production in West Lake of Hangzhou. Our results showed that the waste dry biomass from greenspace reaches 4.60 ± 3.12 t · hm-2 · a-1. The garden waste dry biomass from greenspace in the road area was 5.96 t · hm-2 · a-1 which was higher than the other area. The main species of the garden wastes were Cinnamomum camphora, Osmanthus fragrans and Rhododendron simsii. The total amount of dry biomass from scenic wastes was estimated at 3402 t · a-1. The total potential biofuel produced as scenic waste biomass was estimated at 6.3×1010 kJ · a-1, which accounts for 40% of the energy consumption for the West Lake. The wood pellets production bioenergy system was the best way for the garden waste biofinery. The emission reduction of using garden waste for energy production to alternative fossil fuels would be 4177 t C02 per year. The use of garden wastes in scenic area for energy production could be a win-win approach for the reduction of environment stress and the increase in the energy supply.

AB  - Water consumption has become a serious concern in renewable fuels production. This paper proposes a framework to address sustainable transport systems design where both environmental (i.e. carbon and water footprints) and economic performances are taken into account along the bioethanol supply chain. A multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming modeling framework supporting strategic design and planning decisions for multi-period and multi-echelon upstream ethanol supply chains is developed. Hybrid biofuel production networks, where both corn grain and stover are used as suitable feedstocks, are optimized according to several features, involving technology selection and by-products end-use option. A case study is presented referring to the emerging Italian biofuels market. Results show the effectiveness of mathematical-programming-based tools to optimal design of biofuels supply chains, assessing the pros and cons of alternative configurations and, thus, allowing investors to drive planning decisions. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A first-generation energy sorghum hybrid with enhanced photoperiod sensitivity and long growth duration accumulated more than twice as much biomass as grain sorghum. The energy sorghum produced more leaves (~45 vs 17-20), longer stems (~4 vs 1.5 meters) and had a higher stem-to-leaf biomass ratio than grain sorghum. At the end of the season, energy sorghum stems represented 83% of the plant's shoot biomass. The greater biomass accumulation was due to longer growth duration, a higher leaf area index, greater radiation interception, and higher radiation use efficiency. When grown under dryland or limited irrigation conditions, the rate of biomass accumulation by the energy sorghum hybrid was reduced in mid-season. This decrease was most apparent in August due to summer water deficit; however plants recovered when rain occurred in September. Crop growth modeling and biomass accumulation rates measured under optimal field conditions show that energy sorghum, like other C4 energy grasses, has excellent biomass yield potential. The greenhouse gas offset values of energy sorghum hybrids, grown in large and small field plots, and under fully irrigated and dryland conditions, ranged from 63-78% for cellulosic ethanol production and 88-95% for power generation. This study shows that drought-tolerant, annual energy sorghum hybrids have the genetic yield potential to contribute significantly to bioenergy production. Sorghum is a genetically tractable, diverse species with a good genomics platform, making energy sorghum a promising genetic model for the design of C4 grass energy crops. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This article seeks to address aviation as an emerging biofuel consumer and to discuss sustainability issues and consequences for feedstock production concepts. Biojet fuels have been identified as a promising, readily deployable alternative to fossil-based aviation fuels. At the same time they are highly criticised as their production may have negative social and environmental impacts. Therefore, the paper aims to identify major sustainability issues and assessment challenges and relate these to the production of biojet fuel feedstock. Design/methodology/approach: Two plant oil production concepts are presented that address the sustainability issues discussed. Both concepts are being investigated within the research project "Platform for Sustainable Aviation Fuels". A literature-based overview of sustainability issues and assessment challenges is provided. Additionally, conceptual insights into new plant oil production concepts are presented. Findings: The use of biojet fuels is often hailed as a strategy for the aviation industry to become more sustainable. However, biofuels are not necessarily sustainable and their potential to reduce GHG emissions is highly debated. Several unresolved sustainability issues are identified highlighting the need for improved assessment methods. Moreover, the two concepts presented have the potential to provide sustainably grown feedstock, but further empirical research is needed. Originality/value: This article addresses researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of sustainability issues and assessment challenges related to biojet fuels. Consequences are identified for two plant oil feedstock concepts: catch cropping in temperate regions and silvopastoral systems in tropical and subtropical regions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is a specific example of life cycle assessment (LCA) applied to legislative measures that have far-reaching implications for economic operators. This paper aims to analyze LCA limitations for biofuels based on RED from an environmental accounting perspective. Design/methodology/approach: LCA limitations are identified on the basis of a literature review and illustrated in the specific context of RED. The limitations encountered within the study were classified into two categories: lack of data, and lack of standards. From this perspective, the LCA-based problems and their implication and possible improvements in the RED context are discussed. Findings: The study identifies that the absence of an environmental accounting that could provide periodic enterprise-specific information is a significant cause of limitations of LCA as a decision-supporting tool within RED. In turn, environmental accounting approaches address a number of initiatives that are not systematically linked with LCA research. The paper recommends that RED should provide rules to address enterprise-specific data in addition to other methodological approaches to overcome problems already discussed in the extant literature. This would enable RED to provide economic incentives more effectively and promote the application of environmental accounting systems in companies with higher quality data for LCA applications. Originality/value: This paper explains how LCA applications could be improved by the introduction of environmental accounting systems and how RED could be more effective by considering environmental accounting. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The global biofuels sector has expanded rapidly in the past decade, with feedstock expansion penetrating many tropical areas. While the emerging demand for biofuels represents an opportunity for developing countries, it also poses a host of social and environmental risks. Large investments are needed to finance expansion of biofuel and feedstock production, suggesting that the financial sector may have a crucial role to play in mitigating these risks. This paper seeks to explore the role of financiers in expanding biofuel feedstock production and refining in tropical forest-rich countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America to better understand the role and future potential of responsible finance in the biofuel sector. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis draws on published data and reports from academia, industry, governments, civil society and the press, to quantify the magnitude and source of investments made from 2000-2010 in 16 countries sampled from "ecoregions" subject to high rates of forest conversion, weak land tenure institutions, and vulnerable communities. Findings: It is found that the case study countries received USD 5.3-7.3 billion for feedstock production and USD 5.7-6.7 billion for biofuel refining between 2000 and 2009. This was financed by a mix of entrepreneurs, private banks, investors, governments and multilateral banks. While no clear patterns emerge, foreign banks and institutional investors rank as "important" for most feedstocks and regions. Multilateral banks and domestic institutional investors seem to be the least important. Few financiers have criteria in place in order to ensure sustainable investing practices, and those who do tend to have policies of limited quality. Originality/value: While much has been written on biofuel sustainability and governance, there is little research that delineates the nature of investment and finance in the sector. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Unicellular marine algae have promise for providing sustainable and scalable biofuel feedstocks, although no single species has emerged as a preferred organism. Moreover, adequate molecular and genetic resources prerequisite for the rational engineering of marine algal feedstocks are lacking for most candidate species. Heterokonts of the genus Nannochloropsis naturally have high cellular oil content and are already in use for industrial production of high-value lipid products. First success in applying reverse genetics by targeted gene replacement makes Nannochloropsis oceanica an attractive model to investigate the cell and molecular biology and biochemistry of this fascinating organism group. Here we present the assembly of the 28.7 Mb genome of N. oceanica CCMP1779. RNA sequencing data from nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted growth conditions support a total of 11,973 genes, of which in addition to automatic annotation some were manually inspected to predict the biochemical repertoire for this organism. Among others, more than 100 genes putatively related to lipid metabolism, 114 predicted transcription factors, and 109 transcriptional regulators were annotated. Comparison of the N. oceanica CCMP1779 gene repertoire with the recently published N. gaditana genome identified 2,649 genes likely specific to N. oceanica CCMP1779. Many of these N. oceanica-specific genes have putative orthologs in other species or are supported by transcriptional evidence. However, because similarity-based annotations are limited, functions of most of these species-specific genes remain unknown. Aside from the genome sequence and its analysis, protocols for the transformation of N. oceanica CCMP1779 are provided. The availability of genomic and transcriptomic data for Nannochloropsis oceanica CCMP1779, along with efficient transformation protocols, provides a blueprint for future detailed gene functional analysis and genetic engineering of Nannochloropsis species by a growing academic community focused on this genus. © 2012 Vieler et al.

AB  - Background: This study evaluates the global economic effects of the current US RFS2, and the potential contribution from advanced biofuels. Results & discussion: Our simulation results suggest that these mandates lead to an increase of 0.21% in the global gross domestic product in 2022, including an increase of 0.8% in the USA and 0.02% in the rest of the world, relative to our baseline no-RFS scenario. The incremental contributions to gross domestic product from advanced biofuels in 2022 are estimated at 0.41 and 0.04% in the USA and the rest of the world, respectively. Conclusion: Although production costs of advanced biofuels are higher than for conventional biofuels in our model, their economic benefits result from reductions in oil use and their smaller impacts on food markets compared with conventional biofuels. Thus, the US advanced biofuels targets are expected to have positive net economic benefits. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the links between some cases of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) and the passing of the Biofuels Act by the Argentinean parliament. The analysis is guided by a theoretical-methodological approach based on tools drawn from the social studies of technology field. The employment of eatable crops in the biofuel industry sparked a global debate concerning the drawbacks. Critics argue that it deepens the capital-intensive monoculture agricultural production, driving away small farmers and peasants from their lands. Far from these debates, in southern Buenos Aires Province, there were alternative biodiesel production experiences whose main objective was providing solutions to social and environmental problems. After the Biofuels Act was passed, the new scenario posed unprecedented challenges. The socio-technical approach allowed operating a systemic interpretation of these processes, bringing new insights to explain the construction of sustainability-or impracticality-of technological policies aimed to promote social inclusion. © 2012 by The Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - The scale of the ambition to decouple emissions growth from energy consumption runs counter to decades of debates and literatures on the limits of government. Transport biofuels are an early and influential case of the policy capacity challenge in the transition to low-carbon economies. The case stands analytically for the policy-maker's dilemma of maintaining long-term policy goals as credible commitments, despite the flexibility and adaptability in policy-making required to achieve them under high political, technological and market uncertainty. This paper compares US and EU biofuels policy processes in these terms. It reveals an intertemporal choice embedded in biofuels policies which tests the capacity to account for future benefits from a low carbon future in current policy processes; if the pathway to their achievement is uncertain and politically contested in the implementation phase, then future benefits may be heavily discounted, shortening policy-maker horizons and rendering the transition process politically vulnerable. © 2012 Policy and Society Associates (APSS).

AB  - Cool-season oilseed crops are potential feedstock for biofuel production, but few studies have compared oilseed-durum (Triticum durum Desf.) rotations on yield, quality, water use, and pests associated with crops. We conducted an experiment under dryland conditions during 2007 to 2010 near Culbertson, MT, comparing crop productivity, water balance, and key weed and arthropod pests of 2-yr oilseed-durum rotations under zero tillage. Rotations included durum with three Brassicaceae sp., camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz], crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst. ex R.E. Fries), and canola-quality Brassica juncea L., and fallow. Over 4 yr, B. juncea had the highest seed and oil yields of crucifer entries. Water use was similar among oilseed crops, averaging 286 mm. Water use was similar for durum following oilseeds, averaging 282 mm, 72 mm less than for durum following fallow. Durum following fallow averaged 775 kg ha-1 greater grain yield than durum following oilseeds due to higher water availability and use. Camelina had greater weed biomass at harvest and lower densities of Plutella xylostella L. than other oilseeds. Durum in rotation with crambe had higher weed density and biomass at harvest than durum following B. juncea or fallow. Brassica juncea generally performed better than crambe or camelina, but each oilseed crop had several positive attributes. Oilseed-durum rotations can be used for biofuel feedstock and grain production, but long-term sustainability of 2-yr rotations on crop yields and pest management requires further study.

AB  - The importance of syntrophic acetate oxidation for process stability in methanogenic systems operating at high ammonia concentrations has previously been emphasized. In this study we investigated bioaugmentation of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing (SAO) cultures as a possible method for decreasing the adaptation period of biogas reactors operating at gradually increased ammonia concentrations (1.5 to 11 g NH4+-N/liter). Whole stillage and cattle manure were codigested semicontinuously for about 460 days in four mesophilic anaerobic laboratory-scale reactors, and a fixed volume of SAO culture was added daily to two of the reactors. Reactor performance was evaluated in terms of biogas productivity, methane content, pH, alkalinity, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) content. The decomposition pathway of acetate was analyzed by isotopic tracer experiments, and population dynamics were monitored by quantitative PCR analyses. A shift in dominance from aceticlastic methanogenesis to SAO occurred simultaneously in all reactors, indicating no influence by bioaugmentation on the prevailing pathway. Higher abundances of Clostridium ultunense and Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans were associated with bioaugmentation, but no influence on Syntrophaceticus schinkii or the methanogenic population was distinguished. Overloading or accumulation of VFA did not cause notable dynamic effects on the population. Instead, the ammonia concentration had a substantial impact on the abundance level of the microorganisms surveyed. The addition of SAO culture did not affect process performance or stability against ammonia inhibition, and all four reactors deteriorated at high ammonia concentrations. Consequently, these findings further demonstrate the strong influence of ammonia on the methane-producing consortia and on the representative methanization pathway in mesophilic biogas reactors. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Indirect land use change (iLUC) is hypothesized to occur when increasing demand for land due to bioenergy production displaces food and feed production onto new lands, thereby potentially producing large greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) during the land conversion event. Thus far, the totality of the projected iLUC effect has been assigned to biofuel production. In fact, multiple drivers of land use change exist and the resulting GHG releases should, in fairness, be allocated among these drivers. It seems more useful and intellectually rigorous to allocate potential land use change effects among these many drivers. This paper focuses on how to allocate the environmental consequences of iLUC to the multiple drivers through a function-oriented approach, namely human nutritional requirements for calories and protein. "Food versus Biofuel" issues can then be more usefully addressed as "Nutrition versus Biofuel" issues. Human beings actually have many choices in how we provide ourselves with adequate diets, and these choices have very different GHG and land use consequences. Therefore, in this paper, GHG assigned to iLUC is allocated between ethanol and human dietary preferences via a human nutrition-based method. Applying allocation approaches to iLUC lowers the estimated GHG of iLUC by up to 73% compared to GHG estimates in the GTAP model. For example, global warming intensity (GWI) of ethanol measured as CO 2 equivalent becomes 58.2 g MJ -1, while GWI of ethanol calculated using GREET is 68.9 g MJ -1. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial solar biofuels offer great promise for future sustainable food, fuels and chemicals but are limited by low productivities and a requirement for large land areas to harvest sunlight. A 71 % increase in combined photosynthetic activity was achieved by illuminating both Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis from a single beam of simulated sunlight, divided using a dichroic mirror. Therefore, this technique is termed 'dichroic beam-sharing', in which the complementary action spectra of two different useful micro-organisms, belonging to green and purple groups, is exploited and allows a single beam of sunlight to be shared efficiently between separate photobioreactors. Because the action spectra of these two organisms are typical of large groups, this novel method could increase the productivity of photosynthetic micro-organisms in the production of diverse commodities. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - The study assesses the impacts of the biofuels production to the socio-economic development in Thailand. The four kinds of biofuels considered in the analyses are ethanol from cassava, molasses and sugarcane ethanol as well as palm biodiesel. The key elements of socio-economic development including employment generation, economic effects on GDP and trade balance are investigated based on a combination of process and input-output analysis. The results show that producing ethanol and biodiesel require about 17-20 and 10 times more workers than gasoline and diesel as per energy content, respectively. Direct employment in agriculture contributes to more than 90% of total employment. Nevertheless, there are the significant differences in the characteristics of employment in the agriculture and biofuel processing sectors. The overall impacts of ethanol production in Thailand in year 2022 are the employment generation of around 238,700-382,400 person-years, 150 M$ additional GDP, imported goods worth 1583 M$ but 2547 M$ of imports would be saved if compared to petroleum fuels. The other socio-economic aspects such as agricultural improvement and rural development due to biofuels policy in Thailand and some policy measures that need to be urgently promoted are also discussed in the study. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is growing interest in using switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a biofuel crop and for its potential to sequester carbon. However, there are limited data on the establishment success of this species when grown as a forest intercrop in coastal plain settings of the U.S. Southeast. Therefore, we studied establishment success of switchgrass within experimental intercropped plots and in pure switchgrass plots in an intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation in eastern North Carolina. Pine trees were planted in the winter of 2008, and switchgrass was planted in the summer of 2009. Establishment success of switchgrass was measured over the growing season from May to October 2010, and quantified in terms of percent cover, height (cm), tiller density (number of tillers m -2), leaf area index and biomass (Mg ha -1). At the end of the growing season, pure switchgrass plots were taller than the intercropped treatments (114 ± 2 cm versus 98 ± 1 cm, respectively), but no significant treatment effects were evident in the other variables measured. Switchgrass biomass across all treatments increased from 2.65 ± 0.81 Mg ha -1 in 2009 to 4.14 ± 0.45 Mg ha -1 in 2010. There was no significant effect of distance from the pine row on any switchgrass growth parameters. However, we anticipate a shading effect over time that may limit switchgrass growth as the pines approach stand closure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates the use, if produced, of 6.06 × 10 10 L of advanced biofuels by 2022. The objective of this study is to determine the ethanol price necessary for a biorefinery to breakeven when using switchgrass as the single feedstock to produce ethanol. A holistic model that encompasses acquisition of land use services, feedstock production, harvest, harvest machine investment, feedstock logistics (storage, transportation), biorefinery location and size, and biorefinery investment is constructed and used to determine breakeven ethanol price. The model was solved for each of three biomass to ethanol conversion rates (250, 334, and 417 L of ethanol Mg -1 of biomass) and each of three biorefinery investment cost estimates ($2, $4, and $6 × 10 8 for a biorefinery with annual capacity of 379 × 10 6 L). Breakeven ethanol prices ranged from $0.44 L -1 with a conversion rate of 417 L of ethanol Mg -1 and an investment cost of $2 × 10 8, to $0.72 L -1 with a conversion rate of 250 L Mg -1 and an investment cost of $6 × 10 8. Improving the efficiency of conversion from 250 to 334 L Mg -1 decreases the estimated breakeven cost by $0. 07 L -1. Improved conversion efficiency results in a reduction of the total quantity of feedstock required and in the cost to deliver feedstock. Most of the cost reduction follows from reductions in land required (rent), and biomass harvest, storage, and transportation costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing use of liquid biofuels has been justified by highly volatile and rising oil prices, geopolitical instability of countries that control most of proven oil reserves, growing demand for passenger transportation and environmental concerns, especially climate change. Investments in the sector are increasing steadily, with oil majors being responsible for rising investments into liquid biofuel joint ventures, research and development projects and logistics. This paper analyses the underlying motivations of these investments by evaluating corporate diversification and integration strategies. Findings indicate that vertical integration and diversification are an integral part of oil major's strategic behavior toward biofuels, although strategies differ substantially among companies. In the short term current major oil companies' investments in liquid biofuels are driven by the requirement to comply with binding mandates for biofuels, whereas in the long-term liquid biofuels, if produced on a significant scale, could be classified as non-conventional liquid hydrocarbon reserves for oil majors where access to other (non-)conventional resources is not secured. Finally, given existing technology lock-ins it seems unlikely whether different paths for producing liquid biofuels will be able to co-exist in the long term, or there will be only one dominant path possibly controlled by large oil companies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The shortage of petroleum reserves and the increase in CO2 emissions have raised global concerns and highlighted the importance of adopting sustainable energy sources. Second-generation ethanol made from lignocellulosic materials is considered to be one of the most promising fuels for vehicles. The giant snail Achatina fulica is an agricultural pest whose biotechnological potential has been largely untested. Here, the composition of the microbial population within the crop of this invasive land snail, as well as key genes involved in various biochemical pathways, have been explored for the first time. In a high-throughput approach, 318 Mbp of 454-Titanium shotgun metagenomic sequencing data were obtained. The predominant bacterial phylum found was Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Viruses, Fungi, and Archaea were present to lesser extents. The functional analysis reveals a variety of microbial genes that could assist the host in the degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulose, detoxification of xenobiotics, and synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins, contributing to the adaptability and wide-ranging diet of this snail. More than 2,700 genes encoding glycoside hydrolase (GH) domains and carbohydrate-binding modules were detected. When we compared GH profiles, we found an abundance of sequences coding for oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes (36%), very similar to those from wallabies and giant pandas, as well as many novel cellulase and hemicellulase coding sequences, which points to this model as a remarkable potential source of enzymes for the biofuel industry. Furthermore, this work is a major step toward the understanding of the unique genetic profile of the land snail holobiont. © 2012 Cardoso et al.

AB  - Introduction In the last years, the use of biomass for energy purposes has been seen as a promising option to reduce the use of nonrenewable energy sources and the emissions of fossil carbon. However, LCA studies have shown that the energetic use of biomass also causes impacts on climate change and, furthermore, that different environmental issues arise, such as land use and agricultural emissions. While biomass is renewable, it is not an unlimited resource. Its use, to whatever purpose, must therefore be well studied to promote the most efficient option with the least environmental impacts. The 47th LCA Discussion Forum gathered several national and international speakers who provided a broad and qualified view on the topic. Summary of the topics presented in DF 47 Several aspects of energetic biomass use from a range of projects financed by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) were presented in this Discussion Forum. The first session focused on important aspects of the agricultural biogas production like the use of high energy crops or catch crops as well as the influence of plant size on the environmental performance of biogas. In the second session, other possibilities of biomass treatment like direct combustion, composting, and incineration with municipal waste were presented. Topic of the first afternoon session was the update and harmonization of biomass inventories and the resulting new assessment of biofuels. The short presentations investigated some further aspects of the LCA of bioenergy like the assessment of spatial variation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from bioenergy production in a country, the importance of indirect land use change emissions on the overall results, the assessment of alternative technologies to direct spreading of digestate or the updates of the car operation datasets in ecoinvent. Conclusions One main outcome of this Discussion Forum is that bioenergy is not environmentally friendly per se. In many cases, energetic use of biomass allows a reduction of GHG and fossil energy use. However, there is often a tradeoff with other environmental impacts linked to agricultural production like eutrophication or ecotoxicity. Methodological challenges still exist, like the assessment of direct and indirect land use change emissions and their attribution to the bioenergy production, or the influence of heavy metal flows on the bioenergy assessment. Another challenge is the implementation of a life cycle approach in certification or legislation schemes, as shown by the example of the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - Human health concerns and the dissemination of anthropogenic substances with unknown consequences are the reasons most often given why disposal of municipal sewage sludge in landfills or using the organic waste as biofuel is preferable to land application. But no "fertilizer" causes more nitrogen pollution than sludge when applied according to Virginia law. Poultry litter is the only other "fertilizer" that causes more phosphorus pollution than sludge. Cost savings by the few farmers in Virginia who use sludge are far less than the costs of the nitrogen pollution they cause. A ban on the land application of all forms of animal waste is very cost-effective and would reduce Chesapeake Bay nutrient pollution by 25%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Millettia pinnata (Synonym Pongamia pinnata) is a viable source of oil for the mushrooming biofuel industry, source for agroforestry, urban landscaping, and the bio-amelioration of degraded lands. It also helps in maintaining soil fertility through symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, not much work is reported on classification and characterization of the rhizobia associated with this plant. In the present study, an attempt was made to isolate rhizobial strains nodulating Millettia from soils collected from southern regions of India. The isolates were characterized using numerical taxonomy, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and cross nodulation ability. The results showed high phenotypic and genetic diversity among the rhizobia symbiotic with Millattia pinnata. The isolates formed five clusters at similarity level of 0.82 based on the results of numerical taxonomy. Results on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that most microsymbionts of M. pinnata belonged to Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, which are closely related to Rhizobium sp., B. elkanii and B. yuanmingense. Among these isolates, some isolates could grow in a pH range of 4.0-10.0, some could tolerate a high salt concentration (3% NaCl) and could grow at a maximum temperature between 35 and 45 °C. M. pinnata formed nodules with diverse rhizobia in Indian soils. These results offered the first systematic information about the microsymbionts of M. pinnata grown in the soils from southern part of India. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Aims: This work reports on one of the first attempts to use biofilm-forming cyanobacteria for biomass and lipid production. Methods and Results: Three isolates of filamentous cyanobacteria were obtained from biofilms at different Italian sites and characterized by a polyphasic approach, involving microscopic observations, ecology and genetic diversity (studying the 16S rRNA gene). The isolates were grown in batch systems and in a semi-continuous flow incubator, specifically designed for biofilms development. Culture system affected biomass and lipid production, but did not influence the fatty acid profile. The composition of fatty acids was mainly palmitic acid (>50%) and less amounts of other saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Only two isolates contained two polyunsaturated fatty acids. Conclusions: Data obtained from the flow-lane incubator system would support a more economical and sustainable use of the benthic micro-organisms for biomass production. The produced lipids contained fatty acids suitable for a high-quality biodiesel production, showing high proportions of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Significance and Impact of the Study: Data seem promising when taking into account the savings in cost and time derived from easy procedures for biomass harvesting, especially when being able to obtain the co-production of other valuable by-products. © 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - This paper examines landfill gas (LFG) emissions at a large inactive waste disposal site to evaluate the viability of investment in LFG recovery through the clean development mechanism (CDM) initiative. For this purpose, field measurements of LFG emissions were conducted and the data were processed by geospatial interpolation to estimate an equivalent site emission rate which was used to calibrate and apply two LFG prediction models to forecast LFG emissions at the site. The mean CH4 flux values calculated through tessellation, inverse distance weighing and kriging were 0.188±0.014, 0.224±0.012 and 0.237±0.008lCH4/m2hr, respectively, compared to an arithmetic mean of 0.24l/m2hr. The flux values are within the reported range for closed landfills (0.06-0.89l/m2hr), and lower than the reported range for active landfills (0.42-2.46l/m2hr). Simulation results matched field measurements for low methane generation potential (L0) values in the range of 19.8-102.6m3/ton of waste. LFG generation dropped rapidly to half its peak level only 4yrs after landfill closure limiting the sustainability of LFG recovery systems in similar contexts and raising into doubt promoted CDM initiatives for similar waste. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgal lipids are promising alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production. Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1, an oil-rich freshwater microalga isolated from Antarctica, was identified to be a suitable candidate to produce biodiesel in this study. This strain could grow at temperatures ranging from 4 to 35 °C. With regular decrease in nitrate concentration in the medium, large quantities of triacylglycerols accumulated under batch culture conditions detected by thin layer chromatography and BODIPY 505/515 fluorescent staining. Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 achieved the average biomass productivity of 0.105 g l-1 d-1 (dry weight) and nearly the highest lipid content (35 % of dry cell weight) was reached at day 28 in the batch culture. Neutral lipids accounted for 78 % of total lipids, and C18:1 (n-9), C16:0 were the major fatty acids in total lipids, composing 37 and 20 % of total fatty acids of Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 grown for 36 days, respectively. These results suggested that Scenedesmus sp. NJ-1 was a good source of microalgal oils for biodiesel production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Cultivation of the biofuel plant, hybrid giant Napier grass (HGN), in saline soil was investigated in a greenhouse study. The results show that HGN is a salt tolerant plant which can flourish in saline soil and product a large amount of biomass. The extensively developed fibrous root system of HGN plays a significant role in the uptake of sodium from saline soil so that both soil salinity and pH are reduced. Fibrous roots of HGN are well distributed in the soil below the surface, where the metabolism of the root system produces a gradient at the depth between 10 and 20 cm in soil salinity, pH and organic content. The degradation of the HGN by the biota within the soil results in an increase in nutrients and improved soil quality. The experimental results suggest that HGN adapts to saline soil, which is promising for phytoremediation of such soils. Additional advantages of HGN include the large biomass produced which can be used for renewable energy generation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Recent policies, such as the Green Energy Act in the Canadian province of Ontario, have placed increasing emphasis on the development of renewable energy sources. One source that has received considerable attention in Europe, but very little in Canada, is the energy crop miscanthus. This study examines the economic feasibility of miscanthus from a Canadian perspective. A net present value approach is used to determine the breakeven price of miscanthus production in Ontario. Based on assumptions specific to Ontario regarding miscanthus production, input costs, and opportunity costs associated with alternative land use, the breakeven price is estimated to be $88.02/t. To account for uncertainty inherent in the imposed assumptions, sensitivity analysis is conducted on various life cycle factors, yield, and cost components. The results of this analysis indicate a range of breakeven prices from $77.79 to $105.08/t. These results are then applied to Ontario's greenhouse industry, where the cost of energy derived from miscanthus is found to be competitive with the costs of current non-renewable energy sources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 is one of three microbial catalysts capable of fermenting synthesis gas (mainly CO, CO2, and H2) to produce the liquid biofuels ethanol and butanol. Gasification of feedstocks to produce synthesis gas (syngas), followed by microbial conversion to solvents, greatly expands the diversity of suitable feedstocks that can be used for biofuel production beyond commonly used food and energy crops to include agricultural, industrial, and municipal waste streams. C. carboxidivorans P7 uses a variation of the classic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, identified through genome sequence-enabled approaches but only limited direct metabolic analyses. As a result, little is known about gene expression and enzyme activities during solvent production. In this study, we measured cell growth, gene expression, enzyme activity, and product formation in autotrophic batch cultures continuously fed a synthetic syngas mixture. These cultures exhibited an initial phase of growth, followed by acidogenesis that resulted in a reduction in pH. After cessation of growth, solventogenesis occurred, pH increased and maximum concentrations of acetate (41mM), butyrate (1.4mM), ethanol (61mM), and butanol (7.1mM) were achieved. Enzyme activities were highest during the growth phase, but expression of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), Fe-only hydrogenases and two tandem bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases were highest during specific stages of solventogenesis. Several amino acid substitutions between the tandem acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenases and the differential expression of their genes suggest that they may have different roles during solvent formation. The data presented here provide a link between the expression of key enzymes, their measured activities and solvent production by C. carboxidivorans P7. This research also identifies potential targets for metabolic engineering efforts designed to produce higher amounts of ethanol or butanol from syngas. Biotechnol. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model along with a direct acyclic graph is employed to decompose how supply/demand structural shocks affect food and fuel markets. The results support the hypothesis that fundamental market forces of demand and supply are the main drivers of food price volatility. Increased biofuel production may cause short-run food price increases but not long-run price shifts. Decentralized freely operating markets will mitigate the persistence of any price shocks and restore prices to their long-run trends. The main policy implications are that oil, gasoline, and ethanol market shocks do not spillover into grain prices, which indicates no long-run food before fuel issue. In the short-run, grain prices can spike due to market shocks, so programs designed to blunt these price spikes may be warranted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels could offer new economic opportunities for low-income countries. We use a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model of Tanzania to evaluate different biofuels production options and estimate their impacts on growth and poverty. Our results indicate that maximizing the poverty-reducing effects of biofuels production in countries like Tanzania will require engaging and improving the productivity of smallholder farmers. Evidence shows that cassava-based ethanol production is more profitable than other feedstock options. Cassava also generates more "pro-poor" growth than sugarcane-based systems. However, if smallholder yields can be improved rather than expanding cultivated land, then both sugarcane and cassava out-grower schemes generate similar pro-poor outcomes. We conclude that, in so far as the public investments needed to establish a biofuels industry are consistent with other development needs, then producing biofuels will enhance economic development in countries like Tanzania. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae have great potential as a feedstock for biofuel production. Continuous operation is an important benefit of the continuous electrolytic microalgae (CEM) harvest system, but it is necessary to optimize cultivability and recovery efficiency in order to improve overall performance. Two pairs of best-candidate electrodes for polarity exchange (PE) were examined to improve these two key factors: (i) aluminum and dimensionally stable anode (Al-DSA), and (ii) Al-platinum (Al-Pt). Al-DSA was better than Al-Pt because it led to less cell damage and was less expensive. Moreover, cell viability and recovery were improved by optimizing the timing of PE. A P1:P2 ratio of 1:1.5 at 5 min and 1:1.2 at 10 min yielded the best results, with greatly reduced electricity consumption and enhanced cell viability and recovery. The CEM harvest system appears to be a well-suited option for the harvest of microalgae for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle making the study of water use by trees and forest stands of prime importance in the global change context. Very negative effects of increasing and more intense droughts on forest vegetation have been described over the last decades. Symptoms of disease and decline have been associated with changed precipitation patterns in many forests particularly in European temperate and Mediterranean regions. Intra- and inter-specific differences in both physiology and morphology exert a large but not well understood influence on the water balance of forest ecosystems, further affecting their vulnerability to drought. Stand structure and composition influences rainfall interception, runoff and water fluxes of the whole ecosystem. Both expanding plantations of renovated interest for biofuel industry and natural and semi-natural forests must be managed in a sustainable way on the basis of their water consumption. We review the role of key drivers on forest water use such as species composition, tree canopy status of each of them and species specific sensitivity to soil water scarcity. Specifically we discuss the role of these factors for natural forest, but with references also to forest plantations. Water scarcity is expected to be one of the largest societal problems worldwide in the near future, so water use by natural and planted forest ecosystems has become a central subject in current research agendas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As biofuel usage has boomed over the past decade, so has research and regulatory interest in its carbon accounting. This paper examines one aspect of that carbon accounting: the baseline, i.e. the reference case against which other conditions or changes can be compared. A literature search and analysis identified four baseline types: no baseline; reference point; marginal fossil fuel; and biomass opportunity cost. The fourth one, biomass opportunity cost, is defined in more detail, because this is not done elsewhere in the literature. The four baselines are then applied to the carbon footprint of a wood-fired power plant. The footprint of the resulting wood-fired electricity varies dramatically, according to the type of baseline. Baseline type is also found to be the footprint's most significant sensitivity. Other significant sensitivities are: efficiency of the power plant; the growth (or re-growth) rate of the forest that supplies the wood; and the residue fraction of the wood. Length of the policy horizon is also an important factor in determining the footprint. The paper concludes that because of their significance and variability, baseline choices should be made very explicit in biofuel carbon footprints. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an invaluable tool for the structured environmental impact assessment of bioenergy product systems. However, the methodology's static temporal and spatial scope combined with its restriction to emission-based metrics in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) inhibits its effectiveness at assessing climate change impacts that stem from dynamic land surface-atmosphere interactions inherent to all biomass-based product systems. In this paper, we focus on two dynamic issues related to anthropogenic land use that can significantly influence the climate impacts of bioenergy systems: i) temporary changes to the terrestrial carbon cycle; and ii) temporary changes in land surface albedo-and illustrate how they can be integrated within the LCA framework. In the context of active land use management for bioenergy, we discuss these dynamics and their relevancy and outline the methodological steps that would be required to derive case-specific biogenic CO 2 and albedo change characterization factors for inclusion in LCIA. We demonstrate our concepts and metrics with application to a case study of transportation biofuel sourced from managed boreal forest biomass in northern Europe. We derive GWP indices for three land management cases of varying site productivities to illustrate the importance and need to consider case- or region-specific characterization factors for bioenergy product systems. Uncertainties and limitations of the proposed metrics are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Various progenies of Eucalyptus grandis and E. amplifolia, and clones of Populus deltoides, were evaluated for plant removal of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for 26 months at a municipal waste spray field in north Florida. Tertiary treated wastewater containing 2.73 mg L -1 nitrate N and 0.30 mg L -1 total P was applied using sprinkler irrigation (93.8 m 3 ha -1 d -1) to fast growing trees utilized for bioenergy. Eucalyptus amplifolia and E. grandis survived and grew very poorly as the result of severe winter injury in two successive years and were not evaluated for nutrient removal. Survival and growth of P. deltoides demonstrated suitability for phytoremediation, and selected clones were evaluated for biomass and nutrient content. Removals of total N (TN) and total P (TP) were greatest for main stem (36% and 44%, respectively) and foliage (44% and 36%, respectively). Low biomass producing clones generally had higher nutrient concentrations, but high biomass producing clones removed more TN and TP. Approximately 789 kg ha -1 TN and 103 kg ha -1 TP were removed by the highest biomass producing P. deltoides clone, representing 215% of N and 615% of P inputs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper uses fuel ethanol from corn as an example to establish a theoretical model and framework to explore possible impacts of developing bioenergy on food security in China under short run and long run dynamic equilibriums with import supplements. From the three aspects including " fighting for food with people" , " fighting for land with food" , and international trade safety, the conditions that create food safety problems are discussed. In a closed economy, when the decrease in direct or indirect demand for corn caused by corn price rise is larger than the demand increase due to income increase, or when corn demand increase caused by fuel ethanol price rise is larger than the corn demand decrease caused by the decrease in government price subsidy for fuel ethanol, food security problem will appear. Food security problem can be solved by implementing trade policy when a stable import source is available. Otherwise the subsidies, substitutes, technology, etc. should be used to increase the rate of self-supply. Moreover, considering the status quo of corn market, the paper puts forward a set of policies of income and price subsidy, substitutes, and trade and technology to solve the problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present paper was to define the agroclimatological aptitude of the Argentinean semiarid and arid zones to produce industrial oil and biofuel from castor. Castor bean oil (Ricinus communis L.), which currently has more than 700 applications, has an "unlimited" market because its uses are multiple and there is a growing international demand. In Argentina its production was always relegated to marginal soils, but since it ceased to be grown in 1989 castor oil is imported. Due to the international prices of castor bean oil, its multiple applications and in Argentina its diverse climate, this work on potential cultivation areas considering the species bioclimatic needs was carried out. To define the agroclimatic aptitude of this crop in Argentina, the climatic data of the meteorological stations corresponding to the period 1981-2010 was analyzed. Using available databases and geographical limits for the different variables, aptitude types were defined and mapped: optimal (>750. mm; temperature 24.0-27.0 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days); very suitable (>750. mm; temperature 21.0-23.9 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days); suitable with humid regime (>750. mm; temperature 16.0-20.9 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days), suitable 1 with sub-humid regime (450-750. mm; temperature 24.0-27.0 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days); suitable 2 with sub-humid regime (450-750. mm; temperature 21.0-23.9 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days); suitable 3 with sub-humid regime (450-750. mm; temperature 16.0-20.9 °C; >-8 °C; >180 frost-free days); marginal due to humidity (200-450. mm); marginal due to temperature (<16.0 °C); marginal due to frosts (<180 frost-free days or <-8 °C) and not suitable areas (combination of 2 or more of the following variables: <200. mm; <16.0 °C; <-8.0 °C; <180 frost free days). Areas classified as optimal and very suitable in the eastern sector of Argentina overlay with the areas for the production of traditional oilseed crops. So, its cultivation is not recommended. The areas that can be destined to its cultivation are the ones zoned as suitable, defined under conditions of sub-humid regime (450-750. mm), with different thermal regimes: suitable 1 (24.0-27.0 °C), suitable 2 (21.0-23.9 °C) and suitable 3 (16.0-20.9 °C). Therefore, land might be used in parts of the provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Tucumán, Chaco, Formosa, Santiago del Estero, Córdoba, San Luis, La Pampa, western Buenos Aires, La Rioja and Catamarca. This agro-climatic zoning model to determine potential production areas for castor bean can be applied to any part of the world, using the bioclimatic limits of the species presented in this work. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are an important group of photoautotrophic organisms that can synthesize valuable bio-products by harnessing solar energy. They are endowed with high photosynthetic efficiencies and diverse metabolic capabilities that confer the ability to convert solar energy into a variety of biofuels and their precursors. However, less well studied are the similarities and differences in metabolism of different species of cyanobacteria as they pertain to their suitability as microbial production chassis. Here we assemble, update and compare genome-scale models (iCyt773 and iSyn731) for two phylogenetically related cyanobacterial species, namely Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. All reactions are elementally and charge balanced and localized into four different intracellular compartments (i.e., periplasm, cytosol, carboxysome and thylakoid lumen) and biomass descriptions are derived based on experimental measurements. Newly added reactions absent in earlier models (266 and 322, respectively) span most metabolic pathways with an emphasis on lipid biosynthesis. All thermodynamically infeasible loops are identified and eliminated from both models. Comparisons of model predictions against gene essentiality data reveal a specificity of 0.94 (94/100) and a sensitivity of 1 (19/19) for the Synechocystis iSyn731 model. The diurnal rhythm of Cyanothece 51142 metabolism is modeled by constructing separate (light/dark) biomass equations and introducing regulatory restrictions over light and dark phases. Specific metabolic pathway differences between the two cyanobacteria alluding to different bio-production potentials are reflected in both models. © 2012 Saha et al.

AB  - Background: Microalgae hold promise for yielding a biofuel feedstock that is sustainable, carbon-neutral, distributed, and only minimally disruptive for the production of food and feed by traditional agriculture. Amongst oleaginous eukaryotic algae, the B race of Botryococcus braunii is unique in that it produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons of terpenoid origin. These are comparable to fossil crude oil, and are sequestered outside the cells in a communal extracellular polymeric matrix material. Biosynthetic engineering of terpenoid bio-crude production requires identification of genes and reconstruction of metabolic pathways responsible for production of both hydrocarbons and other metabolites of the alga that compete for photosynthetic carbon and energy.Results: A de novo assembly of 1,334,609 next-generation pyrosequencing reads form the Showa strain of the B race of B. braunii yielded a transcriptomic database of 46,422 contigs with an average length of 756 bp. Contigs were annotated with pathway, ontology, and protein domain identifiers. Manual curation allowed the reconstruction of pathways that produce terpenoid liquid hydrocarbons from primary metabolites, and pathways that divert photosynthetic carbon into tetraterpenoid carotenoids, diterpenoids, and the prenyl chains of meroterpenoid quinones and chlorophyll. Inventories of machine-assembled contigs are also presented for reconstructed pathways for the biosynthesis of competing storage compounds including triacylglycerol and starch. Regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, and the extracellular localization of the hydrocarbon oils by active transport and possibly autophagy are also investigated.Conclusions: The construction of an annotated transcriptomic database, publicly available in a web-based data depository and annotation tool, provides a foundation for metabolic pathway and network reconstruction, and facilitates further omics studies in the absence of a genome sequence for the Showa strain of B. braunii, race B. Further, the transcriptome database empowers future biosynthetic engineering approaches for strain improvement and the transfer of desirable traits to heterologous hosts. © 2012 Molnár et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Various studies have suggested that semi-natural grasslands could be a more ecologically beneficial source for biofuel production than intensively managed monocultures. In particular, it has been observed that the high level of species diversity in grasslands has a positive effect on several ecosystem functions (e.g. productivity). Ecological models are useful tools for analyzing the interactions of different processes in grasslands, which are assumed to be the underlying drivers of this positive effect. In this paper we present a review of the main processes included in existing grassland models and discuss the strength and limitations of existing approaches in the context of biofuel production. Most of the existing models (a) focus solely on one or a few single species, (b) do not consider competition processes adequately, or (c) do not follow the individual's development in the grassland community. This hinders a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and conditions that govern the ecosystem functions that are relevant for biofuel production such as productivity, stability, and carbon fixation. To bridge this gap, we propose a concept for a novel individual-based grassland model for temperate regions. Our approach covers a high number of species/functional groups, above- and below-ground intra- and inter-specific competition for different resources (light, water, nitrogen, space), and disturbances (due to management or climate change). Hence, it could facilitate comprehensive mechanistic analyses of the dynamics of semi-natural grasslands and their efficiency in biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A spatially explicit life cycle water analysis framework is proposed, in which a standardized water footprint methodology is coupled with hydrologic modeling to assess blue water, green water (rainfall), and agricultural grey water discharge in the production of biofuel feedstock at county-level resolution. Grey water is simulated via SWAT, a watershed model. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimates generated with the Penman-Monteith equation and crop parameters were verified by using remote sensing results, a satellite-imagery-derived data set, and other field measurements. Crop irrigation survey data are used to corroborate the estimate of irrigation ET. An application of the concept is presented in a case study for corn-stover-based ethanol grown in Iowa (United States) within the Upper Mississippi River basin. Results show vast spatial variations in the water footprint of stover ethanol from county to county. Producing 1 L of ethanol from corn stover growing in the Iowa counties studied requires from 4.6 to 13.1 L of blue water (with an average of 5.4 L), a majority (86%) of which is consumed in the biorefinery. The county-level green water (rainfall) footprint ranges from 760 to 1000 L L -1. The grey water footprint varies considerably, ranging from 44 to 1579 L, a 35-fold difference, with a county average of 518 L. This framework can be a useful tool for watershed- or county-level biofuel sustainability metric analysis to address the heterogeneity of the water footprint for biofuels.

AB  - Resource demand analyses indicate that algal biodiesel production would require unsustainable amounts of freshwater and fertilizer supplies. Alternatively, municipal wastewater effluent can be used, but this restricts production of algae to areas near wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and to date, there has been no geospatial analysis of the feasibility of collocating large algal ponds with WWTPs. The goals of this analysis were to determine the available areas by land cover type within radial extents (REs) up to 1.5 miles from WWTPs; to determine the limiting factor for algal production using wastewater; and to investigate the potential algal biomass production at urban, near-urban, and rural WWTPs in Kansas. Over 50% and 87% of the land around urban and rural WWTPs, respectively, was found to be potentially available for algal production. The analysis highlights a trade-off between urban WWTPs, which are generally land-limited but have excess wastewater effluent, and rural WWTPs, which are generally water-limited but have 96% of the total available land. Overall, commercial-scale algae production collocated with WWTPs is feasible; 29% of the Kansas liquid fuel demand could be met with implementation of ponds within 1 mile of all WWTPs and supplementation of water and nutrients when these are limited. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The effects of growing Jatropha in on-farm and on-station degraded lands were evaluated on carbon (C) sequestration and soil properties. Jatropha accumulated and added to soil significant amounts of C (305kgha -1year -1) from the year one itself. Overall, a 3-5-year old plantation added per year around 4000kg plant biomass equivalent to 1450kgCha -1 - 800kg C through leaves, 150kg C through pruned twigs, and 495kg C as deoiled Jatropha cake. Biodiesel C replacement in the fossil fuel was 230kgha -1. Besides adding biomass to the soil, and C replacement in fossil fuel; the standing Jatropha rendered ecosystem service by fixing 5100-6100kgha -1C as the aboveground plus belowground biomass. Carbon additions by Jatropha during 4 years increased C content in the degraded surface soil layer by 19%, resulting in about 2500kgha -1C sequestered. Huge C additions and live root activity under Jatropha increased microbial population, respiration rate and microbial biomass C and N in soil. Along with C additions, 4000kgha -1year -1 plant biomass recycled into the soil 85.5kg nitrogen, 7.67kg phosphorus, 43.9kg potassium, 5.20kg sulphur, 0.11kg boron, 0.12kg zinc and other nutrients. The C additions improved water holding capacity of the soil under Jatropha as compared with the adjacent control soil which increased by 35% at 30kPa and 21% at 1500kPa soil water potential. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the increasing biofuel demands in recent years, the cultivated lands for biofuel crops, i.e., corn and soybeans, the major sources of ethanol and biodiesel, have been greatly expanding in the northern Great Plains states of the United States. Simulating the spatio-temporal dynamics of biofuel croplands can provide critical information required for assessing the impacts of land-use change on wildlife conservation and water quality. But, yearly agricultural practices such as crop rotations often complicate the spatially explicit modeling of specific crops' expansion. Our research focused on developing a geospatial modeling framework that is able to distinguish long-term, regional changes in croplands from short-term, local fluctuations (such as rotations), using geographic information systems (GIS) and the land transformation model (LTM). The USDA Cropland Data Layers (CDLs) of North Dakota for 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011 were spatially and temporally aggregated to generate a series of biofuel cropland maps. The historical cropland data for 1999/2000 and 2004/2005, together with a collection of environmental factors (i.e., topography, soil fertility, and climate), were used to calibrate the neural network embedded in the LTM. Validation analysis was then conducted by simulating the biofuel cropland change during the period of 2004/2005-2010/2011 using the calibrated LTM and comparing the simulation result with the observed change for the same time period, resulting in 6.3% allocation disagreement (0% quantity disagreement) and 27.4% figure of merit. Future forecast for 2020 showed that biofuel croplands would be expanding northwestward from southeastern North Dakota. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crop residues can be a viable source for biofuel production and other industrial products; however, their removal from agricultural land may negatively impact productivity and environmental quality. In this study three process-based models (CENTURY, DAYCENT, and DNDC) and the CAMPBELL empirical model were used to simulate soil organic carbon (SOC) change and were compared to observations from 14 residue removal experiments within the temperate climate areas of Canada and the Midwestern USA. The experimental results indicated that residue removal effects on SOC were more likely to be observed (i) with greater rates of residue removal, (ii) after longer periods, and (iii) with greater rates of (N) fertilizer. All four models simulated the hypothesized decline in SOC when residues were removed. The average measured SOC change for residue removal across all experimental sites and durations was -235gm -2 (i.e., 3.3% of SOC in top 20cm) whereas the SOC change as estimated by the models were -423, -417, -201, and -218gm -2 for the CENTURY, DAYCENT, DNDC, and CAMPBELL models, respectively. All model predictions were close or within the range of uncertainty of estimates derived from measurements. © 2012.

AB  - Background: Exposure to fine fractions of particulate matter (PM 2.5) is associated with increased hospital admissions and mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular disease in children and the elderly. This study aims to estimate the toxicological risk of PM2.5 from biomass burning in children and adolescents between the age of 6 and 14 in Tangará da Serra, a municipality of Subequatorial Brazilian Amazon. Methods. Risk assessment methodology was applied to estimate the risk quotient in two scenarios of exposure according to local seasonality. The potential dose of PM2.5 was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation, stratifying the population by age, gender, asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: Male asthmatic children under the age of 8 at normal body rate had the highest risk quotient among the subgroups. The general potential average dose of PM 2.5 was 1.95μg/kg.day (95% CI: 1.62 - 2.27) during the dry scenario and 0.32μg/kg.day (95% CI: 0.29 - 0.34) in the rainy scenario. During the dry season, children and adolescents showed a toxicological risk to PM2.5 of 2.07μg/kg.day (95% CI: 1.85 - 2.30). Conclusions: Children and adolescents living in the Subequatorial Brazilian Amazon region were exposed to high levels of PM2.5 resulting in toxicological risk for this multi-pollutant. The toxicological risk quotients of children in this region were comparable or higher to children living in metropolitan regions with PM2.5 air pollution above the recommended limits to human health. © 2012 de Oliveira et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Recent developments in synthetic biology are described and characterized as moving the era of biotechnology into platform technologies. Platform technologies enable rapid and diffuse innovations and simultaneous product development in diffuse markets, often targeting sectors of the economy that have traditionally been thought to have little relationship to one another. In the case of synthetic biology, pharmaceutical and biofuel product development are occurring interactively. But the regulatory and ethical issues associated with these two applications share very little overlap. As such, there is some risk that focus on traditional medical applications, for which the ethical expertise is highly developed, will overshadow the ethical issues that arise in connection with land use and its attendant socioeconomic consequences, especially in the developing world. The 2010 report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics exhibits this tendency. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Mechanical dewatering of wet mined peat produced peat mining process water (PMPW) with low pH (5.49) and high total suspended solids (TSS 432 mg L-1), Al (1.39 mg L-1), Fe (4.36 mg L-1), Hg (37.1 ng L-1), MeHg (0.485 ng L-1), Zn (55 μg L-1), total nitrogen (TN 7.92 mg L-1), total phosphorus (TP 303 μg L-1) and true colour (532 TCU). High removal efficiencies were calculated for acrotelm peat filters (mesocosms) used to treat PMPW (TSS 45-83%; particulate organic carbon (POC) 47-89%; metals 53-100%; TN 85%; TP 81%), though final mesocosm leachate concentrations did not all achieve Canadian Water Quality Guidelines. In one study, mesocosm leachate had higher colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than PMPW. Our mesocosm studies suggest an initial reduction in PMPW solids be considered by industry before peatlands are used as treatment systems. © IWA Publishing 2012.

AB  - Global interest in biomass-based fossil fuel substitutes is increasing, creating needs for new crops and cropping systems that will expand biofuel production. In the southeastern United States, an alley cropping agroforestry management system in which switchgrass is cultivated between rows of loblolly pine is being explored. Such a system could produce an annually harvested, high-yield energy crop, wood waste for biofuel production, conventional forest products, and environmental services such as soil carbon (C) sequestration. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of loblolly pine age (juvenile, mid-rotation, and late-rotation) and loblolly pine density (no trees, low density, and high density) on switchgrass and loblolly pine growth and soil characteristics (microbial biomass C and activity, labile C, and total soil C) linked to carbon sequestration and site productivity. Switchgrass ground coverage was greater in loblolly pine alleys than in open conditions in 2 of the 3 years of this study, but switchgrass biomass was lower in loblolly pine alleys than in open conditions in the mid-rotation stand. Switchgrass in alleys was associated with greater labile C, respiration, and microbial biomass and activity in soil compared with that in loblolly pine plantations with intensive suppression of understory. © 2012 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Although biofuels present an opportunity for renewable energy production, significant land-use change resulting from biofuels may contribute to negative environmental, economic, and social impacts. Here we examined non-GHG air pollution impacts from both indirect and direct land-use change caused by the anticipated expansion of Brazilian biofuels production. We synthesized information on fuel loading, combustion completeness, and emission factors, and developed a spatially explicit approach with uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to estimate air pollution emissions. The land-use change emissions, ranging from 6.7 to 26.4 Tg PM2.5, were dominated by deforestation burning practices associated with indirect land-use change. We also found Brazilian sugar cane ethanol and soybean biodiesel including direct and indirect land-use change effects have much larger life-cycle emissions than conventional fossil fuels for six regulated air pollutants. The emissions magnitude and uncertainty decrease with longer life-cycle integration periods. Results are conditional to the single LUC scenario employed here. After LUC uncertainty, the largest source of uncertainty in LUC emissions stems from the combustion completeness during deforestation. While current biofuels cropland burning policies in Brazil seek to reduce life-cycle emissions, these policies do not address the large emissions caused by indirect land-use change. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels as renewable resources are one of the options to meet the challenges of fossil fuel resource depletion and atmospheric pollution. Several studies have focused on the technical, economic, and environmental footprint of biofuels, particularly bioethanol production. However, there has been little effort to incorporate the environmental, health, and safety (EHS) hazards in an inclusive sustainability assessment of bioethanol production alternatives. This study focuses on these sustainability aspects for bioethanol production by employing the EHS and the inherent safety index (ISI) methods. The multicriteria assessment also includes the cumulative energy demand as a widely used lifecycle impact assessment indicator. Sugarcane, corn, and corn stover are considered as biomass resources, and the typical process conditions are used for the base case evaluation. Sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the impact of process conditions, composition of feed, and method settings on the final outcome. The results indicate that both the ISI and the EHS methods present similar overall rankings with sugarcane-derived and corn stover-derived processes as the most and the least hazardous, respectively. However, dissimilarities occur in the evaluation of the process sections, highlighting different hazardous aspects. Finally, including the lifecycle impact assessment in a bicriteria assessment indicates the sugarcane-derived process as clearly superior followed by the corn-derived and the corn stover-derived processes.

AB  - The complexity of human interaction in the commercial agricultural landscape and the resulting impacts on the ecosystem services of water quality and quantity are largely ignored by the current agricultural paradigm that maximizes crop production over other ecosystem services. Three examples at different spatial scales (local, regional, and global) are presented where human and ecosystem interactions in a commercial agricultural landscape adversely affect water quality and quantity in unintended ways in the Delta of northwestern Mississippi. In the first example, little to no regulation of groundwater use for irrigation has caused declines in groundwater levels resulting in loss of baseflow to streams and threatening future water supply. In the second example, federal policy that subsidizes corn for biofuel production has encouraged many producers to switch from cotton to corn, which requires more nutrients and water, counter to national efforts to reduce nutrient loads to the Gulf of Mexico and exacerbating groundwater-level declines. The third example is the wholesale adoption of a system for weed control that relies on a single chemical, initially providing many benefits but ultimately leading to the widespread occurrence of glyphosate and its degradates in Delta streams and necessitating higher application rates of glyphosate as well as the use of other herbicides due to increasing weed resistance. Although these examples are specific to the Mississippi Delta, analogous situations exist throughout the world and point to the need for change in how we grow our food, fuel, and fiber, and manage our soil and water resources. © 2012.

AB  - A range of major risks associated with the production and use of biofuels in the rapidly changing United Kingdom (UK) energy and transport sectors have been identified and quantified. This was achieved with the aid of various stakeholder groups (academic researchers; industrialists; and a concatenated group of policy makers together with 'green' and international development groups), who completed an online internet questionnaire. Each stakeholder ranked 15 potential risks associated with the UK development and use of liquid biofuels according to their perceived 'severity of impact' and 'likelihood of occurrence' using a three-point scale. This data was then used to perform a ranking of the risks by multiplying scores for impact and occurrence. There was some variation between the different stakeholder groups, but the similar risks were ranked highly by each group. The overall ranking identified the main risks as being a lack of investor confidence in biofuel developments (the highest score); energy or fuel security issues; negative public perception of biofuels (equal second highest); increased food prices; high barriers to entry into the fuel market; and misdirected agricultural expansion or land use (equal fifth highest). Comments by the expert respondents also provide a qualitative evaluation of the present state of UK biofuel developments. The present trial illustrates the potential of using risk issues appraisal and ranking to evaluate developing risks to the UK biofuels landscape. Clearly such an exercise would need to be carried out periodically if it were to maintain its value to the biofuel-related industrial sector and other stakeholders, including policy makers. © 2012 IMechE.

AB  - A novel hydrothermal catalytic liquefaction process for Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied in the paper to explore the new resources of bio-fuel. The effects of catalytic liquefaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst on the yield of bio-fuel were investigated, and the reaction conditions were optimized via orthogonal optimization method. The chemical groups and components of final bio-fuel were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the optimal reaction was taken place at 300°C for 20 minutes as Ce/HZSM-5 was selected as a catalyst with 5% mass fraction and the volume ratio of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to solvent was 1:10. The maximum liquefaction yield reached to 39.87% and the heating value of final bio-fuel was up to 26.09 MJ/kg. The main components of bio-fuel from Chlorella pyrenoidosa contained alcohol, ester derivatives and some hydrocarbons. Compared with other lignocellulosic bio-fuels, the prepared bio-fuel can be regarded as an alternative diesel fuel because of their similar chemical components and higher heat value. The research is helpful for the preparation of bio-fuel from microalgaes.

AB  - The global concerns of increasing atmospheric concentration of green house gas emissions and world energy demand has led to the substantial interest in developing sustainable energy sources. The greenhouse gas most commonly produced by burning fossil fuels is carbon dioxide (CO 2), which is responsible for 63% of global warming. Micro algae are viewed as sustainable approach for Carbon fixation. Microalgae are capable of fixing CO 2 using sunlight to produce biofuel and other chemical compounds with numerous additional technological advantages. This present study highlights the concept of algal carbon sequestration and biofuel production using open raceway ponds and closed photo bioreactor. This article addresses its technical and economic aspects.

AB  - The temperature optimum of photosynthesis coincides with the average daytime temperature in a species' native environment. Moderate heat stress occurs when temperatures exceed the optimum, inhibiting photosynthesis and decreasing productivity. In the present study, the temperature response of photosynthesis and the potential for heat acclimation was evaluated for Camelina sativa, a bioenergy crop. The temperature optimum of net CO 2 assimilation rate (A) under atmospheric conditions was 30-32 °C and was only slightly higher under non-photorespiratory conditions. The activation state of Rubisco was closely correlated with A at supra-optimal temperatures, exhibiting a parallel decrease with increasing leaf temperature. At both control and elevated temperatures, the modeled response of A to intercellular CO 2 concentration was consistent with Rubisco limiting A at ambient CO 2. Rubisco activation and photochemical activities were affected by moderate heat stress at lower temperatures in camelina than in the warm-adapted species cotton and tobacco. Growth under conditions that imposed a daily interval of moderate heat stress caused a 63 % reduction in camelina seed yield. Levels of cpn60 protein were elevated under the higher growth temperature, but acclimation of photosynthesis was minimal. Inactivation of Rubisco in camelina at temperatures above 35 °C was consistent with the temperature response of Rubisco activase activity and indicated that Rubisco activase was a prime target of inhibition by moderate heat stress in camelina. That photosynthesis exhibited no acclimation to moderate heat stress will likely impact the development of camelina and other cool season Brassicaceae as sources of bioenergy in a warmer world. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).

AB  - A promising renewable energy scenario involves growing photosynthetic microalgae as a biofuel feedstock that can be converted into fungible, energy-dense fuels. Microalgae transform the energy in sunlight into a variety of reduced-carbon storage products, including triacylglycerols, which can be readily transformed into diesel fuel surrogates. To develop an economically viable algal biofuel industry, it is important to maximize the production and accumulation of these targeted bioenergy carriers in selected strains. In an effort to identify promising feedstock isolates we developed, evaluated and optimized contemporary high-throughput cell-sorting techniques to establish a collection of microalgae isolated from highly diverse ecosystems near geographic areas that are potential sites for large-scale algal cultivation in the Southwest United States. These efforts resulted in a culture collection containing 360 distinct microalgal strains. We report on the establishment of this collection and some preliminary qualitative screening studies to identify important biofuel phenotypes including neutral lipid accumulation and growth rates. As part of this undertaking we determined suitable cultivation media and evaluated cryopreservation techniques critical for the long-term storage of the microorganisms in this collection. This technique allows for the rapid isolation of extensive strain biodiversity that can be leveraged for the selection of promising bioenergy feedstock strains, as well as for providing fundamental advances in our understanding of fundamental algal biology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The theories about plant nutrition and soil fertility varied widely from the antiquity to the middle of the nineteenth century, with major (Thaer A. 1809. Grundsätze der rationellen Landwirtschaft (1809-1812). Berlin (Germany): Realschulbuch Ed.) or minor (Liebig J. 1840. Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikultur und Physiologie. Braunschweig (Germany): Vieweg) importance attributed to soil humus or soil organic matter (SOM). The importance assigned to humus over the past two centuries will be developed in this historical paper. Intensification of agriculture in the twentieth century permitted an important increase in cultivated plant yield of food, fiber, wood, and biofuel production, not only in the northern countries, but also in some southern countries (e.g., India and China) with the emergence of the Green Revolution. However, the question of organic restitutions and the maintenance (or increase) of the SOM stock was, at times, not taken into consideration; consequently, there was a general decrease in SOM stock for many tropical soils. It is now widely accepted by scientists that SOM depletion is one of the major factors leading to degradation of ecosystem services and loss of ecosystem resilience: new alternatives are now necessary for the maintenance and/or increase in plant productivity and production of environmental services by agriculture. Therefore, this paper will also present some recent research in different tropical countries with a focus on agroecological management of tropical soils. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increasing concerns of oil security, greenhouse gas emissions, and sustainability have encouraged nations to consider the contribution that agriculture/forestry for bioenergy (and biofuels in particular) could make as alternatives to current fossil- based energy and transportation fuels. Despite China's large population and geographical size, it has only relatively recently developed into a highly industrialized and energy-dependent economy. Coal is, and will remain, China's dominant energy source. However, over the last few years with China's growing middle class, increasing growth in production and sale of cars/trucks and a growing chemical based sector, oil and its derivatives are predicted to experience the fastest fossil fuel growth. China's ability to produce so-called "first-generation" or conventional biofuels from sugar, starch or vegetable oil based plants is very restricted because of "food vs. fuel" issues. Thus, biomass-based and forest-based biofuels, in particular, can form a medium-to-long-term solution that could contribute to China's national biofuels targets. Oilseed trees have been suggested as an initial forest-based biodiesel strategy with about 13 million ha of marginal land identified for possible plantation. It is also estimated that 17 million tonnes of cellulosic ethanol per annum could be derived from forest biomass that is currently available in China.

AB  - Ever since the Kyoto Protocol, agroforestry has gained increased attention as a strategy to sequester carbon (C) and mitigate global climate change. Agroforestry has been recognized as having the greatest potential for C sequestration of all the land uses analyzed in the Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry report of the IPCC; however, our understanding of C sequestration in specific agroforestry practices from around the world is rudimentary at best. Similarly, while agroforestry is well recognized as a land use practice capable of producing biomass for biopower and biofuels, very little information is available on this topic. This thematic issue is an attempt to bring together a collection of articles on C sequestration and biomass for energy, two topics that are inextricably interlinked and of great importance to the agroforestry community the world over. These papers not only address the aboveground C sequestration, but also the belowground C and the role of decomposition and nutrient cycling in determining the size of soil C pool using specific case studies. In addition to providing allometric methods for quantifying biomass production, the biological and economic realities of producing biomass in agroforestry practices are also discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Increased demand for meat products has led to increased livestock production in Vietnam, which now risks environmental pollution from inappropriate animal manure management on livestock farms. Biogas technology is generally considered an efficient solution for such farms to produce renewable biofuel for use in the household and to reduce the pollution impact from animal waste. However, with biogas technology, farmers may reduce their use of manure for fertilising crops. This field survey investigated nutrient flows on small- and medium-scale livestock farms with and without biogas in Northern Vietnam, in order to identify existing problems and possibilities for sustainable livestock production. A field survey was conducted on 12 pig farms with biogas and 12 pig farms without biogas in Quoc Oai district, Hanoi city. In general, the non-biogas pig farms used on average 3. 8 ton compost and 3. 1 ton fresh solid manure ha-1crop-1 for each of three crops typically grown per year on their arable land. They discharged on average 16 % of the total manure produced into the environment in liquid form through the public sewage system. On biogas pig farms, the use of fresh solid manure for crops and discharge of liquid manure was lower, as manure was used to produce biogas. However, excessive use of washing water on several of these farms resulted in very dilute slurry (solid manure:water ratio 1:11) entering the biogas digester. This lowered the retention time in the digester (below the optimum range of 35-55 days), leading to low biogas production rates and possible accumulation of sediment. The digestate was also highly diluted and hence difficult and costly to transport and apply to crops, so it was largely (60 %) discharged to the environment. The input volume of washing water should therefore be reduced to a ratio of 1:5. For better sustainability, appropriate technologies are needed to absorb nutrients from the digestate before discharge and to recycle these nutrients to crops. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The methane potentials of cyanobacteria and chlorella have been investigated in eight different lab scale reactors at 25°C for three-day Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). Autoclavation pre-treatment was applied to the cyanobacteria to aid digestion, while the Chlorella was obtained and digested in powdery form. The organic loading rates were 1g VS, 2 g VS, 3 g VS, 4 g VS, 5 g VS, 6 g VS, 7 g VS, 8 g VS and 9 g VS. Methane production rates increased with increasing loading and started declining at loading rate higher than 7 g VS, while the HRT was kept constant. The highest methane production rates for cyanobacteria and chlorella were (78±25) mL/(L•d) and (100±25) mL/(L•d), respectively, at loading rate of 7g VS. Digester instability occurred at loading rates of 8 g VS and 9 g VS with higher accumulation of methane concentrations. Lipid compositions of both feeds were close and the methane production potentials of both biomasses were also close and followed the same trend.

AB  - Mallee-based agroforestry has potential to provide farmers with new income sources derived from biofuels, biofeedstocks, and carbon sequestration. Although mallees are planted on 12 700ha across the south-west of Western Australia, very little commercial harvesting of mallee has occurred to date. The development of biomass processing industries is constrained by lack of robust information regarding the productivity of integrated mallee and agricultural systems. This study addresses this constraint by quantifying the productivity and economics of agricultural crops and pastures growing in the competition zone adjacent to mallee belts at 15 sites across the Western Australian wheatbelt. The sites covered a range of climate and edaphic conditions, three mallee species (Eucalyptus polybractea R Baker, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia LAS Johnson and KD Hill, or E. kochii ssp. plenissima (CA Gardner) Brooker), various crop and pasture rotations, and various mallee harvest-management treatments. Malleecrop competition was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with mallee age and size, and greater for crops than pasture. Consequently, extent and magnitude of competition were highly variable across sites and years. On average, malleecrop competition extended 11.3m from unharvested belts and reduced crop and pasture yields by 36% within 220m of the mallee belts relative to open paddock yields. This is similar to what has been reported for taller tree species. Harvesting mallees reduced competition such that crop and pasture yield was reduced by 22 or 27% relative to open paddock yields for mallees harvested at 3- or 6+-year intervals, respectively. The economic cost of malleecrop competition on agricultural enterprises was also highly variable between sites, and between years within individual sites. Averaged across all site-years, the opportunity cost of competition was equivalent to forgoing agricultural production for 14.4m on each side of unharvested mallee belts, or 910m on each side of harvested belts. Farmers with mallee agroforestry systems will need to manage the economic impacts of competition by reducing agricultural input costs in the competition zone, timing crop-grazing rotations with mallee harvests, ensuring that the width of alleys is at least 25 times the height of the mature trees, and possibly root-pruning mallees in unharvested or long harvest interval systems. This research has shown that malleecrop competition presents a significant cost to farmers and must be considered when designing mallee agroforestry systems. The findings have relevance for the development of appropriate biomass and carbon sequestration pricing benchmarks for mallee plantings. Journal compilation © CSIRO 2012.

AB  - A closed-loop vertical tubular photobioreactor (PBR), specially designed to operate under conditions of scarce flat land availability and irregular solar irradiance conditions, was used to study the potential of Scenedesmus obliquus biomass/sugar production. The results obtained were compared to those from an open-raceway pond and a closed-bubble column. The influence of the type of light source and the regime (natural vs artificial and continuous vs light/dark cycles) on the growth of the microalga and the extent of the sugar accumulation was studied in both PBRs. The best type of reactor studied was a closed-loop PBR illuminated with natural light/dark cycles. In all the cases, the relationship between the nitrate depletion and the sugar accumulation was observed. The microalga Scenedesmus was cultivated for 53 days in a raceway pond (4,500 L) and accumulated a maximum sugar content of 29 % g/g. It was pre-treated for carrying out ethanol fermentation assays, and the highest ethanol concentration obtained in the hydrolysate fermented by Kluyveromyces marxianus was 11.7 g/L. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - A well-to-wheels life cycle analysis on total energy consumptions and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions for alternative fuels and accompanying vehicle technologies has been carried out for the base year 2010 and projected to 2020 based on data gathered and estimates developed for China. The fuels considered include gasoline, diesel, natural gas, liquid fuels from coal conversion, methanol, bio-ethanol and biodiesel, electricity and hydrogen. Use of liquid fuels including methanol and Fischer-Tropsch derived from coal will significantly increase GHG emissions relative to use of conventional gasoline. Use of starch-based bio-ethanol will incur a substantial carbon disbenefit because of the present highly inefficient agricultural practice and plant processing in China. Electrification of vehicles via hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle technologies offers a progressively improved prospect for the reduction of energy consumption and GHG emission. However, the long-term carbon emission reduction is assured only when the needed electricity is generated by zero- or low-carbon sources, which means that carbon capture and storage is a necessity for fossil-based feedstocks. A PHEV that runs on zero- or low-carbon electricity and cellulosic ethanol may be one of the most attractive fuel-vehicle options in a carbon-constrained world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While biofuel crops are widely studied and compared for their energy and carbon footprints, less is known about their effects on other soil properties, particularly hydrologic characteristics. Soils under three biofuel crops, corn (Zea mays), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and willow (Salix spp.), were analyzed seven years after establishment to assess the effects on soil bulk density (ρ b), penetration resistance (PR), water-holding capacity, and infiltration characteristics. The PR was the highest under corn, along with the lowest associated water content, while PR was 50-60% lower under switchgrass. In accordance with PR data, surface (0-10 cm) bulk density also tended to be lower under switchgrass. Both water infiltration rates and cumulative infiltration amounts varied widely among and within the three crops. Because the Philip model did not fit the data, results were analyzed using the Kostiakov model instead. Switchgrass plots had an average cumulative infiltration of 69 cm over 3 hours with a constant infiltration rate of 0.28 cm min -1, compared with 37 cm and 0.11 cm min -1 for corn, and 26 cm and 0.06 cm min -1 for willow, respectively. Results suggest that significant changes in soil physical and hydrologic properties may require more time to develop. Soils under switchgrass may have lower surface bulk density, higher field water capacity, and a more rapid water infiltration rate than those under corn or willow. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to evaluate waste-to-energy technology for the utilization of crude glycerol (84.5% purity) surplus, collected by the largest Lithuanian biodiesel plants. The research examined the use of glycerol and woody (timber) cutting waste (WCW) to produce fuel briquettes. Two ratios of glycerol mass share 10% and 20% per unit volume were proposed as a partial substitute for WCW in briquette production process, thus solving glycerol utilization problems present in Lithuania. Proposed volumes of additive are in strong agreement with EN 14961-1. Affirmative proportions for interfusion of input materials, durability rating of fuel briquettes, characterization of combustion regimes and emission characteristics were assessed based on their composition. The optimum fuel properties were demonstrated by WCW briquettes containing maximum 10% glycerol mass concentration. Combustion of such briquettes exposed low CO, SO 2 and NO X emission levels, falling under requirements of LAND 43-2001. Further increase in glycerol share is not recommendable, in the larger part due to the decrease in physical-mechanical properties, but not from emission constrains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is being evaluated as a bioenergy crop for the northern Great Plains. Field measurements of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O flux are needed to estimate the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of this biofeedstock. The study objective was to determine effects of recommended Nitrogen (N) fertilization (67 kg ha -1 of N applied) and unfertilized switchgrass on growing season soil-atmosphere CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O flux using static chamber methodology. Mean hourly CO 2 flux was greatest during periods of active switchgrass growth and was similar between N fertilizer treatments (P = 0.09). Mean hourly N 2O flux was consistently greater under N fertilization than without N throughout the growing season. Overall, N fertilization of switchgrass affected cumulative growing-season N 2O flux (27.6 kg ha -1 ± 4.0 kg ha -1 vs. 86.3 kg ha -1 ± 14.3 kg ha -1 as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2eq) for 0 kg ha -1 and 67 kg ha -1 of N applied, respectively; P &lt; 0.01), but not cumulative CO 2 or CH 4 flux (P = 0.08 and 0.51, respectively). Aboveground biomass production was greater with N application (6.8 Mg ha -1 ± 0.5 Mg ha -1 dry matter) than without N (3.2 Mg ha -1 ± 0.5 Mg ha -1) (P &lt; 0.05). Net greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; kg GHG flux kg -1 harvest yield as CO 2eq) for switchgrass production was similar between N treatments (0.71 vs. 0.44 for 0 kg ha -1 and 67 kg ha -1 of N applied, respectively; P = 0.18). © 2012.

AB  - Endophytic fungi represent a diverse group of Fungi belonging primarily to the Phylum Ascomycota, and exist asymptomatically within tissues of plants. Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes can promote plant productivity in grasses. Less is known about non-clavicipitaceous endophytes, which are the dominant fungal endophytes in many plants. Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), a prairie grass native to North America, is a potential candidate as a biofuel crop. Our knowledge of the endophytic fungi of switchgrass and their potential effects on biomass production in this species is limited. To characterize and evaluate endophytic fungi in switchgrass, tillers were collected from a range of habitats across Indiana and Illinois in 2008 and 2009. Endophytic fungi were cultured from surface disinfected aboveground tissues. Morphological characters and sequences of the fungal ITS region were used to identify endophytic fungal isolates. In total, 31 operational taxonomic units were identified, representing fungi belonging to over 11 taxonomic orders. All fungi were members of Ascomycota and most belonged to common genera such as Alternaria, Epicoccum, Phoma, Phaeosphaeria and Stagonospora. No members of the Clavicipitaceae were detected. A greenhouse assay was carried out with a subset of endophyte isolates to determine their impacts on switchgrass biomass production. Experimental inoculations demonstrated that fungi had a range of effects on switchgrass biomass, with 12.5. % and 62.5. % of isolates significantly promoting versus reducing biomass production of test seedlings over controls. Some endophytic fungi of switchgrass may have potential to enhance plant productivity, but net effects of endophyte communities under field conditions need to be explored. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB  - The European Union issued an ambitious target for the introduction of biofuels in the transport sector: 10% by 2020. 2nd generation biofuels (e.g. BTL, lignocellulosic ethanol, algae) are expected to play an important role in the medium term: among these, lignocellulosic ethanol is a key technology currently under industrialisation. In the present work, second generation ethanol modelled through a process simulation developed in the software Aspen Plus ® environment. A literature-based comparative analysis of the conversion technologies in terms of yield, efficiency, feedstock and level of process integration is carried out. Crucial aspects of the process include high pretreatment performances, efficient hexose and pentose fermentation, enzyme strain development and solid co-product valorisation for process heat and power generation. The investigated plant size processes 240,000 t biomass/y, with a production capacity of about 40,000 t ethanol/y. Ethanol productivity ranges between 303 and 316 l/t dry biomass. Considering a total energy input (chemical energy contained in the biomass fed to the process) of 108 MW, 36 MW of ethanol are obtained, and additional 2.5 MW of power: the net process energy efficiency is calculated in the range from 35% to 37%. Modelling was aimed to better understand the production process from poplar as feedstock and could be used to support process development in design and optimisation. In particular the lignin-rich residue thermal/chemical valorisation is a key issue that needs further studies, in order to improve the environmental and economic performances of the process.

AB  - With the increasing availability of European and global forest maps, users are facing the difficult choice to select the most appropriate map for their purposes. Many of these maps are potential input datasets for forest-related applications for the European Union (EU), due to their spatial extent and harmonised approach at the European level. However, they possess different characteristics in terms of spatial detail or thematic accuracy. Little attention has been paid to the effect of these characteristics on simulation models and the resultant policy implications.In this study we tested whether the choice of a forest map has substantial influence on model output, i.e. if output differences can be related to the input differences. A sensitivity analysis of the spatially explicit Global Forest Model (G4M) was performed using four different forest maps: the pan-European high resolution forest/non-forest map (FMAP), the Corine Land Cover (CLC), the Calibrated European Forest Map (CEFM) and the Global Land Cover (GLC). Finally, the impact of potential differences owing to input datasets on decision-making was tested in a selected case study: reaching the EU 10% biofuel target through enhanced utilization of forest biomass.The sensitivity analysis showed that the choice of the forest cover map has a major influence on the model outputs in particular at the country-level, while having less influence at the EU27 level. Differences between the input datasets are strongly reflected in the outputs. Similarly, depending on the choice of the input alternate options for decision-making were found within the hypothesized biofuel target (case study), demonstrating a substantial value of information. In general, it was demonstrated that input maps are the major driver of decision-making if forest resource outputs of the model are their basis. Improvement of the input forest map would result in immediate benefit for a better decision-making basis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to a growing world population and increasing welfare, energy demand worldwide is increasing. To meet the increasing energy demand in a sustainable way, new technologies are needed. The Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell (P-MFC) is a technology that could produce sustainable bio-electricity and help meeting the increasing energy demand. Power output of the P-MFC, however, needs to be increased to make it attractive as a renewable and sustainable energy source. To increase power output of the P-MFC internal resistances need to be reduced. With a flat-plate P-MFC design we tried to minimize internal resistances compared to the previously used tubular P-MFC design. With the flat-plate design current and power density per geometric planting area were increased (from 0.15 A/m2 to 1.6 A/m2 and from 0.22 W/m2 to and 0.44 W/m2)as were current and power output per volume (from 7.5 A/m3 to 122 A/m3 and from 1.3 W/m3 to 5.8 W/m3). Internal resistances times volume were decreased, even though internal resistances times membrane surface area were not. Since the membrane in the flat-plate design is placed vertically, membrane surface area per geometric planting area is increased, which allows for lower internal resistances times volume while not decreasing internal resistances times membrane surface area. Anode was split into three different sections on different depths of the system, allowing to calculate internal resistances on different depths. Most electricity was produced where internal resistances were lowest and where most roots were present; in the top section of the system. By measuring electricity production on different depths in the system, electricity production could be linked to root growth. This link offers opportunities for material-reduction in new designs. Concurrent reduction in material use and increase in power output brings the P-MFC a step closer to usable energy density and economic feasibility. © 2012 Helder et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The production of fuel grade ethanol from nonfood grade crops in South Africa has the potential to reduce reliance on imported oil and minimize the negative environmental consequences of fossil fuels. This article presents a preliminary assessment of the technical and economic feasibility of producing fuel-grade ethanol from nonfood, small grain crops cultivated on marginal lands in the Western Cape of South Africa, namely triticale, low-grade wheat, feed barley, and malt barley. It also explores the potential of grain fiber fractionation (separation of starch from bran) on process economics for a dry-mill process. A conservative "base-case" economic model was developed for a processing capacity of 200 000 metric tonnes per annum (tpa) at maximum expected feedstock prices. The overall average unit costs of production for each grain were compared for three possible process configurations, i.e. a conventional dry-mill starch-to-ethanol plant, an advanced starch-to-ethanol plant with fractionation and energy recovery from bran, and a hybrid integrated cellulosic plant with fractionation, hydrolysis, and fermentation of bran. Triticale demonstrated the greatest economic potential of all grains, regardless of technology type, while the advanced process technology option-fiber fractionation and steam generation from bran combustion-achieved the lowest overall costs of production, across all grain types. For the conservative base-case model, it was found that the government subsidy of ZAR 1.50/L proposed under the South African Biofuels Strategy is insufficient to ensure economic feasibility for any of the grains or technology options under scenarios with high feedstock costs. The government subsidy would need to be increased by at least 124% before profitable operation during times with high feedstock prices would be possible. A sensitivity analysis of the economic assumptions of the base-case model demonstrated that feedstock price is the most important determinant of production costs and that the economic feasibility of such technologies relies heavily on a favorable ethanol selling price. When assuming maximum theoretical starch-ethanol yields, and considering fluctuation in feedstock prices in the range from ZAR 1589/t to ZAR 3680/t (as observed in South Africa during the period between 2005 and 2012), the best economic results were observed for an advanced starch-to-ethanol plant processing triticale grain at a rate of 200 000 tpa (production cost between ZAR 4.25/L and ZAR 8.48/L). Due to uncertainty of commodity price fluctuations, it is recommended that static, deterministic models for economic feasibility should therefore be enhanced to incorporate uncertainty and quantitative risk assessment in process and economic parameters, by adopting stochastic simulation methods to account for price volatility. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The storage of renewable electrical energy within chemical bonds of biofuels and other chemicals is a route to decreasing petroleum usage. A critical challenge is the efficient transfer of electrons into a biological host that can covert this energy into high energy organic compounds. In this paper, we describe an approach whereby biomass is grown using energy obtained from a soluble mediator that is regenerated electrochemically. The net result is a separate-stage reverse microbial fuel cell (rMFC) that fixes CO2 into biomass using electrical energy. We selected ammonia as a low cost, abundant, safe, and soluble redox mediator that facilitated energy transfer to biomass. Nitrosomonas europaea, a chemolithoautotroph, was used as the biocatalyst due to its inherent capability to utilize ammonia as its sole energy source for growth. An electrochemical reactor was designed for the regeneration of ammonia from nitrite, and current efficiencies of 100% were achieved. Calculations indicated that overall bioproduction efficiency could approach 2.7±0.2% under optimal electrolysis conditions. The application of chemolithoautotrophy for industrial bioproduction has been largely unexplored, and results suggest that this and related rMFC platforms may enable biofuel and related biochemical production. © 2012 Khunjar et al.

AB  - At present, most synthetic organic materials are produced from fossil carbon feedstock that is regenerated over time scales of millions of years. Biobased alternatives can be rapidly renewed in cradle-to-cradle cycles (1-10 years). Such materials extend landfill life and decrease undesirable impacts due to material persistence. This work develops a LCA for synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from methane with subsequent biodegradation of PHB back to biogas (40-70% methane, 30-60% carbon dioxide). The parameters for this cradle-to-cradle cycle for PHB production are developed and used as the basis for a cradle-to-gate LCA. PHB production from biogas methane is shown to be preferable to its production from cultivated feedstock due to the energy and land required for the feedstock cultivation and fermentation. For the PHB-methane cycle, the major challenges are PHB recovery and demands for energy. Some or all of the energy requirements can be satisfied using renewable energy, such as a portion of the collected biogas methane. Oxidation of 18-26% of the methane in a biogas stream can meet the energy demands for aeration and agitation, and recovery of PHB synthesized from the remaining 74-82%. Effective coupling of waste-to-energy technologies could thus conceivably enable PHB production without imported carbon and energy. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The expansion of sugarcane for biofuels is a highly contentious issue. The growth of sugarcane area has occurred simultaneously with a reduction of dairy production in São Paulo state, the primary production region for sugar and ethanol in Brazil. This paper analyses different dairy farm rationales to continue dairy production in the context of a dramatically expanding sugarcane economy. Combining different data sets - semi-structured interviews with 34 farmers and baseline data from all members of a dairy farm co-operative - makes it possible to recognize different farm types. This heuristic tool is used to identify the various strategies regarding shifting to biofuel production or investing in dairy farming. The paper identifies labour availability, household resilience and technology introduction as key factors in the context of complex, multiple interactions between the biofuel sector and dairy production. We will argue that biofuel-sugarcane expansion not always pushes aside dairy farming. Those farmers that shift to sugarcane are not simply spurred by better prices, but mainly change as result of perceptions of labour constraints, risks and the opportunities offered by diversification. For farmers who totally quit dairy production the shift to sugarcane may pass the point of no return. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crossflow microfiltration (MF) was successfully implemented for harvesting microalgae suspensions from a culture medium. In this study, investigations were carried out to harvest Chlorella sp. using a cellulose acetate (CA) membrane. Electrophoretic mobility profile during the cultivation process showed a maximum electronegative value of -2.56±0.07μmcm/Vs on the 9th day of the experiment which were taken as a fresh cultures in each cultivation process. The effects of hydrodynamic conditions on the permeation flux are also discussed. The results show that the permeate flux increases with an increasing crossflow velocity (CFV) and transmembrane pressure (TMP). The flux is higher when the pressure is high, suggesting that the resistance of the membranes to mass transfer increases; hence, the applied pressure (driving force) has to be increased to obtain a higher flux. Furthermore, an increase in the CFV leads to a higher shear velocity, which makes it more difficult for microalgae to be deposited on the membrane, thus giving a better flux. The analysis of various resistances encountered in membrane filtration which involves the resistance of membrane itself and cake as well as those due to pore blocking and concentration polarization was studied. The experimental results obtained here show that the cake resistance (R c) played a more major role in the filtration rate than the resistance due to concentration polarization (R cp) and pore blocking (R b) under the conditions examined. An increase in the CFV and a decrease in the TMP result in a reduction in the cake layer formation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article analyzes the domestic and global rebound effects of a carbon price policy, the existing Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), and a proposed national Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and examines implications for the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits of these policies. This study shows that unlike a carbon price policy, the RFS generates positive domestic and global rebound effects, while the rebound effects under the LCFS may be positive or negative depending on the stringency of the LCFS target. The numerical simulation shows that a 10% LCFS generates a smaller positive rebound effect than the RFS, and that the rebound effect has a larger potential to offset the direct GHG savings resulting from the displacement of fossil fuels achieved by these policies compared to the indirect-land-use change effect. Nevertheless, all three policies reduce GHG emissions relative to a no-policy, business-asusual scenario, with the RFS leading to a lower reduction in GHG emissions than the LCFS and the carbon tax.

AB  - All biofuels produced in the world utilize food resources. This contributes to the world starvation problem that is reported to be more than 66% of the world population being malnourished. Starvation is the number one cause of death in the world. Approximately 40% of U.S. corn is being converted into ethanol and 1.6 liters of fossil oil equivalents are required to produce 1 liter of ethanol. Thus, the U.S. is importing oil to produce ethanol at an enormous economic and fuel cost to the people of the nation, and reduces food resource availability to the people.

AB  - The expanding production of bioenergy crops may impact regional air quality through the production of volatile organic compounds such as isoprene. To investigate the effects of isoprene-emitting crops on air quality, specifically ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, we performed a series of model runs using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) coupled with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) simulating a proposed cropland conversion to the giant cane Arundo donax for biomass production. Cultivation of A. donax in the relatively clean air of northeastern Oregon resulted in an average increase in 8 h O3 levels of 0.52 ppb, while SOA was largely unaffected (&lt;+0.01 μg m-3). Conversions in U.S. regions with reduced air quality (eastern Texas and northern Illinois) resulted in average 8 h O3 increases of 2.46 and 3.97 ppb, respectively, with daily increases up to 15 ppb in the Illinois case, and daytime SOA increases up to 0.57 μg m-3. While cultivation of isoprene-emitting bioenergy crops may be appropriate at some scales and in some regions, other areas may experience increased O 3 and SOA, highlighting the need to consider isoprene emissions when evaluating potential regional impacts of bioenergy crop production. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The environmental concerns and the European liquid (bio) fuel regulations have determined a growing demand on biofuels. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can provide clean synthetic fuels containing low concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics. While Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using natural gas and coal is a well established and commercialized process for more than 70 years, the new technology of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using biomass as feedstock is gaining more and more attention due to the possibilities of using renewable raw materials. In this work, in order to optimize the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the influence of operating conditions has been studied in a slurry reactor using a Co-based catalyst. Experiments were performed at different syngas composition (variation of H2/CO ratio) and pressure (24, 20, and 16 bar), keeping the other parameters (temperature, 230 °C; gas flow, 5 Nm3/h) constant. The effects of pressure on CO conversion, product distribution, C5+ selectivity, Par/Ole ratio, and α value were investigated, and the results were compared with data from literature. It was found that-increasing the reaction pressure-heavier hydrocarbons were formed, and CO conversion increased from 44. 2 to 63. 7 %. A slight change has been observed in the case of an α value between 0. 89 and 0. 9, C5+ selectivity between 90. 6 and 91. 7 %, and Par/Ole ratio between 11. 4 and 14. 1. An important role for the results obtained was attributed to H2/CO ratio variation during the experiments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biomass represents both the dominant source of feedstock for biotechnological processes and the renewable foreseeable sustainable source of organic fuels, chemicals, and other materials. In particular, woody biomass is one of the most efficient sources for renewable energy on a large scale. Converting biomass to fuels, pulp and paper, chemicals, power, and/or feed is essential to be analyzed in terms of economic viability, as well as environmental friendliness. The benefits of using biomass as feedstock for bioenergy may include: the reduction of the use of nonrenewable fuels, less dependence on foreign fuels, stabilization of income in rural areas, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Taking into account the current data in the literature and some Romanian practices, an analysis was developed considering woody biomass use. The paper discusses some stages of the biomass life cycle: extraction of forestry biomass-transport-biomass valorization. The way the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was further applied to assess the environmental impacts associated with the production of electricity and biofuels, starting from resource extraction until the end-of-life, is addressed. LCA has been discussed in relation to the estimation of biomass distribution on the land together with an evaluation of different chains, including harvesting, biomass transport, and final utilization through combustion and biorefining. System boundaries address cradle-to-gate, gate-to-gate and cradleto-grave approaches. The results of the analysis based on LCA allowed for the identification of some environmental indicators that make sustainability criteria measurable, and also die assessment of the potential for sustainable valorization of biomass, together with benefits and drawbacks from the economic, environmental and managerial points of view. The most relevant indicator analyzed was the climate change potential, in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It was found that woody biomass can often be associated with positive environmental impacts, since CO2 emissions have biogenic character.

AB  - The biofuels industry is rapidly growing with the goal of providing a sustainable fuel alternative to petroleum products. However, two challenges persist in limiting current biofuels technologies as a viable alternative: (1) the cost of feedstock and (2) the quality of the fuel. Metabolic engineering shows the potential to overcome these two challenges, enabling the bioconversion of cheaper feedstocks into improved fuels in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Metabolic engineering is the systematic attempt to understand, design, and engineer cellular metabolic networks using a wide range of interdisciplinary tools and strategies. It is rapidly emerging as the enabling technology behind the development of the next generation of biofuels. Several examples of current research demonstrate how metabolic engineering has begun to contribute both novel and creative solutions toward bringing promising biofuel technologies to fruition: production of higher chain alcohols, fermentation of lignocellulosic material, and production of fatty acid derivatives. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biosorption of metals by microorganisms is a promising technology to remove accumulated non-process elements in highly recycled biorefinery process water. Removal of these elements would enable greater water reuse and reduce the environmental impact of effluent discharge. A model lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery wastewater was created based on pulp mill effluent. This generated a wastewater with an environmentally realistic high loading of dissolved natural organic matter (900 mg/l), a potentially important factor influencing metal biosorption. Analysis of feedstock and pulp mill effluent indicated that Mn and Zn are likely to be problematic in highly recycled lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery process water. Therefore, the growth of several bacteria and fungi from existing collections, and some isolated from pulp mill effluent were tested in the model wastewater spiked with Mn and Zn (0.2 mM). Wastewater isolates grew the best in the wastewater. Metal uptake varied by species and was much greater for Zn than Mn. A bacterium, Novosphingobium nitrogenifigens Y88T, removed the most metal per unit biomass, 35 and 17 mg Mn/g. No other organism tested decreased the Mn concentration. A yeast, Candida tropicalis, produced the most biomass and removed the most total metal (38 % of Zn), while uptake per unit biomass was 24 mg Zn/g. These results indicate that microorganisms can remove significant amounts of metals in wastewater with high concentrations of dissolved natural organic matter. Metal sorption by autochthonous microorganisms in an anaerobic bioreactor may be able to extend water reuse and therefore lower the water consumption of future biorefineries. © Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology 2012.

AB  - Purpose The critically discussed effects on biodiversity due to the intensive cultivation of energy crops are largely lacking in the LCAs of biofuels due to basic methodological deficits. This was the starting point to develop a new methodology for impact assessment on biodiversity. The central research question to be clarified was: how can the spatial references, which are necessary for the assessment of biodiversity, be included in the usually spatially unspecific LCA. Methods Prevalent methods for both LCA and environmental planning were investigated with regard to interfaces and integration capabilities as well as differences. Drawing on this analysis a theoretical and methodological approach was developed which integrates the spatially specific procedure of environmental planning into the product-specific approach of the LCA. The available geodata and statistical data base for the assessment was examined for Germany and the method adapted to the data situation in Germany. Results and discussion The resulting methodological approach is explained and tested. It is compatible with LCA principles and leads to product-specific quantitative results. The method can be applied on a higher geographic level (Germany) but, nevertheless, makes reference to spatial characteristics of biodiversity on different scales. This is achieved by combining area specific data about biodiversity with statistical data about pressure factors on the regional level. The procedure is demonstrated by the example of bio-ethanol from wheat. An overall view of the various indicators yields a "Biodiversity profile" for the considered fuel and a specific bio-fuel target. This approach leads the way for an integration of spatial knowledge about biodiversity into the spatially non-specific LCA.

AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a fast-growing and high biomass producing plant species, which has been traditionally grown as multiple-use crop and recently considered as an energy crop. In order to screen accessions that can be cultivated in cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils for biodiesel production, the ability of Cd tolerance and bioaccumulation of 18 hemp cultivars or ecotypes were evaluated in pot experiment under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (dry weight, DW) soil condition, in terms of plant growth, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence, and Cd accumulation at 45 days after seedling emergence. Results showed that seedlings of all cultivars, except USO-31, Shenyang and Shengmu, could grow quite well under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (DW) soil condition. Among them, Yunma 1, Yunma 2, Yunma 3, Yunma 4, Qujing, Longxi, Lu'an, Xingtai, and Shuyang showed great biomass (&gt;0.5 g plant-1), high tolerance factors (68.6-92.3%), and little reduction of pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence under 25 mg Cd kg-1 (DW) soil stress, indicating these cultivars had a strong tolerance to Cd stress and could be cultivated in Cd-contaminated soils. Cultivars Longxi, Lu'an, Xingtai, Yunma 2, Yunma 3, Yunma 4, and Qujing exhibited higher Cd concentrations and total Cd in shoots. These cultivars, therefore, are good candidates for the implementation of the new strategy of cultivating biodiesel crops for phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soils. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - There is potential for algal-derived biofuel to help alleviate part of the world's dependency on petroleum based fuels. However, research must still be done on strain selection, induction of triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation, and fundamental algal metabolic studies, along with large-scale culturing techniques, harvesting, and biofuel/biomass processing. Here, we have advanced the knowledge on Scenedesmus sp. strain WC-1 by monitoring growth, pH, and TAG accumulation on a 14:10 light-dark cycle with atmospheric air or 5% CO 2 in air (v/v) aeration. Under ambient aeration, there was a loss of pH-induced TAG accumulation, presumably due to TAG consumption during the lower culture pH observed during dark hours (pH 9. 4). Under 5% CO 2 aeration, the growth rate nearly doubled from 0. 78 to 1. 53 d -1, but the pH was circumneutral (pH 6. 9) and TAG accumulation was minimal. Experiments were also performed with 5% CO 2 during the exponential growth phase, which was then switched to aeration with atmospheric air when nitrate was close to depletion. These tests were run with and without the addition of 50 mM sodium bicarbonate. Cultures without added bicarbonate showed decreased growth rates with the aeration change, but there was no immediate TAG accumulation. The cultures with bicarbonate added immediately ceased cellular replication and rapid TAG accumulation was observed, as monitored by Nile Red fluorescence which has previously been correlated by gas chromatography to cellular TAG levels. Sodium bicarbonate addition (25 mM final concentration) was also tested with the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum strain Pt-1 and this organism also accumulated TAG. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are an important alternative, renewable source of energy in the face of the ongoing depletion of fossil fuels. Cheese whey is a dairy industry waste characterized by high lactose concentration, which represents a significant environmental problem. Bio-ethanol production by cheese whey could be an effective nonvegetable source for renewable energy production. Here, we report the isolation of a mixed microbial population, able to produce ethanol as main fermentation product from fermenting whey. The microbial consortium has been used to perform a batch fermentation of crude whey in both anoxic and hypoxic conditions. Maximum ethanol concentrations achieved in this study was obtained using the mixed culture in hypoxic conditions, grown at pH 4 and 30°C, with ethanol production yield of 60 g/L. Our research has pointed out an alternative way to both dispose and valorize cheese whey, a dairy by-product that could cause water pollution and harm to the environment if not properly treated. © 2012 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The use of microalgae for biofuel production has the potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Ideal candidate species of microalgae for bio-oil production need both relatively high growth rates and lipid content. Here, we report on the effects of temperature, nutrients (N, Si), and salinity on growth rates and lipid content of the common freshwater diatom, Fragilaria capucina (Desm), isolated from western Lake Erie. At low NaCl salinity, growth rate increased rapidly from 10 to 20°C, and then further increased slowly from 20 to 30°C, with a maximum specific growth rate of 0. 61 day -1. Growth rate declined with increasing salinity (e. g., reduced by ca. 50 and 100% at 137 and 274 mmol L -1 NaCl, respectively), and increased with increased N and Si concentration until ca. 100 μmol L -1 for each (with &gt;85% of maximum growth rate at 10 μmol L -1). Lipid content (% total lipid per dry mass) in nutrient-replete cultures was 14% and (1) increased to &gt;30% at low N and, especially, low Si; (2) was lower at 30°C vs. 20 or 10°C; and (3) decreased with salinity. Thus, F. capucina accumulates lipid to high levels even under N, Si, and temperature levels that permit a high growth rate for this species, and hence, this species is a candidate for use in biofuel production. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - How and where it will be possible to produce biofuels at a scale that can compete with fossil fuels, without competing with agriculture for water, fertilizer and land, is a fundamental unanswered question. We propose that the answer could be offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae. Microalgae are the fastest growing biomass and best oil producers known; by cultivating microalgae offshore using wastewater as a source of water and nutrients in floating photobioreactors (PBRs), the system would not compete with agriculture. Furthermore, freshwater microalgae clean the wastewater, capture CO2 and, if they accidentally escape, they cannot become invasive species because they cannot thrive in seawater. The seawater supports the PBRs, controls temperature and can be used for forward osmosis to concentrate nutrients and facilitate harvesting. Algae products, wastewater treatment, carbon sequestration and compatible aquaculture support the economics of the system as a whole. The completion of a 2-year feasibility study on prototype PBRs, control systems, biofouling, wastewater treatment, life cycle analysis and energy return on investment sets the stage for future offshore studies. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present greenhouse gas study results for biofuels produced with partial qualified utilisation of pulp wood or forest residues when integrated into kraft pulp mill systems. The impact of considering biogenic carbon on the results is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: The material and energy balances of the integrated ethanol production were simulated for the study with a mill-wide simulation model. Data for the simulation were obtained from prehydrolysis and cooking experiments. The life cycle model for greenhouse gas calculation was created based on the simulation results. In this paper, the change of forest carbon stock caused by residue removal from forest soil and carbon delay of forest growth after stand felling were also taken into consideration, to discuss the true greenhouse gas emissions of forest biomass utilisation. Findings: The emission reduction levels achieved with these ethanol fuels derived from forest biomass ranged from 80 to 90 per cent when biogenic carbon emissions were neglected. Originality/value: The findings indicate that in both cases a significant percentage of the side flows containing energy can be utilised to produce excess electricity when the ethanol plant is integrated into the pulp mill. The findings also indicate that the carbon storage impact of forest biomasses affects significantly the emission values of both studied fuels and overturns the emission savings of prehydrolysed chip based ethanol. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: This article examines environmental and social sustainability of integrated seawater agriculture systems growing Salicornia bigelovii for biofuel. Case studies in Eritrea and Mexico are evaluated using Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels criteria. Results: Producer claims versus accomplishments centered on desirable environmental and socioeconomic outcomes are discussed. Operations ceased due to political instability, mismanagement and community opposition. Conclusion: Dialogue promoting sustainable biofuel suggests producers utilize marginal land; however, marginal land may contain sites of ecological or cultural significance. Implementation efforts, however well intentioned, may involve tradeoffs and political maneuvering that can derail projects. In these case studies, conflicting narratives and limited transparency further compounded technical and social complexity. Free, prior and informed consent as well as independent environmental monitoring could reduce risk of project failure. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Genes encoding the enzyme urease were integrated in a . Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum ethanologen. The engineered strain hydrolyzed urea, as evidenced by increased cellular growth and elevated final pH in urea minimal medium and urease activity in cell free extracts. Interestingly, replacement of ammonium salts with urea resulted in production of 54 g/L ethanol, one of the highest titers reported for . Thermoanaerobacterium. The observed increase in ethanol titer may result from reduced pH, salt, and osmolality stresses during fermentation. Urea utilization is attractive for industrial scale fermentation, where pH control is technically challenging and increased ethanol titer is desirable. © 2012.

AB  - Short rotation coppice (SRC) willow is currently emerging as an important dedicated lignocellulosic energy crop in the UK. However, investigation into the variation between species and genotypes in their suitability for liquid transport biofuel processing has been limited. To address this, four traits relevant to biofuel processing (composition, enzymatic saccharification, response to pretreatment and projected ethanol yields) were studied in 35 genotypes of willow including Europe's leading SRC willow cultivars. Large, genotype-specific variation was observed for all four traits. Significant positive correlations were identified between the accessibility of glucan to enzymatic saccharification before and after pretreatment as well as glucose release and xylose release via acid hydrolysis during pretreatment. Of particular interest is that the lignin content of the biomass did not correlate with accessibility of glucan to enzymatic saccharification. The genotype-specific variations identified have implications for SRC willow breeding and for potential reductions in both the net energy expenditure and environmental impact of the lignocellulosic biofuel process chain. The large range of projected ethanol yields demonstrate the importance of feedstock selection based on an ideotype encompassing the performance of both field biomass growth and ease of conversion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: When fossil fuels on the Earth are used up, which kind of green energy can be used to replace them? Do every bioenergy generation or crop food chain results in environmental pollution? These questions are major concerns in a world facing restricted supplies of energy and food as well as environmental pollutions. To alleviate these issues, option biogases are explored in this paper. Materials and methods: Two types of biogas generators were used for modifying the traditional crop food chain [viz. from atmospheric CO2 photosynthesis to crops, crop stem/husk biowastes (burnt in cropland or as home fuels), to livestock droppings (dumping away), pork and people foods, then to CO2], via turning the biowaste pollutants into green bioenergies. By analyzing the traditional food chain via observation method, the drawbacks of by-product biowastes were revealed. Also, the whole cycle chain was further analyzed to assess its "greenness," using experimental data and other information, such as the material balance (e. g., the absorbed CO2, investment versus generated food, energy, and wastes). Results and discussion: The data show that by using the two types of biogas generators, clean renewable bioenergy, crop food, and livestock meat could be continuously produced without creating any waste to the world. The modification chain largely reduced CO2 greenhouse gas and had a low-cost investment. The raw materials for the gas generators were only the wastes of crop stems and livestock droppings. Thus, the recommended CO2 bioenergy cycle chain via the modification also greatly solved the environmental biowaste pollutions in the world. Conclusions: The described two type biogases effectively addressed the issues on energy, food, and environmental pollution. The green renewable bioenergy from the food cycle chain may be one of suitable alternatives to fossil and tree fuels for agricultural countries. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Mass culture of microalgae is a potential alternative to cultivation of terrestrial crops for bioenergy production. However, microalgae require nitrogen fertiliser in quantities much higher than plants, and this has important consequences for the energy balance of these systems. The effect of nitrogen fertiliser supplied to microalgal bubble-column photobioreactor cultures was investigated using different nitrogen sources (nitrate, urea, ammonium) and culture conditions (air, 12% CO 2). In 20 L cultivations, maximum biomass productivity for Chlorella vulgaris cultivated using nitrate and urea was 0. 046 and 0. 053 g L -1 day -1, respectively. Maximum biomass productivity for Dunaliella tertiolecta cultivated using nitrate, urea and ammonium was 0.033, 0.038 and 0. 038 g L -1 day -1, respectively. In intensive bubble-column photobioreactors using 12% CO 2, maximum productivity reached 0. 60 and 0. 83 g L -1 day -1 for C. vulgaris and D. tertiolecta, respectively. Recycling of nitrogen within the photobioreactor system via algal exudation of nitrogenous compounds and bacterial activity was identified as a potentially important process. The energetic penalty incurred by supply of artificial nitrogen fertilisers, phosphorus, power and CO 2 to microalgal photobioreactors was investigated, although analysis of all energy burdens from biomass production to usable energy carriers was not conducted. After subtraction of the power, nitrogen and phosphorus energy burdens, maximum net energy ratios for C. vulgaris and D. tertiolecta cultivated in bubble columns were 1. 82 and 2. 10. Assuming CO 2 was also required from a manufactured source, the net energy ratio decreased to 0. 09 and 0. 11 for C. vulgaris and D. tertiolecta, so that biomass production in this scenario was unsustainable. Although supply of nitrogen is unlikely to be the most energetically costly factor in sparged photobioreactor designs, it is still a very significant penalty. There is a need to optimise both cultivation strategies and recycling of nitrogen in order to improve performance. Data are supported by measurements including biochemical properties (lipid, protein, heating value) and bacterial number by epifluorescence microscopy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - After substantial global investments into biofuel production from 2005 to 2008, challenges to a sustainable and robust biofuel industry have become more apparent than many proponents have anticipated. Across country and development contexts, conflicts arose as plans to scale up production clashed with local preferences or national policies, and Southern Africa has been no exception. This article analyzes recent difficulties with biofuels projects in Tanzania before the background of the more successful experiences of Brazil and South Africa. We identify areas of incompatibility between local expectations, government policy, and investor incentives. An assessment of different biofuels business models shows that some-such as contract farming-may not be appropriate for Tanzania's situation and that policies are necessary that can address the needs of both local and regional stakeholders and provide adequate incentives for investors to pursue sustainable biofuels production. © 2012 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Changing demands for food and biofuel have reshaped global agricultural outlooks and pushed production in areas long considered too marginal for the widespread production of agricultural commodities. Perhaps no region has drawn more attention to the environmental impacts of expanding agricultural production than the Amazon. Considerations of indirect land use change have brought a new dimension to discussions related to the impacts of agriculture on the region's forest cover. In this article, I provide a location-based conceptualization of indirect land use change that brings to light the intra-regional movement of capital and skills between the cattle and agriculture sectors. The article suggests that amid rapid increases in rents for soy production and land prices, ranchers face strong incentives to relocate their operations to forest regions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Declining fossil fuels reserves, a need for increased energy security and concerns over carbon emissions from fossil fuel use are the global drivers for alternative, renewable, biosources of fuels and chemicals. In the present study the identification of long chain (C 29-C 33) saturated hydrocarbons from Nicotiana glauca leaves is reported. The occurrence of these hydrocarbons was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identification confirmed by comparison of physico-chemical properties displayed by the authentic standards available. A simple, robust procedure was developed to enable the generation of an extract containing a high percentage of hydrocarbons (6.3% by weight of dried leaf material) higher than previous reports in other higher plant species consequently, it is concluded that N. glauca could be a crop of greater importance than previously recognised for biofuel production. The plant can be grown on marginal lands, negating the need to compete with food crops or farmland, and the hydrocarbon extract can be produced in a non-invasive manner, leaving remaining biomass intact for bioethanol production and the generation of valuable co-products. © 2012 Phytochemical Society of Europe.

AB  - Agricultural bioenergy production is subject to dynamics such as yield fluctuations, volatile prices, resource competition, new regulation and policy, innovation and climate change. This raises questions, to what extent bioenergy production is able to adapt to changes and overcome critical events. These dynamics have important implications for effective policy development. Using a case study method, which draws on various data sources, we investigate in detail how agricultural bioenergy sectors in the German State of Brandenburg adapted to diverse past events. The case analysis rests on the adaptive-cycle concept and the system properties potential, connectedness and resilience as defined by Holling and Gunderson (2002a). Our case study concludes that Brandenburg's biogas sector has a low potential and connectedness within the system, and a low resilience against crop failures. The biofuels sector displays similar properties in the short term. In the medium term the potential could increase in both sectors. The properties imply risks and opportunities for biogas production and the possibility to develop towards a stage with a higher potential and a higher connectedness. But adaptive capacity is limited and there are certain barriers for the agricultural bioenergy sectors to overcome potentially critical states. Policy needs to be tailored accordingly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents a linear profit model with combined economic and environmental factors for a switchgrass-for-biofuels agricultural system in the southeastern U.S. The objectives are to establish conversion-to-switchgrass thresholds for various market prices and identify policy incentives that would ensure economic profit while also maximizing environmental benefits (carbon sequestration, displacement of fossil fuels) and minimizing negative impacts (global warming potential, nitrate loss). Weighting factors are chosen to represent incentives and penalties by assigning value to the impacts. With no other incentives, switchgrass market prices of at least $51 and $58/dton would be needed in order to make a profitable switch from corn/Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and cotton, respectively. At a mid-range offering of $50/dton, feasible carbon credit prices of $3/ $8/ $23 per metric tonne CO 2e would incentivize conversion from corn, CRP, or cotton, respectively. Similarly, a water quality penalty of $0.20/ $3/ $2 per kilogram NO 3-N leached would incentivize the same conversions with resultant watershed improvement. At a lower price of $30/dton switchgrass, incentives based on valuation of ecosystem services begin to exceed feasible ranges of these valuations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The well-to-wheel (WtW) results of biomass-based chains are found to be significantly sensitive to changes in the elements of the chain model such as the land use change. Our new standardization model is based on the conviction that the synthesis of a statistical aggregate of the possibilities that are defined by the major models in the field including GREET and GEMIS would build reliability into the result by buffering against the changes in the elements of the chain model. In this paper we assess a chosen set of biomass-based chains in terms of energy and GHG emissions using the innovative concept of the standardization transport model (STM). Hydrogen was found to be very attractive with the use of waste wood. On the other hand, sugar ethanol was found to be a promising fuel for the reduction of GHG emissions. Unfavorable land use changes and high fertilizers use should be avoided to maximize confidence in significant reductions from sugar ethanol. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the biofuel industry diverts a large amount of agricultural crops as energy feedstocks, and in turn affects farm land allocation, feedstock market equilibrium, and agricultural economic development in local areas. In this paper, we propose game-theoretic models that incorporate farmers' decisions on land use and market choice into the biofuel manufacturers' supply chain design problem. A noncooperative bi-level Stackelberg leader-follower game model and a cooperative game model are developed respectively to address possible business partnership scenarios between feedstock suppliers and biofuel manufacturers. The models determine the optimal number and locations of biorefineries, the required prices for these refineries to compete for feedstock resources, as well as farmers' land use choices between food and energy. Using corn as an example of feedstock crops, spatial market equilibrium is utilized to model the relationship between corn supply and demand, and the associated price variations in local grain markets. With linear corn demand functions, we develop a solution approach that transforms the original discrete mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPEC) into to a solvable mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The proposed methodology is illustrated using an empirical case study of the Illinois State. The computation results reveal interesting insights into optimal land use strategies and supply chain design for the emerging "biofuel economy". © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A recent life cycle assessment (LCA) reported that biodiesel production in supercritical alcohols (SCA) produces a higher environmental load than the homogeneous catalytic process because an enormous amount of energy is required to recover excess alcohol. However, the excess alcohol could be dramatically reduced by increasing the operating temperature to 400. °C; although the product would have to be considered as an alternative biofuel instead of biodiesel. A comparative LCA of the biodiesel production in two SCA at 300. °C (C-SCA) and novel biofuel production in the same two SCA at 400. °C (N-SCA) is presented. It was clear that the N-SCA process produces a dramatically reduced environmental load over that of the C-SCA process due to a lower amount of excess alcohol being used. The N-SCA process could be improved in terms of its environmental impact by changing from fossil fuel to biomass-based fuels for the steam generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study aimed at the identification of favourable land use options for semi-natural grassland management and preservation. Economic assessments of energy recovery by the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) in comparison with dry fermentation (DF) and hay combustion systems (HC), beef cattle production (BC) and non-refining landscape preservation measures, such as mulching (MU) and composting (CO), were carried out in this study. Energy recovery systems made profitable use of semi-natural grasslands with the highest economic returns attained by IFBB-AO (Return On Investment, ROI: 22.75%) and HC (ROI: 22.00%) systems, followed by the IFBB-SA (ROI: 7.71%) and the DF system (ROI: 6.22%). Animal husbandry (BC) and non-refining management systems (MU, CO) were not profitable considering the current framework conditions. Input parameters critical for profitability were modified in order to identify influences of changing framework conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and palm tree (Elaeis guianeensis) are crops with high biofuel yields, 7.6 m 3 ha -1 y -1 of ethanol and 4 Mg ha -1 y -1 of oil, respectively. The joint production of these crops enhances the sustainability of ethanol. The objective of this work was comparing a traditional sugarcane ethanol production system (TSES) with a joint production system (JSEB), in which ethanol and biodiesel are produced at the same biorefinery but only ethanol is traded. The comparison is based on ISO 14.040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006, and appropriate indicators. Production systems in Cerrado (typical savannah), Cerradão (woody savannah) and pastureland ecosystems were considered. Energy and carbon balances, and land use change impacts were evaluated. The joint system includes 100% substitution of biodiesel for diesel, which is all consumed in different cropping stages. Data were collected by direct field observation methods, and questionnaires applied to Brazilian facilities. Three sugarcane mills situated in São Paulo State and one palm oil refinery located in Para State were surveyed. The information was supplemented by secondary sources. Results demonstrated that fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions decreased, whereas energy efficiency increased when JSEB was compared to TSES. In comparison with TSES, the energy balance of JSEB was 1.7 greater. In addition, JSEB released 23% fewer GHG emissions than TSES. The ecosystem carbon payback time for Cerrado, Cerradão, and Degraded Grassland of JSEB was respectively 4, 7.7 and -7.6 years. These are typical land use types of the Brazilian Cerrado region for which JSEB was conceived. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The impact of storage dry matter (DM) losses on the profitability of producing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is poorly understood. This article evaluates net returns to storage considering DM losses using data from a 500-day experiment at Milan, TN. Switchgrass was harvested in large round and large rectangular bales wrapped with twine and stored outdoors with and without a tarp on grass, gravel, and pallet surfaces. Comparative breakeven analysis incorporating DM loss estimates from the experiment determined optimal harvest and storage strategies. Bale shape and choice of cover most impacted DM losses, which increased at a decreasing rate with time in storage. Even though covered rectangular bales had higher DM losses than uncovered round bales, they were more profitable for a wide range of switchgrass price and storage period combinations because of lower overall harvest, storage and transportation costs Mg -1. Uncovered round bales were only more profitable than covered rectangular bales for high price and long storage period combinations. Covered round bales were not profitable for any price and storage period combination evaluated in the analysis. The use of a cover is generally worth the added cost for rectangular bales but not for round bales. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid emergence of the European Union (EU) as a leader in global environmental politics has led many scholars to argue in favour of the EU being a 'normative power' in international relations. This paper critically examines the EU's biofuels policy and evaluates whether its attempts to lead by example and shape international practice in this field could support such arguments. Europe's biofuel policies are evaluated through a sustainable development lens, so as to determine the extent to which it has embraced a holistic approach to sustainability. While not dismissing that the identity of the EU is indeed an explanatory factor and that normative intentions may well be regarded as a motivating force, this study argues that an interest-based perspective on international environmental regulation offers a supplementary view of how an actor's preferences for an international regime are shaped. By erecting barriers aimed at shielding its own inefficient domestic biofuels production the EU is in essence placing trade competitiveness and economic growth above environmental protection, thus permitting sustainability concerns to be addressed only in part. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this survey study is to investigate the level of awareness and prevailing attitudes of schoolstudents toward renewable energy (RE) in a country which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels despite having high RE resources. The importance of this study stems from the need to better understand the role of education in cultivating awareness of RE, which is necessary for the students to become future responsible energy consumers. To that end, we developed a suitable questionnaire. In total, 617 respondents from both rural and urban areas filled in the questionnaire. Our results indicate that students have limited ability to distinguish renewable from non-renewable energy sources despite many respondents being aquatinted with the common RE sources like solar and wind. Furthermore, over 50% of students are unaware of biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol. Nevertheless, 87% of students consider RE to be a viable future energy option, and generally exhibit a positive attitude and willingness to adopt RE even at high prices. Overall, young females appear to be more acquainted with RE than young males. Likewise, students studying in urban areas are more aware of RE and more strongly support their adoption, in comparison to rural students, who show a preference for nuclear energy. This study highlights the importance of implementing RE education as early as possible to encourage RE development, which is necessary to alleviate the risk from fossil fuel-related environmental problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Continuing interest in sustainable biofuel production is linked with sustainable farming and begs for insights from farming systems research on sustainability assessment and the role of family farms. The aims of this work were two-fold. First, to present a tools and methods selection framework supporting indicator-based sustainability assessment. Second, to apply the framework to the case of castor beans (Ricinus communis L.), family farmers and the biodiesel industry in the southeast of Brazil. The framework synthesizes existing work on sustainability assessment within the agricultural domain. Transparent selection of tools and methods is supported by sequentially accounting for the context of sustainability, dealing with space, classifying the 'nature of research' and the degree of integration of different facets of sustainability. The framework is demonstrated with an exploratory assessment of the potential for castor bean cultivation within the current farm type of extensive pasture and fodder crops for dairy cattle. The study accounted for the range of productivity levels within the current farm type and for different management decisions when including castor beans. Assessment was made against economic development, livelihood stability and soil fertility criteria. Selected tools and methods included farm surveys, alternative farming system design and input-output calculations. The results demonstrate the greatest opportunity for castor bean cultivation by currently low productive farms. There is a trade-off of income derived from milk production that is supported by fodder production, and income from castor beans. Decisions regarding areal extent of castor beans and supplementing animal feed, are shown to be farm-specific, and depend upon the interactions between current farm productivity and prioritisation of sustainability criteria. However, generally it is shown that castor bean cultivation should be linked to animal production so that current risk management and income levels can be supported and improved. Further, to maintain soil fertility, castor bean cultivation with nitrogen inputs is necessary. The cyclic nature of the framework supports the next contextualisation of the sustainability question. For our application, constructive future work in a next cycle could include extending to regional level and accounting for temporal variability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The immediate effects of prescribed burning, shrub clearing and shrub mastication on runoff, infiltration and erosion were evaluated in two contrasting shrubland areas in northern Spain. Rainfall simulations (67 mm h -1 for 30 min) were conducted immediately after fuel reduction treatments in each runoff plot. Compared to shrub mastication and shrub clearing, prescribed burning generated the lowest infiltration rate and highest runoff and erosion rates at both study sites. However, sediment yields measured immediately after treatments were low in all cases, from 0.31 to 2.22 g m -2 after shrub clearing, 0.40-1.63 g m -2 after shrub mastication and 2.30-8.11 g m -2 after prescribed burning. Slope, type of fuel reduction treatment and the depth and cover of the soil organic layer remaining after treatment were the most important variables determining runoff and erosion during the first rainfall event following treatment. In the rainfall simulation plots subjected to prescribed burning, the maximum temperatures reached at the organic layer/mineral soil interface during burning also had a significant effect on soil loss. The findings show that good fuel management prescriptions make fire hazard reduction and soil conservation compatible in cases where the remaining soil cover is about 70%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermophilic microorganisms capable of using complex substrates offer special advantages for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and bioproducts. Members of the Gram-positive bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor are anaerobic thermophiles with optimum growth temperatures between 65°C and 78°C and are the most thermophilic cellulolytic organisms known. In fact, they efficiently use biomass non-pretreated as their sole carbon source and in successive rounds of application digest 70% of total switchgrass substrate. The ability to genetically manipulate these organisms is a prerequisite to engineering them for use in conversion of these complex substrates to products of interest as well as identifying gene products critical for their ability to utilize non-pretreated biomass. Here, we report the first example of DNA transformation of a member of this genus, C. bescii. We show that restriction of DNA is a major barrier to transformation (in this case apparently absolute) and that methylation with an endogenous unique α-class N4-Cytosine methyltransferase is required for transformation of DNA isolated from E. coli. The use of modified DNA leads to the development of an efficient and reproducible method for DNA transformation and the combined frequencies of transformation and recombination allow marker replacement between non-replicating plasmids and chromosomal genes providing the basis for rapid and efficient methods of genetic manipulation. © 2012 Chung et al.

AB  - While agricultural residue is considered as a near-term feedstock option for cellulosic biofuels, its sustainability must be evaluated by taking water into account. This study aims to analyze the county-level water footprint for four biofuel pathways in the United States, including bioethanol generated from corn grain, stover, wheat straw, and biodiesel from soybean. The county-level blue water footprint of ethanol from corn grain, stover, and wheat straw shows extremely wide variances with a national average of 31, 132, and 139 L of water per liter biofuel (Lw/Lbf), and standard deviation of 133, 323, and 297 Lw/Lbf, respectively. Soybean biodiesel production results in a blue water footprint of 313 Lw/Lbf on the national average with standard deviation of 894 Lw/L bf. All biofuels show a greater green water footprint than the blue one. This work elucidates how diverse spatial resolutions affect biofuel water footprints, which can provide detailed insights into biofuels' implications on local water sustainability. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A recent U.S. Department of Energy study estimated that more than one billion tons of biofuel feedstock could be produced by 2030 in the United States from increased corn yield, and changes in agricultural and forest residue management and land uses. To understand the implications of such increased production on water resources and stream quality at regional and local scales, we have applied a watershed model for the Upper Mississippi River Basin, where most of the current and future crop/residue-based biofuel production is expected. The model simulates changes in water quality (soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings in streams) and resources (soil-water content, evapotranspiration, and runoff) under projected biofuel production versus the 2006 baseline year and a business-as-usual scenario. The basin average results suggest that the projected feedstock production could change the rate of evapotranspiration in the UMRB by approximately +2%, soil-water content by about -2%, and discharge to streams by -5% from the baseline scenario. However, unlike the impacts on regional water availability, the projected feedstock production has a mixed effect on water quality, resulting in 12% and 45% increases in annual suspended sediment and total phosphorus loadings, respectively, but a 3% decrease in total nitrogen loading. These differences in water quantity and quality are statistically significant (p < 0.05). The basin responses are further analyzed at monthly time steps and finer spatial scales to evaluate underlying physical processes, which would be essential for future optimization of environmentally sustainable biofuel productions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper analyses the potential conflict between resilience of the Earth system and global freshwater requirements for the dual task of carbon sequestration to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, and food production to feed humanity by 2050. It makes an attempt to assess the order of magnitude of the increased consumptive water use involved and analyses the implications as seen from two parallel perspectives; the global perspective of human development within a "safe operating space" with regard to the definition of the Planetary Boundary for freshwater; and the social-ecological implications at the regional river basin scale in terms of sharpening water shortages and threats to aquatic ecosystems. The paper shows that the consumptive water use involved in the dual task would both transgress the proposed planetary boundary range for global consumptive freshwater use and would further exacerbate already severe river depletion, causing societal problems related to water shortage and water allocation. Thus, strategies to rely on sequestration of CO2 as a mitigation strategy must recognize the high freshwater costs involved, implying that the key climate mitigation strategy must be to reduce emissions. The paper finally highlights the need to analyze both water and carbon tradeoffs from anticipated large scale biofuel production climate change mitigation strategy, to reveal gains and impact of this in contrast to carbon sequestration strategies. © 2012.

AB  - Background: Because many Miscanthus genotypes can be cultivated with relatively high productivity and carbohydrate content, Miscanthus has great potential as an energy crop that can support large scale biological production of biofuels. Results: In this study, batch hydrothermal pretreatment at 180°C for 35min followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was shown to give the highest total sugar yields for Miscanthus x giganteus cv. Illinois planted in Illinois. High throughput pretreatment at 180°C for 35min and 17.5min followed by co-hydrolysis in a multi-well batch reactor identified two varieties out of 80 that had significantly higher sugar yields from pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis than others. The differences in performance were then related to compositions of the 80 varieties to provide insights into desirable traits for Miscanthus that enhance sugar yields. Conclusions: High throughput pretreatment and co-hydrolysis (HTPH) rapidly identified promising genotypes from a wide range of Miscanthus genotypes, including hybrids of Miscanthus sacchariflorus/M. sinensis and Miscanthus lutarioriparius, differentiating the more commercially promising species from the rest. The total glucan plus xylan content in Miscanthus appeared to influence both mass and theoretical yields, while lignin and ash contents did not have a predictable influence on performance. © 2012 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Cereals are a large source of biopolymers, where mainly the starch is used for food and feed. A rapidly growing cereal application is the production of biofuel, mainly produced from corn in the US. The starch is fermented to ethanol leaving spent grain rich in cereal proteins as a by-product. The corn protein zein is currently extracted on a large scale and used in, for example, material applications. Similarly, pennisetin can be extracted from pearl millet, a crop critical for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The formation of viscoelastic melts is crucial for (bio)plastics production and the viscoelasticity, microstructure, and molecular properties of zein and pennisetin melts were determined here. The proteins were mixed with plasticizers (polyethyleneglycol or glycerol/citric acid) to form melts. The melts displayed a phase separated microstructure with protein-rich and plasticizer-rich regions with distinctly separate T gs. The pennisetin melts formed cross-links at temperatures above 60°C, which could be related to the high content of cysteine and methionine, as compared to zein. As a consequence, pennisetin melts showed a more thermocomplex behavior than zein melts. For zein melts, the mixture of glycerol and citric acid interacted with protein in addition to being a plasticizer causing a high-molecular weight shoulder in the molecular weight distribution. The study showed that, although both zein and pennisetin form viscoelastic melts, the choice of plasticizer strongly affects both melt structure and physical properties. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Evaluation of indirect land-use changes due to biofuels has been very controversial over the past few years, as doubts have arisen about the environmental benefits of growing crops for use as a substitute for fossil fuels. This paper presents an overview of the MIRAGE-BioF CGE modeling approach to biofuel policies assessment. Our framework introduces new innovative features that strengthen the relevance of the methodology. In particular, a more detailed and consistent database has been developed to represent the sectors and substitution mechanisms at play. Moreover, the model used has been improved in several important ways to better reproduce the agricultural supply function and land-use change. However, we also emphasize the critical uncertainties that prevent us from being able to provide a precise two-digit figure on the extent of land-use change and associated emissions. We illustrate these efforts with the case of EU biofuel mandates implications. We show that emissions from the current national targets in the EU could lead to an indirect effect of land-use expansion ranging from 1 ha per TJ consumed to 12 ha per TJ with a median value of 3.4 ha per TJ. The associated emissions in a 20-year period would range from 10 gCO2/MJ to 115 gCO2/MJ, with a median value of 38 gCO2/MJ. These results seriously question the sustainability of the current EU biofuels policy and emphasize the even more dramatic effect of a biodiesel-oriented EU biofuel program, which was found to emit two times more than an EU ethanol-oriented program. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Even with a normalized and standardized biofuel shock, the wide range of land-use change estimates and their associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have raised concern on the adequacy of existing agricultural models in this new area of analysis. In particular, reducing bias and improving precision of impact estimates are of primary concern to policy makers. This paper provides a detailed overview of the FAPRI-CARD agricultural modeling system, with particular emphasis on the modifications recently introduced to reduce bias in the results. We illustrate the impact of these new model features using the example of the new yield specification that now includes updated trend parameter, intensification and extensification effects, and a spatially disaggregated Brazil specification. The paper also provides a taxonomy of the many types of uncertainty surrounding any analysis, including parameter-coefficient uncertainty and exogenous variable uncertainty, identifying where specific types of uncertainty originate, and how they interact. Finally, FAPRI-CARD's long experience in using stochastic analysis is presented as a viable approach in addressing uncertainty in the analysis of changes in the agricultural sector, associated land-use change, and impacts on GHG emissions. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Biofuels production has increased rapidly in recent years due to higher petroleum prices as well as heightened concerns regarding climate change and energy security. However, because commercially viable biofuels are currently produced primarily from agricultural feedstocks, higher production volumes increase pressure on land resources. Thus, large-scale biofuels production has important implications for the forest and agriculture sectors, land use, trade, and net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Competition for land is expected to continue growing in the future as mandated biofuels volumes increase along with rising demand for food, feed, and fiber, both domestically and internationally. In response to heightened concern regarding impacts such as indirect land-use change and higher food prices, the U.S. policy is focusing on second-generation (cellulosic) feedstocks to contribute the majority of the mandated increase in biofuels volume through 2022. However, there has been little work exploring the logistics of supplying these feedstocks or examining feedstock mix and net GHG effects of combining renewable fuels mandates with climate policy. In this paper, we apply the recently updated Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with GHGs (FASOMGHG) to explore the implications of alternative assumptions regarding feedstock storage costs and carbon price for renewable energy production mix, land use, and net GHG emissions. The model is used to quantify the magnitude and regional distribution of changes in the optimal mix of bioenergy feedstocks when accounting for storage costs. In addition, we find that combining the biofuels volume mandate with a carbon price policy has additional implications for feedstock mix and provides a substantially larger net reduction in GHG than a renewable fuels mandate alone. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The emergence of biofuels as an agricultural commodity has integrated the agricultural, energy and livestock sectors and expanded the scope of models being used to analyze the effects of energy policies. It has increased the importance of incorporating spatial heterogeneity in land availability and productivity and information about the biophysical and economic determinants of land use change at multiple spatial scales. Since biofuels affect food and fuel prices, they have expanded the boundaries of economic models to consider not only their direct but also their indirect effects on land use and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper describes the demand-side and supply-side determinants of these direct and indirect changes in land use and greenhouse gas emissions with biofuels. We discuss the major modeling approaches used to analyze these effects, their strengths, limitations and key findings and directions for future research. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This paper reviews an analysis of land use change impacts of expanded biofuel production with GTAP-BIO computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. It describes the treatment of energy substitution, the role of biofuel by-products, specification of bilateral trade, the determination of land cover changes in response to increased biofuel feedstock production, and changes in crop yields-both at the intensive and extensive margins. The paper responds to some of the criticisms of GTAP-BIO and provides insights into the sensitivity of land use change and GHG emissions to changes in key parameters and assumptions. In particular, it considers an alternative specification of acreage response that takes into account the degree of land heterogeneity within agro-ecological zone (AEZ) for different AEZs and countries. The paper concludes with the discussion of alternative specifications of land mobility across uses employed in CGE models and the agenda for further research to narrow parametric and structural uncertainty to improve the model's performance. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This paper examines the changes in land use in the U.S. likely to be induced by biofuel and climate policies and the implications of these policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the 2007-2022 period. The policies considered here include a modified Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by itself as well as combined with a cellulosic biofuel tax credit or a carbon price policy. We use a dynamic, spatial, multi-market equilibrium model, Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM), to endogenously determine the effects of these policies on cropland allocation, food and fuel prices, and the mix of first-And second-generation biofuels. We find that the RFS could be met by diverting 6% of cropland for biofuel production and would result in corn prices increasing by 16% in 2002 relative to the business-As-usual baseline. The reduction in GHG emissions in the U.S. due to the RFS is about 2%; these domestic GHG savings can be severely eroded by emissions due to indirect land-use changes and the increase in gasoline consumption in the rest of the world. Supplementing the RFS with a carbon price policy or a cellulosic biofuel tax credit induces a switch away from corn ethanol to cellulosic biofuels and achieves the mandated level of biofuel production with a smaller adverse impact on crop prices. These supplementary policies enhance the GHG savings achieved by the RFS alone, although through different mechanisms; greater production of cellulosic biofuels with the tax credit but larger reduction in fossil fuel consumption with a carbon tax. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Aviation biofuel mainly consists of straight chain paraffin with chain length from 8 to 16 carbon atoms, which has better low temperature engine startup performance and higher lubricity than traditional aviation kerosene. The production techniques for the aviation biofuel have been analyzed, including Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrodeoxygenation, fast pyrolysis and biochemical conversion. The choice of the appropriate catalysts is a key for the manufacture of biofuel by the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or the hydrodeoxygenation process. When different catalysts and operation conditions are employed, synthesized products are different. Co-based and Fe-based catalysts are the main catalysts used in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process and Ni-based catalysts are the main catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation process due to their high activities. The unstable feedstock and high production cost are primary problems hindering the biofuel industrialization.

AB  - Extremely thermophilic bacteria of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor utilize carbohydrate components of plant cell walls, including cellulose and hemicellulose, facilitated by a diverse set of glycoside hydrolases (GHs). From a biofuel perspective, this capability is crucial for deconstruction of plant biomass into fermentable sugars. While all species from the genus grow on xylan and acidpretreated switchgrass, growth on crystalline cellulose is variable. The basis for this variability was examined using microbiological, genomic, and proteomic analyses of eight globally diverse Caldicellulosiruptor species. The open Caldicellulosiruptor pangenome (4,009 open reading frames [ORFs]) encodes 106 GHs, representing 43 GH families, but only 26 GHs from 17 families are included in the core (noncellulosic) genome (1,543 ORFs). Differentiating the strongly cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species from the others is a specific genomic locus that encodes multidomain cellulases from GH families 9 and 48, which are associated with cellulose-binding modules. This locus also encodes a novel adhesin associated with type IV pili, which was identified in the exoproteome bound to crystalline cellulose. Taking into account the core genomes, pangenomes, and individual genomes, the ancestral Caldicellulosiruptor was likely cellulolytic and evolved, in some cases, into species that lost the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose while maintaining the capacity to hydrolyze amorphous cellulose and hemicellulose. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Although there is continuing debate surrounding biofuel cultivation (especially in developing nations) in relation to issues of exploitation, land grabbing, poverty alleviation and energy security, there is a lack of empirical evidence to assess how these debates are playing out in practice on the ground. Drawing on political ecology discourse, this paper examines case studies of biofuel production in Zambia and the effects they have on environmental and social sustainability. During April and May 2011, data were collected on two case study projects involving Jatrophacurcas feedstock cultivation in Zambia. Semi-structured interviews were used to ascertain views from affected stakeholders (local farmers, local environmental, social, and agronomic experts, and investors) on the biofuel projects and their environmental and social impacts. The findings suggest that the uneven distribution of costs and benefits are brought about by imbalances in knowledge, access to resources and the allocation of social and political influence (often associated with broader discourses of development), and this provides a likely rationale for a lack of sustainability in biofuel projects. Drawing on these viewpoints, as well as on field observations, this paper outlines the barriers and opportunities linked to Jatrophacurcas project sustainability. © 2012 United Nations.

AB  - Concerns over energy security and climate change stimulate developments towards renewable energy. Transport is expected to switch from fossil fuel use to the use of fuel mixtures with a larger fraction of biofuels, e.g. bio-ethanol and biodiesel. Growing biomass for biofuels requires water, a scarce resource. Existing scenarios on freshwater use usually consider changes in food and livestock production, and industrial and domestic activities. This research assesses global water use changes related to increasing biofuel use for road transport in 2030 and evaluates the potential contribution to water scarcity. To investigate water demand changes related to a transition to biofuels in road transport, the study combines data from water footprint (WF) analyses with information from the IEA APS energy scenario for 2030. It includes first-generation biofuels, bio-ethanol from sugar cane, sugar beet, sweet sorghum, wheat and maize, and biodiesel from soybean, rapeseed, jatropha and oil palm. Under the IEA APS scenario, the global biofuel WF will increase more than tenfold in the period 2005-2030. The USA, China and Brazil together will contribute half of the global biofuel WF. In many countries, blue biofuel WFs significantly contribute to blue water scarcity. The research provides a first exploration of the potential contribution of transport biofuel use to blue water scarcity. In 2030, the global blue biofuel WF might have grown to 5.5% of the totally available blue water for humans, causing extra pressure on fresh water resources. When biofuel use continues to expand after 2030, countries should therefore consider the water factor when investigating the extent to which biofuels can satisfy future transport energy demand. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of different pretreatment technologies, including sulfuric acid, hot-water, NaOH, and MgCl2 pretreatments, on the fermentation of xylose and glucose to ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 24858 and Escherichia coli KO11 were investigated. In this study, cattail was used as the feedstock. The use of aquatic plant cattails to produce biofuel will add value to land and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by replacing petroleum products. The pretreated biomass first was enzymatically hydrolyzed for 2 days, followed by a 2-day Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) using S. cerevisiae. The glucose to ethanol yields were approximately 85 to 91% of the theoretical yield for this S. cerevisiae strain. Glucose and xylose released from cattail cellulose and hemicellulose could be fermented to ethanol using E. coli KO11, resulting in approximately 85% of the theoretical ethanol yield using either a Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF) process or a SSF process. In order to improve the sugars to ethanol yields, a detoxification process is necessary to remove the inhibitory compounds produced during the acid pretreatment process. Among the four pretreatment methods, the dilute acid pretreatment was found to be superior, and additional research is required to optimize the economics of the overall biorefinery process.

AB  - If tacit ethical ideals shape policy and practice, even when practitioners are not fully aware of underlying philosophical assumptions, then philosophical frameworks that support diagnostic, evaluative, and adaptive capacity in the sphere of action are critical to sustainability. Thompson's agrarian-influenced sustainability framework substantially advances beyond the prevailing triple bottom line approach, as experimental evaluation of biofuels sustainability illustrates. By suggesting that governance of complex social-natural systems lies at the core of contemporary sustainability challenges, Thompson illuminates the critical importance of social capacity for deliberation and choice-a powerful and somewhat unexpected theme requiring more development by philosophers and practitioners alike going forward. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - While much literature exists on the ecology and ecosystem impacts of signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852), as an invasive species, little information exists on the ecology of this species in its native range in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Signal crayfish (P. leniusculus leniusculus) were collected from the Umatilla River in northeastern Oregon, USA, where they are native. Collecting occurred during the summer at 13 sites spanning the longitudinal gradient of the river to examine the relationship between density and size of individuals and environmental factors at two spatial scales. At the reach scale (100+ m 2) the density of young-of-year (YOY), and age 1+ female and male crayfish was positively associated with substrate size. Additionally, age 1+ female and male crayfish density was negatively associated with the amount of crop agriculture. Substrate size was also important in determining the density and size of crayfish at the microhabitat scale (&lt;1 m 2) with greater densities and larger size (for age 1+ females and males) with larger substrate. Other factors influencing density at the microhabitat scale included Froude number for YOY and age 1+ females with higher densities at lower Froude numbers (indicative of tranquil flows) and water depth for age 1+ males with higher densities at greater depth. Our results indicate that substrate size is one of the most important drivers of the distribution and density of signal crayfish in the Umatilla Basin at multiple spatial scales. Understanding the habitat requirements and ecology of this species in its native range is important as agricultural intensification resulting from the development of biofuel technology and increasing human population size and the threat of invasive crayfish species might greatly influence the distribution, abundance, and management of the species of Pacifastacus in their native range in the near future. © 2012 The Crustacean Society.

AB  - This study evaluates the sustainability of biodiesel for transport in Thailand in terms of the availability of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) and crude palm oil (CPO) supply to satisfy the future demands for food and fuel, and the contribution of palm biodiesel to mitigating climate change if biodiesel induces land-use change (LUC). Five land conversions including rubber, cassava, paddy field, set-aside land, and forest land to oil palm are considered along with their displacement effects to other land types to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the direct and indirect land-use impacts. The net feedstock balance reveals that the policy to expand 0.4 million hectare (Mha) for new oil palm plantations accompanied with an increase of FFB yield to 22 megagrams per hectare (Mg/ha) by 2012 would help avoid a CPO shortage; however, this increase in land use needs to be strongly encouraged. The GHG analyses show a wide range of net GHG balances compared to diesel depending on which type of land is converted and which options are used to treat the oil palm wastes. Except for forest land conversion, direct LUC emissions from converting other lands to oil palm will render benefit to the GHG balance of biodiesel. Indirect LUC emissions through crop displacements, however, will generally worsen the balance. Several recommendations are therefore suggested for sustainable palm biodiesel production in the future. © 2012 by Yale University.

AB  - A xylanase gene (thxyn11A) from the Thermobifida halotolerans strain YIM 90462T was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame (ORF) of thxyn11A has 1,008 bp encoding a mature xylanase with a high degree of similarity (80 %) to the xylanase from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111. This enzyme (Thxyn11A) also possesses a glycosyl hydrolases family 11 (GH11) domain and a high isoelectric point (pI = 9.1). However, Thxyn11A varies from most GH11 xylanases, due to its large molecular mass (34 kDa). Recombinant Thxyn11A demonstrated a strong pH and temperature tolerance with a maximum activity at pH 9.0 and 70 °C. Xylotriose, the end-product of xylan hydrolysis by Thxyn11A, serves as a catalyst for hemicellulose pretreatment in industrial applications and can also function as a food source or supplement for enterobacteria. Due to its attractive biochemical properties, Thxyn11A may have potential value in many commercial applications. © 2012 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The role that liquid biofuels will play in future energy systems will depend on biomass-to-energy supply chain to overcome the barriers that may hinder the development and international trade, as well as a sustainable and efficient production of biomass resources. This research paper is based on an extensive literature review, and its purpose is to identify and to investigate the variables that, throughout the agricultural biomass-to-energy supply chain, give rise to the barriers that are common to most varieties of biomass. For achieving it and to assess the effects of referred barriers were used techniques of the Soft Systems methodology. Although biomass-to-energy supply chains are diverse in terms of pattern and operations, the characteristic of the barriers involved in the research provides a broad insight into the issues and challenges to define consistent strategies and interventions for overcoming them. So, this review might be useful for further research related to agricultural biomass-to-energy supply chain optimization that is needed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biodiesel production from microalgae is a promising approach for energy production; however, high cost of its process limits the use of microalgal biodiesel. Increasing the levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) levels, which is used as a biodiesel feedstock, in microalgae has been achieved mainly by nitrogen starvation. In this study, we compared effects of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) starvation on TAG accumulation and related parameters in wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-124 mt(-) and CC-125 mt(+) strains. Cell division was interrupted, protein and chlorophyll levels rapidly declined while cell volume, total neutral lipid, carotenoid, and carbohydrate content increased in response to nutrient starvation. Cytosolic lipid droplets in microalgae under nutrient starvation were monitored by three-dimensional confocal laser imaging of live cells. Infrared spectroscopy results showed that relative TAG, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide levels increased rapidly in response to nutrient starvation, especially S starvation. Both strains exhibited similar levels of regulation responses under mineral deficiency, however, the degree of their responses were significantly different, which emphasizes the importance of mating type on the physiological response of algae. Neutral lipid, TAG, and carbohydrate levels reached their peak values following 4 days of N or S starvation. Therefore, 4 days of N or S starvation provides an excellent way of increasing TAG content. Although increase in these parameters was followed by a subsequent decline in N-starved strains after 4 days, this decline was not observed in S-starved ones, which shows that S starvation is a better way of increasing TAG production of C. reinhardtii than N starvation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The concept of Green Growth implies that a wide range of developmental objectives, such as job creation, economic prosperity and poverty alleviation, can be easily reconciled with environmental sustainability. This article, however, argues that rather than being win-win, Green Growth is similar to most types of policy reforms that advocate the acceptance of short-term adjustment costs in the expectation of long-term gains. In particular, Green Growth policies often encourage developing countries to redesign their national strategies in ways that might be inconsistent with natural comparative advantages and past investments. In turn, there are often sizeable anti-reform coalitions whose interests may conflict with a Green Growth agenda. We illustrate this argument by using case studies of Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa, which are engaged in development strategies that involve inorganic fertilizers, biofuel production and coal-based energy, respectively. Each of these countries is pursuing an environmentally suboptimal strategy but nonetheless addressing critical development needs, including food security, fuel and electricity. We show that adopting a Green Growth approach would not only be economically costly but also generate substantial domestic resistance, especially among the poor. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study discusses four European and American regulatory schemes designed for accounting lifecycle GHG emissions in relation to the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. The objective is to critically examine the methodologies and associated parameters used in existing regulatory schemes for calculating GHG emissions, and to explore methodological convergences. The issues related to direct lifecycle and indirect land use change emissions have been addressed. It is found that there are commonalities between the European Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED) and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (UK-RTFO), but the US-EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard (US-EPA) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard of the California Air Resources Board (CA-CARB) vary greatly not only among themselves, but also in relation to the European regulations. Agricultural practices (especially soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics), co-product credits from surplus electricity and uncertainties around economic modeling approaches for indirect land use change are the major areas where methodological divergences exist. Incorporation of domestic agricultural practices, sugarcane mills operations, and realistic modeling of indirect impacts of land use change using regional models could provide more coherence in estimations of GHG emissions. Furthermore, the Brazilian trend of novelty in all phases of sugarcane bioenergy systems should be considered when projecting GHG emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The future bioenergy crop potential depends on (1) changes in the food system (food demand, agricultural technology), (2) political stability and investment security, (3) biodiversity conservation, (4) avoidance of long carbon payback times from deforestation, and (5) energy crop yields. Using a biophysical biomass-balance model, we analyze how these factors affect global primary bioenergy potentials in 2050. The model calculates biomass supply and demand balances for eleven world regions, eleven food categories, seven food crop types and two livestock categories, integrating agricultural forecasts and scenarios with a consistent global land use and NPP database. The TREND scenario results in a global primary bioenergy potential of 77. EJ/yr, alternative assumptions on food-system changes result in a range of 26-141. EJ/yr. Exclusion of areas for biodiversity conservation and inaccessible land in failed states reduces the bioenergy potential by up to 45%. Optimistic assumptions on future energy crop yields increase the potential by up to 48%, while pessimistic assumptions lower the potential by 26%. We conclude that the design of sustainable bioenergy crop production policies needs to resolve difficult trade-offs such as food vs. energy supply, renewable energy vs. biodiversity conservation or yield growth vs. reduction of environmental problems of intensive agriculture. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Local and regional governments have developed climate action plans with significant implications for forests and wildlife. The effectiveness of climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration depends on understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). Few studies project future LCLUC effects on forest carbon sequestration, and even fewer examine the resulting consequences for forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. First, we asked what forest-relevant climate mitigation strategies have been identified in US state climate mitigation plans, and do they consider implications for wildlife habitat and forest connectivity? Second, for Wisconsin, a partially forested state, what are the effects of three future LCLUC scenarios on afforestation, forest loss, carbon sequestration and storage, forest connectivity, and wildlife habitat? The 35 US states with climate mitigation plans recommended woody biomass for biofuels or energy production (27 states), forest loss prevention (24 states), and afforestation (17 states). Most plans (24 states) anticipated positive wildlife impacts while 7 plans indicated potential negative wildlife impacts from biomass energy; only 3 plans anticipated tradeoffs among afforestation and energy production. A LCLUC model for Wisconsin revealed substantial local variation in potential afforestation and forest loss, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat across LCLUC scenarios that range from no change in current conditions (Static Forest) to maximum afforestation potential (All Forest). Projected increases in forest cover under the Dynamic Forest scenario equated to 0.41. TgC sequestered per year, or 1.3% of Wisconsin's emissions of 33. TgC per year. Potential increases in core forest area and connectivity would increase habitat for 60 forest-associated species of greatest conservation need, but may decrease habitat for 48 grassland-associated species of greatest conservation need. These results indicate the importance of synergistic evaluation of multiple policy goals and LCLUC scenarios to examine tradeoffs and spatial dynamics of climate change mitigation strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study seeks to assess the future impacts of biofuel production on regional agricultural and related sectors over the next decade with a specific focus on the vulnerable regions of developing nations. Using a modification of the GTAP modeling platform to account for the global interactions of regional biofuel and food markets, the analysis shows that biofuel production levels depend on the assumption about the future price of energy and the nature of the substitutability between biofuels and petroleum-based transport fuels. Low energy prices reduce the demand for biofuels and thus require greater government support to meet the desired production targets. At the other extreme, when prices are high and there is scope for substituting biofuels for petroleum-based fuels, the volume of biofuels produced will exceed the mandates. Even when biofuels are being mainly produced in developed countries, our results indicate that there are impact pathways that extend far beyond the borders of the US, Brazil and the EU. Prices of feedstock and non-feedstock commodities rise in developing countries. There is also a rise in value added from the agricultural sector-a gain that is enjoyed by the owners of land and labor, including unskilled. Hence, to the extent that agriculture is a key sector in getting growth started and addressing poverty needs, the emergence of biofuels can (in this way at least) be a positive force. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass was submitted to a biological pretreatment prior to a catalytic hydroliquefaction in order to produce biofuel. The biodegradation process was conducted over 3. months in a reactor under controlled conditions. During the biodegradation process the organic matter was characterised and its evolution was correlated with physico-chemical parameters. In parallel with the analysis of the lipidic fraction, analytical pyrolysis was used to monitor bacterial activity. The alterations of branched to linear fatty acids ratio and of mono- to diacids ratio were compared when determined by thermochemolysis and observed in the directly extractable lipids. The evolution of the phytol to the corresponding isoprenoic ketone ratio was observed to be dependent on the desorption technique since it decreases using headspace while it increases using pyrolysis. "Humic"/" fulvic acids" ratio, infrared spectroscopy and thermodifferential analysis were used to determine the degree of OM complexification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Symbiotic association of legumes with rhizobia frequently results in higher photosynthesis and soluble carbohydrates in comparison with nitrate-fed plants, which might improve its potential for biomass conversion into bioethanol. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effects of nitrogen source and water availability on stem characteristics and on relationships between carbohydrates, phenolic metabolism activity and cell wall composition in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. Aragón). The experiment included three treatments: (1) plants fed with ammonium nitrate (AN); (2) plants inoculated with rhizobia (R); and (3) plants inoculated with rhizobia and amended with sewage sludge (RS). Two levels of irrigation were imposed: (1) well-watered and (2) drought stress. Under well-watered conditions, nitrogen-fixing plants have increased photosynthesis and stem fermentable carbohydrate concentrations, which result in higher potential for biomass conversion to bioethanol than in AN plants. The latter had higher lignin due to enhanced activities of phenolic metabolism-related enzymes. Under drought conditions, the potential for bioethanol conversion decreased to a similar level in all treatments. Drought-stressed nitrogen-fixing plants have high concentrations of fermentable carbohydrates and cell wall cellulose, but ammonium nitrate-fed plants produced higher plant and stem biomass, which might compensate the decreasing stem carbohydrates and cellulose concentrations. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This article describes the direct vehicle emission impact of the future use of bio ethanol as a fuel for gasoline cars in Denmark arising from the vehicle specific fuel consumption and emission differences between neat gasoline (E0) and E5/E85 gasoline-ethanol fuel blends derived from emission tests using primarily the European NEDC and ARTEMIS driving cycles. The E0-E5 test vehicles (nine cars) represent today's gasoline car traffic well where most of the driving is being made with cars certified as Euro 3+. The FFV test cars (25 cars) are all certified according to the Euro 4 emission standard introduced in Europe from the mid-2000s. This matches well with the propagation of the FFV technology in Europe.For vehicles using E5 rather than E0, the average fuel consumption and emission differences are small. For CO, VOC and NO x the derived average differences are 0.5%, -5% and 7%, respectively. For FFVs using E85 rather than E5, the emission differences become even smaller for VOC and NO x, but greater for CO. The derived average emission differences are in this case 18%, -1% and 5% for CO, VOC and NO x, respectively. In both comparative cases there is a large variation in the emission difference values calculated for the individual cars. The large standard deviations introduce some uncertainties in the final averages computed for each emission component.The vehicle based emissions are made up for two fossil fuel baseline scenarios (FS), characterised by high and low traffic growth rates. For each FS, two biofuel scenarios (BS1, BS2) are presented. BS1 reaches the Danish policy targets (10% biofuel share in 2020). BS2 is more ambitious (25% in 2030). By definition the biofuel part of the combusted fuel is CO 2 neutral and the maximum CO 2 emission difference between FS and BS2 becomes 27% in 2030. As predicted by the vehicle specific emission differences the calculated emission impacts of using bio ethanol are small for NO x, VOC and CO. Instead, for FS, BS1 and BS2 large emission reductions are due to the gradually cleaner new sold gasoline cars and the decline in total mileage until the mid-2010s. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study we investigate how indicators for energy use are applied in a set of life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy analysis case studies of biofuels. We found five inherently different types of indicators to describe energy use: (1) fossil energy, (2) secondary energy, (3) cumulative energy demand, (4) net energy balance, and (5) total extracted energy. It was also found that the examined reports and articles, the choice of energy use indicator was seldom motivated or discussed in relation to other energy use indicators. In order to investigate the differences between these indicators, they were applied to a case. The life cycle energy use of palm oil methyl ester was calculated and reported using these five different indicators for energy use, giving considerably different output results. This is in itself not unexpected, but indicates the importance of clearly identifying, describing and motivating the choice of energy use indicator. The indicators can all be useful in specific situations, depending on the goal and scope of the individual study, but the choice of indicators need to be better reported and motivated than what is generally done today. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is more than necessary to examine the issue of climate change and the connection that it has with the tremendous demand of mineral fuels in the last decades. It is also a necessity to examine thoroughly the alternatives that we have, like the use of biofuels, and to point out both the advantages and disadvantages of their use in order to define the conditions that should be applied for the minimisation of the effect of greenhouse emissions and thus to minimise the phenomenon of climate change. Biofuels are able to cover a small percentage of the energetic needs of the planet's population, do not charge the atmosphere with carbon dioxide emissions but they should not be cultivated in fertile lands.

AB  - Jatropha curcas a multipurpose, drought resistant, perennial plant belonging to family Euphorbiaceae is known for biodiesel production. This paper highlights the role of biotechnological tools in the genetic improvement of Jatropha. In tropical and subtropical countries Jatropha is a potential biofuel crop. It can be grown in low to high rainfall areas either as a commercial crop or hedge. The limitations in available germplasm include lack of knowledge of the genetic base, poor yield, low genetic diversity and vulnerability to a wide array of insects and diseases. Great scope exists for genetic improvement through conventional methods, induced mutations, interspecific hybridization and genetic transformation. Reliable and highly efficient tissue culture protocols for direct and callus-mediated shoot regeneration and somatic embryogenesis are established for Jatropha which indicates potential for widening the genetic base through biotechnological tools. Assessment of genetic diversity using molecular markers disclosed low inter-accessional variability in local Jatropha curcas germplasm. The current status and future prospects of in vitro regeneration, genetic transformation and the role of molecular tools in the genetic enhancement of the oilseed crop are discussed. This paper gives an overview on role of biotechnological techniques in the improvement of Jatropha plant emphasizing the benefit to the rural and urban economy.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) emissions from China are of global concern. A new BC emission inventory (PKU-BC(China)) has been developed with the following improvements: (1) The emission factor database was updated; (2) a 0.1° × 0.1° gridded map was produced for 2007 based on county-level proxies; (3) time trends were derived for 1949-2007 and predicted for 2008-2050; and (4) the uncertainties associated with the inventory were quantified. It was estimated that 1957 Gg of BC were emitted in China in 2007, which is greater than previously reported. Residential coal combustion was the largest source, followed by residential biofuel burning, coke production, diesel vehicles, and brick kilns. By using a county-level disaggregation method, spatial bias in province-level disaggregation, mainly due to uneven per capita emissions within provinces, was reduced by 42.5%. Emissions increased steadily since 1949 until leveling off in the mid-1990s, due to a series of technological advances and to socioeconomic progress. BC emissions in China in 2050 are predicted to be 920-2183 Gg/yr under various scenarios; and the industrial and transportation sectors stand to benefit the most from technological improvements. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates can dramatically affect vegetation structure, composition and dynamics in nearly every terrestrial ecosystem of the world. These effects are of particular concern in forests of western North America, where intensive herbivory by native and domestic ungulates has the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate deciduous, highly palatable species of aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), and willow (Salix spp.). In turn, differential herbivory pressure may favor greater establishment of unpalatable conifers that serve as ladder fuels for stand-replacing fires. The resulting high fuel loads often require silvicultural fuels reductions to mitigate fire risk, which in turn may facilitate additional recruitment of deciduous species but also additional herbivory pressure. Potential interactions of ungulate herbivory with episodic disturbances of silviculture, fire, and other land uses are not well documented, but are thought to operate synergistically to affect forest dynamics. We evaluated individual and joint effects of ungulate herbivory and fuels reduction treatments in grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziezii) forests that dominate large areas of interior western North America. We applied fuels reduction treatments of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire and then evaluated the responses of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species to these treatments (N=3) versus areas of no treatment (N=3), and to exclusion from ungulate herbivory versus areas subjected to extant herbivory by free-ranging cattle (Bos taurus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Densities of deciduous species were >4 times higher in response to fuels reduction treatments (84.4. individuals/ha) compared to areas of no treatment (19.7. individuals/ha). Additionally, when ungulates were excluded from fuels treated sites, the density of cottonwood was >5 times higher (122.5. individuals/ha) than fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (24.3. individuals/ha). Similarly, densities of Populus spp. and Salix spp. were >3 times higher (211.6. individuals/ha) on fuels treated sites excluded from ungulate herbivory versus fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (66.1. stems/ha). Deciduous species subjected to extant ungulate herbivory also were significantly lower in height, canopy surface area, and canopy volume than the same species inside the ungulate exclosures. Recruitment and long-term survival of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species in coniferous forests of interior western North America require a combination of episodic disturbances such as silviculture and fire to facilitate deciduous plant recruitment, followed by reductions in grazing pressure by domestic and wild ungulates during the time intervals between episodic disturbances to facilitate plant establishment, growth and survival. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae have been widely reported as a promising source of biofuels, mainly based on their high areal productivity of biomass and lipids as triacylglycerides and the possibility for cultivation on non-arable land. The isolation and selection of suitable strains that are robust and display high growth and lipid accumulation rates is an important prerequisite for their successful cultivation as a bioenergy source, a process that can be compared to the initial selection and domestication of agricultural crops. We developed standard protocols for the isolation and cultivation for a range of marine and brackish microalgae. By comparing growth rates and lipid productivity, we assessed the potential of subtropical coastal and brackish microalgae for the production of biodiesel and other oil-based bioproducts. This study identified Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaniella salina and new isolates of Chlorella sp. and Tetraselmis sp. as suitable candidates for a multiple-product algae crop. We conclude that subtropical coastal microalgae display a variety of fatty acid profiles that offer a wide scope for several oil-based bioproducts, including biodiesel and omega-3 fatty acids. A biorefinery approach for microalgae would make economical production more feasible but challenges remain for efficient harvesting and extraction processes for some species. © 2012 Lim et al.

AB  - Assessment of both economical and environmental performance of biofuel supply chains is crucial to have a complete view of the future implications of those systems. This paper presents a multi-objective, static modelling framework for the optimisation of hybrid first/second generation biofuel supply chains. Using the proposed modelling framework, different aspects are analysed including the potential GHG savings, the impact of carbon tax on the economic and environmental performance of a biofuel supply chain, the trade-off between the economic and environmental objectives and the maximum bioethanol throughput that can be achieved at different cap levels on the total supply chain cost. The trade-off between the conflicting objectives is analysed by solving the proposed multi-objective model using the e{open}-constraint method. In addition, the impact of technological learning on the economic and environmental performance of the supply chain throughout time is also analysed using a multi-period model developed based on the proposed static optimisation framework. Bioethanol production in the UK using hybrid first/second generation technologies is considered as the case study to highlight the model applicability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Sustainable Development - Policies and Measures (SD-PAM) proposal, in which developing countries could achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goals as side effects of sustainable development programmes, is a creative option for international climate-driven agreements that consider the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Analysing and comparing the Brazilian Ethanol Program (Proalcool) and the Brazilian Biodiesel Production Program (PNPB) can lead to a better understanding of how SD-PAM, or any other similar tool, as, for example, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA), which are initiatives under evaluation within UNFCCC, could shape or reshape domestic policies in developing countries if they had been considered as SD-PAM (or NAMA) in their inceptions. Both programmes were analysed from a programme theory perspective to investigate the possibility of having the programmes reshaped for the achievement of UNFCCC objectives under the SD-PAM mechanism. The comparison between the two programmes led to the understanding that, despite differences in their primary goals, implementation and maturity, their outcomes are very similar so far, very much focused on large-scale, capital-intensive agricultural sectors. In this regard, SD-PAM, or other similar tool, could play an important role for guaranteeing the sustainability of some developing countries' programmes, by bringing on board the perspectives of international negotiations on climate change. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Recent increases in energy demands as a consequence of population growth and industrialization, and pollution caused during the extraction and combustion of fossil fuel sources have driven the development of new energy sources that do not cause pollution and are inexpensive and renewable. Consequently, it is necessary to develop alternative ways of generating biofuels that put less pressure on agricultural lands and water supplies, and ensure ecosystems conservation. In order to achieve the proposed goals related to energetic coverage and independence, several approaches have been developed, including biodiesel production using vegetal oils as feedstock. The aim of the current research project was to apply a nonconventional bioprocess for in vitro biomass and oil production of Jatropha curcas, for assessing different J. curcas varieties, where seed tissue was isolated and used for callus induction. Once friable callus was obtained, cell suspension cultures were established. The cell viability, fatty acid content, and characteristics were used to select the most promising cell line according to its fatty acid profile and ability to grow and develop under in vitro conditions. Oil produced by cell suspension culture of the Jatropha varieties studied was extracted and characterized by GC/MS. Differences encountered among Jatropha varieties were related to their fatty acid profiles, oil content (% on dry basis), and cell viability measurements (%). © 2012 Publishing Technology.

AB  - Despite an enhanced emphasis on the human right to adequate food in the last decade, this has not had a measurable effect on the number of undernourished persons around the world. Rather, the number of hungry persons has increased from 800 million in 1996 (the year of the World Food Summit) to more than 925 million today. Acknowledging that enough food is produced globally to enable everyone to have an adequate food intake, the article analyzes the international dimensions of the right to food as recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), particularly the international obligations that can be read out from the relevant provisions. The ICESCR recognizes the right to food by applying strong wording, and some of its provisions have not been adequately observed in order to provide for alternative policies. It is the lack of political will of the States which explains the increase in the number of hungry persons globally, not the human rights system per se. Moreover, the ICESCR is not formulated in a manner which provides for a substantive overhaul of the international economic system, even if the States must change their conduct to comply with the ICESCR. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Cultivation of raw material represents a large proportion of biofuelś GHG emissions. The EU renewable energy directive 2009/28/EC specifies a GHG emission default value for cultivation of biofuel raw material (23 g CO2-e/MJ ethanol for wheat). The aim of this study was to quantify the uncertainty in GHG emissions for wheat cultivation in Sweden, considering uncertainty and variability in data at farm level. Results: Two levels of data collection at farm level were analyzed; simple (only yield and amount of N) and advanced (also including amounts and types of energy). The 2.5-97.5 percentile uncertainty for Swedish winter wheat was 20-27 g CO 2-e/MJ, which can be considered large in the context of the Directives threshold of 23 g (to two significant figures). Conclusion: It is concluded that quantifying GHG emissions in order to regulate biofuels is a difficult task, especially emissions from cultivation, since these are biological systems with large variability. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - A wide range of bioenergy crops has been proposed as feedstocks that can serve as renewable and ecologically sound substitutes to fossil fuels. In the United States, corn grain (Zea mays) ethanol is the primary biofuel, with over 49 billion liters produced in 2010. Along with the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 mandate, concerns about competition for food, land availability, nutrient and water requirements, energy balances, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted researchers to investigate other potential feedstocks. These include second-generation lignocellulosic feedstock and third-generation biodiesel from microalgae and cyanobacteria. However, each feedstock option has associated benefits and consequences for its use. One technique used to evaluate the energy efficiency of bioenergy production systems is the life-cycle assessment (LCA), where system inputs and outputs are computed in terms of either C or energy equivalents to assess the net gains in energy or C offsets. This article collates and synthesizes information about feedstock production options. Results show a wide range of calculated energy and GHG balances, even for the same feedstock species. Discrepancies in LCA and uncertainty thus make direct comparisons difficult and prevent a consensus in determining feedstock suitability. Recommendations must be based upon LCA model assumptions, crop species, cultivation methods, management practices, and energy conversion choices. Currently lignocellulosic feedstock, while a better alternative than corn grain, is not a long-term viable energy source. New feedstocks and technologies are necessary if bioenergy is to be C-neutral and efficient in energy production and land use. Although C fluxes are considered in LCA, one important ecosystem C stock that has previously been left out of many LCA models is changes to soil organic carbon (SOC). Future research, developments, and priorities are discussed for options to produce low C fuel sources and stabilize the climate. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Land and the use of land provide a key link between human activity and the natural environment. Traditionally, land has been a finite environmental resource. Land has been devoted to a variety of uses, such as food, for housing, as fibre and fodder. More recently, though, the discussion over the production of bioenergy crops for biofuels or for energy generation has put forward a new paradigm of land use. This paper reviews land use from the perspective of integrated systems, the new paradigm, and how it has evolved to make a contribution towards the reduction of greenhouse gases. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae are a promising source of industrial biomass for the future. In order to assess if aquacultured seaweed (macroalgae) could be considered an environmentally friendly source of biomass for bioenergy, life cycle assessments were performed for European countries, comparing methane as a biofuel from the anaerobic digestion (A) of whole seaweeds, (B) of alginate extraction residues, and (C) natural gas as a fossil fuel reference. These results clarify that the sources of electricity and energy used to heat the anaerobic digesters have an important impact. Recycling of materials and use of greenhouses at the nursery stage also allow environmental improvements for system (A). Ecodesign can make algal biomethane competitive in several categories compared to natural gas: a decrease of 21.9% and 54.2% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 58.6% and 68.7% in fossil depletion for systems (A) and (B), respectively, decrease in ozone depletion, and last but not least, improvement in the marine eutrophication index for system (A). For system (B), benefits are more arguable and dependent on the allocation. To conclude, seaweed could become competitive with terrestrial feedstock for biofuel production in the near future. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study is to assess how bioenergy costs and supply potential in Mozambique develop over time in a spatially explicit way. The land availability for energy crops was explored making use of a business-as-usual and progressive scenario on the development of other land-use functions. The assessment of the costs and supply potential is based on developments in land availability, the suitability of the land that is and becomes available, the disaggregated cost breakdown of energy crop production, the transportation distance of feedstock to conversion plant, the cost of conversion, the transportation distance from plant to harbor, and the cost of international shipping. The supply chains of eucalyptus (torrefied) pellets and sugarcane ethanol are used as a case study. The results show a large spatial variation in supply chain costs, which is the result of spatial variation in feedstock production costs, primary transport costs, and secondary transport costs. Most promising areas for eucalyptus and sugarcane production are scattered in the central south, the central, and the north-eastern part of Mozambique where agro-ecological conditions are relatively favorable, where sufficient feedstock can grow to meet plant input requirements, and where infrastructure is available. In 2030, in the progressive scenario, the total potential for eucalyptus pellet production amounts 3200 PJ of which 2500 PJ could be exported to Europe below a market price level of 8 €/GJ; for sugarcane ethanol, the total potential amount is 850 PJ of which 500 PJ could be exported below a price level of 30 €/GJ. The location of production is the key factor for cost-effective production. This study demonstrates an approach which enables the assessment of the development of bioenergy potential and costs over time in a spatially explicit way. As environmental and socio-economic impacts of bioenergy supply chains are highly related to the biophysical and socio-economic context of the production location, a spatially explicit assessment of bioenergy production potential is a suitable approach for the assessment of the sustainability of bioenergy chains. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - seed crops, such as rapeseed, sunflower, soyabean and safflower and non-edible seed oil plantation crops Jatropha and Pongamia have proved to be internationally viable commercial sources of vegetable oils for biodiesel production. Considering the paucity of edible oils and unsustainability of arable land under perennial plantation of Jatropha and Pongamia in countries such as India, the prospects of seed oil producing Cleome viscosa, an annual wild short duration plant species of the Indogangetic plains, were evaluated for it to serve as a resource for biodiesel. The seeds of C. viscosa resourced from its natural populations growing in Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi areas of Aravali range were solvent extracted to obtain the seed oil. The oil was observed to be similar in fatty acid composition to the non-edible oils of rubber, Jatropha and Pongamia plantation crops and soybean, sunflower, safflower, linseed and rapeseed edible oil plants in richness of unsaturated fatty acids. The Cleome oil shared the properties of viscosity, density, saponification and calorific values with the Jatropha and Pongamia oils, except that it was comparatively acidic. The C. viscosa biodiesel had the properties of standard biodiesel specified by ASTM and Indian Standard Bureau, except that it had low oxidation stability. It proved to be similar to Jatropha biodiesel except in cloud point, pour point, cold filter plugging point and oxidation stability. In view of the annual habit of species and biodiesel quality, it can be concluded that C. viscosa has prospects to be developed into a short-duration biodiesel crop.

AB  - In this article we examine the technological feasibility of the global target of reducing GHG emissions to 50 % of the 1990 level by the year 2050. We also perform a detailed analysis of the contribution of low-carbon technologies to GHG emission reduction over mid- and long-term timeframes, and evaluate the required technological cost. For the analysis we use AIM/Enduse[Global], a techno-economic model for climate change mitigation policy assessment. The results show that a 50 % GHG emission reduction target is technically achievable. Yet achieving the target will require substantial emission mitigation efforts. The GHG emission reduction rate from the reference scenario stands at 23 % in 2020 and 73 % in 2050. The marginal abatement cost to achieve these emission reductions reaches $150/tCO 2-eq in 2020 and $600/tCO 2-eq in 2050. Renewable energy, fuel switching, and efficiency improvement in power generation account for 45 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. Non-energy sectors, namely, fugitive emission, waste management, agriculture, and F-gases, account for 25 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation, and biofuel together account for 64 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2050. Additional investment in GHG abatement technologies for achieving the target reaches US$ 6.0 trillion by 2020 and US$ 73 trillion by 2050. This corresponds to 0.7 and 1.8 % of the world GDP, respectively, in the same periods. Non-Annex I regions account for 55 % of the total additional investment by 2050. In a sectoral breakdown, the power generation and transport sectors account for 56 and 30 % of the total additional investment by 2050, respectively. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Miscanthus species have attracted considerable interest on account of their biomass, which has high productivity, low inputs, and contains large amounts of polysaccharides. In this study, we used established methods to analyze the lignin (Klason lignin and acid-soluble lignin), cellulose, and hemicellulose contents of 12 Miscanthus genotypes (8 lines of Miscanthus sinensis, 1 line of Miscanthus x giganteus, and 3 lines of Miscanthus sacchariflorus) cultivated in Korea to assess their suitability for biofuel production. Two M. sacchariflorus genotypes revealed high polysaccharide content (close to 65%) and low lignin content (<20%) compared with the others genotypes. We were able to select 2 genotypes (M. sacchariflorus) that are potentially suitable for bioenergy production. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased food production can be achieved by incorporating more land into the productive process, by increasing productivity in already opened areas or by a combination of both strategies. By allowing a fraction of current pasture area to accommodate the expansion of food and biofuel crops intensification of existing pastoral systems is a strategy to avoid further loss of native vegetation. However, there is a common misperception that the path of growth of the Brazilian beef production has been primarily based on the expansion of extensive pastures. Empirical evidence presented in this article shows that whilst this was the case for the 1950-1975 period, the pattern of cattle production in Brazil has changed profoundly since then. During the 1950-2006 period productivity gains explained 79% of the growth in beef production in Brazil and supported a land-saving effect of 525 million hectares. Therefore, without this land-saving effect an additional pasture area that is 25% higher than the Amazon biome in Brazil would be needed to meet current levels of Brazilian beef production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodologies commonly underpin project-scale carbon accounting for changes in land use and management and are used in frameworks for Life Cycle Assessment and carbon footprinting of food and energy crops. These methodologies were intended for use at large spatial scales. This can introduce error in predictions at finer spatial scales. There is an urgent need for development and implementation of higher tier methodologies that can be applied at fine spatial scales (e.g. farm/project/plantation) for food and bioenergy crop greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting to facilitate decision making in the land-based sectors. Higher tier methods have been defined by IPCC and must be well evaluated and operate across a range of domains (e.g. climate region, soil type, crop type, topography), and must account for land use transitions and management changes being implemented. Furthermore, the data required to calibrate and drive the models used at higher tiers need to be available and applicable at fine spatial resolution, covering the meteorological, soil, cropping system and management domains, with quantified uncertainties. Testing the reliability of the models will require data either from sites with repeated measurements or from chronosequences. We review current global capability for estimating changes in soil carbon at fine spatial scales and present a vision for a framework capable of quantifying land use change and management impacts on soil carbon, which could be used for addressing issues such as bioenergy and biofuel sustainability, food security, forest protection, and direct/indirect impacts of land use change. The aim of this framework is to provide a globally accepted standard of carbon measurement and modelling appropriate for GHG accounting that could be applied at project to national scales (allowing outputs to be scaled up to a country level), to address the impacts of land use and land management change on soil carbon. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This communication presents an integrated approach to study the potential of Chlorella pyrenoidosa for treatment of dairy wastewater (DWW) and biofuel extraction. The experiment was set up in two steps. The step-1 of the experiment was designed for treatment of dairy wastewater. The physical and chemical parameters of wastewater quality such as nitrate, phosphate, chloride, fluoride, hardness, etc., were studied. The level of nitrate and phosphate known, agents of eutrophication in water bodies was reduced by 60% and 87% in influent, 49% and 83% in the effluent, respectively. The step-2 of the experiment was designed for biofuel extraction by harvesting the biomass (algal strain) grown in dairy waste water. The result of this study shows that algal strain C. pyrenoidosa is not only an agent for mitigation of pollutant load, but it can also be used as potential agent for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mechanical-biological treatment of municipal solid waste has become popular throughout the UK and other parts of Europe to enable compliance with the Landfill Directive. Pretreatment will have a major influence on the degradation and settlement characteristics of the waste in landfills owing to the changes in the composition and properties of the wastes. This paper presents and compares the results of long term landfill behaviour of the UK and German MBT wastes pretreated to different standards. The gas generating potential, leachate quality and settlement characteristics are highlighted. The results reveal that it is possible to achieve stabilisation of MBT waste within a year and the biogas yield and leachate strength of German MBT waste was significantly reduced compared with the UK MBT waste. The settlement resulting from mechanical creep is more significant than the biodegradation induced settlement in both cases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Measurements of black carbon (BC) mass concentration were made over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the period of 27 December 2008-29 January 2009. BC mass concentration is highest over the Coastal-BoB (5.1 ± 3.0 μg m -3) and is more than a factor of two higher than the South-BoB (2.5 ± 1.4 μg m -3). The source regions of BC over the study region is identified using the Total Potential Source Contribution Function (TPSCF) analysis. The probable source regions over the Coastal-BoB and North-BoB (India, Indo-Gangetic plain, Pakistan, Afghanistan) are found to be distinctly different than that over the East-BoB and South-BoB (mostly from southeast Asia). The spectral distribution of absorption coefficients suggested similar source types of BC present over the entire BoB, with significant contribution of absorbing aerosols from the sources other than fossil fuel burning. Our results suggest that the entire BoB remains dominantly influenced by aerosols emitted from biomass/biofuel burning during winter. Single scattering albedo (SSA) is found to vary in the range of 0.63-0.70 over different parts of BoB with the lowest value over Coastal-BoB and the highest value over South-BoB. SSA values observed in the present study are the lowest ever reported over the BoB in the last decade indicating highest concentration of absorbing aerosols over the BoB during winter. The present work and the results obtained will have strong implications while investigating the effect of anthropogenic aerosols over marine environment, and in estimating the spatiotemporal variation of aerosol radiative impact. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels could become increasingly important for agriculture; however there is growing concern regarding the possible environmental drawbacks due to the risks of increased inputs during crop cultivation. These risks need to be evaluated in order to assess the best management practices. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out: (i) to evaluate the environmental impacts of three cropping systems characterized by different external input levels (low S1, medium S2 and high S3) applied to sunflower and maize, both in rotation with wheat, in a Mediterranean region; (ii) to estimate the environmental benefits of the optimization of cropping systems for energy management. Output-input ratio, net energy balance, global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP) and acidification potential (AP) were used as LCA impact categories. Data from cropping systems (external input and crop yields) were collected from a long-term experiment carried out in the coastal plain of Tuscany; data regarding fertilizers, machinery and pesticide production were taken from literature. The results obtained showed S1 with the highest output-input ratios and the lowest impact for the selected impact categories. The other cropping systems S2 and S3 showed limited differences between them for all the impact categories evaluated. Fertilizer use and application, irrigation and machinery use caused most of the environmental impacts and energy consumption. The allocation procedure, showing residues as co-products, had a strong influence on the overall efficiency of agricultural systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing international biomass trade for energy and concerns about sustainability of globally traded biomass have raised interest in assessments of cross-border trade related to bioenergy. Within this paper, approaches to overcome methodological difficulties related to biomass trade are proposed and applied for the case of Austria. Biomass currently has a share of 15.5% in Austria's primary energy consumption of 1354. PJ (2009). According to energy statistics, the rate of self-sufficiency with biomass for energy (defined as the ratio of domestic production to inland consumption, with both imports and exports taken into account) is 91%. However, feedstock imports for transport fuel production and indirect imports of wood-based fuels (wood processing residues and waste liquor of the paper industry originating from imported wood) are not taken into account in energy statistics, but prove to be of some significance. Imports of agricultural commodities to the amount of 9.7. PJ can be attributed to domestic biofuel production, and indirect imports of wood-based fuels, account for 31. PJ. With these import streams taken into account, the share of domestic fuels in bioenergy use is only 67%, rather than 84%, as official energy statistics suggest. On the other hand, Austria is exporting more than 50% of its production of sawnwood, panelboard and paper products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article evaluates the environmental performance of a biofuel production system based on the fast pyrolysis of short-rotation poplar biomass using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The system includes a circulating fluidized bed reactor followed by bio-oil upgrading through hydrotreating and hydrocracking to produce gasoline and diesel. The investigated system was selected on the basis of an overview of available technologies for the production and upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. Inventory data for the whole system were collected and used in order to carry out the life cycle impact assessment. Seven impact categories were evaluated: cumulative energy demand, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. Feedstock pre-treatment, pyrolysis and steam reforming for the production of the hydrogen required for hydroprocessing were identified as the subsystems with the highest contributions to the potential impacts. Within these subsystems, natural gas production, electricity generation and direct emissions to air were the main contributors. Special attention should also be paid to the production of the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, especially to the associated land occupation and fertilizer requirements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the past few years, agribusiness, investment funds and government agencies have been acquiring long-term rights over large areas of farmland in lower income countries. It is widely thought that private sector expectations of higher agricultural commodity prices and government concerns about longer-term food and energy security underpin much recent land acquisition for agricultural investments. These processes are expected to have lasting and far-reaching implications for world agriculture and for livelihoods and food security in recipient countries. This paper critically examines evidence of trends, scale, geography and drivers in the global land rush. While this analysis broadly corroborates some widespread assumptions, it also points to a more complex set of drivers that reflect fundamental shifts in economic and geopolitical relations linking sovereign states, global finance, and agribusiness through to local groups. Only a solid understanding of these fundamental drivers can help identify levers and pressure points for policy responses to address the challenges raised by large-scale land acquisitions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Rio Mannu River Basin (Sardinia, Italy) is undergoing a process of agricultural intensification. Like many Mediterranean areas, this basin is characterized by water shortages and diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. Hence the objective of this study was to develop possible land use and land management scenarios that could constitute an alternative to the current watershed management. Several land use and land management scenarios were formulated and analyzed with local stakeholders, and two were selected and simulated as realistic in consideration of the socio-economical aspects of the study area. Scenario 1 involves agricultural practices that include a reduction in fertilizer use to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements for " good" status of water bodies. Scenario 2 introduces rapeseed cultivation, replacing durum wheat in a small area, to investigate the impact of biofuel plant cultivation on water quality. Each option was assessed by considering the effects on water quality, crop yields and economic benefits. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to simulate hydrological processes and evaluate current and future nutrient loads. This model requires adequate streamflow data for calibration and validation. However, as is the case for many Mediterranean basins, insufficient data were available. Therefore, a methodology was developed and tested to calibrate hydrological processes based on the transposition of a parameter set from a gauged catchment located in the same region. This study suggests that a sound use of fertilizers could substantially reduce the amount of nutrients flowing into surface waters, although the effects of such a policy on crop yield and farm income would be negative in some cases. Moreover, the results clearly predict that the replacement of durum wheat with rapeseed (a biofuel crop), could offer a margin of profit, but would have a negative impact on water quality due to increased nutrient losses. Consequently, this option is unsuitable for this area. Furthermore, it can be inferred from these results that the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources may have a negative impact on the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. Clearly, this process needs to be regulated, taking into account environmental and socio-economical aspects. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels from algae are highly interesting as renewable energy sources to replace, at least partially, fossil fuels, but great research efforts are still needed to optimize growth parameters to develop competitive large-scale cultivation systems. One factor with a seminal influence on productivity is light availability. Light energy fully supports algal growth, but it leads to oxidative stress if illumination is in excess. In this work, the influence of light intensity on the growth and lipid productivity of Nannochloropsis salina was investigated in a flat-bed photobioreactor designed to minimize cells self-shading. The influence of various light intensities was studied with both continuous illumination and alternation of light and dark cycles at various frequencies, which mimic illumination variations in a photobioreactor due to mixing. Results show that Nannochloropsis can efficiently exploit even very intense light, provided that dark cycles occur to allow for re-oxidation of the electron transporters of the photosynthetic apparatus. If alternation of light and dark is not optimal, algae undergo radiation damage and photosynthetic productivity is greatly reduced. Our results demonstrate that, in a photobioreactor for the cultivation of algae, optimizing mixing is essential in order to ensure that the algae exploit light energy efficiently. © 2012 Sforza et al.

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic anaerobe, has the unusual capacity to convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol and hydrogen. In this work, the cell wall proteome of C. thermocellum was investigated. The proteins in the cell wall fraction of C. thermocellum prepared by the boiling SDS method were released by mutanolysin digestion and resolved on two-dimensional (2D) gel. One hundred and thirty-two proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, among which the extracellular solute-binding protein (CbpB/cthe_1020), enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and translation elongation factor EF-Tu were detected as highly abundant proteins. Besides the known surface localized proteins, including FtsZ, MinD, GroEL, DnaK, many enzymes involved in bioenergetics, such as alcohol dehydrogenases and hydrogenases were also detected. By glycan stain and MS analysis of glycopeptides, we identified CbpB as a glycoprotein, which is the second glycoprotein from C. thermocellum characterized. The fact that CbpB was highly abundant in the cell wall region and glycosylated, reflects its importance in substrate assimilation. Our results indicate cell wall proteins constitute a significant portion of cellular proteins and may play important physiological roles (i.e. bioenergetics) in this bacterium. The insights described are relevant for the development of C. thermocellum as a biofuel producer. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background: Forests of the Midwest U.S. provide numerous ecosystem services. Two of these, carbon sequestration and wood production, are often portrayed as conflicting. Currently, carbon management and biofuel policies are being developed to reduce atmospheric CO 2 and national dependence on foreign oil, and increase carbon storage in ecosystems. However, the biological and industrial forest carbon cycles are rarely studied in a whole-system structure. The forest system carbon balance is the difference between the biological (net ecosystem production) and industrial (net emissions from forest industry) forest carbon cycles, but to date this critical whole system analysis is lacking. This study presents a model of the forest system, uses it to compute the carbon balance, and outlines a methodology to maximize future carbon uptake in a managed forest region.Results: We used a coupled forest ecosystem process and forest products life cycle inventory model for a regional temperate forest in the Midwestern U.S., and found the net system carbon balance for this 615,000 ha forest was positive (2.29 t C ha -1 yr -1). The industrial carbon budget was typically less than 10% of the biological system annually, and averaged averaged 0.082 t C ha -1 yr -1. Net C uptake over the next 100-years increased by 22% or 0.33 t C ha -1 yr -1 relative to the current harvest rate in the study region under the optized harvest regime.Conclusions: The forest's biological ecosystem current and future carbon uptake capacity is largely determined by forest harvest practices that occurred over a century ago, but we show an optimized harvesting strategy would increase future carbon sequestration, or wood production, by 20-30%, reduce long transportation chain emissions, and maintain many desirable stand structural attributes that are correlated to biodiversity. Our results for this forest region suggest that increasing harvest over the next 100 years increases the strength of the carbon sink, and that carbon sequestration and wood production are not conflicting for this particular forest ecosystem. The optimal harvest strategy found here may not be the same for all forests, but the methodology is applicable anywhere sufficient forest inventory data exist. © 2012 Peckham et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Cellulose degrading enzymes have important functions in the biotechnology industry, including the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Anaerobes including Clostridium species organize cellulases and other glycosyl hydrolases into large complexes known as cellulosomes. In contrast, aerobic actinobacteria utilize systems comprised of independently acting enzymes, often with carbohydrate binding domains. Numerous actinobacterial genomes have become available through the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) project. We identified putative cellulose-degrading enzymes belonging to families GH5, GH6, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH48, and GH51 in the genomes of eleven members of the actinobacteria. The eleven organisms were tested in several assays for cellulose degradation, and eight of the organisms showed evidence of cellulase activity. The three with the highest cellulase activity were Actinosynnema mirum, Cellulomonas flavigena, and Xylanimonas cellulosilytica. Cellobiose is known to induce cellulolytic enzymes in the model organism Thermobifida fusca, but only Nocardiopsis dassonvillei showed higher cellulolytic activity in the presence of cellobiose. In T. fusca, cellulases and a putative cellobiose ABC transporter are regulated by the transcriptional regulator CelR. Nine organisms appear to use the CelR site or a closely related binding site to regulate an ABC transporter. In some, CelR also regulates cellulases, while cellulases are controlled by different regulatory sites in three organisms. Mining of genome data for cellulose degradative enzymes followed by experimental verification successfully identified several actinobacteria species which were not previously known to degrade cellulose as cellulolytic organisms. © 2012 Anderson et al.

AB  - The Haloxylon vegetation in Central Asia has undergone vast changes throughout the last century, which has lead to a strong degradation and desertification of the desert ecosystems in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. In terms of combating desertification and restoration of ecosystems, two pilot-projects recently are aiming at the reforestation of Haloxylon ecosystems. Hereby, two of the internationally discussed climate change mitigation activities may be of higher relevance: (I) to sequester CO 2 through afforestation and reforestation and (II) to substitute fossil fuels by sustainable utilization of regenerative bio-fuels. With particular focus on Central Asian desert ecosystems, the questions arose: (I) to which extent Haloxylon species - the dominant shrub species - sequester CO 2, (II) what the recent carbon pool related to Haloxylon ecosystems is, and (III) in which magnitude the existing and/or reforested ecosystems could be utilized for bio-fuels sustainably. Therefore, this study aims at the derivation of allometric models including carbon contents for the two Haloxylon species in Central Asian desert ecosystems. A first application to measured transect data across Central Asia is carried out to reflect the recent biomass variability of the two study species. We found, that above- and below-ground biomass for both species is best modeled when taking growth height, basal area, and canopy area of shrubs into account (0.87&lt;r 2&lt;0.97 for the top-models). Regarding the transect data, Haloxylon aphyllum showed a significantly higher variability of measured and modeled variables as well as higher maximum and average biomass estimates when compared to Haloxylon persicum. As our study sites partly include regions with moderate to strong human impact, the observed biomass variability represents differing ecological conditions as well as anthropogenic effects, with the latter also being reflected in the observed shrub species compositions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - The Great Plains region of the United States is an area of widespread dryland crop production, with wheat being the dominant crop. Precipitation in the region ranges from 300 to 500. mm annually, with the majority of precipitation falling during hot summer months. The prevailing cropping system is a two-year rotation of wheat and summer fallow. The adoption of no-till practices has resulted in greater precipitation storage and use efficiency, which has led to greater cropping intensity, higher productivity, more diverse crop rotations, and improvements in soil properties. In Colorado, for example, a no-till rotation of winter wheat-maize-fallow increased total annualized grain yield by 75% compared to winter wheat-summer fallow. Soil erosion was reduced to just 25% of that from a conventional tillage wheat-summer fallow system. The primary challenge with reducing fallow frequency is the increase in yield variability and risk of crop failure. Improved approaches for choosing crop or fallow are being developed based on soil water content and forecasted weather. Development of alternative crops, crop rotations, and integrated livestock systems that are sustainable from both economic and ecological perspectives is an on-going effort. Other research is addressing adaptation of cropping practices to climate change and the potential for dryland biomass crop production for the developing biofuel industry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During recent years, the opportunity to use energy crops for the production of biofuels aroused many interest by virtue of the potential reduction of green house gasses emissions associated to their large-scale use. Nevertheless, many studies highlight that the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels from energy crops can lead up to serious problems related to the pressure on water resources. The present research had the aim to investigate the relations existing between biofuels production and the pressure on water resources, and how these relations are affected by climate variability. To this aim, the water footprint of maize cultivation in Tuscany (central Italy) was computed and its trend was analyzed during the last 55. years in relation to climate variability with particular attention to precipitations. The results demonstrated that the WF was affected by climate variability mainly through the effect of climate on the crop cycle. The total WF decreased over time but an increase of the blue component was found due to the change in precipitation patterns and to the rise of temperatures. Concerning the gray WF, despite a decrease in the last 55-years period mainly due to precipitation decrease, there was a reduction in N uptake by the crop and an accumulation of nitrate into the soil. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major issue raised about development of cellulosic biomass derived fuels technologies is the concern about possible competition for land with agricultural crops and impacts on food and feed supply. However, because agave offers high productivity with low water and nutrient demands, it can thrive on semiarid lands not suitable for conventional agriculture, making it a promising lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels production. Because agave composition will establish the maximum potential fuel yield that is vital to low cost conversion, detailed chemical composition data and cellulose characteristics were measured by standard biomass analysis procedures and solid-state NMR methods, respectively, for four agave samples: A. americana leaves, A. salmiana leaves, A. tequilana leaves, and A. americana heart. For the first time, we report substrate characteristics relevant to biochemical conversion for the tested agave species, specifically cell wall compositional data along with the relative proportions of cellulose ultra-structural components. The experimental results also provide an important baseline for further characterization and conversion of different agave species as biofuels feedstocks for semi-arid lands. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - There is widespread concern that biomass energy policy that promotes forests as a supply source will cause net carbon emissions. Most of the analyses that have been done to date, however, are biological, ignoring the effects of market adaptations through substitution, net imports, and timber investments. This paper uses a dynamic model of forest and land use management to estimate the impact of United States energy policies that emphasize the utilization of forest biomass on global timber production and carbon stocks over the next 50 years. We show that when market factors are included in the analysis, expanded demand for biomass energy increases timber prices and harvests, but reduces net global carbon emissions because higher wood prices lead to new investments in forest stocks. Estimates are sensitive to assumptions about whether harvest residues and new forestland can be used for biomass energy and the demand for biomass. Restricting biomass energy to being sourced only from roundwood on existing forestland can transform the policy from a net sink to a net source of emissions. These results illustrate the importance of capturing market adjustments and a large geographic scope when measuring the carbon implications of biomass energy policies. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Land can be used in several ways to mitigate climate change, but especially under changing environmental conditions there may be implications for food prices. Using an integrated global system model, we explore the roles that these land-use options can play in a global mitigation strategy to stabilize Earth's average temperature within 2°C of the preindustrial level and their impacts on agriculture. We show that an ambitious global Energy-Only climate policy that includes biofuels would likely not achieve the 2°C target. A thought-experiment where the world ideally prices land carbon fluxes combined with biofuels (Energy+Land policy) gets the world much closer. Land could become a large net carbon sink of about 178 Pg C over the 21st century with price incentives in the Energy+Land scenario. With land carbon pricing but without biofuels (a No-Biofuel scenario) the carbon sink is nearly identical to the case with biofuels, but emissions from energy are somewhat higher, thereby results in more warming. Absent such incentives, land is either a much smaller net carbon sink (+37 Pg C - Energy-Only policy) or a net source (-21 Pg C - No-Policy). The significant trade-off with this integrated land-use approach is that prices for agricultural products rise substantially because of mitigation costs borne by the sector and higher land prices. Share of income spent on food for wealthier regions continues to fall, but for the poorest regions, higher food prices lead to a rising share of income spent on food. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The approximately 100 million tonne per year increase in the use of corn to produce ethanol in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and projections of greater future use, have raised concerns that reduced exports of corn (and other agricultural products) and higher commodity prices would lead to land-use changes and, consequently, negative environmental impacts in other countries. The concerns have been driven by agricultural and trade models, which project that large-scale corn ethanol production leads to substantial decreases in food exports, increases in food prices, and greater deforestation globally. Over the past decade, the increased use of corn for ethanol has been largely matched by the increased corn harvest attributable mainly to increased yields. U.S. exports of corn, wheat, soybeans, pork, chicken, and beef either increased or remained unchanged. Exports of distillers' dry grains (DDG, a coproduct of ethanol production and a valuable animal feed) increased by more than an order of magnitude to 9 million tonnes in 2010. Increased biofuel production may lead to intensification (higher yields) and extensification (more land) of agricultural activities. Intensification and extensification have opposite impacts on land use change. We highlight the lack of information concerning the magnitude of intensification effects and the associated large uncertainties in assessments of the indirect land use change associated with corn ethanol. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energy supply for transportation causes a major part of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. Therefore, several governments have introduced measures to promote biofuels based on agricultural feedstock in order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce the import dependency of fossil fuel energy. However, due to the land requirement for the cultivation of agricultural feedstock and the conflict between the use of biomass for food and fuel, the generation of biofuel from microalgae as a promising alternative is discussed more and more. Against this background, the goal of this paper is to estimate the GHG emissions for the provision and use of biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethane from microalgal feedstock. These biofuels have the possibility to reduce the pressure on agricultural land because of the higher area-specific biomass yields. Nevertheless, the energy demand needed for the provision of biofuels from microalgae according to the concepts investigated here is responsible for no significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with fossil fuels or even for a high increase in emissions. From the investigated options, the cultivation in open ponds seems to be more promising than the cultivation in photo-bioreactors, and the provision of biodiesel and biomethane from microalgae shows advantages over the ethanol generation from a greenhouse-gas-reduction point of view. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - On a world scale companies and governments are acquiring tracts of land from rural communities across the developing world in what some describe as a global "land grab." Yet looking into local settings reveals that negotiations and arrangements are often piecemeal and halting, with little resemblance to a coordinated seizure of land. Conflicting maps, overlapping territorial claims, and unclear acquisition processes are creating land disputes, mistrust, and ambiguity. Resulting cycles of contention are enabling companies to obtain-even appropriate-some land. Still, in at least some locales the process is doing more to undermine development opportunities for all parties. To probe into these local politics of mapmaking, this article draws on fieldwork from 2010 to 2011 in Tanzania's Rufiji District, located in the lower floodplain of the Rufiji River. Companies, one might surmise, should be able to exploit information asymmetries to wrest control of land from local villagers. Interviews, primary documents, and field observations reveal, however, that this is not occurring as much as one might expect along the lower Rufiji River. The politics of such land acquisitions, we argue, would seem to be better understood in terms of cycles of contentious politics, as an ongoing process in which movements and counter-movements vie for control through the strategic use of images, maps, and discourse. This research extends the understanding of the processes changing global agriculture and energy production by bridging the frames of the "politics of mapping" and "cycles of contention" to more fully reveal how and why control over land and resources is shifting in the global South. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The large majority of biofuels to date is ''firstgeneration'' biofuel made from agricultural commodities. All first-generation biofuel production systems require phosphorus (P) fertilization. P is an essential plant nutrient, yet global reserves are finite. We argue that committing scarce P to biofuel production involves a trade-off between climate change mitigation and future food production. We examine biofuel production from seven types of feedstock, and find that biofuels at present consume around 2% of the global inorganic P fertilizer production. For all examined biofuels, with the possible exception of sugarcane, the contribution to P depletion exceeds the contribution to mitigating climate change. The relative benefits of biofuels can be increased through enhanced recycling of P, but high increases in P efficiency are required to balance climate change mitigation and P depletion impacts. We conclude that, with the current production systems, the production of first-generation biofuels compromises food production in the future. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2012.

AB  - The paper presents the findings of comparative investigations into the operation of Audi 80 1.9l 4 cylinder diesel engine, TDI, type 1Z, 66 kW powered by new FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) mixtures of spring (SCME) and winter (WCME) camelina-based biofuel and mineral diesel. The article assesses the principles of operating electronic control over the diesel engine (ECS) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and looks at a positive impact of the system on energetic (be,ηe) and ecological (CH, NOx, CO2, SM) parameters. The ECS of the average and maximal power of the engine improve in-cylinder air injection that has an impact on an increase in ηe by approximately 30% and reduces the emission of the harmful components from incomplete combustion. It is accepted that in case diesel fuel is replaced by FAME biofuels (RME - rapeseed methyl ester; SCME - spring camelina methyl ester; WCME - winter camelina methyl ester), ECS control parameters shall not be retrofitted or additionally optimized. The properties of camelina-based biofuel mixtures B30 (SCME) and B30 (WCME) and diesel fuel are similar to the properties of the standard mixtures of RME biofuel B30 (RME). If compared to diesel fuel, the use of camelina-based biofuel mixtures B30 (SCME) and B30 (WCME) enables lower emissions of harmful components from exhaust gases, which makes approximately 15% of CH and 20÷25% of SM. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.

AB  - Nigeria's biofuels policy advocates the adoption of cassava as feedstock for a 10%-biofuel substitution option in Nigerian transport fuel demand. This policy option is expected to address energy security and environmental consequences of using fossil fuels as the sole source of transport energy in the country. This paper appraised the technological and economic factors necessary for achieving Nigeria's cassava-based biofuel initiative at different substitution levels of 5, 10, and 15% by the Year 2020. A multi-stage energy forecasting and project analysis framework adapted from Coate's structure for technology assessment, as well as engineering economy methodology was used for the study. Technological analysis entailed determining petrol consumption projection, R and D capability, input feedstock requirements, environmental considerations and land requirement for feedstock crop production while engineering economy analysis evaluated the economic viability of the project. The results showed that petrol consumption in Nigeria and bioethanol substitution requirements were in the range of 18,285.7-19,142.84 thousand tons and 914.28 (5% low demand)-2871.43 (15% high demand) thousand tons, respectively by 2020.Cassava feedstock and landmass requirements for bioethanol production were in the range of 4.64-14.53 million tons and 4.08-12.80 thousand sq. km, respectively while carbon dioxide savings were between 1.87-5.89 million tons by 2020. The recovery price for cassava bioethanol was estimated to be US$ 0.74/litre (N 111/litre). Petrol being subsidised presently is harmful to the environment though it 'oils' the economy. Nigeria currently subsidizes petroleum products to the tune of 28% of 2011 budget. The government plans to remove this by 2012. Thus we conclude that weighing both economic and environmental benefits of bioethanol substitution in petrol consumption in Nigeria, the study showed that bioethanol production from cassava feedstock would be both technically and economically viable, provided subsidy, which depends on political will on the side of the government, is introduced for the first ten years of its implementation.

AB  - Biofuels represent a possibility to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the transport sector. In this context the sustainability of biofuels, especially so called 1 st generation biofuels led to controversial discussions in the past. Biofuels from waste and residues represent a well suited but quantitative limited alternative due to their sustainability. At an international level, different approaches for converting waste and residues into biofuels can be found. Developing countries in general use classic transesterification of waste fats to produce biodiesel. Technically advanced options such as pyrolysis, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch-Diesel, anaerobic fermentation and distillation, as well as biogas production coupled with biomethane upgrading, are mostly found in industrialized countries. Within this study, different waste to biofuel options are reviewed ranging from small scale to industrial scale and take into account used raw materials, technological application and (potential) GHG-reduction. Further the potential of several wastes and residues for gasification processes and synthesis of biofuels in Germany is described. Biofuel from waste offers promising funding incentives because of the "double counting" according to 2009/28/EC and the switch in mandatory blending from an amount based quota to a GHG-based blending quota in 2015. © 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece All rights reserved.

AB  - Members of the plant family Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are not only interesting because they represent the smallest flowering plants; they possess also the fastest rates of producing biomass. As aquatic plants, duckweed production is not in competition with other agricultural crops that require fertile land while the cultivation of duckweeds does not contribute to further eutrophication of surface water. Instead, they can be cultivated on municipal or agricultural waste water and remove the nutrients during their propagation and growth. Duckweeds can thus be used for cleaning of waste water and the resulting biomass can be valuable starting material for animal feeds and the production of biofuels. Research focusing on these goals has begun to transfer from research laboratories to pilot plants in different parts of the world, e.g. in New Jersey and North Carolina, USA; Chengdu, P. R. China; and Armidale, Australia. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - As demand for energy increases in the United States, alternative energy sources are being sought both domestically and abroad. Biofuels have been promoted as a major source of alternative energy, but sustainable supply of biomass still remains a major challenge. Agroforestry offers a potential way to integrate perennial woody bioenergy crops with traditional agricultural crops to satisfy energy demands without sacrificing food production in the North Central Region of the United States. We suggest shelterbelts, alley cropping and working riparian buffer strips as ideal candidates for biomass production in agroforestry settings in this region. In addition to satisfying domestic energy demands, these systems could also potentially increase water quality, sequester carbon, improve aesthetics, and provide critical wildlife habitat. However, obstacles to implementing agroforestry systems for biomass production, such as a competitive price structure and stable markets, must be overcome before large-scale adoption by landowners. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Feedstock crops selected for bioenergy production to date are almost exclusively perennial grasses because of favorable physiological traits that enhance growth, water use, and nutrient assimilation efficiency. Grasses, however, tend to rely primarily on physical defenses, such as silica, to deter herbivores. Silica impedes processing of feedstocks and introduces a trade-off between managing for cost efficiency (i.e., yield) and plant defenses. To test how silica modulates herbivory in two of the most preferred feedstock crops for production across the central United States, miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef and Deuter ex Hodkinson and Renvoize) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), we examined the performance of two immature generalist insect herbivores, fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) and the American grasshopper [Schistocerca americana (Drury)], on grasses grown under silica and nitrogen amendment. Both miscanthus and switchgrass assimilated nitrogen and silica when grown in amended soil that altered the consumption and conversion efficiency of herbivores consuming leaf tissue. The magnitude of nutrient assimilation, however, depended on intrinsic plant traits. Nitrogen increased conversion efficiency for both fall armyworm and American grasshopper but increased consumption rate only for fall armyworm. Silica reduced conversion efficiency and increased consumption rate only for the American grasshopper. Because of this variability, management strategies that reduce silica or increase nitrogen content in feedstock crops to enhance yields may directly influence the ability of bioenergy grasses to deter certain generalist herbivores. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - An environmental, climate mitigation rationale for research and development (R&D) on liquid transportation fuels derived from plants emerged among many scientists and engineers during the last decade. However, between 2006 and 2010, this climate ethic for pursuing biofuel became politically entangled and conceptually confused with rationales for encouraging greater use of plant-based ethanol that were both unconnected to climate ethics and potentially in conflict with the value-commitments providing a mitigation-oriented reason to promote and develop new and expanded sources of biofuel. I argue that the conceptual construct of technological trajectories provides a fecund approach to the ethical evaluation of R&D strategies in the case of plant-based liquid transportation fuels. The idea of a trajectory has a current use in the literature of science studies and aptly summarizes a number of themes that are critical to the evaluation of tools and techniques whose future shape, design, applications and potential consequences are necessarily somewhat speculative. In the case of biofuels, it is the imagined future trajectory that provides the basis for resistance to an emerging technology, rather than the present-day technical capabilities and the unexpected consequences of biofuel development. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. is a perennial grass being considered for bioenergy production in the United States (USA) and elsewhere. Because M. sinensis is already naturalized in the USA, it is important to examine its potential to spread with further introduction. Introduced populations may harbor substantial genetic diversity or enable genetic admixture, which may enhance adaptation to novel environments. Here we compare genetic diversity in introduced US populations with native Japanese populations to understand the potential for invasiveness through genetic means in M. sinensis. Using 11 microsatellite markers, we determined genetic variation and structure in populations within and across the introduced and native ranges. We also correlated genetic diversity with population size in each range. Genetic diversity was substantial and similar in all populations, with only allelic richness (A, Ap) significantly lower in the USA than in Japan. Japanese populations were slightly more differentiated (θ=0.098) than those in the USA (θ=0.078) although both exhibited significant genetic admixture and were composed of a number of different genetic groups (K=3 or 7, depending on the STRUCTURE model). Genetic diversity (He) was positively correlated with population size, but only in the USA The lack of a genetic bottleneck and the consequent maintenance of genetic diversity and admixture in US populations suggest the potential for further spread of introduced populations, assuming such diversity is important for adaptation to novel environments. Potential invasiveness should be considered by breeders of new Miscanthus varieties for bioenergy and ornamental uses. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - While a growing body of research indicates the severe ecological and social costs of biofuel production worldwide, the U.S. government continues to promote the expansion of this fuel sector. Recent congressional testimony regarding the promotion of biofuels via the renewable fuel standard (RFS) offers a strategic research site for sociological investigation into the practices of key political actors and their roles in promoting and discouraging ecologically oriented change. Congressional hearings provide a window into the political process of energy policy formation, thus informing environmental sociological theory and debates. The ecological modernization perspective and its assumptions provide the analytical frame of this empirical analysis of congressional hearings during the peak legislative period concerning biofuels. This research is intended to contribute to alternative energy debates, add to our understanding of the role of various actors in energy policy formation, and further theoretical developments within sociology. © 2012, by the Rural Sociological Society.

AB  - Green microalgae, due to their short growth cycle and to their ability to photosynthetically fix carbon dioxide producing an oil-rich biomass, have been proposed as an attractive alternative feedstock for the production of "second generation" biofuels. However, it has been anticipated that owing to their ability to colonize very different environments characterized by high levels of nitrogen, they can also be good candidates for bioremediation, thus integrating environmental protection with sustainable biomass production. We have isolated a strain belonging to Scenedesmus genus from urban wastewater. This isolate, Scenedesmus acutus PVUW12, was tested for its ability to grow and actively deplete eutrophicating inorganic molecules present in wastewater. In order to test its biomass productivity, the PVUW12 strain was grown in a vertical-column photobioreactor using standard growth medium obtaining a maximal productivity of 0.3 g dry weight L -1 d. When the same strain was grown in the photobioreactor filled with wastewater collected from the final step of the local urban purifier plant containing 18.8 mg L -1 nitrate, we observed complete nitrogen removal coupled with a biomass production of about 0.74 g dry weight L -1 within 3 days. After 10 days, the recovered biomass was analyzed for triglyceride content which was found to be 9.3% of the dry biomass. However, when algal cells were left for additional 10 days in static conditions the triglyceride content increased to 28.8%. These data show that this Scenedesmus strain can be used for wastewater bioremediation producing a biomass suitable for energy production. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Common methods for assaying acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymatic activity rely upon radiolabeled substrates or product assay. We developed a novel assay that directly quantifies endogenous DGAT activity through the use of a fluorescently labeled substrate. We performed this assay with microsomal protein, 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-diacylglycerol (NBD-DAG), and oleoyl-CoA substrates. DGAT activity was analyzed in three species of algae as well as rat liver. The protocol proved to be sensitive and reliable. This assay may be used to facilitate research in the areas of biodiesel, oilseed crops, and triacylglycerol-related human pathologies. © 2012 Phycological Society of America.

AB  - Accurate and quick field estimation of crop residues is important for carbon sequestration and biofuel production programs. Landscape-scale assessment of this vital information has resorted to the use of remote sensing technology. The cellulose absorption index (CAI) technique has outperformed other indices for discriminating bare soil and crop residue in the Midwest, but has not been tested in the Pacific Northwest and the Central and Northern Great Plains regions of the United States. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of CAI in these regions. Malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), durum (Triticum turgidum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow following spring wheat and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) were used in the assessment. Using a portable ground-based spectroradiometer, as well as transect line and photo-grid methods, crop residue cover was measured after the 2009 harvest season. Samples were collected for laboratory analyses. Linear regression analysis showed CAI explained 41% to 55% of the variation in the residue cover. Field pea and fallow residue cover had better correlation with CAI than did small grain crop residues. Field and laboratory measurement of CAI showed that varying pea residue cover responded significantly different than other crop residues. The performance of CAI was affected by the type of crop rather than by location and soil type in the regions. Among other measured parameters, percentage crop residue cover, hemicellulose, and residue amount were most correlated with CAI. Results document that CAI can quickly and effectively estimate percentage of residue cover in the regions. Copyright © 2012 Soil and Water Conservation Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper considers the use of a non-edible plant, Jatropha curcas (J. curcas), for the production of biofuel as a substitute for traditional fossil fuel. It is shown that the net energy balance and greenhouse gases (GHGs) balance are positive. The investment value in biofuel from J. curcas is also studied, and both its intrinsic and option values are calculated. A reference case is evaluated, namely, the cultivation of J. curcas as a substitute for conventional fuel in a specific less-developed country, Kenya, that lies in the tropical region where J. curcas grows. The investment is modeled as a perpetual investment call option. It is shown that the Net Present Value is positive for a vast range of discount factors and investment costs, while the option value depends crucially on the parameters of the model. A positive option value points out those cases in which it is optimal to defer the investment even if it entails a positive and possibly high Net Present Value. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - From a sustainability perspective, the potential risks associated with microalgae production for biofuel extraction will be investigated in this paper, including the environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions. Environmentally, four main concerns are mapped out: first, there are potential water safety risks, such as water resource abuse, water pollution and groundwater recharge deficiency; second, unreasonable construction will lead to land-use overexpansion, land pollution and service expectancy reduction; third, microalgae production may exert a detrimental effect on the local ecosystem, causing algal blooms and biological invasion; finally, microalgae might emit unexpected greenhouse gases [nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH 4)] and ammonia (NH3). From an economic risk standpoint, microalgae production requires an overwhelming investment due to the expensive start-up and operation. Socially, contaminant discharge will threaten the health of local animals and people. Moreover, the safety effects of genetically modified algae may not be immediately apparent or known. In addition, over time, microalgae may become a medium for mosquitoes to spread disease. From a cultural point of view, it requires time for people in developing countries to adapt algal oil to their daily life as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, personnel changes in the workforce may harm existing cultural structures, and landscape aesthetics may be affected by system construction. Taking the above challenges into consideration, efficient government policies, proactive company behaviours and positive public participation will play an important role in minimising or even eliminating these potential risks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The EU's Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28) requires that by 2020, biofuels should account for at least 10 per cent of transport fuel consumption. EU legislation sets out sustainability criteria for biofuels to qualify for this target and procedures for verifying that they are met. Using the AGLINK-COSIMO model, we investigate the impacts of the biofuel target on global trade flows and land use, both under the current biofuel tariff regime and assuming zero EU tariffs for biofuels. The EU's 2020 transport fuel target increases the global area of agricultural crops by 0.9 per cent. With zero tariffs, the extra global land requirement is 21 per cent smaller, but a larger share of it falls outside the EU. This outcome sharpens the issue of how the EU's unilateral sustainability criteria can be implemented given current international trade rules. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Fossil energy and chemical sources are depleting. There is a critical need to change the current industry and human civilization to a sustainable manner, assuring that our way of life actual continues on the path of improvement after the depletion of fossil energy sources. The utilization of agricultural residues as raw materials in a biorefinery is a promising alternative to fossil resources for production of energy carriers and chemicals, thus mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security. Biorefinery is a concept of converting lignocellulosic biomass or grains (such as corn) to chemicals, materials and energy on which human civilization runs, replacing the need for petroleum, coal, natural gas, and other nonrenewable energy and chemical sources. Lignocellulosic biomass is renewable, that is plant synthesizes chemicals (by drawing energy from the sun and carbon dioxide) and water from the environment, while releasing oxygen. Combustion of biomass releases energy, carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, biorefinery plays a key role in satisfying human needs for energy and chemicals by using the biomass production and consumption cycle. This paper focuses on a biorefinery concept and in particular on the bioethanol production from wood residues. In order to evaluate the environmental reliability of the system under study, the biorefinery plant (producing bioethanol and electricity from wood residues) was compared, by using the LCA methodology, to both conventional refinery system (producing light fuel oil and electricity from petroleum) and biorefinery plant based on corn feedstock producing the same goods. Interesting considerations about LUC emissions effect on biorefinery sustainability are also reported. The obtained results show that by assigning reasonable values to the three damage categories used in the eco-indicator 99 methodology the biorefinery system is preferable, from an environmental point of view, to the conventional refinery system analysed. This finding confirms the high potentials of this innovative plant technology. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - In the Midwestern USA, current biofuel production systems rely on high input monoculture crops that do little to support native biodiversity. The University of Northern Iowa's Tallgrass Prairie Center is investigating the feasibility of cultivating and harvesting diverse mixes of native prairie vegetation for use as a sustainable biofuel in a manner that also conserves biodiversity and protects soil and water resources. In 2009, we established 48 research plots on three soil types at an Iowa site with a uniform history of row crop production. We seeded each plot with one of four treatments of native prairie vegetation: (1) switchgrass monoculture, (2) warm-season grass mix (5 grass species), (3) biomass mix (16 species of grasses, legumes, and forbs), or (4) prairie mix (32 species of grasses, legumes, forbs, and sedges). In 2010, we measured vegetation characteristics and studied butterfly use of the plots to investigate the hypothesis that more diverse plant communities would support a greater abundance and diversity of butterflies. Habitat characteristics varied significantly among the plots by treatment and soil type, and butterflies responded rapidly to variation in floral abundance and richness. Averaged over the entire growing season, butterflies were six times more abundant and twice as species rich in the biomass and prairie mix plots compared to the warm-season grass and switchgrass plots. Our results suggest that implementation of biomass production using diverse mixes of native prairie vegetation on marginal lands could have positive effects on the maintenance of butterfly populations in agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Climate change and energy security concerns have driven the development of policies that encourage bioenergy production. Meeting EU targets for the consumption of transport fuels from bioenergy by 2020 will require a large increase in the production of bioenergy feedstock. Initially an increase in 'first generation' biofuels was observed, however 'food competition' concerns have generated interest in second generation biofuels (SGBs). These SGBs can be produced from co-products (e.g. cereal straw) or energy crops (e.g. miscanthus), with the former largely negating food competition concerns. In order to assess the sustainability of feedstock supply for SGBs, the financial, environmental and energy costs and benefits of the farm system must be quantified. Previous research has captured financial costs and benefits through linear programming (LP) approaches, whilst environmental and energy metrics have been largely been undertaken within life cycle analysis (LCA) frameworks. Assessing aspects of the financial, environmental and energy sustainability of supplying co-product second generation biofuel (CPSGB) feedstocks at the farm level requires a framework that permits the trade-offs between these objectives to be quantified and understood. The development of a modelling framework for Managing Energy and Emissions Trade-Offs in Agriculture (MEETA Model) that combines bio-economic process modelling and LCA is presented together with input data parameters obtained from literature and industry sources. The MEETA model quantifies arable farm inputs and outputs in terms of financial, energy and emissions results. The model explicitly captures fertiliser: crop-yield relationships, plus the incorporation of straw or removal for sale, with associated nutrient impacts of incorporation/removal on the following crop in the rotation. Key results of crop-mix, machinery use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kg of crop product and energy use per hectare are in line with previous research and industry survey findings. Results show that the gross margin - energy trade-off is £36GJ-1, representing the gross margin forgone by maximising net farm energy cf. maximising farm gross margin. The gross margin-GHG emission trade-off is £0.15kg-1 CO2 eq, representing the gross margin forgone per kg of CO2 eq reduced when GHG emissions are minimised cf. maximising farm gross margin. The energy-GHG emission trade-off is 0.03GJkg-1CO2 eq quantifying the reduction in net energy from the farm system per kg of CO2 eq reduced when minimising GHG emissions cf. maximising net farm energy. When both farm gross margin and net farm energy are maximised all the cereal straw is baled for sale. Sensitivity analysis of the model in relation to different prices of cereal straw shows that it becomes financially optimal to incorporate wheat straw at price of £11t-1 for this co-product. Local market conditions for straw and farmer attitudes towards incorporation or sale of straw will impact on the straw price at which farmers will supply this potential bioenergy feedstock and represent important areas for future research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Feedstock Readiness Level (FSRL) tool was developed by the US Department of Agriculture, US Federal Aviation Administration, and Research and Innovative Technology Administration to describe the steps involved in bringing plant-based feedstocks to market for aviation biofuels production. A candidate feedstock is assigned a FSRL level from 1 through 9, indicating an increasing level of maturity towards commercialization. The FSRL level also communicates the state of development of a feedstock concurrent with its readiness for use with a conversion process. There are four components to the FSRL (production, market, policy, and linkage to conversion process), each with one to four tollgate descriptions per readiness level. The FSRL tool was structured to complement the Fuel Readiness Level (FRL) tool in use by the aviation industry as an internationally recognized communication best practice. Similarly, the FSRL can be used to identify gaps in any feedstock supply chain designed for any biofuel or conversion process that provides a market for feedstocks. This integrated feedstock and conversion technology approach can facilitate a coordinated allocation of resources to effectively plan for and develop a viable aviation biofuels industry. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - This study was designed to examine carbon utilization within scalable microalgae production systems. Neochloris oleoabundans was produced in replicated troughs containing BG11 nutrient formulation. Atmospheric CO 2 was supplemented with ∼5% CO 2 or with NaHCO 3, and the pH of troughs receiving NaHCO 3 was adjusted with HCl or H 3PO 4. Peak biomass concentrations reached 950, 1140, or 850mgL -1 and biomass productivities of 109, 96, and 74mgL -1 day -1 were achieved in the CO 2, NaHCO 3:HCl and NaHCO 3:H 3PO 4 troughs, respectively. The highest productivity is expected in a scaled-up continuous batch process of the CO 2 supplemented system, which was projected to yield 8948L lipids ha -1yr -1. Carbon utilization in the CO 2, NaHCO 3:HCl and NaHCO 3:H 3PO 4 systems was ∼0.5, 15.5, and 12.9%, while the energy content of the combustible biomass was 26.7, 13.2, and 15.4MJkg -1, respectively. Techno-economic analyses of microalgal production systems should consider efficiencies and cost-benefit of various carbon sources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High biomass productivity and efficient harvesting are currently recognized challenges in microbial biofuel applications. To produce naturally settleable biomass, combined growth of native microalgae and bacteria was facilitated in laboratory sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) using primary treated wastewater from the Christchurch Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWTP) in New Zealand. SBRs were operated under a simulated, local, summer climate (i.e., 925 μmol/m2/s of photosynthetically active radiation for 14.7 h per day at 21 °C mean water temperature) using 1.4- to 8-day hydraulic retention times (HRTs) to optimize growth. Solids retention times (SRTs) were varied from 4 to 40 days by discharging different ratios of supernatant and completely mixed culture. Biomass productivity up to 31 g/m2/day of solids was obtained, and it generally increased as retention times decreased. Biomass settleability was typically 70-95%, and the microbes aggregated into compact flocs as cultures aged up to four months. Due to a low lipid content of 10.5%, anaerobic digestion appeared to be the most appropriate biofuel conversion process with potential to generate 19,200 m3/ha/yr of methane based on settleable mixture productivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Genetic engineering of Clostridium cellulolyticum has been developed slowly compared with that of other clostridial species, and one of the major reasons might be the restriction and modification (RM) system which degrades foreign DNA. Here, a putative MspI endonuclease gene, ccel2866, was inactivated by a ClosTron-based gene disruption method. The resulting C. cellulolyticum mutant H10δ mspI lost the MspI endonuclease activity and can accept unmethylated DNA efficiently. Following that, an oxygen-independent green fluorescence protein gene was introduced into H10δ mspI without methylation, generating a convenient reporter system to evaluate the expression of heterologous protein in C. cellulolyticum by green fluorescence. To further demonstrate the efficiency of the H10δ mspI, double mutants H10δ mspIδ ldh and H10δ mspIδ ack were constructed by disrupting lactate dehydrogenase gene ccel2485 and acetate kinase gene ccel2136 in H10δ mspI, respectively, without DNA methylation, and the stability of the double mutation was confirmed after the 100th generation. The mutant H10δ mspI constructed here can be used as a platform for further targeted gene manipulation conveniently and efficiently. It will greatly facilitate the metabolic engineering of C. cellulolyticum aiming at faster cellulose degradation and higher biofuel production at the molecular level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There has been a growing interest in liquid biofuels during the recent years due to concerns about security of energy supply and global climate change. Targets have been set throughout the globe for blending biofuels into conventional petroleum fuels. In this paper, an optimisation framework for the strategic design of a hybrid first/second generation ethanol supply chain is presented. The model seeks to address sustainability issues such as the use of food crops, land use requirements of second generation crops and competition for biomass with other sectors. The applicability of the model is demonstrated with a case study of ethanol production in the UK. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examined the impacts of increased biofuel feedstock production on regional water resource and water quality. We focused on the Upper Mississippi river basin, from which a majority of U.S. biofuel is produced at present. The production of biofuel from both conventional feedstock and cellulosic feedstock will potentially increase in the near future, and a significant portion of the cellulosic feedstock is expected to come from this region. In this work, we developed future scenarios of biofuel feedstock production in 2015 to assess the potential water quality and quantity changes associated with an increase in biofuel production through corn yield increase, harvesting a fraction of corn stover, and converting land to perennial grass (switchgrass). The estimates are accomplished by a watershed model SWAT. Results project a slight increase in phosphorus loading and decrease in nitrogen loading when corn yield is increased without cellulosic feedstock production. Harvesting a fraction of corn stover with improved management and efficient nitrogen use could lead to a decrease in nitrogen loading (up to 10%) and phosphorus loading (2%) when soil properties remain constant. Changes in sediment loadings are relatively minor. Growing switchgrass reduces soil erosion considerably and positively impacts nitrogen and phosphorus loadings at the projected yield and fertilizer input while switching from pasture to switchgrass would increase the water loss associated with ET (1% of total precipitation), decrease base flow (2%), and decrease the surface runoff flow to the basin. Major factors - including land use changes, feedstock types, fertilizer inputs, crop yield, and soil properties - were analyzed for their direct and composite impacts. © 2012.

AB  - We present a detailed analysis of the supply potential and use of biomass in the context of a transition to a fully renewable global energy system by 2050. We investigate bioenergy potential within a framework of technological choices and sustainability criteria, including criteria on land use and food security, agricultural and processing inputs, complementary fellings, residues and waste. This makes our approach more comprehensive, more stringent in the applied sustainability criteria and more detailed on both the supply potential and the demand side use of biomass than that of most other studies.We find that the potential for sustainable bioenergy from residues and waste, complementary fellings, energy crops and algae oil in 2050 is 340 EJ a -1 of primary energy. This potential is then compared to the demand for biomass-based energy in the demand scenario related to this study, the Ecofys Energy Scenario [1]. This scenario, after applying energy efficiency and non-bioenergy renewable options, requires a significant contribution of bioenergy to meet the remaining energy demand; 185 EJ a -1 of the 340 EJ a -1 potential supply. For land use for energy crops, we find that a maximum of 2,500,000 km 2 is needed of a 6,730,000 km 2 sustainable potential. For greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy, a 75%-85% reduction can be achieved compared to fossil references.We conclude that bioenergy can meet residual demand in the Ecofys Energy Scenario sustainably with low associated greenhouse gas emissions. It thus contributes to its achievement of a 95% renewable energy system globally by 2050. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding and quantifying the impact of bioenergy crops on soil carbon (C) storage is an essential component of crop management. Our objectives were to (i) compare total (TC), organic (OC), and inorganic carbon (IC) storage under Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers and the energy crop Arundo donax L. along the soil profile, and (ii) determine the effect of these crops on available soil C (measured as hot water extractable C, HC) as an indirect indicator of soil C changes. The study site was within the Rio Grande floodplain in Quemado, Texas covered by A. donax and C. dactylon. Soil samples were taken from five soil depths: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm at 125 locations in a 34.5 ha field; TC, IC, and HC were measured and OC was derived. In all four C pools, soils under A. donax had higher C content (volumetric C or Cv, kg m -2) than soils under C. dactylon, except for IC at the top two depths. Larger soil C storage under A. donax as compared to C. dactylon was consistent throughout the profile. The effect was most pronounced for volumetric HC content (HCv) with 43% higher amount under A. donax than C. dactylon at 0-10 cm depth. In areas, where A. donax is considered an invasive species, the available biomass can be used for bioenergy production and the higher soil carbon under A. donax can provide additional economic return in a C economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Green biorefinery (GBR) is an alternative use of grassland biomass. GBR involves applying technology to chemically and physically fractionate (split) biomass such as grass and grass silage to produce marketable products. Three GBR system models were developed in a companion paper to determine, using scenario analysis, the most technically feasible scenario for the development of a blueprint Irish GBR system. The three GBR system models were a combination of feedstock system and biorefinery technology: Grass/silage - basic technology (GS), Silage - basic technology (S) and Silage - advanced technology (AT). The models were then assessed at different input volumes. The focus of this paper is on the development of the economic modelling component of the three GBR system models in order to identify which of the previously selected GBR scenarios is the most technically and economically viable to develop a blueprint for a first generation GBR. Six scenarios were assessed in this paper. The GS, S and AT GBR systems, at two input volume rates: medium volume and low volume. Additional scenario analyses were also carried out to investigate two possible production scenarios "No Prot" (fibre product only), and "Prot" (includes proteinaceous secondary product). Both the economic and technical scenario analyses of this paper and its companion paper suggest the most appropriate GBR systems for a first generation Irish blueprint are the combination of Silage feedstock - basic biorefinery technology (S), at the medium input volume and both "Prot" and "No Prot" systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the issues related to the increased use of biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) in the transport sector concerns their higher production costs, either in pure or blended form, as compared to conventional fuels (gasoline and diesel). Based on the average cost of biodiesel, the former is not able to compete with diesel if no subsidies are provided by the government to boost its cost competitiveness. However, such a cost comparison is not a true reflection of the various potential benefits of biofuels. This study aims to evaluate the influence of externalities on the cost performance of various palm oil biodiesel blends (B5, B10 and B100) when internalized into their respective production cost for the case of Thailand. A case study of palm oil biodiesel has been assessed and compared to conventional diesel. An income elasticity of willingness to pay (WTP) was used as multiplier factor to transfer the values of selected environmental damage costs obtained from the Environmental Priority Strategies (EPS) methodology into Thai context. The three key environmental burdens considered in this work include land use, fossil energy resources depletion and air pollutants emissions i.e. CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, CO, NO x, SO 2, VOC and PM10. The results obtained indicate that environmental costs contribute to 34% of the total costs of conventional diesel. In comparison to diesel and for the same performance, the total environmental cost of biodiesel based palm methyl ester (PME) is about 3-76% lower depending on the blending levels. This is mainly due to two major advantages that biofuels present which are a reduction in the depletion of fossil energy resources and mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. In terms of net social benefits, the promotion of biodiesel to replace diesel is economically feasible contributing a gain in welfare of about 0.01 and 0.76 THB L -1 diesel equivalent for B5 and B10 respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Switchgrass is one of the most promising bioenergy crop candidates for the US. It gives relativelyhigh biomass yield and can grow on marginal lands. However, its yields vary from year to year and from location tolocation. Thus it is imperative to develop a low input and sustainable switchgrass feedstock production system. Oneof the most feasible ways to increase biomass yields is to harness benefits of microbial endophytes.Results: We demonstrate that one of the most studied plant growth promoting bacterial endophytes, Burkholderiaphytofirmans strain PsJN, is able to colonize and significantly promote growth of switchgrass cv. Alamo underin vitro, growth chamber, and greenhouse conditions. In several in vitro experiments, the average fresh weight ofPsJN-inoculated plants was approximately 50% higher than non-inoculated plants. When one-month-old seedlingswere grown in a growth chamber for 30 days, the PsJN-inoculated Alamo plants had significantly higher shoot androot biomass compared to controls. Biomass yield (dry weight) averaged from five experiments was 54.1% higher inthe inoculated treatment compared to non-inoculated control. Similar results were obtained in greenhouseexperiments with transplants grown in 4-gallon pots for two months. The inoculated plants exhibited more earlytillers and persistent growth vigor with 48.6% higher biomass than controls. We also found that PsJN couldsignificantly promote growth of switchgrass cv. Alamo under sub-optimal conditions. However, PsJN-mediatedgrowth promotion in switchgrass is genotype specific.Conclusions: Our results show B. phytofirmans strain PsJN significantly promotes growth of switchgrass cv. Alamounder different conditions, especially in the early growth stages leading to enhanced production of tillers. Thisphenomenon may benefit switchgrass establishment in the first year. Moreover, PsJN significantly stimulatedgrowth of switchgrass cv. Alamo under sub-optimal conditions, indicating that the use of the beneficial bacterialendophytes may boost switchgrass growth on marginal lands and significantly contribute to the development of alow input and sustainable feedstock production system. © 2012 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol from corn stover is expected to play an important role in achieving the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 target of 136.25 billion liters (36 billion gallons) of biofuel by 2022. The 2010 USDA biofuel strategic report estimates that 16.3 billion liters (4.3 billion gallons) of biofuel from crop residues such as corn stover and straw is possible. Corn stover is expected to provide the majority of the estimated biofuel from crop residues, especially from the Midwestern US Corn Belt. A major concern related to removing corn stover is potential negative hydrologic and water quality impacts. The overall goal of this study was to estimate the watershed scale environmental impacts of corn stover removal in an agricultural watershed in the Midwest US. Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate the impacts associated with three corn stover removal rates (38%, 52% and 70%). The stream flow, nitrate and mineral phosphorus loading were reduced, and sediment and organic nitrogen loading were increased at the watershed outlet with all three stover removal scenarios. The stream flow was reduced by 1.4%, 2.0% and 2.7% from the baseline scenario (no stover removed) at 38%, 52% and 70% stover removal rates, respectively. The sediment loading increased by 19.7%, 22.5% and 29.0%, organic nitrogen increased by 0.8%, 2.0% and 5.5%, mineral phosphorus decreased by 11.7%, 15.5% and 21.0%, and nitrate decreased by 2.0%, 3.2% and 5.3% from the baseline scenario at the watershed outlet with 38%, 52% and 70% stover removal rates, respectively.

AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAPs) impose significant social costs on the population of the Agulhas Plain region in South Africa due to their adverse impacts on ecosystem goods and services (decreased water supply and increased fire risk). While the cost of clearing IAPs is considerable, this paper assesses opportunities to reduce some of the social and environmental burdens (e.g. disruptions of ecosystems which have negative impacts on livelihoods) by using IAP biomass to produce bio-energy. However, such an initiative could increase financial dependency on these plants and is thus considered to be a major risk factor which could create adverse incentives to illegally grow these plants. A participatory decision-making process with active stakeholder participation is a key element in managing such an initiative. We used a multi-stakeholder engagement process and the analytical hierarchy process to define and weigh suitable criteria for the assessment of different "IAP biomass to bio-energy" technology scenarios on the Agulhas Plain. Feasible scenarios were constructed by means of an expert panel which were then ranked according to stakeholder preference. The six criteria were: minimising impacts on natural resources; job creation; certainty of benefits to local people in the study area; development of skills for life; technology performance and cost efficiency. This ranking was largely determined by the preference for resource efficiency in terms of minimising impacts on natural ecosystems and the localisation of benefits. The smaller, modular technologies were consequently preferred since these realise direct local benefits while developing local skills and capacity in their manufacture, sales and maintenance. The rankings as obtained in this study are context-bound, which implies that the findings only have limited application to areas with similar biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. However, the method itself is fully generalisable, and the same prioritisation process can be followed in any study area to ensure that a participatory decision-making process fulfils local energy needs and contributes to sustainable development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent high-profile efforts have called for integrating ecosystemservice values into important societal decisions, but there are few demonstrations of this approach in practice. We quantified ecosystem-service values to help the largest private landowner in Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, design a land-use development plan that balances multiple private and public values on its North Shore land holdings (Island of O'ahu) of ∼10,600 ha. We used the InVEST software tool to evaluate the environmental and financial implications of seven planning scenarios encompassing contrasting land-use combinations including biofuel feedstocks, food crops, forestry, livestock, and residential development. All scenarios had positive financial return relative to the status quo of negative return. However, tradeoffs existed between carbon storage and water quality as well as between environmental improvement and financial return. Based on this analysis and community input, Kamehameha Schools is implementing a plan to support diversified agriculture and forestry. This plan generates a positive financial return ($10.9 million) and improved carbon storage (0.5% increase relative to status quo) with negative relative effects on water quality (15.4% increase in potential nitrogen export relative to status quo). The effects on water quality could be mitigated partially (reduced to a 4.9% increase in potential nitrogen export) by establishing vegetation buffers on agricultural fields. This plan contributes to policy goals for climate change mitigation, food security, and diversifying rural economic opportunities. More broadly, our approach illustrates how information can help guide local land-use decisions that involve tradeoffs between private and public interests.

AB  - The inclusion of cellulosic ethanol in the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 and the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) has spurred development of the first commercial scale cellulosic ethanol biorefineries. These efforts have also revived interest in the development of dedicated energy crops selected for biomass productivity and for properties that facilitate conversion of biomass to liquid fuels. While many aspects of developing these feedstocks are compatible with current agricultural activities, improving biomass productivity may provide opportunities to expand the potential for biofuel production beyond the classical research objectives associated with improving traditional food and feed crops. © 2012 Faculty of 1000 Ltd.

AB  - We present SSR-based genetic maps from a cross between Miscanthus sacchariflorus Robustus and M. sinensis, the progenitors of the promising cellulosic biofuel feedstock Miscanthus × giganteus. cDNA-derived SSR markers were mapped by the two-way pseudo-testcross model due to the high heterozygosity of each parental species. A total of 261 loci were mapped in M. sacchariflorus, spanning 40 linkage groups and 1,998.8 cM, covering an estimated 72.7% of the genome. For M. sinensis, a total of 303 loci were mapped, forming 23 linkage groups and 2,238.3 cM, covering 84.9% of the genome. The use of cDNA-derived SSR loci permitted alignment of the Miscanthus linkage groups to the sorghum chromosomes, revealing a whole genome duplication affecting the Miscanthus lineage after the divergence of subtribes Sorghinae and Saccharinae, as well as traces of the pan-cereal whole genome duplication. While the present maps provide for many early research needs in this emerging crop, additional markers are also needed to improve map density and to further characterize the structural changes of the Miscanthus genome since its divergence from sorghum and Saccharum. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Most halophyte species experience drought, salinity and high temperature stresses in their growth period, and sensitivity to any of these may affect plant tolerance to others. Among halophytes, Kochia scoparia have recently considered as forage and fodder crop in marginal lands. In order to evaluate interaction of saline water application and water deficit effect on growth parameters, water-salinity production function and physiological parameters, a series of experiments were conducted with different levels of saline water (1.5 to 42 dS/m) and different levels of applied water (25 to 125% of the water requirement) in the farm and greenhouse. Results showed that Kochia like other halophytes is sensitive to drought and salinity at the earliest stages of growth. Salinity reduced linear phase of growth and decreased biomass production but salinity tolerance of Kochia was improved by increasing water application. Evaluation of yield response factor under water deficit and salinity showed that there is not any significant difference among water deficit treatments up to 21 dSm-1. There was no significant difference in biomass of medium drought stress and control. Plants showed more tolerance against drought stress, when stress was induced in the whole growth season. In all experiments, ecotypes from the arid regions, revealed a better response to drought and salinity. Under severe drought and salinity, Kochia still could produce up to 16 and 8 t DM ha-1 biomass in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Salinity tolerance of Kochia was improved by increasing water application. Results of water depletion from different soil layers showed that Kochia uptakes more water from the 30-60 cm soil depth. The soil salinity (ECe) of this section was lower in comparison to the 0-30 cm soil depth. Additionally, the water uptake of the 30-60 cm soil depth improved the salt tolerance level of Kochia. At 75% application of water requirement, Kochia produced 90% of biomass in comparison to 100% water application. Therefore, deficit irrigation is a useful management technique for Kochia even under saline conditions. The results of the present study demonstrated that some indices regarding growth of Kochia and probably other halophytes under salinity, drought and their combination should seriously be revised. Kochia also could be considered as a forage crop or biofuel material by using saline water in semi-arid areas.

AB  - Maize is one of the most important crops in the world. The products generated from this crop are largely used in the starch industry, the animal and human nutrition sector, and biomass energy production and refineries. For these reasons, there is much interest in figuring the potential grain yield of maize genotypes in relation to the environment in which they will be grown, as the productivity directly affects agribusiness or farm profitability. Questions like these can be investigated with ecophysiological crop models, which can be organized according to different philosophies and structures. The main objective of this work is to conceptualize a stochastic model for predicting maize grain yield and productivity under different conditions of water supply while considering the uncertainties of daily climate data. Therefore, one focus is to explain the model construction in detail, and the other is to present some results in light of the philosophy adopted. A deterministic model was built as the basis for the stochastic model. The former performed well in terms of the curve shape of the above-ground dry matter over time as well as the grain yield under full and moderate water deficit conditions. Through the use of a triangular distribution for the harvest index and a bivariate normal distribution of the averaged daily solar radiation and air temperature, the stochastic model satisfactorily simulated grain productivity, i.e., it was found that 10,604 kg ha-1 is the most likely grain productivity, very similar to the productivity simulated by the deterministic model and for the real conditions based on a field experiment. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Hydrologic variables in the Great Lakes region have been altered relative to pre-settlement conditions in response to major land use changes during the past 150 years. One of the goals of the present work is to develop a baseline scenario relative to which the impacts of land use changes on hydrological and environmental processes can be evaluated. In addition, this study can help in quantifying the potential impacts of future projected changes in land use in order to mitigate the negative impacts of these changes, especially in regard to a shift toward urbanization and second-generation bioenergy crop production derived from lignocellulosic crops. The present study explores the relationship between land use changes and hydrologic indicators within the agricultural regions of Michigan and Wisconsin. Two sets of land use data, the circa 1800 county base and the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset, were used to set up the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. First, sensitivity analyses were performed based on both pre-settlement and current land use scenarios. Results showed that parameter sensitivity analysis may not always explain how the variation in model output can be attributed to different sources of variation in the model input. Therefore, effort should be made to determine the true importance of sensitive parameters by considering their placement in model algorithms. The model was then calibrated against measured daily streamflow data obtained from eight U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations. The impacts of land use changes were studied at three scales: subwatershed, watershed, and basin. At the subwatershed scale, most of the hydrologic behavior can be described by percent change in land cover. However, the trend was more apparent for land use conversion from mixed forest to urban and agriculture lands than for other land use conversions. At the watershed scale, significant differences were observed based on the long-term average hydrologic variables under the current and presettlement scenarios. In addition, an increase in evapotranspiration (up to 16.5%) and surface runoff (up to 93.9%) contribution to streamflow, a decrease in recharge to aquifers (up to -51.5%) and baseflow (up to -50.1%), and mixed impacts on water yield (-21.5% to 24.6%) were detected. However, at the basin scale, more than 70% of the study area experienced decreased lateral subsurface flow and recharge to aquifers, while 65% of the area experienced increased overland flow and minor changes in evapotranspiration and water yield. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Global climate issues and a looming energy crisis put agriculture under pressure in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate adaptation measures must entail sustainable development benefits, and growing crops for food as well as energy may be a solution, removing people from hunger and poverty without compromising the environment. The present study investigated the feasibility of using non-food parts of cassava for energy production and the promising results revealed that at least 28% of peels and stems comprise dry matter, and 10 g feedstock yields >8.5 g sugar, which in turn produced >60% ethanol, with pH = 2.85, 74-84% light transmittance and a conductivity of 368 mV, indicating a potential use of cassava feedstock for ethanol production. Thus, harnessing cassava for food as well as ethanol production is deemed feasible. Such a system would, however, require supportive policies to acquire a balance between food security and fuel. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to performa well-to-pump life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the overall net energy balance and environmental impact of bioethanol production using Tall Fescue grass straw as feedstock. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were compared to those of gasoline to explore the potential of bioethanol as sustainable fuel. Methods The functional unit used in the study was 10,000 MJ of energy. The data for grass seed production were collected from the farmers in Oregon and published reports. The compositions of straw, pretreatment, and hydrolysis yields were obtained from laboratory experiments. Process models were developed for ethanol production using different pretreatment technologies in SuperPro Designer to calculate the process energy, raw materials, utility use, and emissions related. The Greenhouse Gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model and other literature studies were used to obtain additional data. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5% cutoff value. Results and discussion Ethanol yields from grass straw were estimated 256.62, 255.8, 255.3, and 230.2 L/dry metric ton of biomass using dilute acid, dilute alkali, hot water, and steam explosion pretreatments, respectively. Fossil energy required to produce one functional unit was in the range of -1507 to 3940 MJ for different ethanol production techniques. GHG emissions fromethanol LCAmodels were in the range of -131 to -555.4 kg CO2 eq. per 10,000 MJ of ethanol. Fossil energy use and GHG emissions during ethanol production were found to be lowest for steam explosion pretreatment among all pretreatment processes evaluated. Change in coproduct allocation from economic to mass basis during agricultural production resulted in 62.4% and 133.1%increase in fossil energy use and GHG emissions respectively. Conclusions Technologies used for ethanol production process had major impact on total fossil energy use and GHG emissions. N2O emissions from the nitrogen fertilizers were major contributor (77%) of total GHG emissions produced during agricultural activities. There was 57.43-112.67% reduction in fossil energy use to produce 10,000 MJ of ethanol compared to gasoline; however, about 0.35 ha of land is also required to produce this energy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biomass fuels are used by the majority of resource poor households in low-income countries. Though biomass fuels, such as dung-briquette and firewood are apparently cheaper than the modern fuels indoor pollution from burning biomass fuels incurs high health costs. But, the health costs of these conventional fuels, mostly being indirect, are poorly understood. To address this gap, this study develops probit regression models using survey data generated through interviews from households using either dung-briquette or biogas as the primary source of fuel for cooking. The study investigates factors affecting the use of dung-briquette, assesses its impact on human health, and estimates the associated household health costs. Analysis suggests significant effects of dung-briquette on asthma and eye diseases. Despite of the perception of it being a cheap fuel, the annual health cost per household due to burning dung-briquette (US$ 16.94) is 61.3% higher than the annual cost of biogas (US$ 10.38), an alternative cleaner fuel for rural households. For reducing the use of dung-briquette and its indirect health costs, the study recommends three interventions: (1) educate women and aboriginal people, in particular, and make them aware of the benefits of switching to biogas; (2) facilitate tree planting in communal as well as private lands; and (3) create rural employment and income generation opportunities. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.

Since 2007, soybean actors started producing biodiesel for international market-especially to Europe- and the country quickly became the major biodiesel exporter. In 2010, around twenty processing units started supplying the domestic market. Diesel sold in Argentina contained 5% of biodiesel. The obligation to add 5% of biodiesel to diesel has passed to 7% and the goal is to increase this percentage. The State support and soybean biodiesel competitiveness have been important for biodiesel chain development but some doubts could appear about the kind of actors that could have the benefits.

AB  - Although numerous advancements have been made in the study of agenda setting among the media, the president, and Congress, scholars have struggled to develop a cohesive theory about who influences whom. To address this problem and augment the agenda-setting literature, I integrate exogenous agenda-setting variables from the American politics and policy literatures into traditional agenda-setting models. In contrast to prior research, which has tended to favor broad policy domains and foreign policy issues, I focus on one specific domestic policy area-biofuels. The results indicate that exogenous agenda-setting variables should be included in models of dynamic agenda setting, because they play an important role in the relationship among the media, the president, and Congress. In the case of biofuels, economic indicators, public opinion, and election year politics affected the agendas' of the media, the president, and Congress, and they drowned out the influence that these actors had on one another. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In 2006 the Ugandan government attempted to give a large portion of Mabira Forest Reserve to the Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited. The government argued the rainforest "give away" would contribute to economic development and create the opportunity for biofuel production. The proposal faced massive opposition from Ugandan civil society, which countered that deforestation would increase hunger and poverty. In order to help resolve the debate, this study examines the livelihoods of villagers living near a sugar factory and forest reserve in rural Uganda. We interviewed 821 households seeking to explore possible links between poverty and participation in sugarcane production at both the village and household level. Villages closest to the factory appeared wealthier than villages closer to the reserve. However, households pursued different livelihood strategies and invested in different components of wealth. It is therefore unclear whether the benefits of sugar or biofuel production outweigh the environmental costs of forest loss. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Together with 106 farmers who started growing Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) in 2004-2006, this research sought to increase the knowledge around the real-life experience of Jatropha farming in the southern India states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Launched as an alternative for diesel in India, Jatropha has been promoted as a non-edible plant that could grow on poor soils, yield oil-rich seeds for production of bio-diesel, and not compete directly with food production. Through interviews with the farmers, information was gathered regarding their socio-economic situation, the implementation and performance of their Jatropha plantations, and their reasons for continuing or discontinuing Jatropha cultivation. Results reveal that 82% of the farmers had substituted former cropland for their Jatropha cultivation. By 2010, 85% (n = 90) of the farmers who cultivated Jatropha in 2004 had stopped. Cultivating the crop did not give the economic returns the farmers anticipated, mainly due to a lack of information about the crop and its maintenance during cultivation and due to water scarcity. A majority of the farmers irrigated and applied fertilizer, and even pesticides. Many problems experienced by the farmers were due to limited knowledge about cultivating Jatropha caused by poor planning and implementation of the national Jatropha program. Extension services, subsidies, and other support were not provided as promised. The farmers who continued cultivation had means of income other than Jatropha and held hopes of a future Jatropha market. The lack of market structures, such as purchase agreements and buyers, as well as a low retail price for the seeds, were frequently stated as barriers to Jatropha cultivation. For Jatropha biodiesel to perform well, efforts are needed to improve yield levels and stability through genetic improvements and drought tolerance, as well as agriculture extension services to support adoption of the crop. Government programs will probably be more effective if implementing biodiesel production is conjoined with stimulating the demand for Jatropha biodiesel. To avoid food-biofuel competition, additional measures may be needed such as land-use restrictions for Jatropha producers and taxes on biofuels or biofuel feedstocks to improve the competitiveness of the food sector compared to the bioenergy sector. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Grasses could provide an alternative to the use of food crops for biofuel production. Australia has large areas of non-crop land that already produce grasses. However, there is currently no detailed assessment of Australia's grass production potential for bioenergy or carbon management. This paper provides an overview of grass production potential in Australia. Our approach is based on modeling native grass pastures net primary production (NPP) at a broad scale using the AussieGRASS NPP model. We assess the technical production potential of grasses for the whole of Australia; and, after excluding unsuitable production areas examine the bioenergy feedstock potential in seven regions around Australia. The paper identifies areas for grass feedstock production outside existing cropping and hay production areas. The analysis highlights areas of high production in north-east Australia around the Tropic of Capricorn. The non-cleared land in this extensive agricultural zone shows a promising technical production potential (266 Mt y -1) and if 15% of this land's NPP were to be transformed into ethanol, it could replace a significant part (54%) of current Australian petrol demand. We subsequently discuss these modeling results to identify areas for further improvement and future development for this approach that would produce a more robust spatial grass feedstock assessment. The paper investigates only a set of technical constraints for grass production. There will be many other constraints to consider, e.g. competing uses for grass resources from crop and animal production, and conservation needs, which will reduce the possible off-take of grasses for energy. © 2012 Commonwealth of Australia.

AB  - Simultaneously achieving economic, environmental and social sustainability is a major challenge for the emerging renewable fuel industry. We approach this problem by demonstrating a cellulosic biorefinery paradigm which produces ethanol and food precursors using lignocellulosic biomass as the exclusive source for carbohydrates and minerals. Enzymatic hydrolysate from Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover at 18% w/w solids loading was found to be nutrient-rich. This hydrolysate was fermented completely within 48 h in two stages to produce ethanol and native yeast cells. An in-house saccharolytic enzyme production using AFEX-pretreated corn stover as carbohydrate source greatly reduces the dependence on commercial enzymes. The inducer mixture is 2.5-7 times more potent than lactose, a common enzyme inducer. Economic analysis indicates that the proposed paradigm is substantially more cost-effective relative to the 2005 NREL model. This improvement is largely attributed to the native yeast cells co-production and the reduction of enzyme cost through the in-house production. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Crop science is a highly integrative science employing expertise from multiple disciplines to broaden our understanding of agronomic, turf, and forage crops. A major goal of crop science is to ensure an adequate and sustainable production of food, feed, fuel, and fiber for our world's growing population. The Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) identified key Grand Challenges which, when addressed, will provide the tools, technologies, and solutions required to meet these challenges. The Grand Challenges are: (i) Crop adaptation to climate change: Increase the speed with which agriculture can adapt to climate change by using crop science to address abiotic stresses such as drought and heat. (ii) Resistance to biotic stresses: Increase durability of resistance to biotic stresses that threaten yield and quality of major crops. (iii) Management for resource limited systems: Create novel crop cultivars and management approaches designed for problem soils and low-input farming to increase economic prosperity for farmers and overcome world hunger. (iv) Crop management systems: Create novel crop management systems that are resilient in the face of changes in climate and rural demographics. (v) Biofuels: Develop sustainable biofuel feedstock cropping systems that require minimal land area, optimize production, and improve the environment. (vi) Bioresources: Genotyping the major crop germplasm collections to facilitate identification of gene treasures for breeding and genetics research and deployment of superior genes into adapted germplasm around the globe. These challenges are intended to be dynamic and change as societal needs evolve. Available funding and national prioritization will determine the rate that they will be addressed. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - This meta-analysis of land-cover transformations of the past 10-15 years in tropical forest-agriculture frontiers world-wide shows that swidden agriculture decreases in landscapes with access to local, national and international markets that encourage cattle production and cash cropping, including biofuels. Conservation policies and practices also accelerate changes in swidden by restricting forest clearing and encouraging commercial agriculture. However, swidden remains important in many frontier areas where farmers have unequal or insecure access to investment and market opportunities, or where multi-functionality of land uses has been preserved as a strategy to adapt to current ecological, economic and political circumstances. In some areas swidden remains important simply because intensification is not a viable choice, for example when population densities and/or food market demands are low. The transformation of swidden landscapes into more intensive land uses has generally increased household incomes, but has also led to negative effects on the social and human capital of local communities to varying degrees. From an environmental perspective, the transition from swidden to other land uses often contributes to permanent deforestation, loss of biodiversity, increased weed pressure, declines in soil fertility, and accelerated soil erosion. Our prognosis is that, despite the global trend towards land use intensification, in many areas swidden will remain part of rural landscapes as the safety component of diversified systems, particularly in response to risks and uncertainties associated with more intensive land use systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We analyze the long-term impacts of large-scale expansion of biofuels on land-use change, food supply and prices, and the overall economy in various countries or regions using a multi-country, multi-sector global computable general equilibrium model augmented with an explicit land-use module and detailed biofuel sectors. We find that an expansion of biofuel production to meet the existing or even higher targets in various countries would slightly reduce GDP at the global level but with mixed effects across countries or regions. Significant land re-allocation would take place with notable decreases in forest and pasture lands in a few countries. The expansion of biofuels would cause a moderate decrease in world food supply and more significant decreases in developing countries like India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Feedstock commodities (sugar, corn and oil seeds) would experience significant increases in their prices in 2020, but other price changes are small. © 2012 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Prairie vegetation has the potential to serve as a bioenergy feedstock with favorable environmental impacts but generally yields less than corn (Zea mays L.). To more fully assess the potential of prairie vegetation to serve as a biofuel feedstock, more needs to be understood about prairie responses to different management strategies, including fertilization. We hypothesized that (i) N fertilization would increase prairie productivity and nutrient content and (ii) fertilized prairie would produce similar amounts of total biomass as corn but would allocate more biomass and nutrients to roots. Our hypotheses were tested in a field experiment using prairie species representing different functional groups-C 3 grasses, C 4 grasses, legumes, and multifunctional group mixtures-grown with and without N fertilizer as well as fertilized corn. Fertilized and unfertilized C 4 prairie grasses produced as much total biomass as corn but allocated up to 65% of their biomass belowground compared to 3% for corn. Corn yields decreased over the 3-yr period of the study whereas yields of fertilized C 4 grasses and multifunctional group mixtures were stable, and yields of unfertilized C 4 grasses and mixtures increased and became equal to their fertilized counterparts. Calculated annual costs for replacing nutrients removed in the harvested portions of corn and fertilized and unfertilized C 4 grasses were US$403, $137, and $40 ha -1, respectively. Results of this experiment show tradeoffs among corn and prairie systems with respect to harvested biomass, root production, and nutrient exports, emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach to fully evaluate bioenergy feedstock production systems. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - A methane-producing microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is a technology to convert CO 2 into methane, using electricity as an energy source and microorganisms as the catalyst. A methane-producing MEC provides the possibility to increase the fuel yield per hectare of land area, when the CO 2 produced in biofuel production processes is converted to additional fuel methane. Besides increasing fuel yield per hectare of land area, this also results in more efficient use of land area, water, and nutrients. In this research, the performance of a methane-producing MEC was studied for 188days in a flat-plate MEC design. Methane production rate and energy efficiency of the methane-producing MEC were investigated with time to elucidate the main bottlenecks limiting system performance. When using water as the electron donor at the anode during continuous operation, methane production rate was 0.006m 3/m 3 per day at a cathode potential of -0.55V vs. normal hydrogen electrode with a coulombic efficiency of 23.1%. External electrical energy input was 73.5kWh/m 3 methane, resulting in a voltage efficiency of 13.4%. Consequently, overall energy efficiency was 3.1%. The maximum achieved energy efficiency was obtained in a yield test and was 51.3%. Analysis of internal resistance showed that in the short term, cathode and anode losses were dominant, but with time, also pH gradient and transport losses became more important. The results obtained in this study are used to discuss the possible contribution of methane-producing MECs to increase the fuel yield per hectare of land area. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Improving salinity and drought tolerance of crop plants has been an important aim of modern agricultural development, which depends on understanding the functions of genes expressed during the process of stress adaptation. EST resources are an efficient and cost-effective solution to gene discovery. Jatropha curcas is emerging as the most promising tree oil seed as a source of biodiesel. To identify genes that respond to abiotic stress, in the present study, we report 1240 ESTs generated from root cDNA libraries of J. curcas. ESTs were clustered and assembled into a collection of 865 unigenes, with 107 contigs and 758 singleton sequences. The putative functions of several ESTs could be assigned by similarity to plant gene sequence comparisons. It was found that 23 full-length CDS (34%) and the majority of transcription factors had sequence similarity to genes known to be involved in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. The expression pattern of nine selected genes revealed that these genes are differentially expressed in various tissues during adaptation to stress. The data could serve as a critical resource to enable plant improvement programmes towards enhancing the adaptability of J. curcas to growth on marginal lands. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

AB  - Owing to the extensive critique of food-crop-based biofuels, attention has turned toward second-generation wood-based biofuels. A question is therefore whether timber taken from the vast boreal forests on an increasing scale should serve as a source of wood-based biofuels and whether this will be effective climate policy. In a typical boreal forest, it takes 70-120 years before a stand of trees is mature. When this time lag and the dynamics of boreal forests more generally are taken into account, it follows that a high level of harvest means that the carbon stock in the forest stabilizes at a lower level. Therefore, wood harvesting is not a carbon-neutral activity. Through model simulations, it is estimated that an increased harvest of a boreal forest will create a biofuel carbon debt that takes 190-340 years to repay. The length of the payback time is sensitive to the type of fossil fuels that wood energy replaces © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In this paper, Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica L.) seed kernel oil was investigated for the first time as a promising non-conventional feedstock for preparation of biodiesel. Siberian apricot seed kernel has high oil content (50.18±3.92%), and the oil has low acid value (0.46mgg -1) and low water content (0.17%). The fatty acid composition of the Siberian apricot seed kernel oil includes a high percentage of oleic acid (65.23±4.97%) and linoleic acid (28.92±4.62%). The measured fuel properties of the Siberian apricot biodiesel, except cetane number and oxidative stability, were conformed to EN 14214-08, ASTM D6751-10 and GB/T 20828-07 standards, especially the cold flow properties were excellent (Cold filter plugging point -14°C). The addition of 500ppm tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) resulted in a higher induction period (7.7h) compliant with all the three biodiesel standards. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative environmentally friendly fuel made from renewable biological sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats. The present report deals with screening of 14 accessions of Jatropha curcas collected from all over India to find the most suitable ones for production of Biodiesel. From the 14 accessions of J. curcas located in the plantation at Osmania University, 4 accessions were initially selected on the basis of traits like general appearance, pest resistance, seed yield and seed-oil content. Further, the seed-oil of these 4 accessions was characterized by physico-chemical analysis to identify the elite accessions for production of biodiesel. Highest 1000-seed weight (640 g) and highest percentage seed-oil content (50.16) (extracted by Soxhlet method with hexane as the solvent) was recorded in the "KM" accession. The transesterification process is affected by the presence of high free fatty acids (recorded in "MB" accession) and high moisture content (recorded in "KM" accession) of the seed-oil which also interfere with the separation of fatty esters and glycerol during production of Biodiesel. Further, high phosphorus content and iodine number (recorded in "MB" accession) interfere with conversion of seed-oil to Biodiesel. In the above context, in spite of its yield being lower, the seed-oil of the "RSAD" accession was found to be most suitable for Biodiesel production followed by "KM", "F.W.B" and "MB" accessions, since it contains lower free fatty acids, acid value, viscosity, diglycerides and iodine number. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Available results about energy and GreenHouse Gases (GHG) balances of biofuels from Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) or life-cycle based studies present large discrepancies and thus, may lead to contradictory policy-making measures. This work reviewed seven important European LCA studies in a sensitivity analysis approach in order to get a better understanding of the roots of such a debate for three major biofuels in European production: rape methyl ester and ethanol from wheat and sugar beet. Global trends and variability of energy and GHG balances were depicted and completed with a sensitivity analysis carried out for each methodological and data parameter, which allowed making recommendations on the carrying out of LCA in a policy-making or a biofuels comparison context. Methodological choices, and especially allocation rule, appeared as key elements for results variation with influences on balances up to 149%; system expansion approach was identified as the most relevant rule since it integrates the market potential and the environmental interest of by-products promotion, which was pointed out as a crucial point for biofuels sustainability. The influence of local specificity for cultivation data was evaluated up to 167%, which puts too large geographical coverage in question. Modelling uncertainties due to N 2O emissions from soils showed influences from 17 to 46%, which represents a crucial challenge for research and for LCA results accuracy. Approximations evaluation pointed out the need to integrate agricultural machinery into the assessment. Finally, land-use issue revealed its dramatic importance for LCA results and the need to define explicit scenarios for land-use alternatives. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If energy crops are to replace fossil fuels as source for heat, power or vehicle fuel, their whole production chain must have higher energy output than input. Industrial hemp has high biomass and energy yields. The study evaluated and compared net energy yields (NEY) and energy output-to-input ratios (R O/I) for production of heat, power and vehicle fuel from industrial hemp. Four scenarios for hemp biomass were compared; (I) combined heat and power (CHP) from spring-harvested baled hemp, (II) heat from spring-harvested briquetted hemp, and (III) CHP and (IV) vehicle fuel from autumn-harvested chopped and ensiled hemp processed to biogas in an anaerobic digestion process. The results were compared with those of other energy crops. Calculations were based on conditions in the agricultural area along the Swedish west and south coast. There was little difference in total energy input up to storage, but large differences in the individual steps involved. Further processing to final energy product differed greatly. Total energy ratio was best for combustion scenarios (I) and (II) (R O/I of 6.8 and 5.1, respectively). The biogas scenarios (III) and (IV) both had low R O/I (2.7 and 2.6, repectively). They suffer from higher energy inputs and lower conversion efficiencies but give high quality products, i.e. electricity and vehicle fuel. The main competitors for hemp are maize and sugar beets for biogas production and the perennial crops willow, reed canary grass and miscanthus for solid biofuel production. Hemp is an above-average energy crop with a large potential for yield improvements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One potential externality of the bioeconomy is the unintentional introduction and widespread dissemination of bioenergy crops that become invasive species. As one component of parameterizing risk assessment of invasiveness, we evaluated the colonization, survival, and establishment potential of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) in a riparian and dryland habitat in central California, where both species are non-native, under varying levels of soil moisture availability and competition over two years. Survival (<11%) and performance (≤3 tillers) of transplants of both species were poor in the dry upland environment regardless of competitive regime. In contrast, the lowland riparian habitat supported switchgrass (34-61% survival) and giant miscanthus (5-19% survival) transplants, with survival varying based on soil moisture availability and competitive environment. After two years, switchgrass grown without competition in the first year in the lowland habitat produced about six-fold more tillers that were twice as tall and yielded eight times more aboveground biomass than switchgrass growing in an intact resident plant community. In a second experiment, introduced switchgrass seed and giant miscanthus rhizome survival was extremely poor (<20%) in the upland habitat. Our results indicate that dryland regions of California have very high resistance to either switchgrass or giant miscanthus. However, riparian areas, particularly disturbed low competition areas, are capable of supporting the establishment of switchgrass. Though limited in habitat representation, this is the first study to evaluate experimental introductions of bioenergy crops into potentially susceptible habitat. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

GDP proves to be more significant for OECD countries, while arable land and feedstock prices are more significant for non-OECD countries. Land allocation may also be of importance.

AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the life cycle performance of two alternative pathways to biofuels in the shipping industry: the 'diesel route' and the 'gas route'. The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP 100) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - California's target for reducing economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. We develop transition scenarios for meeting this goal in California's transportation sector, with focus on light-duty vehicles (LDVs). We explore four questions: (1) what options are available to reduce transportation sector GHG emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050; (2) how rapidly would transitions in LDV markets, fuels, and travel behaviors need to occur over the next 40 years; (3) how do intermediate policy goals relate to different transition pathways; (4) how would rates of technological change and market adoption between 2010 and 2050 impact cumulative GHG emissions?We develop four LDV transition scenarios to meet the 80in50 target through a combination of travel demand reduction, fuel economy improvements, and low-carbon fuel supply, subject to restrictions on trajectories of technological change, potential market adoption of new vehicles and fuels, and resource availability. These scenarios exhibit several common themes: electrification of LDVs, rapid improvements in vehicle efficiency, and future fuels with less than half the carbon intensity of current gasoline and diesel. Availability of low-carbon biofuels and the level of travel demand reduction are "swing factors" that influence the degree of LDV electrification required. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper assesses the recent European governance of risks associated with indirect land-use change (ILUC) arising from biofuel production. Deploying the theoretical concepts of wicked problems, incertitudes and co-production, it argues that Europes existing risk governance apparatus has systematically failed to acknowledge the inherent difficulties of both identifying and interpreting knowledge pertaining to this issue, thereby sanctioning a risk management strategy that is both cognitively and democratically illegitimate. In short, existing modes of risk governance have assumed that the questions what makes ILUC problematic? and how problematic is ILUC? are both resolvable through objective, scientific risk assessments, when in fact they are not. This papers first contribution is to outline the precise characteristics of ILUC that serve to render it a wicked problem, focusing in particular on the epistemological hurdles facing those who seek to answer the two key questions outlined above. Its second contribution is then to assess the appropriateness of those science-policy relationships which have thus far been cultivated in Europe as part of attempts to deal with this issue. Specifically here, the reification of ILUC factors as the dominant metric of ILUC risk assessment is argued to have comprised a classic instance of co-production, leading to the systematic closing down of broader political debates around the issue. The paper concludes by contending that Europes risk governance apparatus will have to strive to be more inclusive, transparent, adaptable and reflexive in the future, particularly given the increasing prominence today of such multi-dimensional wicked problems, both in the environmental sphere and beyond. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fossil fuels are being heavily depleted due to increasing anthropogenic activities worldwide, and burning them contributes to global climate warming and air pollution. Vegetable oils are one of the main feedstocks for biodiesel: they are non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Rising global population, decreasing arable lands and a decline in crop yields from desertification and salinization demands that biodiesel feedstock be grown on unproductive agricultural lands. To estimate whether five plants growing on such land in China could be used as energy plants, we determined their seed oil content (SOC) and relative fatty acid content, and estimated the cetane number (CN) of the biodiesel produced from these plant oils by a fitted regression between different C18 fatty acids and CN. Results showed that four plants can be developed as energy plants, including Datura candida (SOC = 22.9%, CN = 50.8), Xanthium sibiricum (SOC = 41.9%, CN = 46.5), Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (SOC = 18.6%, CN = 45.9) and Hibiscus trionum (SOC = 17.5%, CN = 46.9). The fifth plant, Rhus typhina, was not adapted as an energy plant because of its low SOC, 9.7%. Our data provide a scientific basis for growing energy plants in unproductive agricultural lands as biodiesel resources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative diesel fuel which has increased worldwide public interest in a number of countries including China. But the high cost of producing biodiesel from feedstock, predominately food grade oils, limited its economic feasibility. An alternative of using grease extracted from restaurant waste to produce biodiesel is a potential low cost approach. However, this approach generates a significant large quantity of solid residual fraction which required proper disposal. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of a secondary biodiesel production from the solid residual fraction of restaurant waste after typical grease extraction (SRF) employing a high fat containing insect, black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens. The SRF was sampled and fed to black soldier fly larvae. The resulting larval biomass was used for crude grease extraction by petroleum ether. The extracted crude grease was then converted into biodiesel by acid-catalyzed (1% H 2SO 4) esterifi{ligature}cation and alkaline-catalyzed (0.8% NaOH) transesterifi{ligature}cation. About 23.6 g larval grease-based biodiesel was produced from approximately 1000 larvae grown on 1 kg of SRF. The weight of SRF was reduced by about 61.8% after being fed by the black soldier fly larvae for 7 days. The amount of biodiesel yield from restaurant waste was nearly doubled (original restaurant waste grease, 2.7%; larval grease, 2.4%). The major methyl ester components of the biodiesel derived from black soldier fly larvae fed on SRF were oleinic acid methyl ester (27.1%), lauric acid methyl ester (23.4%), and palmitic acid methyl ester (18.2%). Most of the properties of this biodiesel met the specifications of the standard EN 14214, including density (860 kg/m 3), viscosity (4.9 mm 2/s), fl{ligature}ash point (128 °C), cetane number (58) and ester contents (96.9%). These results indicated that black soldier fly larval biomass obtained from larvae reared on SRF could potentially be used as a non-food feedstock for biodiesel production. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of biodiesel production from restaurant waste, it also helps to better manage and significantly reduce the large quantity of solid residual fraction produced during the process of biodiesel production using restaurant waste. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The implantation and development of alternative crops to production of biofuel are dependents of soil structural quality. The physic nut has been considered as one of the promising sources of biofuel. The objective of this study was to quantify the influence of use systems on some indicators of soil physical quality and to identify critical values of bulk density and air-filled porosity to crop development of an Alfisol under conventional system of physic nut. For the evaluation of physical indicators of soil quality, samples were collected with disturbed and indisturbed structure in different sampling positions (crop row and interrow). The samples were taken of the layers 0.00 - 0.05; 0.05 - 0.10 and 0.10 - 0.20 m depth. In the conditions of this study, concluded that: i) except to 0.10 to 0.20 m depth, the sampling positions influenced all soil physical parameters; ii) the crop row position presented higher macroporosity and total porosity in 0.00 to 0.10 m depth; iii) the critical air-filled porosity and bulk density values for plant growth were 0.74 and 1.49 Mg m -3 and iv) considering the bulk density and air-filled porosity only the crop row position no indicate restrictive values to plants development.

AB  - Background: Miscanthus (subtribe Saccharinae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae) is a genus of temperate perennial C4 grasses whose high biomass production makes it, along with its close relatives sugarcane and sorghum, attractive as a biofuel feedstock. The base chromosome number of Miscanthus (x = 19) is different from that of other Saccharinae and approximately twice that of the related Sorghum bicolor (x = 10), suggesting large-scale duplications may have occurred in recent ancestors of Miscanthus. Owing to the complexity of the Miscanthus genome and the complications of self-incompatibility, a complete genetic map with a high density of markers has not yet been developed.Results: We used deep transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) from two M. sinensis accessions to define 1536 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for a GoldenGate™ genotyping array, and found that simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers defined in sugarcane are often informative in M. sinensis. A total of 658 SNP and 210 SSR markers were validated via segregation in a full sibling F1 mapping population. Using 221 progeny from this mapping population, we constructed a genetic map for M. sinensis that resolves into 19 linkage groups, the haploid chromosome number expected from cytological evidence. Comparative genomic analysis documents a genome-wide duplication in Miscanthus relative to Sorghum bicolor, with subsequent insertional fusion of a pair of chromosomes. The utility of the map is confirmed by the identification of two paralogous C4-pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (C4-PPDK) loci in Miscanthus, at positions syntenic to the single orthologous gene in Sorghum.Conclusions: The genus Miscanthus experienced an ancestral tetraploidy and chromosome fusion prior to its diversification, but after its divergence from the closely related sugarcane clade. The recent timing of this tetraploidy complicates discovery and mapping of genetic markers for Miscanthus species, since alleles and fixed differences between paralogs are comparable. These difficulties can be overcome by careful analysis of segregation patterns in a mapping population and genotyping of doubled haploids. The genetic map for Miscanthus will be useful in biological discovery and breeding efforts to improve this emerging biofuel crop, and also provide a valuable resource for understanding genomic responses to tetraploidy and chromosome fusion. © 2012 Swaminathan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Microbial hydrolysis of polysaccharides is critical to ecosystem functioning and is of great interest in diverse biotechnological applications, such as biofuel production and bioremediation. Here we demonstrate the use of a new, efficient approach to recover genomes of active polysaccharide degraders from natural, complex microbial assemblages, using a combination of fluorescently labeled substrates, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and single cell genomics. We employed this approach to analyze freshwater and coastal bacterioplankton for degraders of laminarin and xylan, two of the most abundant storage and structural polysaccharides in nature. Our results suggest that a few phylotypes of Verrucomicrobia make a considerable contribution to polysaccharide degradation, although they constituted only a minor fraction of the total microbial community. Genomic sequencing of five cells, representing the most predominant, polysaccharide-active Verrucomicrobia phylotype, revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding a wide spectrum of glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases, peptidases, carbohydrate lyases and esterases, confirming that these organisms were well equipped for the hydrolysis of diverse polysaccharides. Remarkably, this enrichment was on average higher than in the sequenced representatives of Bacteroidetes, which are frequently regarded as highly efficient biopolymer degraders. These findings shed light on the ecological roles of uncultured Verrucomicrobia and suggest specific taxa as promising bioprospecting targets. The employed method offers a powerful tool to rapidly identify and recover discrete genomes of active players in polysaccharide degradation, without the need for cultivation. © 2012 This is an open-access article.

AB  - Higher oil prices and increased interest in energy security have stimulated research on bio fuels. In order to achieve sustainability, renewable energy sources must be developed and explored. Bio-diesel derived from micro algae is considered as one such sustainable source. An important step to determine the feasibility of algae bio-fuel is quantifying the potential of commercial scale algal bio-fuel production. A deterministic mathematical model was developed to predict the technical potential of micro-algae bio-fuels in India. The model aims to identify suitable growth locations based on sunlight and local climatic conditions for algal biomass cultivation. The model incorporates realistic limits for light distribution, land use, transmission, photon utilization, photosynthetic efficiencies, and oil content based on literature data. For each scenario of oil fraction and sunlight, the model calculates potential oil yield, biomass produced, and growth rates. This preliminary resource assessment estimates annual algal biomass yield between 159 and 345 metric tons per hectare and 57,000 to 1, 62,000 liters of lipids per hectare based on the solar radiation intensity available in India.

AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are a key, integral component of the stability, sustainability and functioning of ecosystems. In this study, we characterised the AMF biodiversity in a native vegetation soil and in a soil cultivated with Jatropha curcas or Ricinus communis, in a tropical system in Guantanamo (Cuba), in order to verify if a change of land use to biofuel plant production had any effect on the AMF communities. We also asses whether some soil properties related with the soil fertility (total N, Organic C, microbial biomass C, aggregate stability percentage, pH and electrical conductivity) were changed with the cultivation of both crop species. The AM fungal small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA genes were subjected to PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Twenty AM fungal sequence types were identified: 19 belong to the Glomeraceae and one to the Paraglomeraceae. Two AMF sequence types related to cultured AMF species (Glo G3 for Glomus sinuosum and Glo G6 for Glomus intraradices-G. fasciculatum-G. irregulare) did not occur in the soil cultivated with J. curcas and R. communis. The soil properties (total N, Organic C and microbial biomass C) were higher in the soil cultivated with the two plant species. The diversity of the AMF community decreased in the soil of both crops, with respect to the native vegetation soil, and varied significantly depending on the crop species planted. Thus, R. communis soil showed higher AMF diversity than J. curcas soil. In conclusion, R. communis could be more suitable for the long-term conservation and sustainable management of these tropical ecosytems. © 2012 Alguacil et al.

AB  - Ethanol has long been regarded as the optimal gasoline-alternative biofuel for spark-ignition (SI) engines. It is used widely in Latin and North America and is increasingly accepted as an attractive option across Europe. Nevertheless, its low energy density requires a high rate of manufacture; in areas which are deficient of arable land, such rates might prove problematic. Therefore, fuels with higher calorific values, such as butanol or 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) deserve consideration; a similar yield to ethanol, in theory, would require much less land. This report addresses the suitability of DMF, to meet the needs as a biofuel substitute for gasoline in SI engines, using ethanol as the biofuel benchmark. Specific attention is given to the sensitivity of DMF to various engine control parameters: combustion phasing (ignition timing), injection timing, relative air-fuel ratio and valve timing (intake and exhaust). Focus is given to the window for optimization; the parameter range which sustains optimal IMEP (within 2%) but provides the largest reduction of emissions (HC or NO). The test results using a single-cylinder SI research engine at 1500 rpm show how DMF is less sensitive to key engine parameters, compared to gasoline. This allows a wider window for emissions optimization because the IMEP remains optimal across a greater parameter range. Copyright Â© 2012 SAE International.

AB  - The strongly increasing demand for biofuel from forests poses new challenges for biodiversity conservation. Methods that may combine biofuel production with conservation goals need to be tested for various forest types. One possible conservation-oriented management alternative is partial cutting of closed canopy oak-rich forests (may also be called conservation thinning). Such cutting may counteract succession and restore a semi-open canopy structure, which may favor epiphytes. We evaluated this possibility by surveying the epiphyte community of lichens and bryophytes on large oaks in 24 oak-rich temperate forests in southern Sweden. Treatment plots, and reference plots with no cutting, were surveyed before, and 6. years after cutting. In the treatment plots, about 25% of the basal area was harvested, and mainly small and intermediate sized successional trees were removed. We detected significant positive effects of partial cutting on species density for both lichens and bryophytes. The additional variation in light influx at tree level (after the cutting) could not explain the change in species density. The increase in density of lichen species was highest on oaks with small trunk diameter and on oaks with deep bark crevices. The pooled frequency of species of conservation concern increased after the cutting, but the change in species composition was weak; colonization events occurred over mean minimum distances of 63.5. m to the nearest potential source tree (n= 22 events and 9 species). Overall, we found significantly higher colonization rates, and significantly lower extinction rates per tree for lichens in the treatment plots. We conclude that partial cutting influenced epiphytes of large oaks positively, as was the case for several other organism groups at the same study sites (previous studies). A mild form of biofuel harvesting may represent sustainable resource-use in these forests, compatible with conservation. However, part of the forest should be kept untouched for species vulnerable to changes in microclimatic conditions, and for evaluation of long-term effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The shoot apical meristem houses stem cells responsible for the continuous formation of aerial plant organs including leaves and stems throughout the life of plants. Laser-microdissection in combination with high-throughput technology such as next generation sequencing permits an in-depth analysis of molecular events associated with specific cell type of interest. Sample preparation is the most critical step in ensuring good quality RNA to be extracted from samples following laser-microdissection. Here, we optimized the sample preparation for a major legume crop, soybean. We used Farmer’s solution as a fixative and paraffin as the embedding medium for soybean shoot apical meristem tissue without the use of any specialized equipment. Shorter time for tissue fixation (two days) was found to be critical for the preservation of RNA in soybean shoot apical meristem. We further demonstrated the utility of this method for different tissues derived from soybean and rice. The method outlined here shall facilitate studies on crop plants involving lasermicrodissection.
RNA extraction methods from plant tissues following laser micro-dissection is of interest.2-5 Kerk et al.3 reported that tissue fixation in Farmer’s solution composed of 75% ethanol, 25% acetic acid provides good quality RNA from samples obtained by laser-microdissected and paraffin-embedded sections although their preparation involves conditions such as long duration of paraffin infiltration at high temperature that are detrimental to RNA. While some protocols call for the use of specialized equipment in speeding up the sample preparation step and hence minimizing RNA degradation, 4,5 others do not give sufficient details for the protocol to be carried out successfully. Furthermore, a sample preparation method for important legume crops such as soybean, a global crop for oil and protein and increasingly priced for its use in biofuel production, is yet to be reported. © C.E.

AB  - Background: Lipids extracted from seeds of Camelina sativa have been successfully used as a reliable source of aviation biofuels. This biofuel is environmentally friendly because the drought resistance, frost tolerance and low fertilizer requirement of Camelina sativa allow it to grow on marginal lands. Improving the species growth and seed yield by genetic engineering is therefore a target for the biofuels industry. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of purple acid phosphatase 2 encoded by Arabidopsis (AtPAP2) promotes plant growth by modulating carbon metabolism. Overexpression lines bolt earlier and produce 50% more seeds per plant than wild type. In this study, we explored the effects of overexpressing AtPAP2 in Camelina sativa. Results: Under controlled environmental conditions, overexpression of AtPAP2 in Camelina sativa resulted in longer hypocotyls, earlier flowering, faster growth rate, higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, increased seed yield and seed size in comparison with the wild-type line and null-lines. Similar to transgenic Arabidopsis, activity of sucrose phosphate synthase in leaves of transgenic Camelina was also significantly up-regulated. Sucrose produced in photosynthetic tissues supplies the building blocks for cellulose, starch and lipids for growth and fuel for anabolic metabolism. Changes in carbon flow and sink/source activities in transgenic lines may affect floral, architectural, and reproductive traits of plants. Conclusions: Lipids extracted from the seeds of Camelina sativa have been used as a major constituent of aviation biofuels. The improved growth rate and seed yield of transgenic Camelina under controlled environmental conditions have the potential to boost oil yield on an area basis in field conditions and thus make Camelina-based biofuels more environmentally friendly and economically attractive. © 2012 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In order to assess the efficiency of an alternative power source and to provide a meaningful comparison with fossil fuel based power sources, a complete accounting of all energy input and output streams, as well as all greenhouse gases, is necessary. We present this analysis for a 1.45 MW (0.71 MW electrical) biogas power plant operating with 70% corn silage and 30% cow dung feedstock. We find net energy ration of 8.0, a net efficiency of 1.2% of converting solar energy into electricity and usable heat, and that only 16 g CO2 per kWh are generated in the process. If all greenhouse gases are considered, our process even actively reduces the total greenhouse gas load on the atmosphere. In terms of producing transportation biofuels our plant provides 3.8 times more yield per hectare than bioethanol plants. © 2012, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Sri Lanka's agricultural sector has an abundant supply of natural resources that can be further developed and utilized to produce bio-fuels. Transformation of the nation's significant renewable biomass resources into cost-competitive, high-performance bio-fuels could reduce the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels and enhance energy security. However, there is limited understanding of the potential of bio-fuel resources, their utilization, and economic potential. This study evaluates the economic competitiveness of producing ethanol from sugar, starch and cellulosic feedstock. The net economic returns model was used to select economically feasible feedstock for bio-fuel production. For each feedstock, net present value, feedstock cost per British thermal unit (Btu) and per gallon of ethanol, and break-even price of feedstock and ethanol were calculated. Cellulosic feedstock showed the lowest feedstock cost per gallon of ethanol. Sugarcane, cassava, corn, and cellulosic feedstock appeared to be the leading bio-fuel crops among the investigated crops. For cellulosic feedstock, however, the process of converting the feedstock into ethanol is still in the demonstration phase; hence, results should be interpreted with caution. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A life cycle approach was adopted for energy, green house gas (GHG) emissions and renewability assessment for production of 1. ton of Jatropha biodiesel. Allocation and displacement approaches were applied for life cycle inventory, process energy and process GHG emission attribution to co-products. The results of process energy and GHG emission analyses revealed that the amount of process energy consumption and GHG emission in the individual stages of the life cycle assessment (LCA) were a strong function of co-product handling and irrigation. The GHG emission reduction with respect to petroleum diesel for generating 1. GJ energy varied from 40% to 107% and NER values from 1.4 to 8.0 depending upon the methodology used for energy and emission distribution between product and co-products as well as irrigation applied. However, GHG emission reduction values of 54 and 40 and NER (net energy ratio) values of 1.7 and 1.4 for irrigated and rain-fed scenarios, respectively indicate the eco-friendly nature and renewability of biodiesel even in the worst scenario where total life cycle inventory (LCI), process energy and GHG emission were allocated to biodiesel only. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - All nations have been confronted with the energy crisis due to depletion of finite fossil fuels reserves, which results an increasing global demand of biofuels for energy security, economic stability and reduction in climate change effects, and generate the opportunity to explore new biomass sources. The production of sustainable bioenergy is a challenging task in the promotion of biofuels for replacing the fossil based fuels to mitigate challenges of fossil based energy consumption. Algae might be a very promising source of biomass in this context as it sequesters a significant quantity of carbon from atmosphere and industrial gases and is also very efficient in utilizing the nutrients from industrial effluents and municipal wastewater. If developed sustainably, the algae biofuel industry may be able to provide large quantities of biofuels with potentially minimal environmental impacts. However, in order to realize this, a complete analysis of full life cycle impact of algal biofuel production in the context of issues such as water resource management, land use impact, energy balance and air emissions are very necessary. The commercial-scale production of algae requires careful consideration of many issues that can be broadly categorized into four main areas: selecting algae species that produce high oil levels and grow well in specified environments, algae growth methods, water sources and related issues, and nutrient and growth inputs. © Sila Science.

AB  - Concerns regarding the depletion of the world's reserves of oil and global climate change have promoted an intensification of research and development toward the production of biofuels and other alternative sources of energy during the last years. There is currently much interest in developing the technology for third-generation biofuels from microalgal biomass mainly because of its potential for high yields and reduced land use changes in comparison with biofuels derived from plant feedstocks. Regardless of the nature of the feedstock, the use of fertilizers, especially nitrogen, entails a potential economic and environmental drawback for the sustainability of biofuel production. In this work, we have studied the possibility of nitrogen biofertilization by diazotrophic bacteria applied to cultured microalgae as a promising feedstock for next-generation biofuels. We have obtained an Azotobacter vinelandii mutant strain that accumulates several times more ammonium in culture medium than wild-type cells. The ammonium excreted by the mutant cells is bioavailable to promote the growth of nondiazotrophic microalgae. Moreover, this synthetic symbiosis was able to produce an oil-rich microalgal biomass using both carbon and nitrogen from the air. This work provides a proof of concept that artificial symbiosis may be considered an alternative strategy for the low-N-intensive cultivation of microalgae for the sustainable production of next-generation biofuels and other bioproducts. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The use of foodstuffs as raw materials for energy production, such as ethanol from corn or biodiesel from vegetable oils, increases the prices of meat and milk. Extensive use of crop foodstuffs (maize and vegetable oils) may cause other significant problems such as starvation in developing countries. The use of foodstuffs as raw materials for energy production, such as ethanol from maize and sugar cane, and biodiesel from soybean and canola increases the prices of meat and milk. To reduce these risks should be initiated application of food operating certificate. For this purpose a Food Using Protocol must be organized with broad participation. This should be an international protocol like Kyoto Protocol. © Sila Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - To decrease the cost of bioethanol production, biomass recalcitrance needs to be overcome so that the conversion of biomass to bioethanol becomes more efficient. CO 2 laser irradiation can disrupt the lignocellulosic physical structure and reduce the average size of fiber. Analyses with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, specific surface area, and the microstructure of corn stover were used to elucidate the enhancement mechanism of the pretreatment process by CO 2 laser irradiation. The present work demonstrated that the CO 2 laser had potential to enhance the bioconversion efficiency of lignocellulosic waste to renewable bioethanol. The saccharification rate of the CO 2 laser pretreatment was significantly higher than ultrasonic pretreatment, and reached 27.75% which was 1.34-fold of that of ultrasonic pretreatment. The results showed the impact of CO 2 laser pretreatment on corn stover to be more effective than ultrasonic pretreatment. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper analyzes the intersection of two parallel developments that have had a curious impact on agrarian politics in Colombia: on the one hand, attempts to appropriate land for 'green' ends such as biofuel production, which have become ubiquitous all across Latin America, and on the other, the implementation of multicultural reforms, which in Colombia resulted in the collective titling of more than five million hectares of land for 'black communities'. Although these two developments can be read as contradictory - with 'green grabs' threatening ethnic groups' territorial rights and multicultural reforms purportedly safeguarding them - I argue that, together, they produce a unique political articulation which I term 'green multiculturalism'.My analysis of oil-palm cultivation in a 'black community' in southwestern Colombia reveals three interrelated consequences. First, I suggest that green multiculturalism produces 'black communities' as 'green' collective subjects charged not only with being wardens of nature, but also bearers of the responsibility to right environmental wrongs. Second, I note that the agrarian practices associated with oil-palm cultivation act as disciplining technologies that seek to transform local rationalities into entrepreneurial ones. Finally, I contend that these initiatives are 'landscaping projects' that seek to transform forms of interspecies relating. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - With the growth of the biofuel complex, the concept of 'marginal land' has emerged as a term commonly associated with the promotion of agrofuels. Remote sensing and other data are used to globally characterize land as marginal based on predominantly biophysical features that render it 'non-competitive' for the purpose of commercial food agriculture. This paper explores the limitations of current geospatial technologies in determining whether marginal land is appropriate for bioenergy crops given that (i) people often have intentions behind land use that are not reflected in most routinely collected remote sensing data and (ii) a remote (and spatio-temporally static) characterization of marginality is unable to capture the shifting character of what constitutes marginality in an economic sense and is therefore a non-sequitur for guiding land use decisions on the ground. This paper also explores the latent values embedded in the ontology of a macro-scale 'marginal land' land cover class and advances the notion that 'marginal land' as an artificial spatial construct serves to re-frame land in a way that neglects socio-ecological processes in order to re-frame it in support of principles based in resource productivism. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - While the size and speculative nature of land transactions in the wake of energy, food and climate crises have surprised observers, the reasons for partial implementation of many land developments remain largely unexamined. This contribution investigates trajectories of land acquisition and enclosure by analyzing four acquisition processes in Indonesia - those associated with rice, oil palm, Jatropha and carbon sequestration - considering their implications for comparative studies elsewhere. The paper finds that current patterns of land use change represent a continuation of ongoing land transformation processes. It describes the logic leading to partial realization of large-scale schemes. Highlighting the importance of interactions between formal and vernacular rural land development processes, the essay concludes that many large-scale schemes are better understood as virtual land acquisitions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Pot experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of drought and salinity stresses and mulch amendment on Jatropha in sand dune soil under three conditions: glasshouse, shade house and open area. Plants were irrigated with freshwater and diluted seawater adjusted to two levels of electrical conductivity- 3 and 6 dS m -1. The results showed that experimental conditions remarkably affected the evapo-transpiration rate, soil moisture, salts accumulation and plant biomass production. Low temperature (23°C) conditions exhibited highest plant growth and soil moisture and lowest salts deposition. Plants showed no symptoms of heat stress in the glasshouse. The shade house and the open area profoundly reduced plant biomass and water content in the soil. Compared to the control, the mulch amended treatments had sufficient water for plant growth even in the high temperature of the open area. High salt content was found in salinity treated pots but the salinity level did not reduce Jatropha growth. Salt accumulated in the salinity treated pots helped retain more water, reduced the temperature and provided nutrients to the plants, with results which were almost similar to those from the mulch effect. The temperature conditions of the shade house and the open area (max&gt;40°C) caused substantial water loss and induced death of plants. Jatropha is a succulent and drought tolerant plant and a close irrigation interval is not the best option for Jatropha growth. But, organic amendment is needed when there is a big loss of soil water due to heat stress condition. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Measurements of light (C 2-C 5) non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were made along with ozone (O 3), oxides of nitrogen (NO x), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4) at Hissar and Kanpur in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in India during the month of December, 2004. Air samplings during noon and evening hours provided an opportunity to study the emission characteristics and changes during this period at these sites. The mixing ratio of O 3 was higher during noon hours due to photochemical formation, while the levels of precursor gases showed elevated values during the evening hours on a clear sky day. On foggy days there is no such variation. The lower mixing ratios of O 3 observed on foggy days could be due to the slower rate of photochemical formation caused by a reduction in solar flux and surface deposition caused by the presence of a stable planetary boundary layer. Propene and ethene show the highest evening to noon ratio due to their faster reactivities with OH radicals. Correlations among different species of the measured gases indicate contributions of emissions from biomass and biofuel burning as well as fossil fuel combustion. Although qualitatively in relation to O 3, the propylene (propene) equivalents of NMHCs have been calculated to investigate their roles in O 3 photochemistry and compared with the data from Ahmedabad, an urban site in western India. The important result, which has emerged from the analysis of the observed data, is that while the total amount of these NMHCs is least at Hissar and highest at Ahmedabad, the total propylene-equivalent is highest at Hissar and lowest at Ahmedabad. Further, these two sites in the IGP show significant contributions, almost 72-77%, by propene and ethene while the contribution by these two gases at Ahmedabad is only about 47%. The surface level mixing ratios of O 3 could be treated as representative for the chemical characterization of air mass at a regional scale over the IGP as the month long trends of O 3 show significant similarity compared to the trends in precursors at the two sites. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Mathematical programming models are widely used in agricultural sector analysis. However, the lack of micro-level data, as well as computational requirements, necessitate the aggregation of individual producers into representative units when working at the sectoral level.This usually leads to unrealistic extreme specialization in supply responses. In 1982, McCarl introduced the "historical crop mixes" approach to avoid extreme specialization.We extend this approach by generating additional synthetic crop mixes using supply response elasticities and systematically varied commodity prices. In addition to avoiding extreme specialization, this approach provides flexibility when future supply responses can be vastly different from past responses.An application to U.S. biofuel policy analysis is presented. © The Author (2012).

AB  - The present paper analyzed the environmental assessment of short rotation willow plantations in Sweden based on the standard framework of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from the International Standards Organisation. The analysis is focused on two alternative management regimes for willow plantations dedicated to biomass production for energy purposes. The data used included the averages of a large sample of commercial plantations. One of the scenarios is carried out under nitrogen based fertilized conditions and the other under non-fertilized management with total biomass yields (dry weight) of 140. t/ha and 86. t/ha over a 21 and 22-year life time respectively. The environmental profile was analyzed in terms of the potentials for abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. In addition, an energy analysis was performed using the cumulative energy demand method (CED). The application of nitrogen based fertilizers allows an increase in the biomass yield per ha of up to 40% although the contributions to almost all impact categories, particularly the eutrophication potential and toxicity potential impact categories are also considerably higher. Conversely, due to the higher biomass yields achieved with fertilization of these willow plantations, that regime presents a better overall environmental profile in terms of energy yield and global warming potential. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the life cycle of bioethanol produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw. Net energy consumption, CO 2 emission and production costs were estimated to determine whether environmentally preferable and economically viable bioethanol can be produced from rice straws. Two varieties of rice straw (Koshihikari and Leafstar), three energy scenarios (F-E-RH: Fuel-Electricity-Residues used for Heat; F-E-RE: Fuel-Electricity-Residues used to generate Electricity; F-RE: Fuel-Residues used to generate Electricity) and three types of primary energy (heavy oil; LNG: liquefied natural gas; agri-residues) were considered. The net energy consumption, CO 2 emission and production costs were estimated to be 10.0-17.6MJ/L, -0.5 to 1.6kg/L and 84.9-144.3¥/L (1 US$≈100¥), respectively, depending on the feedstock and scenarios of this study. A shift in energy scenarios or in the type of primary energy (heavy oil to LNG or agri-residues) not only reduces emissions and production costs of bioethanol from rice straw, but may also reduce the fluctuation in production cost over time and risk on investment, which would encourage more investment in this sector. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass is a potential source of renewable biomass for conversion to liquid biofuels. Efficient conversion requires effective strategies for pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification to produce fermentable sugars. Standard analysis of fermentation liquids includes detection of monosaccharides and ethanol to determine efficiency of conversion. Larger components, specifically oligosaccharides, are typically not measured due to the structural complexity of the products; however, as oligosaccharides they represent carbon available in biomass that is not converted to liquid fuels. In this study, ammonia-pretreated switchgrass was enzymatically depolymerized either independently or under simultaneous saccharification and fermentation conditions. Residual oligosaccharides were reducing end-labeled followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. These data reveal 20 oligosaccharide peaks with distinct retention times and tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns representing 13 different oligosaccharide compositions. All measured compositions were smaller than a chain length of six and were neither linear xylooligosaccharides nor modified with phenolic esters. This work represents a robust method to monitor and identify unhydrolyzed oligosaccharides from fermentations, thereby permitting the screening of targeted enzymatic activities to promote the complete hydrolysis of xylan. © 2012.

AB  - This study analyzes the environmental and economic feasibility of ethanol produced from sugarcane for use as a potential gasoline substitute in the Mexican transport sector from 2010 to 2030. One scenario was created by projecting the historical trend of energy demand assuming that a fraction of this demand is satisfied with ethanol produced from the cultivation of 2.9 million hectares of sugarcane. A life cycle study was performed according to the recommendations from the European Union Directive on Renewable Energies (that include direct land use change emissions) and was used to estimate life cycle Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The method used by Fingerman et al. (2010) was adopted to estimate the water consumption. In the economic analysis, the production cost of ethanol was calculated, and a mitigation cost for carbon dioxide equivalent emissions was estimated. The potential for employment generation was also estimated. The results demonstrate that water use increases by 29.4 times and that the costs increase by 10,706 million USD with the alternative scenario. This scenario, however, has the potential to create 560,619 direct jobs. Furthermore, GHG mitigation is confirmed since the reference scenario resulted in GHG gasoline life cycle emissions of 78.7kgCO 2e/GJ while the alternative scenario resulted in Ethanol GHG emissions in the life cycle of 57.52 kgCO 2e/GJ. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Public policy supports biofuels for their benefits to agricultural economies, energy security and the environment. The environmental rationale is premised on greenhouse gas (GHG, "carbon") emissions reduction, which is a matter of contention. This issue is challenging to resolve because of critical but difficult-to-verify assumptions in lifecycle analysis (LCA), limits of available data and disputes about system boundaries. Although LCA has been the presumptive basis of climate policy for fuels, careful consideration indicates that it is inappropriate for defining regulations. This paper proposes a method using annual basis carbon (ABC) accounting to track the stocks and flows of carbon and other relevant GHGs throughout fuel supply chains. Such an approach makes fuel and feedstock production facilities the focus of accounting while treating the CO 2 emissions from fuel end-use at face value regardless of the origin of the fuel carbon (bio- or fossil). Integrated into cap-and-trade policy and including provisions for mitigating indirect land-use change impacts, also evaluated on an annual basis, an ABC approach would provide a sound carbon management framework for the transportation fuels sector. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates that by 2022 at least 1.36 × 10 11 L of fuel ethanol be produced in the United States, with at least 6.06 × 10 10 L being derived from lignocellulosic biomass. However, the market for cellulosic biofuels is still developing and little is known about the willingness of agricultural producers to grow dedicated energy crops. While there have been some studies done on factors that determine farmers' willingness to produce switchgrass, these have been localized in nature and largely focused on factors other than price. This study analyzes the factors that influence interest among producers in the 12 southeastern U.S. states in growing switchgrass as a biomass feedstock and the share of farmland interested producers would be willing to devote to switchgrass production. The results suggest that about two-thirds of the producers in the region have some interest in growing switchgrass. Among those who are interested and willing to accept the hypothetical price, the predicted land conversion share is 35.8% or 56 ha per farm. At these rates, a commercial scale bio-refinery in the southeast might have to purchase switchgrass from as many as 567 different producers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing emphasis on biofuel to meet the growing energy demand while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, Jatropha curcas has attracted the attention of researchers, policy makers and industries as a good candidate for biodiesel. It is a non-edible oil crop, drought tolerant and could be grown on degraded lands in the tropics without competing for lands currently used for food production. J. curcas being a wild plant, much about its water requirement and production potential of promising clones in different agroclimatic conditions is not known. Water use assessment of J. curcas plantations in the semi-arid tropical location at ICRISAT, Patancheru indicated that crop evapotranspiration of J. curcas under no moisture stress varied from 1410 to 1538. mm per year during 2006-2009. Under field conditions the crop evapotranspiration varied from 614 to 930. mm depending on the atmospheric demand, rainfall and crop phenological stage. Patterns of soil-water depletion indicated that with growing plant age from two to five years, depth of soil-water extraction increased from 100 to 150. cm by fifth year. Monthly water use of Jatropha varied from 10-20 (leaf shedding period) to 140. mm depending on water availability and environmental demand. This study indicated that J. curcas has a good drought tolerance mechanism, however under favorable soil moisture conditions Jatropha could use large amounts of water for luxurious growth and high yield. These findings highlight the need to carefully identify suitable niche areas for Jatropha cultivation and assess the implications of large J. curcas plantations on water availability and use under different agroecosystems, particularly so in water scarce regions such as semi-arid and arid regions in the tropics. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life cycle inventory models of greenhouse gas emissions from biofuel production have become tightly integrated into government mandates and other policies to encourage biofuel production. Current models do not include life cycle impacts of biomass storage or reflect current literature on emissions from soil and biomass decomposition. In this study, the GREET model framework was used to determine net greenhouse gas emissions during ethanol production from corn and switchgrass via three biomass storage systems: wet ensiling of whole corn, and indoor and outdoor dry bale storage of corn stover and switchgrass. Dry matter losses during storage were estimated from the literature and used to modify GREET inventory analysis. Results showed that biomass stability is a key parameter affecting fuel production per farmed hectare and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Corn silage may generate 5358 L/ha of ethanol at 26.5 g CO 2 eq/MJ, relative to 5654 L/ha at 52.3 g CO 2 eq/MJ from combined corn stover and conventional grain corn ethanol production, or 3919 L/ha at 21.3 g CO 2 eq/MJ from switchgrass. Dry matter losses can increase net emissions by 3-25% (ensiling), 5-53% (bales outdoors), or 1-12% (bales indoors), decreasing the net GHG reduction of ethanol over gasoline by up to 10.9%. Greater understanding of biomass storage losses and greenhouse gas fluxes during storage is necessary to accurately assess biomass storage options to ensure that the design of biomass supply logistics systems meet GHG reduction mandates for biofuel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We assessed the short-term effects of converting pastureland to hybrid poplar and willow bioenergy plantations on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and nitrogen (N) leaching in northern Michigan, USA. We used static chambers to measure soil carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and methane (CH 4) efflux, and tension lysimeters to measure nitrate (NO 3 -) leaching, in newly-established poplar and willow plantation plots, and in reference pasture plots. Emissions of N 2O increased markedly following cultivation with cumulative direct N 2O emissions of 0.3, 4.6 and 5.9Mgha -1 of CO 2 equivalents (CO 2eq) in the reference, willow and poplar plots, respectively. Similarly, land conversion resulted in large increases of NO 3 - leaching with losses of 2.6, 38.8 and 53.9kgha -1 of N from the reference, willow and poplar plots, respectively. Soil CO 2 fluxes were significantly affected by land-use conversion; soils from willow and poplar plots emitted 29-42% less CO 2 relative to the reference plots. Greater root respiration in the pastureland likely explained the greater soil CO 2 efflux in these plots. Estimates of the net GHG emissions due to land-use conversion were strongly influenced by assumptions regarding the root contribution (RC) to total soil CO 2 efflux. Assuming an RC=50%, we estimate that pastureland conversion at this site incurred GHG debts of 7.4 and 11.6Mgha -1y -1 as CO 2eq for willow and poplar, respectively, during the establishment year. These results demonstrate the need to include soil disturbance impacts on the N cycle in future life cycle assessment of these bioenergy crops. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Across the world, 'green grabbing' - the appropriation of land and resources for environmental ends - is an emerging process of deep and growing significance. The vigorous debate on 'land grabbing' already highlights instances where 'green' credentials are called upon to justify appropriations of land for food or fuel - as where large tracts of land are acquired not just for 'more efficient farming' or 'food security', but also to 'alleviate pressure on forests'. In other cases, however, environmental green agendas are the core drivers and goals of grabs - whether linked to biodiversity conservation, biocarbon sequestration, biofuels, ecosystem services, ecotourism or 'offsets' related to any and all of these. In some cases these involve the wholesale alienation of land, and in others the restructuring of rules and authority in the access, use and management of resources that may have profoundly alienating effects. Green grabbing builds on well-known histories of colonial and neo-colonial resource alienation in the name of the environment - whether for parks, forest reserves or to halt assumed destructive local practices. Yet it involves novel forms of valuation, commodification and markets for pieces and aspects of nature, and an extraordinary new range of actors and alliances - as pension funds and venture capitalists, commodity traders and consultants, GIS service providers and business entrepreneurs, ecotourism companies and the military, green activists and anxious consumers among others find once-unlikely common interests. This collection draws new theorisation together with cases from African, Asian and Latin American settings, and links critical studies of nature with critical agrarian studies, to ask: To what extent and in what ways do 'green grabs' constitute new forms of appropriation of nature? How and when do circulations of green capital become manifest in actual appropriations on the ground - through what political and discursive dynamics? What are the implications for ecologies, landscapes and livelihoods? And who is gaining and who is losing - how are agrarian social relations, rights and authority being restructured, and in whose interests?. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study is aimed to systematically estimate marginal land resources with different grades (total area; land with certain eco-environmental-economic feasibility; centralized reserve land) in China, and evaluate potential energy production from microalgae on marginal lands in the long-, mid- and near-term, based on a model. The annual potential energy production from algae in total marginal land of China (APEMC) was estimated to 4.19 billion standard coal equivalent (tce), far more than total annual energy consumption equivalent in China (TECCE) in 2007. For microalgae with 35% lipid content, the APEMC in the mid-term would be 37.6-65.8% of the TECCE in 2007. The corresponding annual CO 2 emission mitigation by replacement of fossil fuels by algal bioenergy would be 4.27-7.44billiont. Although Southwest China provides the highest potential algae production in the long-term, Northwest China provides the highest value in the near-term. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article discusses an integrated framework built to compute the cost of stover-based E85, as well as its life cycle energy efficiency and CO 2 emission, with consideration of uncertainties of the policy-related factors, in China. Results show that co-product treatment greatly influenced the performance of E85 route. The calculated values of energy efficiency in co-product burning for electricity scenario (the base scenario) and that in co-product for selling scenario (the alternative scenario) are 4.41 and 3.61, respectively. CO 2 emission of the stover-based route is 99.7% more than that of the gasoline route in the base scenario and 55.3% less than that of the gasoline in the alternative scenario. The costs of E85 in these two scenarios are 9.78 and 7.76yuan/L, respectively. Based on the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, the article suggests the following: (1) stover-based E85 is currently not competitive in terms of cost; (2) on the current stage, to make E85 competitive, policymakers should be concerned about stimulating processing innovation, providing subsidies on ethanol, feedstock and co-product, as well as raising gasoline price, rather than increasing carbon tax rate/promoting Cleaner Development Mechanism (CDM) projects or influencing consumers' Willingness to Pay (WTP) for E85. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel development continues to be a critical development strategy in Africa because it promises to be an important part of the emerging bio-economy. However, there is a growing concern that the pattern of biofuel development is not always consistent with the principles of sustainable development. This paper assesses the potential of the impacts of biofuel development on food security in Botswana. Drawing on informal and semi-structured interviews, the paper concludes that there is potential for the development of biofuels in Botswana without adverse effects on food security due mainly to availability of idle land which accounted for 72% of agricultural land in the eastern part of the country in 2008. It is suggested that farmers could be incentivized to produce energy crops and more food from such land. Although it is hypothesized that the implementation of biofuel development programmes in other countries had an impact on local commodity prices during the period 2005-2008 in Botswana, it is argued that local biofuel production may not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in commodity food prices because land availability is not a major issue. The paper makes policy recommendations for sustainable biofuel development in Botswana. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several physical and chemical factors limit the production of biofuels, such as the complex process required for the conversion of plant biomass into ethanol. For example, fossil energy inputs needed for the production of ethanol from corn is 1.59 liters per liter of ethanol. One of the many factors limiting energy output from biomass is the extremely low fraction of sunlight reaching a hectare that is captured by the plants. On average only about 0.1% of the sunlight is captured by green plants per year. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study focuses on the valorization of biomass wastes in the Piedmont Region, in Italy, with the aim of producing synthetic liquid fuels. On the basis of a territorial survey, the selected fractions from the separate collection of municipal solid wastes (organic fraction, pruning residues and wood refuses) and, to a lesser extent, the residues of the agro-industry, were considered potentially important, due to their abundance and availability throughout the year. Dedicated arborous cultivations, evaluated on the basis of the land that is currently cultivated, also showed a great potential. The sum of the potential recoverable energy from these three categories reaches 35.99 × 10 6 GJ/year, i.e. 6.79% of the total final energy consumption of the Piedmont Region. The target of this valorization is here the conversion of these low energy density biomasses into valuable liquid fuels. The direct liquefaction technology was chosen due to its flexibility towards the feed and the possibility of working with wet substrates, these being typical constraints which are difficult to be overcome in the other thermo-chemical processes. In the direct liquefaction process, a pulp of organic material, with a water content ranging from 50% to 90%, is fed to a reactor at around 330°C and 180 bar, with a residence time of 4-10 min, according to the biomass pulp composition. The resulting bio-oil can be fed to the upgrading section of a refinery, in order to reach standard fuel-grade specifications, which allows it to be blended with currently sold transportation fuels, or it could be used as a source of valuable chemicals in an alternative scenario. A 50 ktons/year plant (based on the dry biomass content) was considered, and the balance of plant was sized in order to estimate the energy requirements of the plant and the bio-oil yield. A very convenient configuration was designed, and a bio-oil net production of 37.1 wt% was reached (referring to the dry matter of the biomass), which takes into account all the fuel needs of the plant. The specific power consumption was equal to 0.258 kWh/kg Oil, which corresponds to a ratio between the output and input energy of 35.8 (excluding the biomass lower calorific value). Finally, it should be mentioned that this target was obtained using simple and economic equipment, thus responding to the need to devise a process which could be profitable, even at a medium scale, for local applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Achten etal. (2010) note that small-scale, local shifts towards growing the inedible, biodiesel crop Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) may overcome some of the negative points inherent in popular biofuel-focused debates, including those on food insecurity and environmental degradation concerns. In this short response, we assess the views expressed by Achten etal. (2010) in light of recent case study-based research in Malawi that identifies and analyses the current context and potential for rural development of both local-level community-led and larger-scale private sector Jatropha projects in Malawi.Although large-scale cultivation of Jatropha is at risk of economic loss resultant from knowledge gaps and unpredictable yields, our research shows that small-scale initiatives do have the potential to contribute positively to rural livelihoods. Sales of seeds or production of Jatropha oil for stoves, engines, soap and paraffin can result in reduced household expenditure or increased incomes. In order for these benefits to be realised and up-scaled, further institutional support in terms of knowledge and technical provision is vital, and must be communicated through established and context-specific, locally-appropriate channels. While the biofuel debate remains global, we assert that actions should be focused at the local level in order to realise developmental, sustainability and climate change mitigation benefits across a range of scales. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To alleviate the demand on fertile agricultural land for production of bioenergy, we investigated the possibility of producing biomass for bioenergy on trace element (TE) contaminated land. Soil samples and plant tissues (leaves, wood and bark) of adult willow (Salix sp.), poplar (Populus sp.), and birch (Betula pendula) trees were collected from five contaminated sites in France and Germany and analysed for Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ca, and K. Cadmium concentration in tree leaves were correlated with tree species, whereas Zn concentration in leaves was site correlated. Birch revealed significantly lower leaf Cd concentrations (1.2-8.9mgkg -1) than willow and poplar (5-80mgkg -1), thus posing the lowest risk for TE contamination of surrounding areas. Birch displayed the lowest bark concentrations for Ca (2300-6200mgkg -1) and K (320-1250mgkg -1), indicating that it would be the most suitable tree species for fuel production, as high concentrations of K and Ca decrease the ash melting point which results in a reduced plant lifetime. Due to higher TE concentrations in bark compared to wood a small bark proportion in relation to the trunk is desirable. In general the bark proportion was reduced with the tree age. In summary, birch was amongst the investigated species the most suitable for biomass production on TE contaminated land. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass has increasingly been recognized as a dedicated biofuel crop for its broad adaptation to marginal lands and high biomass. However, little is known about the basic biology and the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in switchgrass, particularly under stress conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of salt and drought stress on switchgrass germination, growth and the expression of small regulatory RNAs. The results indicate that salt stress had a gradual but significant negative effect on switchgrass growth and development. The germination rate was significantly decreased from 82% for control to 36% under 1% NaCl treatment. However, drought stress had little effect on the germination rate but had a significant effect on the growth of switchgrass under the severest salinity stress. Both salt and drought stresses altered the expression pattern of miRNAs in a dose-dependent manner. However, each miRNA responded to drought stress in a different pattern. Salt and drought stress changed the expression level of miRNAs mainly from 0.9-fold up-regulation to 0.7-fold down-regulation. miRNAs were less sensitive to drought treatment than salinity treatment, as evidenced by the narrow fold change in expression levels. Although the range of change in expression level of miRNAs was similar under salt and drought stress, no miRNAs displayed significant change in expression level under all tested salt conditions. Two miRNAs, miR156 and miR162, showed significantly change in expression level under high drought stress. This suggests that miR156 and miR162 may attribute to the adaption of switchgrass to drought stress and are good candidates for improving switchgrass as a biofuel crop by transgenic technology. © 2012 Sun et al.

AB  - Background: Wax ester synthases (WSs) can synthesize wax esters from alcohols and fatty acyl coenzyme A thioesters. The knowledge of the preferred substrates for each WS allows the use of yeast cells for the production of wax esters that are high-value materials and can be used in a variety of industrial applications. The products of WSs include fatty acid ethyl esters, which can be directly used as biodiesel. Results: Here, heterologous WSs derived from five different organisms were successfully expressed and evaluated for their substrate preference in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We investigated the potential of the different WSs for biodiesel (that is, fatty acid ethyl esters) production in S. cerevisiae. All investigated WSs, from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798, Rhodococcus opacus PD630, Mus musculus C57BL/6 and Psychrobacter arcticus 273-4, have different substrate specificities, but they can all lead to the formation of biodiesel. The best biodiesel producing strain was found to be the one expressing WS from M. hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798 that resulted in a biodiesel titer of 6.3 mg/L. To further enhance biodiesel production, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase was up-regulated, which resulted in a 30% increase in biodiesel production. Conclusions: Five WSs from different species were functionally expressed and their substrate preference characterized in S. cerevisiae, thus constructing cell factories for the production of specific kinds of wax ester. WS from M. hydrocarbonoclasticus showed the highest preference for ethanol compared to the other WSs, and could permit the engineered S. cerevisiae to produce biodiesel. © 2012 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We simulated elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols in China and compared model results to surface measurements at Chinese rural and background sites, with the goal of deriving "top-down" emission estimates of EC and OC, as well as better quantifying the secondary sources of OC. We included in the model state-of-the-science Chinese "bottom-up" emission inventories for EC (1.92 TgC yrĝ̂'1) and OC (3.95 TgC yrĝ̂'1), as well as updated secondary OC formation pathways. The average simulated annual mean EC concentration at rural and background sites was 1.1 1/4gC mĝ̂'3, 56% lower than the observed 2.5 1/4gC mĝ̂'3. The average simulated annual mean OC concentration at rural and background sites was 3.4 1/4gC mĝ̂'3, 76% lower than the observed 14 1/4gC mĝ̂'3. Multiple regression to fit surface monthly mean EC observations at rural and background sites yielded the best estimate of Chinese EC source of 3.05 &plusmn; 0.78 TgC yrĝ̂'1. Based on the top-down EC emission estimate and observed seasonal primary OC/EC ratios, we estimated Chinese OC emissions to be 6.67 &plusmn; 1.30 TgC yrĝ̂'1. Using these top-down estimates, the simulated average annual mean EC concentration at rural and background sites was significantly improved to 1.9 1/4gC mĝ̂'3. However, the model still significantly underestimated observed OC in all seasons (simulated average annual mean OC at rural and background sites was 5.4 1/4gC mĝ̂'3), with little skill in capturing the spatiotemporal variability. Secondary formation accounts for 21% of Chinese annual mean surface OC in the model, with isoprene being the most important precursor. In summer, as high as 62% of the observed surface OC may be due to secondary formation in eastern China. Our analysis points to four shortcomings in the current bottom-up inventories of Chinese carbonaceous aerosols: (1) the anthropogenic source is underestimated on a national scale, particularly for OC; (2) the spatiotemporal distributions of emissions are misrepresented; (3) there is a missing source in western China, likely associated with the use of biofuels or other low-quality fuels for heating; and (4) sources in fall are not well represented, either because the seasonal shifting of emissions and/or secondary formation are poorly captured or because specific fall emission events are missing. In addition, secondary production of OC in China is severely underestimated. More regional measurements with better spatiotemporal coverage are needed to resolve these shortcomings. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - In the US, 95% of biofuel is produced from corn (Zea mays L), an intensively managed annual crop that is also grown for food and animal feed. Using the DAYCENT model, we estimated the effects on ecosystem services of replacing corn ethanol feedstocks with the perennial cellulosic feedstocks switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deuter). If cellulosic feedstocks were planted on cropland that is currently used for ethanol production in the US, more ethanol (+82%) and grain for food (+4%) could be produced while at the same time reducing nitrogen leaching (-15 to -22%) and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions (-29 to -473%). The GHG reduction was large even after accounting for emissions associated with indirect landuse change. Conversion from a high-input annual crop to a low-input perennial crop for biofuel production can thus transition the central US from a net source to a net sink for GHGs. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Climate change mitigation strategies cannot be evaluated solely in terms of energy cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential. Maintaining GHGs at a "safe" level will require fundamental change in the way we approach energy production, and a number of environmental, economic, and societal factors will come into play. Water is an essential component of energy production, and water resource constraints will limit our options for meeting society's growing demand for energy while also reducing GHG emissions. This study evaluates these potential constraints from a global perspective by revisiting the climate wedges proposal of Pacala and Socolow (Science2004, 305 (5686), 968-972) and evaluating the potential water-use impacts of the wedges associated with energy production. GHG mitigation options that improve energy conversion or use efficiency can simultaneously reduce GHG emissions, lower energy costs, and reduce energy impacts on water resources. Other GHG mitigation options (e.g., carbon capture and sequestration, traditional nuclear, and biofuels from dedicated energy crops) increase water requirements for energy. Achieving energy sustainability requires deployment of alternatives that can reduce GHG emissions, water resource impacts, and energy costs. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - United States (U.S.) energy policy includes an expectation that bioenergy will be a substantial future energy source. In particular, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) aims to increase annual U.S. biofuel (secondary bioenergy) production by more than 3-fold, from 40 to 136 billion liters ethanol, which implies an even larger increase in biomass demand (primary energy), from roughly 2.9 to 7.4 EJ yr-1. However, our understanding of many of the factors used to establish such energy targets is far from complete, introducing significgant uncertainty into the feasibility of current estimates of bioenergy potential. Here, we utilized satellite-derived net primary productivity (NPP) data-measured for every 1 km2 of the 7.2 million km2 of vegetated land in the conterminous U.S.-to estimate primary bioenergy potential (PBP). Our results indicate that PBP of the conterminous U.S. ranges from roughly 5.9 to 22.2 EJ yr-1, depending on land use. The low end of this range represents the potential when harvesting residues only, while the high end would require an annual biomass harvest over an area more than three times current U.S. agricultural extent. While EISA energy targets are theoretically achievable, we show that meeting these targets utilizing current technology would require either an 80% displacement of current crop harvest or the conversion of 60% of rangeland productivity. Accordingly, realistically constrained estimates of bioenergy potential are critical for effective incorporation of bioenergy into the national energy portfolio. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent developments in international markets point to a dramatic food crisis all over the world. The media today is repeatedly dominated by staggering reports on the global food crisis, soaring crop prices and demands for biofuels, raising fears of political instability. Since 2002, media reports have mostly highlighted the dramatic situation of food insecurity. The Arab region is most seriously affected by the global food crisis. It is clear that the root causes of 'the Arab springs' and revolutions underway in various Arab countries are not only a desire for transformation to a more democratic political system but also desire for the realization of social justice among citizens, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor. This paper addresses the need for a change in individual and societal behavioral patterns. It addresses the need for communities to assist governments in preventing and managing water-related food crises. It brings together world waters in its complexities, with new dimensions of institutional context and cultural norms. The effectiveness of ongoing traditional approaches may be limited without additional measures and tools to help governments understand how to engage in cooperative behavioral change. © IWA Publishing & the Botín Foundation 2012.

AB  - The US President Barack Obama has stated that the best weapon against rising gasoline prices is the comprehensive energy strategy he outlined in his State of the Union address, which is already producing results including more oil and gas production. After reiterating that it will take more than simply drilling for more oil and gas to solve US energy problems, the president conceded that this still is part of the solution, along with wind, solar, nuclear, biofuels, and energy efficiency improvements. American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers Association Pres. Charles T. Drevna said the organization supports a balanced approach to meeting the nation's energy needs, but opposes many of the Obama administration's proposals. President Obama's administration has issued 50.7% fewer annual leases on public lands than President Bill Clinton's did. Gulf of Mexico energy production is down 16% since 2009 and is projected to decrease even further in 2012.

AB  - Brazil is one of the largest bioethanol and biodiesel producers in the world. Its biodiversity and environmental characteristics create the opportunity to make Brazil a major producer of biotechnological products, such as enzymes for the bioenergy industry. This review gives a brief status of the production of amylases, cellulases, xylanases, and lipases and their application on the synthesis of bioethanol and biodiesel. The historical utilization of several agroindustrial by-products as feedstocks in such processes are presented, as well as the Brazilian market for these enzymes. Finally, an innovative and multidisciplinary approach based on geographic information systems is used in a case study for the estimation of the potential production of the biocatalysts in Brazil. Results indicate that the national production of concentrated preparations based on amylases, cellulases, lipases, and xylanases could reach 3. 1 × 107, 3. 2 × 107, 3. 1 × 108, and 2. 9 × 109 t, respectively. Therefore, Brazil presents a huge potential for the production of biocatalysts from renewable materials. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Florida has high potential to produce forest biomass as a source of renewable energy because of its favorable climate. The Florida government has developed renewable bioenergy programs and policies to reduce the costs of biofuel and compete with fossil fuels, such as the Florida Renewable Energy Technologies & Energy Efficiency Act. The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the economy-wide and welfare effects of select bioenergy polices in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling framework. This study simulated 2 scenarios: (1) implementation of an incentive for the production of second-generation bioenergy (a 10% fuel tax reduction applied to the second-generation bioenergy sector) and (2) a scenario anticipating technological gains in forest bioenergy production. The modeling experiments resulted in increased welfare and gross state product, and land shifting from agriculture to forestry. Results indicated that incentives for the second-generation bioenergy sector and investments in technology would result in overall positive outcomes for Florida's economy and household welfare.

AB  - Agricultural soils that are covered by vegetation or crop residue are less susceptible to degradation by wind and water erosion, organic matter depletion, structural degradation and declining fertility. In general, perennial crops, higher yields, reduced tillage and continuous cropping provide more soil cover than annual crops, lower yields, intensive tillage, residue harvesting and fallowing. This study presents a model for estimating the number of days in a year that the soil surface is protected and demonstrates its application on the Canadian prairies over the period from 1981 to 2006. Over the 25-yr study period, the average soil cover on Canadian prairie soils increased by 4.8% overall. The improvement came primarily as a result of widespread adoption of no-till and a decline in the use of summerfallow, but the gains were offset to a great deal by a shift from higher-cover crops such as wheat, oats and barley to more profitable but lower-cover crops such as canola, soybeans and potatoes. The implication of these trends is that, even though protection of prairie agricultural soils has improved over the past 25 yr, soil cover could decline dramatically over the next several decades if crop changes continue, the adoption of conservation tillage reaches a peak and residue harvesting for biofuels becomes more common.

AB  - Despite large-scale investments and government mandates to expand biofuels development and infrastructure in the United States, little is known about how the public conceives of this alternative fuel technology. This study examines public opinion of biofuels by focusing on citizen knowledge and the motivated processing of media information. Specifically, we explore the direct effects of biofuels knowledge and the moderating effect of partisanship on the relationship between media use and benefit vs. risk perceptions in the following four domains: environmental impacts, economic consequences, ethical/social implications, and political ramifications. Our results suggest that more knowledgeable respondents see fewer benefits of biofuels relative to risks, and that Democrats and Republicans are affected differently by media use when forming opinions about biofuels. Among Democrats, greater attention to political media content leads to a more favorable outlook toward the technology across several domains of interest, while among Republicans, an increase in attention to political content has the opposite effect. Possible reasons for these results, as well as implications of the findings at the intersection of politics and the life sciences, are discussed.

AB  - Until recently, biodiesel production has been derived from terrestrial plants such as soybean and canola, leading to competition between biodiesel production and agricultural production for source materials. Microalgae have the potential to synthesize 30 times more oil per hectare than terrestrial plants without competing for agricultural land. We examined four genera (Cyclotella, Aulacoseira, Fragilaria, Synedra) of common freshwater diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) for growth and lipid content in deWned medium (sD11) that replicates hypereutrophic conditions in lakes and wastewater treatment plant effluents and optimized the medium for silicon content. Cyclotella and Aulacoseira produced the highest levels of total lipids, 60 and 43 μg total lipids/ml, respectively. Both diatoms are rich in fatty acids C14, C16, C16:1, C16:2,7,10, and C22:5n3. Of the diatoms examined, Cyclotella reached the highest population density (&lt;2.5 × 10 6 cells/ml) in stationary phase when many of the cells appeared to be Wlled entirely with oil. Silicon enrichment studies indicated that for optimal utilization of phosphorus and nitrogen by diatoms growing in wastewater effluent, the amount of silicon present or added to the effluent should be 17.5 times the mass of phosphorus in the effluent. With high growth rates, high lipid contents, and rapid settling rates, Cyclotella and Aulacoseira are candidates for biodiesel production. © 2011 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Macroalgae are considered to be promising biomass for fuels and chemicals production. To utilize brown macroalgae as biomass, the degradation of alginate, which is the main carbohydrate of brown macroalgae, into monomeric units is a critical prerequisite step. Saccharophagus degradans 2-40 is capable of degrading more than ten different polysaccharides including alginate, and its genome sequence demonstrated that this bacterium contains several putative alginate lyase genes including alg17C. The gene for Alg17C, which is classified into the PL-17 family, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant Alg17C was found to preferentially act on oligoalginates with degrees of polymerization higher than 2 to produce the alginate monomer, 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid. The optimal pH and temperature for Alg17C were found to be 6 and 40°C, respectively. The K M and V max of Alg17C were 35.2 mg/ml and 41.7 U/mg, respectively. Based on the results of this study, Alg17C could be used as the key enzyme to produce alginate monomers in the process of utilizing alginate for biofuels and chemicals production. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Recent European Union sustainability criteria for biofuels provide an opportunity to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels production. Thus, despite declarations of sustainable development's central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO regulatory chill effect on the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the mutual supportiveness between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development's soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence. © 2012 Oxford University Press, all rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, 207 strains of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from the gut of Holotrichia parallela larvae. These bacterial isolates were assigned to 21 genotypes by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). A partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis and standard biochemical and physiological tests were used for the assignment of the 21 representative isolates. Our results show that the cellulolytic bacterial community is dominated by the Proteobacteria (70.05%), followed by the Actinobacteria (24.15%), the Firmicutes (4.35%), and the Bacteroidetes (1.45%). At the genus level, Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Ochrobactrum, Rhizobium, Cellulosimicrobium, and Microbacterium were the predominant groups, but members of Bacillus, Dyadobacter, Siphonobacter, Paracoccus, Kaistia, Devosia, Labrys, Ensifer, Variovorax, Shinella, Citrobacter, and Stenotrophomonas were also found. Furthermore, our results suggest that a significant amount of bacterial diversity exists among the cellulolytic bacteria, and that Siphonobacter aquaeclarae, Cellulosimicrobium funkei, Paracoccus sulfuroxidans, Ochrobactrum cytisi, Ochrobactrum haematophilum, Kaistia adipata, Devosia riboflavina, Labrys neptuniae, Ensifer adhaerens, Shinella zoogloeoides, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas nitroreducens are reported to be cellulolytic for the first time in this study. Our results indicate that the scarab gut is an attractive source for the study of novel cellulolytic microorganisms and enzymes useful for cellulose degradation. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In a bio-based economy, chemicals, materials, biofuels, and other forms of energy will be produced from biomass. Pressure on agricultural land will thus increase, calling for highly efficient solutions in terms of land use, with minimal environmental impacts. In order to gain better insight into the available options and their trade-offs, this perspective studies the production of polylactic acid (PLA), bioethanol, and bio-based polyethylene (PE) from wheat, maize, sugarbeet, sugarcane, and Miscanthus. While in current agricultural practice some plants are harvested and used as whole crop (e.g. Miscanthus), for others only part of the plant is used, with the remainder being returned to the field (e.g. wheat straw). In order to obtain an understanding of the unused potential we assume as default case that all agricultural residues and processing co-products are used for energy purposes, thereby replacing non-renewable energy. We conclude that this agricultural practice would allow to substantially reduce non-renewable energy use (NREU). We also find a clear difference in ranking depending on whether we study (i) NREU per (metric) tonne of product or (ii) Avoided NREU per hectare of land. The latter seems a suitable choice in a world where land availability is limited. In this case, we identify PLA as the preferred choice, irrespective of the type of crop. The production of ethanol for the replacement of fuels scores as the worst option for all crops. For each of the products studied, sugarcane offers the highest savings per hectare followed by sugarbeet. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Perennial grasses may provide a renewable source of biomass for energy production. Biomass yield, nutrient concentrations, and nutrient removal rates of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), giant reed (Arundo donax L.), weeping lovegrass [Eragrostis curvula (Shrad.) Nees], kleingrass (Panicum coloratum L.), and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.) were evaluated at four N fertilizer rates (0, 56, 112, or 168 kg Nha -1) on a Minco fine sandy loam soil in southern Oklahoma. Species were established in 2008 and harvested for biomass in winter of 2009 and 2010. Biomass yield (dry matter basis) did not show a strong relationship with N fertilizer rate (p = 0.08), but was affected by year and species interactions (p &lt; 0.01). Weeping lovegrass and kleingrass produced 29.0 and 16.0 Mg ha -1 in 2009, but only 13.0 Mg ha -1 and 9.8 Mg ha -1 in 2010, respectively. Biomass yields of giant reed, switchgrass, and Johnsongrass averaged 23.3, 17.8, and 6.0 Mg ha -1, respectively. Giant miscanthus established poorly, producing only 4.7 Mg ha -1. Across years, giant reed had the highest biomass yield, 33.2 Mg ha -1 at 168 kg Nha -1, and the highest nutrient concentrations and removal rates (162 to 228 kg Nha -1, 23 to 25 kg Pha -1, and 121 to 149 kg Kha -1) among the grasses. Although giant reed demonstrated tremendous biomass production, its higher nutrient removal rates indicate a potential for increased fertilization requirements over time. Switchgrass had consistently high biomass yields and relatively low nutrient removal rates (40 to 75 kg Nha -1, 5 to 12 kg Pha -1, and 44 to 110 kg Kha -1) across years, demonstrating its merits as a low-input bioenergy crop. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Miscanthus sinensis is a moderately invasive ornamental grass species being considered as a bioenergy species in the USA and elsewhere. In this study, we show the range of environmental conditions tolerated by this species in wild populations in the USA and in Japan. Six naturalized populations in the USA and five native populations in Japan were sampled in summer 2009. In each population, environmental factors (canopy cover and soil fertility) were measured, along with measurements of size and morphology for 30 plants. Relationships between M. sinensis size and environmental variables in the two countries were determined using linear mixed effects models. Results indicated that M. sinensis can tolerate extremely wide variation in soil and climate conditions in the populations we sampled across both ranges, suggesting that it could be successfully grown across a wide distribution in the USA, both intentionally as a bioenergy crop and unintentionally as an escaped invader. Plant size generally responded to different environmental conditions in both ranges, with USA plants being negatively influenced by canopy cover and Japanese plants being positively influenced by soil fertility measures. We recommend caution in growing M. sinensis for bioenergy or ornamental purposes to minimize escape outside of its native range. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The comparative productivity of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) is of critical importance to the biofuel industry. The radiation use efficiency (RUE), when derived in an environment with non-limiting soil water and soil nutrients, provides one metric of relative productivity. The objective of this study was to compare giant Miscanthus to available switchgrass cultivars, using established methods to calculate RUE of the two species at two disparate sites. Measurements of fraction intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and dry matter were taken on plots at Elsberry, MO (Miscanthus and the switchgrass cultivars Alamo, Kanlow, and Cave-in-Rock) and at Gustine, TX (Miscanthus and Alamo switchgrass, irrigated with dairy wastewater and a non-irrigated control). In MO, Miscanthus mean RUE (3.71) was less than Alamo switchgrass mean RUE (4.30). In TX under irrigation, Miscanthus mean RUE was 2.24 and Alamo switchgrass mean RUE was 3.20. In MO, the more northern lowland switchgrass cultivar, Kanlow, showed similar mean RUE (3.70) as Miscanthus. In MO, the northern upland cultivar Cave-in-Rock had a mean RUE (3.17) that was only 85% of that for Miscanthus at MO. Stress (water and nutrients) had a greater effect on Miscanthus RUE than on switchgrass RUE in TX. These results provide realistic RUE values for simulating these important biofuel grasses in diverse environmental conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

AB  - Expanded production of contemporary bioenergy crops (e. g., corn) is considered a threat to the conservation of biodiversity, yet next-generation perennially based crops (switchgrass, mixed-grass-forb prairie) may represent an opportunity for enhancing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We employed a multi-scaled approach to investigate the relative importance of feedstock selection, forb content, patch size, and landscape-scale habitat structure and composition as factors shaping the diversity and abundance of terrestrial arthropod communities and the biomass of functional groups of arthropods associated with the provisioning of ecosystem services. Compared to intensively managed annual corn fields, switchgrass and mixed-grass-forb prairie plantings were associated with a 230% and 324% increase in arthropod family diversity and a 750% and 2,700% increase in arthropod biomass, respectively. Biomass of arthropod pollinators, herbivores, predators, and parasites were similarly the highest in mixed-grass-forb prairie, intermediate in switchgrass plantings, and the lowest in cornfields. Community-wide biomass and that of several functional arthropod groups were positively linked to increasing forest cover and land cover diversity surrounding biomass plantings, while pollinator and detritivore biomass was lower in smaller fields. Results not only suggest that the choice of biomass feedstock will play an important role in shaping within-field arthropod diversity but also indicate an important role for the composition of this surrounding landscape. Collectively, our results suggest that selection of perennially based biomass feedstocks along with careful attention to crop placement have important potential to enhance biodiversity conservation and the provisioning of ecologically and economically important arthropod-mediated ecosystem services in future agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Current assessments of the commercial viability and productivity potential of microalgae biofuels have been forced to extrapolate small-scale research data. The resulting analyses are not representative of microalgae cultivation and processing at industrial scale. To more accurately assess the current near-term realizable, large-scale microalgae productivity potential in the USA, this paper presents a model of microalgae growth derived from industrial-scale outdoor photobioreactor growth data. This model is combined with thermal models of the photobioreactor system and 15 years of hourly historical weather data from 864 locations in the USA to more accurately assess the current productivity potential of microalgae. The resulting lipid productivity potential of Nannochloropsis is presented in the form of a map that incorporates various land availability models to illustrate the near-term feasible cultivation locations and corresponding productivity potentials for the USA. The discussion focuses on a comparison of model results with productivity potentials currently reported in literature, an assessment demonstrating the scale of Department of Energy 2030 alternative fuel goals, and a critical comparison of productivity potential in several key regions of the USA. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Insect damage to prairie cordgrass, Spartina pectinata Link., is conspicuously high in Illinois, where attempts to collect native seed show the majority of spikelets damaged with small holes. Dissection of spikes during summer reveals minute caterpillars boring though glumes and feeding on florets inside. In 2009-2010, panicles of prairie cordgrass from across its native range were used to estimate the percentage of insect-related damage and losses to seed production. Collections of caterpillars from panicles and stems were used to identify one floret-feeding species, estimate its distribution in the central USA, and assess its feeding patterns within spikes. Insect feeding damaged 38% of spikelets across eight states, though injury differed significantly between states. Regression of developed prairie cordgrass seeds onto insect damage suggests a 1:1 loss ratio (i. e., 50% damaged spikelets reduces seed production by 50%). Collections of caterpillars from six midwestern states suggest that larvae of a tortricid moth, Aethes spartinana (Barnes and McDunnough), are responsible for most insect damage to cordgrass spikelets. Larvae of A. spartinana generally feed on a series of consecutive spikelets, with high infestations (>50% insect damage) showing damage concentrated in the middle of spikes. Because larvae are concealed by moving into adjacent spikelets and later tunneling into cordgrass stems, they may be difficult to control using insecticides. While direct effects of the caterpillar on biomass yields for prairie cordgrass are not known, for states like Illinois (where damage to spikelets often exceeds 70%), breeding and seed production efforts may be severely limited without efforts to manage A. spartinana. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Identifying bioenergy crops that can be produced successfully on marginal lands, such as those affected by salinity, reduces the pressure to produce energy crops on land that would otherwise be used to produce food crops. In this paper, the degree of salinity tolerance of "Red River" prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) and "Cave-in-Rock" switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was determined by evaluating seed germination, plant growth, ion uptake, and leaf anatomical feature responses in saline conditions. Red River seeds retained 50% of germination potential under high salinity up to 300 mM NaCl, whereas Cave-in-Rock seed germination was reduced by 80% at 300 mM NaCl. Red River seedlings survived up to 500 mM NaCl, while more than 30% of Cave-in-Rock did not survive above 100 mM NaCl in greenhouse experiments. Red River produced more biomass and second-generation tillers and had a greater root and shoot biomass ratio than Cave-in-Rock under all salinity ranges. Sodium accumulation in shoots of Cave-in-Rock increased with increasing salinity, whereas Red River maintained a low level of sodium in biomass through salt-gland exclusion. The increasing rate of selectivity coefficient for potassium over sodium in Red River was higher than in Cave-in-Rock with increasing salinity. Although seed germination and plant growth decreased as salinity increased, Red River retained its potential of seed germination and to produce new tillers and biomass under salinity stress. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The decomposition of vegetable and microalgal oils was herein analysed as a process of high interest for the production of both hydrogen and carbon, which potentially entails the advantage of attaining a negative CO 2 balance through carbon fixation. The feasibility of a series of oil decarbonization systems was evaluated by means of energy and CO 2 balances, which comprised not only the direct decarbonization process itself but also the cultivation and oil extraction stages. Three potential scenarios were assessed, embracing different options to meet the energy requirements of the systems. For each scenario, a wide range of case studies were evaluated, involving the use of rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, jatropha, Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris oils as raw materials. Favourable energy and CO 2 balances were found for a variety of crops in different scenarios. In particular, jatropha oil from high seed yield crops and rapeseed oil from high seed yield and high oil content crops were identified as the most promising biomass feedstocks for oil decarbonization since they led to net hydrogen production as well as to negative balances of CO 2 emissions, therefore showing a carbon fixation effect. When compared to vegetable/microalgal oil transesterification to produce biodiesel, oil decomposition proved to be a more suitable alternative from a combined energy and environmental approach. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis, a fast-growing halophilic cyanobacterium able to accumulate glycogen, was investigated for its feasibility to serve as feedstock for fermentative production of biofuels and chemicals. The culture conditions most appropriate for glycogen production were identified. Glycogen production was maximized by the depleting nitrate source under a high light intensity of 700μmol photons m -2s -1. With optimal control of both light intensity and nitrate supply, glycogen production of A. platensis reached nearly 1.03gL -1 (a glycogen productivity of 0.29gL -1d -1), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest α-polyglucan (glycogen or starch) production performance ever reported in microalgae. The outcome of this work supports A. platensis as a promising carbohydrate source for biorefinery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The quest for biorenewable energy sources is held to justify a number of government interventions, including support policies for biofuels such as those responsible for the recent rapid growth of US ethanol production. This article provides an analytical assessment of such policies. We construct a general equilibrium, open economy model that captures the rationale typically invoked to justify government intervention in this setting: to alleviate the environmental impact of energy consumption and to decrease US energy dependence on foreign sources. The model is used to study both the positive and normative implications of alternative policy instruments, including the subsidies and mandates specified by the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. From a positive perspective, we find that biofuels mandates are equivalent to a combination of fuel taxes and biofuels subsidies that are revenue neutral. From a welfare perspective, we show that biofuels mandates dominate biofuels subsidies, and that combining fuel taxes with mandates would be welfare enhancing. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper estimates household preferences for ethanol (E85) as a gasoline (E10) substitute. I develop a theoretical model linking the shape of the ethanol demand curve to the underlying distribution among households of willingness to pay for ethanol. I estimate the model using instrumental variables techniques and data from many retail fueling stations. I find that a $0.10-per-gallon increase in ethanol's price relative to gasoline leads to a 12-16% decrease in the quantity of ethanol demanded. My findings imply that preferences for ethanol are heterogeneous and that a substantial fraction of households are willing to pay a premium for the fuel. This reduces substantially the simulated efficiency cost of an ethanol content standard, since some households choose ethanol without large subsidies, mitigating deadweight losses. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has recently drawn the attention of the international research community due to its potential as a biodiesel crop. In addition, it is very well adapted to arid and semiarid climate conditions. In this research, the effects of drought on growth, leaf water relation and organic solutes, leaf and root mineral concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, leaf gas exchange and carbohydrate concentration were studied in seedlings of J. curcas to elucidate the physiological and morphological mechanisms related to their drought tolerance. Four-week-old seedlings were grown in growth chambers with five different water regimes corresponding to 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0% field capacity (FC) for four weeks. Seedlings, maintained a good water status regardless of the drought stress treatment because all water regimes affected the leaf relative water content, whereas the leaf water potential was only reduced in the water-stressed plants from the 0% and 25% FC treatments. Drought treatments reduced leaf, stem and root growth. However, the decrease in growth was higher in the aerial part of the plant than in the root, so that the root-to-shoot ratio in drought-stressed plants increased compared to that in the well-watered plants. Net assimilation of CO 2 (ACO2) and stomatal conductance (g s) decreased in all treatments, although ACO2 gradually declined as the water supply was decreased, while the reduction in stomatal conductance was similar in all drought stress treatments. Hence, we conclude that the strong control of transpirational water loss by reducing both stomatal conductance and biomass from aerial parts could be involved in the ability of this plant to resist drought conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - First-generation biofuels are often challenged over their potentially adverse impact on food prices. Biofuels that use nonfood biomass such as lignocellulose are being promoted to ease the conflict between fuels and food. However, their complex processes mean that the total costs of lignocellulosic ethanol may be high in comparison. This might undermine the economic soundness of plans for its use.Another potential advantage of lignocellulosic ethanol is seen in an enhanced contribution to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the increasing attractiveness of lignocellulosic biofuels may also lead to changes in land use that induce additional carbon emissions. For this reason, the environmental impacts of such plans are not straightforward and depend on the affected category of land.The objective of this paper is to compare the economic perspectives and environmental impact of lignocellulosic ethanol with food-based ethanol taking into account market constraints and policy measures. The analysis of the environmental impact focuses on carbon dioxide emissions.In the medium run, i.e., by 2020, lignocellulosic ethanol could enter the gasoline market, crowding out inter alia food-based ethanol. In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, lignocellulosic ethanol seems to be environmentally desirable in each of the analyzed cases. The findings depend crucially on the market conditions, which are influenced inter alia by crude oil, the exchange rate, and technology conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels have undergone a controversial resurgence in the UK since the turn of the century. The aim of this article is to consider this development in the context of ongoing interactions between the controversy and regulatory and engineering activities. It is found that the discursive space of the controversy has increasingly narrowed around environmental issues, particularly greenhouse gas emissions. The implications for biofuel development are considered in the context of changing regulatory and engineering visions in response to indirect land-use change. Opposition to the third generation biofuels may be softened, but it may be more difficult to justify the cost of holistic regulation of land-use change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon- and energy-rich porous material produced through slow pyrolysis of biomass, which has been proposed as a way of storing carbon in soils for the long-term (centurial to millennial timescales) but its production incurs an energy penalty. Gasification of rice husks at paddy mills combines the benefits of reasonably efficient delivery of energy with a reasonably high carbon char and ash mixture. The ca. 35% carbon content of the rice husk char is possibly a consequence of the protective shield of silica, preventing full exposure of the biomass to oxidation in the gasifier. In this paper we undertake an evaluation of the sustainability of this 'gasification-biochar system' (GBS) in Cambodia, where a rapid deployment of gasifiers is underway. In Part I, we describe the context and analyse (some of) the physical and chemical properties of the biochar. While there are some potential health, safety and environmental issues that require further analysis, they are problems that could be readily addressed in further research and appear to be resolvable. In Part II, we present results from field trials, summarise the data on the carbon abatement of the gasification-biochar system and present some preliminary economic data. © 2011.

AB  - Nitrate (NO 3 -) loss from intensively farmed cropland is a long-standing, recalcitrant environmental problem that contributes to surface and groundwater pollution and coastal zone hypoxia. Here nitrate leaching losses are reported from nine replicated cropped and unmanaged ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. Ecosystems include four annual corn-soybean-winter wheat rotations under conventional, no-till, reduced-input, and organic/biologically-based management, two perennial cropping systems that include alfalfa and hybrid poplar trees, and three unmanaged successional communities including an early successional community analogous to a cellulosic biofuel system as well as a mature deciduous forest. The organic, alfalfa, and unmanaged systems received no synthetic, manure, or compost nitrogen. Measured nitrate concentrations were combined with modeled soil water drainage to provide estimates of nitrate lost by leaching over 11 years. Among annual crops, average nitrate losses differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) and followed the order conventional (62.3±9.5kgNha -1yr -1)&gt;no-till (41.3±3.0)&gt;reduced-input (24.3±0.7)&gt;organic (19.0±0.8) management. Among perennial and unmanaged ecosystems, nitrate loss followed the pattern alfalfa (12.8±1.8kgNha -1yr -1)=deciduous forest (11.0±4.2)&gt;early successional (1.1±0.4)=mid-successional (0.9±0.4)&gt;poplar (&lt;0.01±0.007kgNha -1yr -1) systems. Findings suggest that nitrate loss in annual row crops could be significantly mitigated by the adoption of no-till, cover crops, and greater reliance on biologically based inputs, and in biofuel systems by the production of cellulosic rather than grain-based feedstocks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The raw material supply bottleneck is one of the obstacles currently facing the development of China's biodiesel industry. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the demands, possibilities, difficulties and suggestions surrounding the participation of restaurant enterprises in the biodiesel supply chain. Based on an analysis of the overall situation of China's biodiesel supply chain, the authors designed a structured questionnaire to survey 246 restaurant enterprises in Nanjing. The questionnaire mainly included basic aspects of restaurant enterprises, disposal of waste cooking oil (WCO), awareness and attitudes towards WCO recycling, understanding and opinion of biodiesel, and willingness and requirements for participating in the production of biodiesel. Factor analysis was then conducted on the motives of industrial restaurant enterprises for disposing of or recycling their WCO, and cluster analysis was used to classify the 246 restaurant enterprises into three clusters. Finally, the authors suggested ways to promote the development of Nanjing's biodiesel supply chain. The significant findings obtained in this paper will help to encourage restaurant enterprises to become suppliers of biodiesel production and promote the healthy development of the biodiesel industry in China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel-induced landscape change will have an enormous impact on terrestrial ecosystems in the near future due to globally escalating energy demands, but investigations into the biological properties of soil under potential biofuel crops have not been well documented. The soil microbiota plays a significant role in ecosystem services and especially their regulation of carbon and nutrient cycles. To improve our knowledge about the structure of soil microbial community and the factors that influence it, we analyzed microbial lipids and various soil physicochemical factors under model biofuel cropping systems of corn, switchgrass and mixed prairie in southern Wisconsin, USA. Principal component analysis of lipid biomarkers from soil microbial communities indicated that there were consistent differences among the crop species. Microbial biomass was significantly lower in corn than prairie soils, with switchgrass intermediate to these systems. An increase in fungi to bacteria ratio was coinciding with a net growth in fungal biomass when converting conventionally managed corn system to perennial systems, which indicates the microbial community change could be affected by the creation or expansion of niches for certain functional groups, rather than rebalancing of competitive interactions among these groups. The soil microbial community structure under corn was distinct from the perennial systems with markers indicative of greater in situ stress in annual corn sites and a reduced proportional abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and an increased of gram-positive bacteria. Redundancy analysis (RDA) using 21 lipid biomarkers concurrently with 17 physicochemical indices showed that these properties correlated with different subsets of the microbial communities. We conclude that the cropping system shifted the microbial community composition at this regional scale, which may also affect the microbial processes associated with these differing communities. This may be significant when scaled up from regional to national, continental or global scales. © 2011.

AB  - The need for biodiesel feedstocks growing on non-arable lands is widely recognized. We present results of the synthesis and characterization of new biodiesels we produced from oils of highbush cranberry, dotted horsemint, and American hazelnut growing in Northern Wisconsin. These biodiesels, particularly those derived from highbush cranberry, exhibited remarkably good low-temperature properties, a condition that is crucial for wider usage of any biodiesel in cold climates. We also present the results on determination of the oxidative stability of the above biodiesels and discuss the growing conditions and habitats of the related plants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents the characteristics of four Salix viminalis×. Populus tremula hybrids, produced for the first time in the world grown in a three-year field experiment. Shoot weight per plant and major biomass yield components, including plant height, number of shoots per rootstock and shoot diameter, were determined. The infection severity caused by leaf rust (Melampsora sp.) was also evaluated. The biomass of three-year-old hybrid plants was subjected to chemical analyses and calorimetric tests to determine the energy value of biomass as solid fuel. Among the studied genotypes the highest yield was achieved by one of the studied hybrids. Its biometric parameters did not differ significantly from the standard genotype, and they were superior to the parameters of the maternal form. All Salix×. Populus hybrids were more susceptible to rust infections than their maternal form and one hybrid was more resistant to infections caused by fungi of the genus Melampsora. Two hybrids have optimal biomass parameters as regards both calorific value and amount of carbon, hydrogen, sulfur and nitrogen. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Winter mustard (Brassica juncea L.) is not a common crop in the Southeastern United States. With increased interest in biodiesel production, there has been corresponding interest in mustard in this region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of N fertilization (0, 50, 100, 150kgNha -1) on productivity, oil content, and oil composition of winter mustard 'Pacific Gold' grown at three locations in Mississippi (Stoneville, and two locations at Verona, namely Verona silt loam (Verona-SL) and Verona clay (Verona-C)). Nitrogen did not affect oil content (percent oil). Seed and oil yields (kgha -1) increased with N application relative to the unfertilized control. At the Verona-C location, the concentration of oleic acid was higher in the 50kgNha -1 treatment. At Stoneville, linolenic acid concentration was higher in the 150kgNha -1 and lower in the 100kg/Nha -1 treatment, while it was not different in the other treatments. Overall, the yield of the fatty acids (FA) palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidic, eicosanoic, behenic, erucic, lignoceric, and nervonic acid increased with higher N rates (100 or 150kgN/h). The highest yield of FA in the two Verona locations were achieved in the 100kg Nha -1, while greatest yield of FA at Stoneville was achieved in the highest N rate (150kgNha -1). Means of mustard oil yields in our study in the higher fertility treatment ranged from 737 to 1094kgha -1. This study demonstrated winter mustard production in Mississippi and possibly other areas in the Southeastern United States can be successful and could provide seed and oil yields comparable to yields from other production areas. © 2011.

AB  - With increased emphasis for diesel substitution, production of brown mustard (Brassica juncea), canola (Brassica napus) and camelina (Camelina sativa) used as biodiesels may increase in the High Plains. Since these are new crops to this region, understanding their growth is critical for their acceptance. The objective was to elucidate the growth pattern of these crops when spring-planted in western Nebraska. Field trials were conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 with early May planting. Plots were seeded 2cm deep at 200plantsm -2. Four plants were destructively sampled at about 28, 40, 53, 61, and 82 days after planting (DAP). Canopy growth was field measured. Canopy heights peaked by 61DAP at 95, 85 and 70cm for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Stem length increased to 82DAP at the rates of 1.24, 1.22 and 0.85cm/d for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Root weight accumulated linearly from 28 to 61DAP. The Brassica grew roots faster and achieved higher weights than camelina. From 28 to 40DAP, vine fresh weight accumulated rapidly for these crops, leveled and then gradually declined as leaves desiccated. Vine dry weight increased to 61DAP and then plateaued. The maximum vine dry weights, reached at 61DAP, were 4.3, 4.5 and 3.0g/plant for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. By 61DAP, pods were present and accumulated dry matter while leaves senesced. Pod fresh weight reached its peak at 61DAP while its dry weight increased linearly to 82DAP at rates of 0.36, 0.24 and 0.096g/d for brown mustard, canola and camelina, respectively. Harvest in 2006 showed no significant (p&lt;0.05) difference between crops with a mean yield of about 1500kgha -1. Fatty acid composition was dramatically different between the crops as previously reported. The growth patterns of these crops indicated that all three would be suitable for production in the northern High Plains. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Farming operations in Africa have, in general, not adopted small-scale biodiesel production technology well for on-farm fuel usage. This is mainly due to the lack of an acceptable method to assess the economic feasibility of constructing small-scale biodiesel production facilities, and the impact of such operations on existing farming production processes. The research study summarised in this paper subsequently set out to develop a model, termed the Biodiesel Production System Optimisation Model (BPSOM), which predicts the cost of producing biodiesel on a small-scale, and optimises on-farm production processes to maximise profits. The model was validated using a South African case study to evaluate the predicted cost of biodiesel per litre produced, and the economic impact of a small-scale facility on the production profits of a farm. A proxy indicator, profit per hectare cultivated land, is introduced to measure the impact. BPSOM predicts a positive profit increase of 33% for the specific farm case study, which proves the economic potential of small-scale biodiesel production facilities for fuel usage at farm level in Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recognizing the contributions of ecosystem services and the lack of their comprehensive accounting in life cycle assessment (LCA), an in-depth analysis of their contribution in the life cycle of cellulosic ethanol derived from five different feedstocks was conducted, with gasoline and corn ethanol as reference fuels. The relative use intensity of natural resources encompassing land and ecosystem goods and services by cellulosic ethanol was estimated using the Eco-LCA framework. Despite being resource intensive compared to gasoline, cellulosic ethanol offers the possibility of a reduction in crude oil consumption by as much as 96%. Soil erosion and land area requirements can be sources of concern for cellulosic ethanol derived directly from managed agriculture. The analysis of two broad types of thermodynamic metrics, namely: various types of physical return on investment and a renewability index, which indicate competitiveness and sustainability of cellulosic ethanol, respectively, show that only ethanol from waste resources combines a favorable thermodynamic return on investment with a higher renewability index. However, the production potential of ethanol from waste resources is limited. This finding conveys a possible dilemma of biofuels: Combining high renewability, high thermodynamic return on investment, and large production capacity may remain elusive. A plot of renewability versus energy return on investment is suggested as one of the options for providing guidance on future biofuel selection. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Considerable research and development is underway to produce fuels from microalgae, one of several options being explored for increasing transportation fuel supplies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). This work models life-cycle GHG and on-site freshwater consumption for algal biofuels over a wide technology space, spanning both near- and long-term options. The environmental performance of algal biofuel production can vary considerably and is influenced by engineering, biological, siting, and land-use considerations. We have examined these considerations for open pond systems, to identify variables that have a strong influence on GHG and freshwater consumption. We conclude that algal biofuels can yield GHG reductions relative to fossil and other biobased fuels with the use of appropriate technology options. Further, freshwater consumption for algal biofuels produced using saline pond systems can be comparable to that of petroleum-derived fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biochar technology has been proposed as a geoengineering solution that has potential to actively reduce the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and enhance the sustainability of agriculture. The magnitude of the technologies net benefit must be considered in relation to the associated risks. Hazards posed by biochar technology need to be managed to a level that the resulting risks are deemed acceptable by society; identification of hazards is an essential first step. Effectively implemented risk management and sustainability guidelines, driven by informed policy directives, will result in biochar technology being an important tool for environmental and atmospheric greenhouse gas management. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of biofuel crops is an important criterion to determine the sustainability of biofuel energy production. Remotely sensed image analysis is a proven and effective tool for describing the spatial distribution of crops using vegetation characteristics. Increases in the number of options and availability of satellite sensors have expanded the horizon of choices of imagery sources for appropriate image acquisitions. The Thailand Earth Observation System (THEOS) satellite is one of the newest satellite sensors. The growing number of satellite sensors warrants their comparative evaluation and the standardization of data obtained from various sensors. This study conducted an inter-sensor comparison of the visible/near-infrared surface reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and THEOS. The surface reflectance and the derived NDVI of the sensors were randomly obtained for two biofuel crops, namely, cassava and sugarcane. These crops had low values of visible surface reflectance, which were not significantly (p < 0.05) different. In contrast, the crops had high values of near-infrared surface reflectance that differed significantly (p > 0.05) between the crops. Strong linear relationships between the remote sensing products for the examined sensors were obtained for both cassava and sugarcane. The regression models that were developed can be used to compute the NDVI for THEOS using those determined from Landsat 5 TM and vice versa for the given biofuel crops. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Demand for aviation fuels will continue to rise as growth in number of people flying increases. While the aviation industry accounts for only 2% of global emission, many airlines are exploring, partnering with appropriate players along the value chain to source biojet fuels that will give them green credentials. Several challenges inform the possible expansion of the aviation biofuels industry. These include policy drivers with sufficient incentives, in particular financial support, specific technical requirement and rigorous testing, feedstock production on marginal lands not competing with food crops and effective linkages in the production supply chain. This paper highlights and discusses these issues and describes initiatives in this sector by the two major airlines Lufthansa and Quantas amongst others.

AB  - The effects of Bacillus sp. SLS18, a plant-growth-promoting endophyte, on the biomass production and Mn/Cd uptake of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), Phytolacca acinosa Roxb., and Solanum nigrum L. were investigated. SLS18 displayed multiple heavy metals and antibiotics resistances. The strain also exhibited the capacity of producing indole-3-acetic acid, siderophores, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. In pot experiments, SLS18 could not only infect plants effectively but also significantly increase the biomass of the three tested plants in the presence of Mn/Cd. The promoting effect order of SLS18 on the biomass of the tested plants was sweet sorghum &gt; P. acinosa &gt; S. nigrum L. In the presence of Mn (2,000 mg kg -1) and Cd (50 mg kg -1) in vermiculite, the total Mn/Cd uptakes in the aerial parts of sweet sorghum, P. acinosa, and S. nigrum L. were increased by 65.2%/40.0%, 55.2%/31.1%, and 18.6%/25.6%, respectively, compared to the uninoculated controls. This demonstrates that the symbiont of SLS18 and sweet sorghum has the potential of improving sweet sorghum biomass production and its total metal uptake on heavy metal-polluted marginal land. It offers the potential that heavy metal-polluted marginal land could be utilized in planting sweet sorghum as biofuel feedstock for ethanol production, which not only gives a promising phytoremediation strategy but also eases the competition for limited fertile farmland between energy crops and food crops. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The land competition between tropical bioenergy plantations and payments for forest carbon conservation (e.g., through an international scheme for Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+) is modeled using spatially explicit data on biofuel feedstock (oil palm and sugar cane) suitability and forest biomass carbon stocks. The results show that a price on the (avoided) carbon emissions from deforestation at the same level as those from fossil fuel use makes clearing for high yielding bioenergy crops unprofitable on about 60% of the tropical evergreen forest area. For the remaining 40% deforestation remains the most profitable option. Continued profitability of forest clearing is most pronounced for oil palm bioenergy systems in Latin America and Africa, with REDD+ making deforestation for sugar cane plantations unprofitable on 97% of evergreen forest land. Results are shown to be relatively robust to assumptions regarding potential yields and to the addition of a 'biodiversity premium' on land use change emissions. While REDD+ may play an important role in stemming biodiversity loss and reducing carbon emissions from tropical deforestation in the near future, in the longer run reliance on a system that values forests solely for their carbon retention capacities poses a serious risk. It is imperative that the institutions and policies currently being established as part of REDD+ readiness activities are resilient to future changes in the incentive structures facing tropical forest countries due to, e.g., climate policy induced demand for biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The economic feasibility of utilizing woody biomass to produce biofuel lies in the willingness to harvest by non-industrial private forest (NIPF) landowners, who control 71% of forestland in the southern United States. A mail survey was distributed to NIPF landowners throughout Mississippi to elicit their preferences concerning the utilization of logging residues from harvesting operations to produce bioenergy. When presented with hypothetical situations that compared the bioenergy utilization harvesting attributes along with those of standard clearcutting in pine plantations, more landowners preferred those associated with the bioenergy utilization scenarios, even when more money was offered for the standard clearcutting option. Older landowners with larger landholdings were less likely to prefer the bioenergy scenarios. Landowners with more formal education who were financially motivated, considered habitat management an important goal, and thought global climate change was an important issue, were more likely to prefer the bioenergy utilization scenario over the standard clearcut. This indicates that a market for logging residues, in the form of wood-based bioenergy, could increase NIPF landowner harvest rates based solely on the different harvesting attributes, and that most woody biomass feedstocks from pine plantations would be available for the production of bioenergy in Mississippi. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Balancing ever-increasing agricultural and biofuel needs with biodiversity conservation is one of the greatest challenges facing conservation biologists in the 21st century. The conversion of 75 million hectares of forests in Brazilian Amazonia over four decades for agropastoral uses has resulted in the 'creation' of a similar-sized amount of non-forest 'agricultural matrix' habitats. Despite extensive research on the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on the Amazonian biota, the value of increasingly larger areas of non-forest habitat for forest wildlife remains poorly understood. We conducted 325 fixed-radius point counts of the avifaunal assemblage of non-forest vegetation within a 1200-km 2 region along the Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' in Northern Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our sampling included 2,814 records of 164 species, 15 and 54% of which were recorded in more than 10% and fewer than 2% of all sampling sites, respectively. In particular, nearly 70% of the regional scale avifauna of 560 species failed to use the agricultural matrix, regardless of the persistence of ameliorating structural features, such as isolated trees. At the local scale, higher species richness in the agricultural matrix was best predicted by the presence of relictual trees, and to a lesser extent by standing water and scrubby habitats. The presence of relictual trees, rather than scrub, predicted the occurrence of those forest-dependent species that did use the agricultural matrix. Our results indicate that intensive agricultural production coupled with land sparing would better suit conservation of vulnerable forest species than more extensive 'wildlife friendly' agricultural practices that require more land under production to produce the same yield. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Nitrogen management has been intensively studied on several crops and recently associated with variable rate on-the-go application based on crop sensors. Such studies are scarce for sugarcane and as a biofuel crop the energy input matters, seeking high positive energy balance production and low carbon emission on the whole production system. This article presents the procedure and shows the first results obtained using a nitrogen and biomass sensor (N-Sensor ™ ALS, Yara International ASA) to indicate the nitrogen application demands of commercial sugarcane fields. Eight commercial fields from one sugar mill in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, varying from 15 to 25 ha in size, were monitored. Conditions varied from sandy to heavy soils and the previous harvesting occurred in May and October 2009, including first, second, and third ratoon stages. Each field was scanned with the sensor three times during the season (at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m stem height), followed by tissue sampling for biomass and nitrogen uptake at ten spots inside the area, guided by the different values shown by the sensor. The results showed a high correlation between sensor values and sugarcane biomass and nitrogen uptake, thereby supporting the potential use of this technology to develop algorithms to manage variable rate application of nitrogen for sugarcane. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - From the perspective of the biorefinery, the inherent heterogeneity of mixed-species feedstocks increases the apparent risk associated with their use due to the difficulty in predicting processing characteristics, potential yields and digestibility. These materials often contain species from different botanical classifications, which could affect pretreatment efficiency and Saccharification yields. For this study, we evaluated the impact of ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX™ 1) pretreatment conditions on hydrolysis sugar yields for five early successional old-field treatment replicates, each comprised of a different mixture of annual forb and grass species. Yields from these samples were also compared to a late successional old field sample and to corn stover that had been pretreated at the same conditions. Relatively high sugar yields were obtained for four of the five early successional feedstocks when pretreated at the same conditions: 2.0g NH 3:g DM; 0.5g H 2O:g DM; 100°C; 30min. It was found that glucan digestibility was strongly inversely correlated to the total lignin content; however this was not true of the xylan digestibility. The mixed-species feedstocks that had a higher grass content tended to also have a higher structural sugar content and were more digestible than forb-dominated feedstocks, thereby resulting in higher saccharification yields. Also, the grass-dominated mixed-species feedstocks were as digestible as corn stover (∼80% total sugar yields). However, due to its higher structural sugar content, corn stover had higher total glucose and xylose yields (580g/kg biomass) compared to the mixed-species feedstocks, which ranged from 290 to 470g/kg biomass. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The economic availability of biomass resources is a critical component in evaluating the commercial viability of biofuels. To evaluate projected farmgate prices and grower payments needed to procure 295 million dry Mg (325 million dry tons) of biomass in the U.S. by 2022, this research employs POLYSYS, an economic model of the U.S. agriculture sector. A price-run simulation suggests that a farmgate price of $58.42Mg -1 ($53.00dryton -1) is needed to procure this supply, while a demand-run simulation suggests that prices of $34.56 and $71.61Mg -1 ($30.00 and $62.00dryton -1) in are needed in 2012 and 2022, respectively, to procure the same supply, under baseline yield assumptions. Grower payments are reported as farmgate price minus resource-specific harvest costs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Food prices have increased rapidly in recent years, and so has ethanol production. Some studies have claimed that there is a connection between the two. The main purpose of this paper is to add to this literature by examining the influence that the interplay between Brazil and the U.S. in ethanol production has on food prices. Specifically, and controlling for other variables, which have been shown to affect food prices, we investigate whether sugarcane ethanol and corn ethanol production have similar impacts on food prices, and whether ethanol productivity affects food prices. We find a positive significant effect of Brazilian market share in world ethanol market on relative food prices. We also find that an increase of Brazilian cane ethanol area has a negative effect on relative food prices. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha, a non-edible oil seed yielding plant has been identified by the Government of India to produce biodiesel under National Biodiesel Mission. Failure of phase-I of National Biodiesel Mission and likely failure of phase-II requires critical analysis of policy frameworks related to its long term sustainability. Indian biofuel promotion policies like Biodiesel Purchase Policy and National Biofuel Policy have failed to yield any visible results. No tangible ground work is visible as of now to ensure success of various government plans and policies related to adoption of jatropha biodiesel. It is clearly evident that some serious bottlenecks are delaying the adoption of jatropha biodiesel. Present work identifies important policy bottlenecks like availability of land, non-remunerative pricing policy and state fear relating to loss of revenue in the case of zero duty regimes. This paper attempts to explore and critically analyze present policies and possible options taking into account the recent Indian experiences for successful adoption of jatropha biodiesel. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing energy use and the need to mitigate climate change make production of liquid biofuels a high priority. Farmers respond worldwide to this increasing demand by converting forests and grassland into biofuel crops, but whether biofuels offer carbon savings depends on the carbon emissions that occur when land use is changed to biofuel crops. This paper reports the results of a study on cassava-based bioethanol production undertaken in the Sikasso region in Southern Mali. The paper outlines the estimated impacts on above-ground carbon stocks when land use is changed to increase cassava production. The results show that expansion of cassava production for bioethanol will most likely lead to the conversion of fallow areas to cassava. A land use change from fallow to cassava creates a reduction in the above-ground carbon stocks in the order of 4-13MgCha -1, depending on (a) the age of the fallow, (b) the allometric equation used and (c) whether all trees are removed or the larger, useful trees are preserved. This 'carbon debt' associated with the above-ground biomass loss would take 8-25 years to repay if fossil fuels are replaced with cassava-based bioethanol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One solution to the supply chain challenges of cellulosic biofuels is a network of local biomass processing depots (LBPDs) that can produce stable, dense, intermediate commodities and valuable co-products prior to shipping to a refinery. A techno-economic model of an LBPD facility that could incorporate multiple technologies and products was developed in Microsoft Excel to be used to economically and environmentally evaluate potential LBPD systems. In this study, three technologies (ammonia fiber expansion or AFEX™ pretreatment, fast pyrolysis, and leaf protein processing) were assessed for profitability. Pyrolysis was slightly profitable under the base conditions, leaf protein processing was highly unprofitable, and AFEX was profitable if biomass drying was not required. This model can be adapted to multiple feedstocks and end uses, including both economic and environmental modeling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignin content, composition, distribution as well as cell wall thickness, structures, and type of tissue have a measurable effect on enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in lignocellulosic feedstocks. The first part of our work combined compositional analysis, pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis for fractionated pith, rind, and leaf tissues from a hybrid stay-green corn, in order to identify the role of structural characteristics on enzyme hydrolysis of cell walls. The extent of enzyme hydrolysis follows the sequence rind&lt;leaves&lt;pith with 90% conversion of cellulose to glucose in 24h in the best cases. Physical fractionation of corn stalks or other C 4 grasses into soft and hard tissue types could reduce cost of cellulose conversion by enabling reduced enzyme loadings to hydrolyze soft tissue, and directing the hard tissue to other uses such as thermal processing, combustion, or recycle to the land from which the corn was harvested. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study investigates the scaling of photobioreactor productivity based on the growth of Nannochloropsis salina incorporating the effects of direct and diffuse light. The scaling and optimization of photobioreactor geometry was analyzed by determining the growth response of a small-scale system designed to represent a core sample of a large-scale photobioreactor. The small-scale test apparatus was operated at a variety of light intensities on a batch time scale to generate a photosynthetic irradiance (PI) growth dataset, ultimately used to inform a PI growth model. The validation of the scalability of the PI growth model to predict productivity in large-scale systems was done by comparison with experimental growth data collected from two geometrically different large-scale photobioreactors operated at a variety of light intensities. For direct comparison, the small-scale and large-scale experimental systems presented were operated similarly and in such a way to incorporate cultivation relevant time scales, light intensities, mixing, and nutrient loads. Validation of the scalability of the PI growth model enables the critical evaluation of different photobioreactor geometries and design optimization incorporating growth effects from diffuse and direct light. Discussion focuses on the application of the PI growth model to assess the effect of diffuse light growth compared to direct light growth for the evaluation of photobioreactors followed by the use of the model for photobioreactor geometry optimization on the metric of areal productivity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The potential impact of policies promoting transport biofuels on the use of land due to the indirect effects of feedstock cultivation has generated a controversy in the EU. Policy-makers are urged to regulate the matter without conclusive scientific evidence concerning the scale and severity of indirect land-use change (iLUC). By looking at this situation as an instance of policy making in the context of scientific uncertainty, this study analyses ways to deal with iLUC of biofuels policies learning from policy fields where similar dilemmas were confronted in the past. The experience with technologies such as genetically modified organisms, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and radioactive waste, and transport biofuels is instructive for this purpose. Policy approaches identified in the case studies are applied to the case of iLUC. The results show that a preventive approach, which appears as the most practical choice in terms of effectiveness and stakeholders' acceptability, however, also involves a risk of treating scientific uncertainty as certainty (the uncertainty paradox). Policy-makers, scientists and stakeholders all have responsibility to avoid this paradox, in order to limit future controversy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha macrocarpa grows naturally in arid environments of the Dry Chaco, northwestern Argentina, where freezing winters make impossible the cultivation of other species of the genus Jatropha. This article is the first report of J. macrocarpa seed productivity aimed to quantify the reproductive performance and seed oil characteristics at different stages of fruit ripening. In addition, J. macrocarpa is evaluated as a new oil crop for biodiesel. Fruits from natural populations near La Rioja city were hand-harvested during the 2007/8 reproductive season and classified according to 7 fruit sizes, from the smallest fruits (G1) to the largest (G7 or mature). Total seed production averaged 87 ± 8 g plant-1 throughout the growing season. Explosive dehiscence of mature fruits produced 46% of total seed loss. Mature fruits produced individual seeds of 550 ± 7 mg with a medium-to-high seed oil concentration ranging from 36 to 40%, and biomass allocation to seeds was 36% of total fruit biomass. Fruits harvested early, at the G6 stage, were lighter and had a significantly less oil concentration. Main fatty acids in mature seeds included linoleic (50%), oleic (32%), palmitic (8.5%) and stearic (7%) acids. Biodiesel quality parameters indicated only slight differences for cetane number and iodine value with respect to European normative requirements. The acceptable oil content of J. macrocarpa shows promise to be used for biodiesel production. However, the low productivity per plant and the explosive fruit dehiscence need to be corrected substantially by breeding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Classic strain development that combines random mutagenesis and selection has a long history of success in generation of biocatalysts with industrially designed traits. However, the genetic loci contributing to the phenotypic strain changes are difficult to identify prior to genome sequencing technology advancement. In this chapter, we present the approach using Roche 454 next-generation pyro-resequencing to identify the genotypic changes such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with an ethanol-tolerant strain of Clostridium thermocellum. The parameters used to filter the pyro-resequencing output for SNP identification are also discussed. These can help researchers to identify the genotypic change of other biocatalysts for strain improvement through metabolic engineering. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - We estimated rate constants for the hydrogen abstraction from carbon-3 of 1-butanol by hydroperoxyl radical, a critically important reaction in the combustion of biofuel. We employed the recently developed multi-structural variational transition-state theory (MS-VTST), which utilizes a multifaceted dividing surface that allows us to include the contributions of multiple structures for reacting species and transition states. First, multiconfigurational Shepard interpolation-based on molecular-mechanics-guided interpolation of electronic-structure Hessian data obtained by the M08 HX/jun-cc-pVTZ electronic model chemistry-was used to obtain the portion of the potential energy surface needed for single-structure variational transition-state theory rate constants including multidimensional tunneling; then, the M08-HX/MG3S electronic model chemistry was used to calculate multi-structural torsional anharmonicity factors to complete the MS-VTST rate constant calculations. The lowest-energy structures of the transition state have strongly bent hydrogen bonds. Our results indicate that neglect of multi-structural anharmonicity would lead to errors of factors of 0.3, 46, and 171 at 200, 1000, and 2400 K for this reaction. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, Raman spectroscopy and a machine learning technique known as support vector regression (SVR) are used for building an online sensor to monitor the heterotrophic algal culture conditions in a computer-interfaced bench-scale microalgal bioreactor system, for the production of bio-oil. Monitoring of process conditions in algal cultures is required to enable the use of different control strategies to maximize oil productivity. In order to correlate the Raman spectra with culture conditions, three independent experimental datasets are used. The effect of several preprocessing techniques, including Savitzky-Golay filtering, baseline correction, and standard normal variate transformation, on the goodness of fit is evaluated. A multivariate sensor for real time online monitoring of the concentrations of biomass, glucose and percentage oil content is successfully built and validated. The advantages of using the proposed real-time on-line sensor are illustrated in an experimental microalgal bioreactor system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in the United States mandates significant growth in the biofuels industry with 36 billion gallons by 2022. Volumes are mandated for each year from 2009 to 2022. In this study, the author simulated the industry required to meet the 2018 mandate, with special attention to the geographic layout. The methodology built a series of scenarios by varying market and technology parameters that influence the design of the biofuel industry. The industry was then modeled with an integrated supply chain model that was spatially explicit. This model described the optimal behavior of a biofuel industry given the constraints of fuel demand, biofuel selling price, and feedstock supply. All the analyzed scenarios achieved the 2018 RFS2 mandate at wholesale fuel prices between $2.65 and $3.78/gal of gasoline-equivalent biofuels. Between $57.7 billion and $140.7 billion in capital investment was required to bring the fuels to market. The results were most sensitive to the level of technological optimism and the access to waste and residue biomass resources.

AB  - The objective of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the European Union's (EU's) fossil energy dependence are two factors that require political and industrial decision makers to set priorities for energy and environmental strategies. Despite the achieved efficiency in modern vehicles, increasing patterns of private car usage, together with a high dependence on oil, place transportation as the most resilient sector in this period of environmental and energy consciousness. The aim of this research was to disaggregate the existing European transportation energy data and use them to build a model of the current situation. With the model, several scenarios evaluated the well-to-wheel energy and carbon dioxide (CO2</ sub>) impacts that resulted from improvements in energy efficiency, uptake of biofuels, and electric mobility, as well as a modal shift into collective modes. Analysis of the European study of the Joint Research Centre Biofuel Programme and each member state's national strategy [National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs)], published in 2010, allowed characterization of the transportation energy situation by 2020 (consumption, efficiency, and new energy). The analysis of mobility surveys from major member states permitted characterization of urban areas within the passenger mobility sector, and the results were integrated into the developed model. The expected improvements in energy efficiency through the Biofuel Programme and the planned increase in biofuel blends and electrified vehicles through the NREAPs combined with an increase in passenger mobility by 2020 resulted in the following 2020 predictions: a 16% reduction in tank-to-wheel and a 12% reduction in well-to-wheel CO2 emissions in the EU's passenger mobility sector compared with 2007 levels.

AB  - Microalgae have emerged as an attractive feedstock for the mass production of renewable transportation fuels due to their fast growth rate, flexible habitat preferences, and substantial oil yields. As an educational tool, a laboratory was developed that mimics emerging algal biofuel technology, including the extraction of algal lipids and transesterification into biodiesel. First, students were introduced to algae as an energy feedstock and taught how to cultivate and harvest algal biomass. Next, students learned how to convert algal biomass to a transportation fuel using transesterification and extraction, including an experimental comparison of base- and acid-catalyzed transesterification methods. The energy content of homemade algae biodiesel was determined and compared to soybean biodiesel and petroleum diesel using a homemade calorimeter. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Several states and countries have adopted targets for deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but there has been little physically realistic modeling of the energy and economic transformations required. We analyzed the infrastructure and technology path required to meet California's goal of an 80% reduction below 1990 levels, using detailed modeling of infrastructure stocks, resource constraints, and electricity system operability. We found that technically feasible levels of energy efficiency and decarbonized energy supply alone are not sufficient; widespread electrification of transportation and other sectors is required. Decarbonized electricity would become the dominant form of energy supply, posing challenges and opportunities for economic growth and climate policy. This transformation demands technologies that are not yet commercialized, as well as coordination of investment, technology development, and infrastructure deployment.

AB  - The optimal use of forest energy wood, industrial wood residues, waste wood, agricultural residues, animal manure, biowaste, and sewage sludge in 2010 and 2030 was assessed for Europe. An energy system model was developed comprising 13 principal fossil technologies for the production of heat, electricity, and transport and 173 bioenergy conversion routes. The net environmental benefits of substituting fossil energy with bioenergy were calculated for all approximately 1500 combinations based on life cycle assessment (LCA) results. An optimization model determines the best use of biomass for different environmental indicators within the quantified EU-27 context of biomass availability and fossil energy utilization. Key factors determining the optimal use of biomass are the conversion efficiencies of bioenergy technologies and the kind and quantity of fossil energy technologies that can be substituted. Provided that heat can be used efficiently, optimizations for different environmental indicators almost always indicate that woody biomass is best used for combined heat and power generation, if coal, oil, or fuel oil based technologies can be substituted. The benefits of its conversion to SNG or ethanol are significantly lower. For non-woody biomass electricity generation, transportation, and heating yield almost comparable benefits as long as high conversion efficiencies and optimal substitutions are assured. The shares of fossil heat, electricity, and transportation that could be replaced with bioenergy are also provided. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The growing global demand for energy needs the Countries to find optimal sources of renewable energy. These include biofuels for transport, whose sustainability has attracted quite a few threads from the beginning. The front of the pessimists became stronger at the outbreak of World Food Crisis 2007/2008, but, as technologies for biofuels productions are still in development, we are not able to forecast these products' future either. European policy for renewable energy, therefore, applies a precautionary principle and establishes a mandatory sustainability- check of all renewable energy sources, offering new challenges to agricultural economists. This paper takes up the most important aspects related to the production of biofuels for economic research in agriculture. We present a literature review from the most important journal of our scientific sector considering the last decade in order to provide a broad view of the problem and inspiration for the research in the next future. Articles collected have been categorized by year, type, research area and contents, in order to provide a descriptive and multivariate analysis (by the mean of simple correspondence analysis) of the economic scientific efforts addressed to study and optimize biofuels management. Results show a growing attention to the issue; but in the different areas of the world, economists seem to prefer to focus their attention to local than global topics, which should be deeper investigated.

The objective of this article is to indicate perspectives for the sustainable production of energy crops in Poland through the production of total biomass as the main renewable source of energy utilized in the countries of Europe and supported by Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 23, 2009 on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources, currently in force. The most important reasons for promoting the production of plant biomass for energy purposes is the desire to work against climate change and reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. This article indicates the significant role of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in biofuels and their production. Note is also taken of agro– climatic and soil conditions for the production of biomass in Poland as well as the economic aspects using the Agricultural Production Space Valuation Ratio (APSVR). © 2012, Versita.

AB  - Biofuels have the potential of playing an important role in the renewable energy sources panorama, ensuring the achievement of multiple goals such as security of supply, reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, creation of green jobs, and development of business opportunities in the agricultural and rural sectors. Subsidies to the sector were justified on this basis, but analysis is required to determine real impacts. However, other potential impacts could offset any benefits biofuels may bring, and careful assessment and analysis of biofuels' impacts are necessary. These possible consequences involve food prices and food security, economic distortions of subsidies, and environmental impacts. Among the methodologies used to evaluate biofuels impacts, general equilibrium models (CGE) can be considered as the most comprehensive tool available to analyze governmental intervention at the aggregate level. The use of these tools is primarily to generate projections of future performance of the market (in terms of production, consumption, prices, international trade) on the basis of alternative scenarios. The present paper applies a general equilibrium model, an extended version of the GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) model developed by Hertel, Tyner and Birur in 2010, in which an alternative closure has been adopted in order to analyze the combined impacts of the US and EU biofuels programs considering inparticular the socio-economic effects on prices, employment and welfare in the European Union in 2015.

AB  - Canada has a huge stock of biomass resources, which provides a basis (and a temptation) for development of a major bio-fuels industry. Both federal and provincial governments have engaged in a wide array of subsidies, mandates, and other measures to stimulate production and consumption of biofuels. As a result, biofuels has become a growth industry in Canada with production of ethanol almost 10 times higher than it was ten years earlier. However, this has come at considerable cost to taxpayers. Increased biofuel production has resulted in minimal reduction in greenhouse gases, short run (but not long run) increases in net farm income (that benefited grain and oilseed producers but hurt livestock producers), large increases in the prices of farm land due to the higher grain and oilseed prices, and minimal impacts on rural economic diversification. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the economics of biofuels. It starts by describing the remarkable growth of the biofuel industry over the last decade, with emphasis on developments in the United States, Brazil and the European Union, and it identifies the driving role played by some critical policies. After a brief discussion of the motivations that are commonly argued in favor of biofuels and biofuel policies, the paper presents an assessment of the impacts of biofuels from the economics perspective. In particular, the paper explains the basic analytics of biofuel mandates, reviews several existing studies that have estimated the economic impacts of biofuels, presents some insights from a specific model, and outlines an appraisal of biofuel policies and the environmental impacts of biofuels. The paper concludes with an examination of several open issues and the future prospects of biofuels. © Firenze University Press.

AB  - Intensive forestry presents opportunities for intercropping herbaceous biomass species between crop tree rows for producing cellulosic feedstocks. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and other native prairie grasses are being evaluated as potential biofuel crops. It is unclear how intercropping within intensively managed forests will affect biodiversity compared with similar forests under traditional timber management. However, research with grasses in row crop agriculture suggests some basic principles. Effects will likely vary with habitat needs of individual species and communities. Additionally, intercropping regimes favoring mixed native warm-season grasses over switchgrass only, spring harvests over fall, and rotational harvests producing mosaics of grass heights would likely benefit biodiversity. A critical knowledge gap is how potential edge effects of growing crop trees may influence habitat quality of intercropped stands. Although biomass intercropping may increase diversity by adding predominantly grass components to intensively managed forest landscapes, predictions about biodiversity response are not possible until more research is done. © 2012 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Agroforestry options are explored for restoring important functions and values of bottomland hardwood (BLH) forests in the lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV). Agroforestry practices can augment the size and quality of BLH habitat, provide corridors between BLH areas, and enable restoration of natural hydrologic patterns and water quality. Agroforestry practices are designed primarily to benefit agriculture, which may appeal to farmers in the region. Profit potential from some agroforestry practices is currently competitive with agricultural crops and production forestry on marginal agricultural lands in the LMAV. Lack of experience with agroforestry in this region hinders adoption, but emerging markets for biofuels and ecosystem services could enhance future prospects. Concepts are presented for how agroforestry can be located and designed for restoring BLH forest functions and values in the LMAV and thereby contribute to achieving goals for ecological restoration. © 2012 by the Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Crop rotation is one of the important decisions made independently by numerous farm managers, and is a critical variable in models of crop growth and soil carbon. In Iowa and much of the Midwestern United States (US), the typical management decision is to rotate corn and soybean crops for a single field; therefore, the land-cover changes each year even though the total area of agricultural land-use remains the same. The price for corn increased from 2001 to 2010, which increased corn production in Iowa. We tested the hypothesis that the production increase was the result of changes in crop rotation in Iowa using the annual remote sensing classification (the cropland data layer) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service. It was found that the area planted in corn increased from 4.7 million hectares in 2001 to 5.7 million hectares in 2007, which was correlated with the market price for corn. At the county level, there were differences in how the increase in corn production was accomplished. Northern and central counties had little land to expand cultivation and generally increased corn production by converting to a corn-corn rotation from the standard corn-soybean rotation. Southern counties in Iowa increased corn production by expanding into land that was not under recent cultivation. These changes affect the amount of soil carbon sequestration. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - Plant-based transportation fuels were the focus of extended criticism in the press, especially during 2008 when a portion of the blame for a spike in global food prices was associated with growth of the United States’ corn ethanol industry. The critique is based on an unsophisticated portrayal of the ethical issues at stake in the food security implications of biofuel. Three ethical critiques can be leveled at the food vs. fuel debate. First, although market drivers of biofuels indeed skew consumption of agricultural grains, this is not a problem that is unique to biofuels. Second, the critique does not reflect an adequate understanding of the way that rising food prices and changes in agricultural technology affect the food security of the poorest people. Third, although rising food prices could be beneficial to poor farm producers among the world’s poor, it is unlikely that benefits will materialize in the absence of concerted programs to deliberately select biofuel development strategies that are targeted to strengthen food security for poor and small-holding producers. An adequate agricultural ethics for biofuels will require commitment by both private and public sector biofuel developers to ensure that potentially positive attributes of biofuel development are realized. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - The paper summarizes key findings of alternative lines of research on the relationship between food and fuel markets, and identifies gaps between two bodies of literature: One that investigates the relationship between food and fuel prices, and another that investigates the impact of the introduction of biofuels on commodity-food prices. The former body of literature suggests that biofuel prices do not affect food-commodity prices, but the latter suggests it does. We try to explain this gap, and then show that although biofuel was an important contributor to the recent food-price inflation of 2001–2008, its effect on food-commodity prices declined after the recession of 2008/09. We also show that the introduction of cross-price elasticity is important when explaining soybean price, but less so when explaining corn prices. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - The study was conducted at three locations in the Savinjska region of Slovenia, where soil is contaminated with heavy metals due to the zinc industry (Cinkarna Celje). In Ponikva the soil to a depth of 30 cm contains 0.8 mg kg(-1) Cd, 32.2 mg kg(-1) Pb, and 86 mg Zn kg(-1), in Medlog 1.4 mg kg(-1) Cd, 37.4 mg kg(-1) Pb, and 115 mg kg(-1) Zn and in Skofja vas 10.9 mg kg(-1) Cd, 239.7 mg kg(-1) Pb, and 1356 mg kg(-1) Zn. The pH at the selected sites was between 7.3 and 7.6. In the beginning of September 2006 two hybrids of Brassica napus L. var. napus, PR45 D01 and PR46 W31 suitable for production of biodiesel obtained from Pioneer Seeds Holding GmbH, were sown. After 96 days juvenile and after 277 days mature plants were collected. Parts of plants (root, shoot and seed) were separated and Cd, Pb, Zn, Mo, and S determined by ultra-trace ICP-MS. We compared the uptake of Cd, Pb, Zn, Mo and S in different parts of juvenile and mature plants of the two different hybrids, TF (translocation factor), BAF (bioaccumulation factor), and PP (phytoextraction potential) were calculated. The mature hybrid PR46 W31 had higher shoot/root ratio and higher PP for metals (Cd, Pb, and Zn) and lower PP for the micronutrient (Mo) and macronutrient (S) on the polluted site. The study demonstrated the potential use of oilseed rape on multiply polluted soils for production of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels. The potential restoration of degraded land could also disburden the use of agricultural land.

AB  - Wood, agricultural crops, agricultural residues, herbaceous grasses, algae, sea plants, municipal solid waste, sewage, and animal waste are all forms of biomass that are being used in order to satisfy the energy demand of modern society. Biomass is still the principal fuel used for cooking and domestic heating in most agrarian societies and many developing nations, while in the industrialized nations it is primarily used for the production of other fuels, the biofuels, or it is burned for the production of electricity. The production of agricultural crops necessitates large areas of arable land and significant amounts of fresh water for irrigation, two scarce resources on Earth. The consumption of these crops to satisfy the energy demand of the population is fast becoming a controversial socioeconomic issue because of the direct competition of energy production with food production and food availability to the poorer segments of the society and poorer nations on the planet. This "to eat or to burn" dilemma in conjunction with the increasing population of Earth, is expected to introduce limitations on the use of agricultural crops and to increase the use of waste products for energy production. This chapter describes the types of biomass that are available as well as their energy content. It presents several useful calculations and facts on the conversion of biomass to transportation fuels and computes, as a special case, the energy balance related to the conversion of corn to ethanol. It appears that in the conversion of corn to ethanol, more energy goes into the materials and processes needed than the energy content of the produced ethanol. The chapter also investigates the environmental effects, social, economic and regulatory issues that will play an important role to the increased utilization of the various types of biomass as energy sources. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - This work is part of a megaproject that seeks to isolate microalgae of the Chlorophyta division native to Norte de Santander and identify their potential applications such as lipid production to be used as biofuel. Here we present the isolation of 11 microalgae strains from the Chlorophyta division found in two different wastewater environments. The collected strains were cultivated in selective media and purified through serial dilutions, depletion culture, and application of penicillin and gentamicin. Biomass production was evaluated and two strains were selected: CHL1 (Chlorella sp.) and DES1 (Desmodesmus sp.). The strains were cultivated on wastewater and PCG media (control), and their biomass concentration and lipid content were measured. Both strains reached similar biomass concentrations compared to their respective controls (CHL1 PCG 1.5 mg/L ± 0.035 mg/L, CHL1 AR 1.68 mg/L ± 0.036, DES1 PCG 1.66 mg/L ± 0.007, DES1 AR 2 mg/L ± 0.03) and their lipid content was slightly higher compared to their controls. The results show that the isolated and evaluated strains may have potential to be lipid producers, since their environmental and nutritional conditions have not been modified yet and adaptation may improve the production yield of lipids.

AB  - The production of sustainable bioenergy is a challenging task in the promotion of biofuels for replacing the fossil based fuels to get cleaner environment and also to reduce the dependency on other countries and uncertainty of fuel price. One biofuels might be very attractive for heat production and not so attractive for electricity and transport purposes. The commercial-scale production of biofuels requires careful consideration of several issues that can be broadly categorized as: selecting biomass, cultivation technology, growth inputs (nutrients, water, etc.) and biofuel conversion technology. The life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool that can be used effectively in assessing various biofuels for their sustainability and can help to policy makers to choose the best biofuels for specific purpose. Allocation method is very important in assessing the sustainability of biofuels as different allocation methods responded differently. The present chapter is an effort to highlight the key issues to consider in conducting an LCA for biofuels. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.

AB  - Management of switchgrass for bioenergy and forage share some commonalities, of particular interest in bioenergy crop production is: (1) rapid establishment of switchgrass to generate harvestable biomass in the seeding year, (2) highly efficient management of soil and fertilizer N to minimize external energy inputs, and (3) harvest management to maximize yields of lignocellulose. Bioenergy cropping may entail management for multiple services in addition to biomass yield including soil C sequestration, wildlife habitat, landscape management, and water quality protection. Management is a critical factor especially as land classified as marginal or idle land will be emphasized for bioenergy production to reduce conflicts with food production. Marginal land may also be more risky. To date, there has been no long-term commercial production of switchgrass on a large scale and there is little in the way of hands-on, practical farm experience with switchgrass managed as a bioenergy crop. In this chapter, we lay out the key best management practices for switchgrass as a bioenergy crop including establishment, soil fertility, and pest management.

AB  - Biomass, as the main contributor to renewable energy in the world (about 13% of total energy consumption), is a versatile energy source-it can be stored and converted in practically any form of energy carrier and also into biochemicals and biomaterials from which, once they have been used, the energy content can be recovered to generate electricity, heat, or transport fuels. It covers a broad range of products, including traditional use of wood for cooking and heating, industrial process heat, co-firing of biomass in coal-based power plants, biogas and biofuels. Moreover, the possibility to use residues and waste as a biomass feedstock enables the production of huge quantities of energy and environmental benefits all over the world, without any fertile land use or any competition with food or feed. Since residues and wastes are part of the short carbon cycle, their use for energy purposes has a minimal extra GHG emission. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.

AB  - In this chapter, we review major environmental impacts of growing switchgrass as a bioenergy crop, including effects on carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, nutrient leaching, and runoff. Information from life cycle analyses, including the effects of indirect land use change (iLUC), is examined to quantify the full impact of migration to bioenergy cropping systems on both managed and natural ecosystems. Information on the environmental impacts of switchgrass cultivation is scarce and there exists a critical need for additional research. What limited information there is suggests that switchgrass provides multiple environmental benefits compared to annual crop cultivation. However, benefits generally appear to be similar to other perennial crops.

AB  - Biomass with high lipids are necessary to the biodiesel industry since the demand for this biofuel is increasing in Brazil and the main oilseed crop used for producing biodiesel in Brazil will not be able to aid the production of biodiesel without arable lands destined only for that purpose. Thus, the microalgae emerge as a potential biomass and they are being used as a source of products for biofuel production because of their high productivity and rapid growth. However, the high cost of microalgal biomass production is the main factor that prevents the use of its products on a large scale. Thus, this work is aimed at using microalgal biomass already present in effluents from aerobic and anaerobic lagoon ponds used for processing the effluent of the UASB reactor; to obtain products and it is proposed to use these as a biofuel. Initially, a qualitative and quantitative characterization of the microalgae species present in the aerobic anaerobic lagoon was performed. The biomass was recovered from the effluent using a vacuum filtration system and sun-dried. For the extraction of total lipids a mixture of polar and apolar solvents was used. The extract was analyzed using FTIR and GC/MS. The results showed that, in quantitative terms, the taxa Cyanobacteria and Euglenophyceae were predominant. In relation to the species found, the species with the largest number of individuals per milliliter were Lepocinclis salina Frits., Plankthotrix isothrix Bory and Euglena sp. The extract obtained presented values of 16 wt%. The infrared spectrum showed the presence of ester and alkanes just like the GC/MS analysis. The microalgae identified are producers, predominantly, of lipids with saturated fatty acids and hydrocarbon. The high presence of microalgae in a natural watercourse can bring environmental problems. Thus the obtainment of microalgal biomass aerobic and anaerobic from a lagoon pond might provide an economic and environmental gain. © 2011 WIT Press.

AB  - The role of biomass as a primary energy resource is highly debated. Next generation biofuels are suggested to be associated with low specific greenhouse gas emissions. But land consumption, demand for scarce water, competition with food production and harmful indirect land-use effects put a question mark over the beneficial effects of bioenergy deployment. In this paper, we investigate the current state of bioenergy assessments and scrutinize the topics and perspectives explored in the SpecialReport on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change. We suggest that an appropriate assessment requires a comprehensive literature review, the explicit exposition of disparate viewpoints, and exploration of policy-relevant content based on plausible 'storylines'. We illustrate these storylines with the IPCC's emission scenarios and point out routes to improve assessment making on the future role of bioenergy. © 2012 by the IAEE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Recently, several papers have assessed land use consequences of biofuel expansion. In the absence of empirical evidence, these papers assigned subjective values to extensive margin (productivity of new croplands over productivity of existing croplands). Methods: This paper fills the gap in this area and provides a new data set which estimates land productivity at 0.5° × 0.5° (longitude × latitude) grid-cell level using a process-based biogeochemistry model, the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM) calibrated for a C4 crop. Results: The results obtained from the TEM can be used in connection with economic models which are designed to assess land use changes induced by economic factors. To show a real application, a set of regional extensive margins are calculated based on the new data set. The calculated regional extensive margins are then introduced in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic model which has been frequently used to assess the land use implications of ethanol production. Finally, land use changes due to US ethanol production are examined using the augmented CGE model with the new extensive margins. Conclusions: The approach developed here provides estimates of extensive margins disaggregated by the country and agroecological zone, replacing the earlier assumption of a globally uniform value. Using these new parameter values, the estimation of land required for ethanol production is 25% lower than earlier published results. © 2012 Taheripour et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Biofuels are anticipated to enable a shift from fossil fuels for renewable transportation and manufacturing fuels, with biohydrogen considered attractive since it could offer the largest reduction of global carbon budgets. Currently, lignocellulosic biohydrogen production remains inefficient with pretreatments that are heavily fossil fuel-dependent. However, bacteria using alkali-treated biomass could streamline biofuel production while reducing costs and fossil fuel needs. An alkaliphilic bacterium, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, is described that is capable of biohydrogen production at levels rivaling neutrophilic strains, but at pH 11 and hypersaline conditions. H. hydrogeniformans ferments a variety of 5-and 6-carbon sugars derived from hemicellulose and cellulose including cellobiose, and forms the end products hydrogen, acetate, and formate. Further, it can also produce biohydrogen from switchgrass and straw pretreated at temperatures far lower than any previously reported and in solutions compatible with growth. Hence, this bacterium can potentially increase the efficiency and efficacy of biohydrogen production from renewable biomass resources. © 2012 Begemann, Mormile, Sitton, Wall and Elias.

AB  - Oleaginous plants such as Jatropha Curcas Linnaeus (JCL), not intended for human consumption but used for biodiesel production, could contribute to beneficial outcomes. This plant grows on poor land (arid and marginal land) and is drought resistant. Jatropha Curcas is native to South America and widely grown in South and Central America, Africa, and Asia (Achten et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2011). Some areas in Tunisia may be suitable for JCL, although not for food production. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the energy performance and potential of Jatropha Curcas for biodiesel production in Tunisia. The evaluation will be completed through the elaboration of an energy balance using life cycle assessment (LCA), which will facilitate the decision making process. Therefore, the cultivation of JCL production in Tunisia will be an experiment with uncertain results. The energy assessment reveals a negative energy return (EE = 0.42). Because of high investment costs and low yield per hectare, Jatropha is not a sound economic choice. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents the usefulness of IPCC Tier 1 methodology for the calculation of annual carbon stock changes for Annex V of the Directive: The promotion of the use energy from renewable sources (RED, 2009/28/EC). The presented results showed that carbon stocks should be calculated for a cold temperate dry climate, which is typical for Poland. In the research we did not find sufficient reasons to perform such calculations for a cold moist temperate climate region, which is also distinguished by the IPCC in Poland. The existing carbon stocks in cultivated high clay activity mineral, sandy and spodic soils were not statistically significantly different, but were more than often lower regarding the IPCC standards for carbon stock values. Spatial differentiations of annual carbon stock changes were low for three of the long-term studied cultivated soils under reduced tillage and no tillage systems with medium, high, or no manure input. Subsequently, the average values of annual carbon stock changes for all of Poland could be accepted and taken into account as binding magnitudes of organic carbon sequestrations for the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the life cycle of liquid biofuels. However, calculations should be done for the NUTS-2 regions, if farms apply these systems of cultivation with a high OM input of manure.

AB  - Biofuels are a suitable complement for fossil energy in the transport sector and bioethanol is the main biofuel traded worldwide. Based on the assumption that innovation can be influenced by regulation, the Brazilian bioethanol industry is facing new requirements from external actors while reaching for international markets. Until 2010, national environmental laws were the main sustainability instrument that the biofuel industry faced. With the introduction of sustainability criteria for biofuels in the European Fuels Quality Directive (FQD) and Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of 2009, bioethanol producers have been pressured to innovate in respect of the requirements of future markets. Here, the aim is to analyse the case of Brazil, given the potential exports of sugarcane-based ethanol from this country to the EU. Brazil provides an interesting overview of how a bioethanol industry innovated while facing sustainability requirements in the past. A comparison between the European requirements and the industry's status quo is then explored. The EU criteria are likely to have effects on the Brazilian bioethanol industry and incremental improvements in sustainability levels might take place based on the sustainability requirements. In addition, the industry could follow two other paths, namely risk diversification by engaging in multi-output models; and market leakage towards less-regulated markets. At the same time, an environmental overregulation of the biofuel market may make it more difficult for emerging biofuel industries in other countries, especially in Africa, by creating a barrier rather than contributing to its expansion. The results of this analysis show the main challenges to be addressed and the potential positive and negative impacts of the European Union biofuels policy on the Brazilian bioethanol industry.

AB  - An overview of lignin metabolism and its effect on biomass recalcitrance). Lignin, after cellulose, is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth, accounting for 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere. It is considered an important evolutionary adaptation of plants during their transition from the aquatic environment to land, since it bestowed the early tracheophytes with physical support to stand upright and enabled long-distance transport of water and solutes by waterproofing the vascular tissue. Although essential for plant growth and development, lignin is the major plant cell wall component responsible for biomass recalcitrance to industrial processing. The fact that lignin is a non-linear aromatic polymer built with chemically diverse and poorly reactive linkages and a variety of monomer units precludes the ability of any single enzyme to properly recognize and degrade it. Consequently, the use of lignocellulosic feedstock as a renewable and sustainable resource for the production of biofuels and bio-based materials will depend on the identification and characterization of the factors that determine plant biomass recalcitrance, especially the highly complex phenolic polymer lignin. Here, we summarize the current knowledge regarding lignin metabolism in plants, its effect on biomass recalcitrance and the emergent strategies to modify biomass recalcitrance through metabolic engineering of the lignin pathway. In addition, the potential use of sugarcane as a second-generation biofuel crop and the advances in lignin-related studies in sugarcane are discussed.

AB  - Selected and tested poplar clones are very suitable biomass resources for various applications such as biofuels, the pulp and paper industry as well as chemicals production. In this study, we determined the content of lignin, cellulose, holocellulose, and extractives, syringyl to guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in lignin, and also calculated higher heating values (HHV) among eight examined clones of Populusgrown on three different experimental sites. The highest lignin content for all the examined sites was determined in 'I-214' and 'Baka 5' clones, whereas the highest content of extractives was found in'Villafranca' and 'Baka 5' clones. The highest S/G ratio for all the examined sites was determined in'Villafranca' and 'Agathe F' clones. The chemical profiles of main wood components, extractives, and the S/G ratio in lignin were also influenced by both the experimental site and the clone × site interaction. Higher heating values, derived from calculations based on the contents of lignin and extractives (or lignin only), were in close agreement with the previously published data. The highest heating values were found for 'Baka 5' and 'I-214' clones. The optimal method of poplar biomass utilization can be chosen on basis of the lignocellulosics chemical composition and the S/G ratio in lignin. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - Globally, bioethanol is the largest volume biofuel used in the transportation sector, with corn-based ethanol production occurring mostly in the US and sugarcane-based ethanol production occurring mostly in Brazil. Advances in technology and the resulting improved productivity in corn and sugarcane farming and ethanol conversion, together with biofuel policies, have contributed to the significant expansion of ethanol production in the past 20 years. These improvements have increased the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of using bioethanol as opposed to using petroleum gasoline. This article presents results from our most recently updated simulations of energy use and GHG emissions that result from using bioethanol made from several feedstocks. The results were generated with the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model. In particular, based on a consistent and systematic model platform, we estimate life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions from using ethanol produced from five feedstocks: corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus. We quantitatively address the impacts of a few critical factors that affect life-cycle GHG emissions from bioethanol. Even when the highly debated land use change GHG emissions are included, changing from corn to sugarcane and then to cellulosic biomass helps to significantly increase the reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using bioethanol. Relative to petroleum gasoline, ethanol from corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus can reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 19-48%, 40-62%, 90-103%, 77-97% and 101-115%, respectively. Similar trends have been found with regard to fossil energy benefits for the five bioethanol pathways. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This letter examines the effectiveness of various biofuel and climate policies in reducing future processing costs of cellulosic biofuels due to learning-by-doing. These policies include a biofuel production mandate alone and supplementing the biofuel mandate with other policies, namely a national low carbon fuel standard, a cellulosic biofuel production tax credit or a carbon price policy. We find that the binding biofuel targets considered here can reduce the unit processing cost of cellulosic ethanol by about 30% to 70% between 2015 and 2035 depending on the assumptions about learning rates and initial costs of biofuel production. The cost in 2035 is more sensitive to the speed with which learning occurs and less sensitive to uncertainty in the initial production cost. With learning rates of 5-10%, cellulosic biofuels will still be at least 40% more expensive than liquid fossil fuels in 2035. The addition of supplementary low carbon/tax credit policies to the mandate that enhance incentives for cellulosic biofuels can achieve similar reductions in these costs several years earlier than the mandate alone; the extent of these incentives differs across policies and different kinds of cellulosic biofuels. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We evaluate the comparative productivity of maize and sugarcane biofuel feedstocks as a function of latitude. Solar radiation for photosynthesis varies by latitude and contributes to differential productivity of tropical and temperate zones. We calculate comparative productivity in two ways - the amount of net sugar energy produced per unit area, and the amount produced per unit of net primary productivity (NPP). NPP measures the accumulation of energy in an ecosystem and can be used as a proxy for the capacity of an ecosystem to support biodiversity and a broader array of ecosystem services. On average sugarcane produces three times more energy per unit area than does maize. The comparative productivity advantage of sugarcane decreases with increases in latitude. Latitudes closer to the equator have higher NPP, so there is a greater trade-off between biofuel production and ecosystem productivity in the equatorial zones. The comparative productivity of sugarcane relative to maize is reduced when comparing biofuel energy per unit of NPP. Sugarcane is still twice as productive on average compared to maize in the amount of biofuel energy produced per unit of NPP. Regions near the equator have lower biofuel energy per unit NPP, making them less attractive for biofuels production. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural phosphorus (P) use is intricately linked to food security and water quality. Globalization of agricultural systems and changing diets clearly alter these relationships, yet their specific influence on non-renewable P reserves is less certain. We assessed P fertilizer used for production of food crops, livestock and biofuels in the US agricultural system, explicitly comparing the domestic P use required for US food consumption to the P use embodied in the production of US food imports and exports. By far the largest demand for P fertilizer throughout the US agricultural system was for feed and livestock production (56% of total P fertilizer use, including that for traded commodities). As little as 8% of the total mineral P inputs to US domestic agriculture in 2007 (1905 Gg P) was consumed in US diets in the same year, while larger fractions may have been retained in agricultural soils (28%), associated with different post-harvest losses (40%) or with biofuel refining (10%). One quarter of all P fertilizer used in the US was linked to export production, primarily crops, driving a large net P flux out of the country (338 Gg P). However, US meat consumption relied considerably on P fertilizer use in other countries to produce red meat imports. Changes in domestic farm management and consumer waste could together reduce the P fertilizer required for US food consumption by half, which is comparable to the P fertilizer reduction attainable by cutting domestic meat consumption (44%). US export-oriented agriculture, domestic post-harvest P losses and global demand for meat may ultimately have an important influence on the lifespan of US phosphate rock reserves. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - There is growing concern that non-native plants cultivated for bioenergy production might escape and result in harmful invasions in natural areas. Literature-derived assessment tools used to evaluate invasion risk are beneficial for screening, but cannot be used to assess novel cultivars or genotypes. Experimental approaches are needed to help quantify invasion risk but protocols for such tools are lacking. We review current methods for evaluating invasion risk and make recommendations for incremental tests from small-scale experiments to widespread, controlled introductions. First, local experiments should be performed to identify conditions that are favorable for germination, survival, and growth of candidate biofuel crops. Subsequently, experimental introductions in semi-natural areas can be used to assess factors important for establishment and performance such as disturbance, founder population size, and timing of introduction across variable habitats. Finally, to fully characterize invasion risk, experimental introductions should be conducted across the expected geographic range of cultivation over multiple years. Any field-based testing should be accompanied by safeguards and monitoring for early detection of spread. Despite the costs of conducting experimental tests of invasion risk, empirical screening will greatly improve our ability to determine if the benefits of a proposed biofuel species outweigh the projected risks of invasions. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A climate envelope approach was used to model the response of switchgrass, a model bioenergy species in the United States, to future climate change. The model was built using general additive models (GAMs), and switchgrass yields collected at 45 field trial locations as the response variable. The model incorporated variables previously shown to be the main determinants of switchgrass yield, and utilized current and predicted 1 km climate data from WorldClim. The models were run with current WorldClim data and compared with results of predicted yield obtained using two climate change scenarios across three global change models for three time steps. Results did not predict an increase in maximum switchgrass yield but showed an overall shift in areas of high switchgrass productivity for both cytotypes. For upland cytotypes, the shift in high yields was concentrated in northern and north-eastern areas where there were increases in average growing season temperature, whereas for lowland cultivars the areas where yields were projected to increase were associated with increases in average early growing season precipitation. These results highlight the fact that the influences of climate change on switchgrass yield are spatially heterogeneous and vary depending on cytotype. Knowledge of spatial distribution of suitable areas for switchgrass production under climate change should be incorporated into planning of current and future biofuel production. Understanding how switchgrass yields will be affected by future changes in climate is important for achieving a sustainable biofuels economy. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the coming decades, continued population growth, rising meat and dairy consumption and expanding biofuel use will dramatically increase the pressure on global agriculture. Even as we face these future burdens, there have been scattered reports of yield stagnation in the world's major cereal crops, including maize, rice and wheat. Here we study data from ∼2.5 million census observations across the globe extending over the period 1961-2008. We examined the trends in crop yields for four key global crops: maize, rice, wheat and soybeans. Although yields continue to increase in many areas, we find that across 24-39% of maize-, rice-, wheat- and soybean-growing areas, yields either never improve, stagnate or collapse. This result underscores the challenge of meeting increasing global agricultural demands. New investments in underperforming regions, as well as strategies to continue increasing yields in the high-performing areas, are required. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the approach of 'arena of development' controversies over bioenergy in the shaping of a Danish climate strategy are analyzed as a contribution to a sustainable transition perspective on bioenergy in industrialized societies with substantial agricultural production. Bioenergy plays a prominent role in several Danish climate and energy plans, alongside with wind and solar energy, and energy savings. There are major controversies about targets for bioenergy with respect to acceptable types, sources and amounts of biomass. Strong path dependency is identified. Energy companies in Denmark convert coal fired power plants to biomass in order to sustain the role of these power plants. Their increasing use of imported wood pellets is criticized for increasing greenhouse gas emissions because of fast logging of years of forest growth. A Danish biotech company is developing enzymes for processing of biomass for biofuels. The alignment with the private car regime is strong, because biofuel enables continuation of fuel-driven vehicles as dominating transportation mode. Danish farmers see manure as important source for biogas while arguing for reduction of climate impact and nuisances from digested manure. Such biogas is questioned by some NGOs who fear manure-based biogas is used as argument for increased animal husbandry. The bioenergy controversies concern also methodologies for environmental assessments, including for indirect land use changes (ILUC), and reliability of certification schemes. The mapping of controversies identifies issues that probably need to be taken into account in shaping of Danish bioenergy strategies if these strategies should gain substantial legitimacy among environmental NGOs.

AB  - This paper examines the water dimensions of recent large-scale land acquisitions for biofuel production in the Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo and Northern regions of Ghana. Using secondary sources of data complemented by individual and group interviews, the paper reveals an almost universal lack of consideration of the implications of large-scale land deals for crop water requirements, the ecological functions of freshwater ecosystems and water rights of local smallholder farmers and other users. It documents the factors responsible for this apparent oversight including the multiplicity of land and water governance systems, sharp sectoral boundaries between land and water policies, property rights and institutions, outdated statutes, poorly resourced and ineffective regulatory agencies, and unequal power relations in land acquisition deals. The paper shows that due to a lack of an approach that jointly considers land and water management policies and institutions in acceding to large-scale land deals, the benefits derived by local people were insufficient to cover the involuntary permanent loss of their water rights and livelihoods and the risks posed to ecosystem services. Options for establishing alternative institutional arrangements that will allow water availability, use and management as well as social and environmental standards to be factored, ex ante, into large-scale land deals are explored. The paper offers recommendations which can help the government to achieve its stated objective of developing a "policy framework and guidelines for large-scale land acquisitions by both local and foreign investors for biofuels that will protect the interests of investors and the welfare of Ghanaian farmers and landowners".

AB  - The delta of the Tana river in Kenya, an important wetland in Eastern Africa, is at a major turning point. Key decisions regarding its future are on the verge of being made, some of which may dramatically alter its characteristics. At present, in a landscape that is a mosaic of floodplains and forests of high biodiversity, small-scale farming, fishing and livestock-keeping are the main activities practised by the local communities, all relying on the occurrence of floods in November and May. Private investors with the backing of governmental bodies or parastatals, including the river basin authority, have planned the conversion of the lower Tana into irrigated sugar cane and Jatropha curcas plantations for biofuel production. In this paper, we discuss the land and water grabbing aspect of this new biofuel production trend, 'grabbing' being defined as cases of land acquisition or water abstraction where established user-rights and public interests are disregarded. We focus on two case studies: a planned large-scale sugar cane plantation in the central floodplain and a large-scale Jatropha curcas plantation on the floodplain terraces. We demonstrate through a water budget analysis that their potential impacts on the water balance and quality, on the environment of the Tana delta and therefore on the flood-dependent livelihoods have not been adequately addressed in the Environmental Impact Assessment documents.

AB  - Increased demand for corn (Zea mays L.) stover as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol raises concerns about agricultural sustainability. Excessive corn stover harvesting could have long-term impacts on soil quality. We estimated current and future stover production and evaluated the potential harvestable stover amount (HSA) that could be used for biofuel feedstock in the United States by defining the minimum stover requirement (MSR) associated with the current soil organic carbon (SOC) content, tillage practices, and crop rotation systems. Here we show that the magnitude of the current HSA is limited (31 Tg y-1, dry matter) due to the high MSR for maintaining the current SOC content levels of soils that have a high carbon content. An alternative definition of MSR for soils with a moderate level of SOC content could significantly elevate the annual HSA to 68.7 Tg, or even to 132.2 Tg if the amount of currently applied manure is counted to partially offset the MSR. In the future, a greater potential for stover feedstock could come from an increase in stover yield, areal harvest index, and/or the total planted area. These results suggest that further field experiments on MSR should be designed to identify differences in MSR magnitude between maintaining SOC content and preventing soil erosion, and to understand the role of current SOC content level in determining MSR from soils with a wide range of carbon contents and climatic conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper a techno-economic analysis for bioethanol production in Africa for Tanzania case is presented. It is shown conversion pathways from sugar cane juice and molasses, at three levels of technological schemes, where the first one includes a selection of widely conventional technologies, the second level with a more sophisticated fermentation technology and the third level using a different broth and solid treatment for ethanol production. A simulation procedure was taking into account in order to evaluate the conversion pathways schemes using different scenarios of raw material pretreatment, using Aspen Plus software, that include productivity analysis and energy requirements for each process configuration. Also an economical evaluation of each technology level and each scenario is shown. A comparison and discussions for each technological level and each scenario for bioethanol production in Tanzania is presented. These results served as the basis to draw recommendations on technological and economic feasibility aspects for the implementation of a national biofuel production programme in Africa. The study helped to identify the best technological schemes for producing fuel-grade alcohol from the various raw materials analysed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of the present article is to consider optimal trade policies for biofuels, taking into account the potential for carbon leakage and the complex set of policies used or discussed for biofuels. First, the authors consider the case of optimal trade policies and find that the combination of an import standard and a border carbon adjustment welfare dominates using only a border carbon adjustment (BCA). The import standard should be set such that the emissions per unit of output is as if the foreign biofuels industry were subject to the globally optimal green house gas (GHG) emission tax. Second, the authors study the same trade policies in the context of a blending mandate, which significantly alters the way the market works. Given the suboptimal implementation of a blending mandate, the optimal BCA depends on the domestic subsidy to biofuels production. High levels of subsidies may in fact imply a negative BCA; that is, the optimal policy would be to subsidize imports. © 2012 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This study investigated the energy productivity and input sensitivity of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), as compared with cotton and maize, at two coastal saline-alkali sites in Shandong Province, China. The data were collected quantitatively using a questionnaire for face-to-face interviewing of 116 farmers. The sorghum showed a lower energy input requirement than cotton and maize. The energy productivity indices were 12.4 and 9.2 for sweet sorghum, which were much higher than for cotton (3.1) at Wudi and maize (8.4) at Wendeng, respectively. Nitrogen fertilisation contributed the highest proportions (between 56% and 69% for the three crops) to the total energy consumption, as compared with the seed, labour, machinery, diesel fuel, phosphorus and potassium fertilisers, irrigation water, plastic film, and pesticides. All of the crops consumed much more non-renewable energy than renewable energy. According to the Cobb-Douglas production function, the diesel and nitrogen fertiliser energy inputs had a significantly positive impact on the sweet sorghum energy output. The energy crop showed an increasing return to scale, with cotton showing a constant and maize a decreasing return. These findings indicate that the sweet sorghum energy output is possible to be increased with further technical research and development. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent large-scale land acquisitions for agricultural production (including biofuels), popularly known as 'land grabbing', have attracted headline attention. Water as both a target and driver of this phenomenon has been largely ignored despite the interconnectedness of water and land. This special issue aims to fill this gap and to widen and deepen the lens beyond the confines of the literature's still limited focus on agriculture-driven resource grabbing. The articles in this collection demonstrate that the fluid nature of water and its hydrologic complexity often obscure how water grabbing takes place and what the associated impacts on the environment and diverse social groups are. The fluid properties of water interact with the 'slippery' nature of the grabbing processes: unequal power relations; fuzziness between legality and illegality and formal and informal rights; unclear administrative boundaries and jurisdictions, and fragmented negotiation processes. All these factors combined with the powerful material, discursive and symbolic characteristics of water make 'water grabbing' a site for conflict with potential drastic impacts on the current and future uses and benefits of water, rights as well as changes in tenure relations.

AB  - Butanol is an important industrial solvent and advanced biofuel that can be produced by biphasic fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum. It has been known that acetate and butyrate first formed during the acidogenic phase are reassimi-lated to form acetone-butanol-ethanol (cold channel). Butanol can also be formed directly from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through butyryl-CoA (hot channel). However, little is known about the relative contributions of the two butanol-forming pathways. Here we report that the direct butanol-forming pathway is a better channel to optimize for butanol production through metabolic flux and mass balance analyses. Butanol production through the hot channel was maximized by simultaneous disruption of the pta and buk genes, encoding phosphotransacetylase and butyrate kinase, while the adhE1D485G gene, encoding a mutated aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, was overexpressed. The ratio of butanol produced through the hot channel to that produced through the cold channel increased from 2.0 in the wild type to 18.8 in the engineered BEKW(pPthlAAD**) strain. By reinforcing the direct butanol-forming flux in C. acetobutylicum, 18.9 g/liter of butanol was produced, with a yield of 0.71 mol butanol/mol glucose by batch fermentation, levels which are 160% and 245% higher than those obtained with the wild type. By fed-batch culture of this engineered strain with in situ recovery, 585.3 g of butanol was produced from 1,861.9 g of glucose, with the yield of 0.76 mol butanol/mol glucose and productivity of 1.32 g/liter/h. Studies of two butanol-forming routes and their effects on butanol production in C. acetobutylicum described here will serve as a basis for further metabolic engineering of clos-tridia aimed toward developing a superior butanol producer. © 2012 Jang et al.

AB  - The characteristics of petroleum-contaminated sediment (PCS) have been evaluated to assess whether the practice of its beneficial reuse as a sole or supplemental energy source is sustainable relative to other sediment remediation options such as monitored natural recovery (MNR), capping, or off-site disposal. Some of these remediation options for PCS are energy-intensive and/or require land utilization. The energy and compositional analysis results indicate a low carbon content (15-17%(wt)) and corresponding low energy values of 5,200 kJ/kg (2,200 Btu/lb) to 5,600 kJ/kg (2,400 Btu/lb). However, given other decision-making criteria, the sediment may contain enough value to be added as a supplemental fuel given that it is normally considered a waste product and is readily available.The thermogravimetric profiles obtained under both combustion and pyrolytic conditions showed that the sulfur contents were comparable to typical low sulfur bituminous or lignite coals found in the United States, and most of the volatiles could be vaporized below 750°C. The heavy metal concentrations determined before and after combustion of the PCS indicated that further engineering controls may be required for mercury, arsenic, and lead. Due to the potential for reduction of public health and environmental threats, potential economic savings, and conservation of natural resources (petroleum and land), removal of PCS by dredging and beneficial reuse as a supplemental fuel clearly has merit to be considered as a sustainable remediation option. This study will provide a logical evaluation process to determine whether petroleum-contaminated sediment can be reused as an energy source. The energy and emissions values were determined and evaluated whether the sediment could be combusted for viable and sustainable use, considering several factors pertinent to evaluate in the remediation decision process. Various analysis methods were employed to determine elemental compositions, heating values, thermal and emission characteristics. This evaluation process may be used as a general methodology for the determination of petroleum-contaminated sediment as a supplemental fuel that may have merit to be considered as a sustainable remediation option. © 2012 Copyright 2012 A&WMA.

AB  - With the growing demands for food and biofuel, new technologies and crop management systems are being used to increase productivity and minimize land-use impacts. In this context, estimates of productivity and the impacts of agriculture management practices are becoming increasingly important. Numerical models that describe the soil-surface-atmosphere interactions for natural and agricultural ecosystems are important tools to explore the impacts of these agronomical technologies and their environmental impacts. However, these models need to be validated by considering the different soil and environmental conditions before they can be widely applied. The processbased terrestrial agricultural version of the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) model (Agro-IBIS) has only been calibrated and validated for North American sites. Here, the authors validate the Agro-IBIS results for an experimental soybean site in southern Brazil. At this site, soybean was grown under two different management systems: no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). The model results were evaluated against micrometeorological, soil condition, and biomass observations made during the soybean growing season. The leaf area index (LAI) was underestimated, approaching the values obtained in the CT crop system, with higher error in the leaf senescence period. The model shows higher skill for daily averages and the diurnal cycle of the energy balance components in the period of high LAI. The soil temperature and moisture were robustly simulated, although the latter is best correlated with the observations made at the CT field. The ecosystem respiration is highly underestimated, causing an overestimation of the cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE), particularly at the end of the crop cycle.

AB  - Many unicellular microalgae produce large amounts (~20 to 50% of cell dry weight) of triacylglycerols (TAGs) under stress (e.g., nutrient starvation and high light), but the synthesis and physiological role of TAG are poorly understood. We present detailed genetic, biochemical, functional, and physiological analyses of phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which catalyzes TAG synthesis via two pathways: transacylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) with acyl groups from phospholipids and galactolipids and DAG:DAG transacylation. We demonstrate that PDAT also possesses acyl hydrolase activities using TAG, phospholipids, galactolipids, and cholesteryl esters as substrates. Artificial microRNA silencing of PDAT in C. reinhardtii alters the membrane lipid composition, reducing the maximum specific growth rate. The data suggest that PDAT-mediated membrane lipid turnover and TAG synthesis is essential for vigorous growth under favorable culture conditions and for membrane lipid degradation with concomitant production of TAG for survival under stress. The strong lipase activity of PDAT with broad substrate specificity suggests that this enzyme could be a potential biocatalyst for industrial lipid hydrolysis and conversion, particularly for biofuel production. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - The capacity for forests to aid in climate change mitigation efforts is substantial but will ultimately depend on their management. If forests remain unharvested, they can further mitigate the increases in atmospheric CO2 that result from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Alternatively, they can be harvested for bioenergy production and serve as a substitute for fossil fuels, though such a practice could reduce terrestrial C storage and thereby increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the near-term. Here, we used an ecosystem simulation model to ascertain the effectiveness of using forest bioenergy as a substitute for fossil fuels, drawing from a broad range of land-use histories, harvesting regimes, ecosystem characteristics, and bioenergy conversion efficiencies. Results demonstrate that the times required for bioenergy substitutions to repay the C Debt incurred from biomass harvest are usually much shorter (&lt; 100 years) than the time required for bioenergy production to substitute the amount of C that would be stored if the forest were left unharvested entirely, a point we refer to as C Sequestration Parity. The effectiveness of substituting woody bioenergy for fossil fuels is highly dependent on the factors that determine bioenergy conversion efficiency, such as the C emissions released during the harvest, transport, and firing of woody biomass. Consideration of the frequency and intensity of biomass harvests should also be given; performing total harvests (clear-cutting) at high-frequency may produce more bioenergy than less intensive harvesting regimes but may decrease C storage and thereby prolong the time required to achieve C Sequestration Parity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - There is a growing need for all productive sectors to develop greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation techniques to reduce the enhanced greenhouse effect. However, the challenge to the agricultural sector is reducing net emissions while increasing production to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and biofuel. This study focuses on the changes in the GHG balance when sugarcane areas are converted from burned harvest (BH) to green harvest (GH, mechanized harvest), including the changes caused by the adoption of conservationist practices such as reduced tillage and a 4-month crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. during sugarcane replanting. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2006) methodologies, the annual emission balance includes both agricultural and mobile sources of GHG, according to the mean annual consumption of supplies per hectare. The potential soil carbon accumulation was also considered in the GH plot. The total amounts of GHG were 2651.9 and 2316.4 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for BH and GH, respectively. Factoring in a mean annual soil carbon accumulation rate of 888.1 kg CO2 ha-1 yr-1 due to the input from long-term crop residues associated with the conversion from BH to GH, the emission balance in GH decreased to 1428.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. A second decrease occurs when a reduced tillage strategy is adopted instead of conventional tillage during the replanting season in the GH plot, which helps reduce the total emission balance to 1180.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. Moreover, the conversion of sugarcane from BH to GH, with the adoption of a crop rotation with Crotalaria juncea L. as well as reduced tillage during sugarcane replanting, would result in a smaller GHG balance of 1064.6 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1, providing an effect strategy for GHG mitigation while still providing cleaner sugar and ethanol production in southern Brazil. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Transport accounts for about one quarter of South Africa's final energy consumption. Most of the energy used is based on fossil fuels causing significant environmental burdens. This threat becomes even more dominant as a significant growth in transport demand is forecasted, especially in South Africa's economic hub, Gauteng province. The South African government has realized the potential of biofuel usage for reducing oil import dependency and greenhouse gas (GHG) and has hence developed a National Biofuels Industrial Strategy to enforce their use. However, there is limited experience in the country in commercial biofuel production and some of the proposed crops (i.e. rapeseed and sugar beet) have not been yet cultivated on a larger scale. Furthermore, there is only limited research available, looking at the feasibility of commercial scale biofuel production or abatement costs of GHG emissions. To assess the opportunities of biofuel production in South Africa, the production costs and consumer price levels of the fuels recommended by the national strategy are analysed in this article. Moreover, the lifecycle GHG emissions and mitigation costs are calculated compared to the calculated fossil fuel reference including coal to liquid (CTL) and gas to liquid (GTL) fuels. The results show that the cost for biofuel production in South Africa are currently significantly higher (between 30% and 80%) than for the reference fossil fuels. The lifecycle GHG emissions of biofuels (especially for sugar cane) are considerably lower (up to 45%) than the reference fossil GHG emissions. The resulting GHG abatement costs are between 1000 and 2500 ZAR2007 per saved ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is high compared to the current European CO2 market prices of ca. 143 ZAR2007 t-1. The analysis has shown that biofuel production and utilization in South Africa offers a significant GHG-mitigation potential but at relatively high cost. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Identifying the location and amount of grain crop residues (stubble) in Australia is necessary for determining the viability of potential biofuel plant locations. We combined 22 years of crop statistics with harvest indices and land use to arrive at spatially explicit stubble productivity figures. Stubble quantities using different focal radii and from different seasons provide an insight into the feasibility of its use for bioenergy. We focus on areas where the stubble concentrations within a 50 km radius were at least 500 kt per year; the amount suggested for a viable lignocellolosic bioethanol facility. The outcome of this study has been to show, for the first time, where there are large amounts of stubble in Australia. Whether the supply of stubble is sufficiently constant over time and indeed available at a price that is economic for a biofuel plant must be subject to future work. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Prairies used for bioenergy production have potential to generate marketable products while enhancing environmental quality, but little is known about how prairie species composition and nutrient management affect the suitability of prairie biomass for bioenergy production. We determined how functional-group identity and nitrogen fertilization affected feedstock characteristics and estimated bioenergy yields of prairie plants, and compared those prairie characteristics to that of corn stover. We tested our objectives with a field experiment that was set up as a 5 × 2 incomplete factorial design with C3 grasses, C4 grasses, legumes, and multi-functional-group mixtures grown with and without nitrogen fertilizer; a fertilized corn treatment was also included. We determined cell wall, hemicellulose, cellulose, and ash concentrations; ethanol conversion ratios; gross caloric ratios; aboveground biomass production; ethanol yields; and energy yields for all treatments. Prairie functional-group identity affected the biomass feedstock characteristics, whereas nitrogen fertilization did not. Functional group and fertilization had a strong effect on aboveground biomass production, which was the major predictor of ethanol and energy yields. C4 grasses, especially when fertilized, had among the most favorable bioenergy characteristics with high estimated ethanol conversion ratios and nongrain biomass production, relatively high gross caloric ratios, and low ash concentrations. The bioenergy characteristics of corn stover, from an annual C4 grass, were similar to those of the biomass of perennial C4 grasses. Both functional-group composition and nitrogen fertility management were found to be important in optimizing bioenergy production from prairies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The sterile triploid Miscanthus × giganteus is capable of yielding more biomass per unit land area than most other temperate crops. Although the yield potential of M. × giganteus is high, sterility requires all propagation of the plant to be done vegetatively. The traditional rhizome propagation system achieves relatively low multiplication rates, i.e. the number of new plants generated from a single-parent plant, and requires tillage that leaves soil vulnerable to CO2 and erosion losses. A stem-based propagation system is used in related crops like sugarcane, and may prove a viable alternative, but the environmental conditions required for shoot initiation from stems of M. × giganteus are unknown. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of temperature, illumination and node position on emergence of M. × giganteus shoots. Stems of M. × giganteus were cut into segments with a single node each, placed in controlled environments under varied soil temperature or light regimes and the number of emerged shoots were evaluated daily for 21 days. At temperatures of 20 and 25 °C, rhizomes produced significantly more shoots than did stem segments (P = 0.0105 and 0.0594, respectively), but the difference was not significant at 30 °C, where 63% of stems produced shoots compared to 80% of rhizomes (P = 0.2037). There was a strong positive effect (P = 0.0086) of soil temperature on emergence in the range of temperatures studied here (15-30 °C). Node positions higher on the stem were less likely to emerge (P &lt; 0.0001) with a significant interaction between illumination and node position. Planting the lowest five nodes from stems of M. × giganteus in 30 °C soil in the light resulted in 75% emergence, which represents a potential multiplication rate 10-12 times greater than that of the current rhizome-based system. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - More diverse sources of energy are needed for countries to progress toward energy independence and to meet future food production needs. The US Task Force on Strategic Unconventional Fuels concluded that to achieve this objective it is essential to develop a domestic unconventional fuels industry. Rangelands, which cover 50 to 70 of the earth's terrestrial surface and dominate much of the western half of the United States, represent a major source of alternative energy resources. A framework to systematically identify biophysical- socioeconomic links that influence the delivery of ecosystem services affected by alternative uses of rangelands has been lacking. The Integrated Social, Economic, and Ecological Conceptual framework was developed by the Sustainable Rangeland Roundtable to address this deficiency. We apply this framework to demonstrate how the effect on ecosystem services of exploiting rangeland-based biofuel, natural gas, and wind energy resources can be systematically compared. We also demonstrate the use of this framework for selecting suitable indicators to monitor changes in the biophysical-socioeconomic links affected by the development of these unconventional energy sources. This type of approach can potentially enhance coordination between federal, state, and local agencies that are attempting to set polices and regulations for the sustainable development of unconventional energy resources on rangelands.

AB  - Biofuels are now an important resource in the United States because of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Both increased corn growth for ethanol production and perennial dedicated energy crop growth for cellulosic feedstocks are potential sources to meet the rising demand for biofuels. However, these measures may cause adverse environmental consequences that are not yet fully understood. This study 1) evaluates the long-term impacts of increased frequency of corn in the crop rotation system on water quantity and quality as well as soil fertility in the James River Basin and 2) identifies potential grasslands for cultivating bioenergy crops (e.g. switchgrass), estimating the water quality impacts. We selected the soil and water assessment tool, a physically based multidisciplinary model, as the modeling approach to simulate a series of biofuel production scenarios involving crop rotation and land cover changes. The model simulations with different crop rotation scenarios indicate that decreases in water yield and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration along with an increase in NO3-N load to stream water could justify serious concerns regarding increased corn rotations in this basin. Simulations with land cover change scenarios helped us spatially classify the grasslands in terms of biomass productivity and nitrogen loads, and we further derived the relationship of biomass production targets and the resulting nitrogen loads against switchgrass planting acreages. The suggested economically efficient (planting acreage) and environmentally friendly (water quality) planting locations and acreages can be a valuable guide for cultivating switchgrass in this basin. This information, along with the projected environmental costs (i.e. reduced water yield and increased nitrogen load), can contribute to decision support tools for land managers to seek the sustainability of biofuel development in this region. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A method and tool have been developed to assess future developments in land availability for bioenergy crops in a spatially explicit way, while taking into account both the developments in other land use functions, such as land for food, livestock and material production, and the uncertainties in the key determinant factors of land use change (LUC). This spatiotemporal LUC model is demonstrated with a case study on the developments in the land availability for bioenergy crops in Mozambique in the timeframe 2005-2030. The developments in the main drivers for agricultural land use, demand for food, animal products and materials were assessed, based on the projected developments in population, diet, GDP and self-sufficiency ratio. Two scenarios were developed: a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and a progressive scenario. Land allocation was based on land use class-specific sets of suitability factors. The LUC dynamics were mapped on a 1 km2 grid level for each individual year up to 2030. In the BAU scenario, 7.7 Mha and in the progressive scenario 16.4 Mha could become available for bioenergy crop production in 2030. Based on the Monte Carlo analysis, a 95% confidence interval of the amount of land available and the spatially explicit probability of available land was found. The bottom-up approach, the number of dynamic land uses, the diverse portfolio of LUC drivers and suitability factors, and the possibility to model uncertainty mean that this model is a step forward in modelling land availability for bioenergy potentials. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) addition typically increases overall plant growth, but the nature of this response depends upon patterns of plant nitrogen allocation that vary throughout the growing season and depend upon canopy position. In this study seasonal variations in leaf traits were investigated across a canopy profile in Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) under two N treatments (0 and 224 kg ha-1) to determine whether the growth response of Miscanthus to N fertilization was related to the response of photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen allocation. Miscanthus yielded 24.1 Mg ha-1 in fertilized plots, a 40% increase compared to control plots. Photosynthetic properties, such as net photosynthesis (A), maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), stomatal conductance (gs) and PSII efficiency (Fv'/Fm'), all decreased significantly from the top of the canopy to the bottom, but were not affected by N fertilization. N fertilization increased specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI). Leaf N concentration in different canopy layers was increased by N fertilization and the distribution of N concentration within canopy followed irradiance gradients. These results show that the positive effect of N fertilization on the yield of Miscanthus was unrelated to changes in photosynthetic rates but was achieved mainly by increased canopy leaf area. Vertical measurements through the canopy demonstrated that Miscanthus adapted to the light environment by adjusting leaf morphological and biochemical properties independent of nitrogen treatments. GPP estimated using big leaf and multilayer models varied considerably, suggesting a multilayer model in which Vcmax changes both through time and canopy layer could be adopted into agricultural models to more accurately predict biomass production in biomass crop ecosystems. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - As the environmental and economic consequences of fossil-fuel use become clear, land is increasingly targeted as a source of bioenergy. We explore the potential for generating electricity from biomass vulnerable to fires as an ecologic and socioeconomic opportunity that can reduce the risk of greenhouse gas generation from wildfires and help to create incentives to preserve natural and seminatural vegetation and prevent its conversion to agriculture, including biofuel crops. On the basis of a global analysis of the energy generation and spatial distribution of fires, we show that between 2003 and 2010, global fires consumed ~8300 ± 592 PJ yr-1 of energy, equivalent to ~36-44% of the global electricity consumption in 2008 and &gt;100% national consumption in 57 countries. Forests/woodlands, cultivated areas, shrublands, and grasslands contributed 53%, 19%, 16%, and 3.5% of the global energy released by fires. Although many agroecological, socioeconomic, and engineering challenges need to be overcome before diverting the energy lost in fires into more useable forms, done cautiously it could reconcile habitat preservation with economic yields in natural systems. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biomass has been focused as a fuel resource because of its huge abundance and carbon-neutral characteristics. Thus, we attempted to use tree biomass as the resource to automotive fuel. From the global warming point of view, the biomass energy production from large-scale plantation is required, however, the land use should not be changed from crop field or forest land. In the present paper, the feasibility of the use in Japan of biofuel from woody biomass produced in large arid area of Western Australia, where the present authors demonstrated that the large-scale afforestation is possible even in an arid land when introducing water management and plantation technologies, has been evaluated using LCA method, by considering the actual condition of our afforestation area. Furthermore, some sensitivity analysis is conducted on the effects of composition ratio of electric power sources. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Energy analysis results confirmed that abandoned rice fields provide a good opportunity for Japan to fulfill its E-3 target by producing ethanol from high-yield rice feedstock. However, to be a viable alternative, a biofuel should not only provide a net energy gain and reduce the emissions of polluting gases, but also be ecologically and economically competitive. Thus, an integrated ecological-economic evaluation was done to determine the viability of the process, the opportunity cost of biodiversity loss and the quality of the energies consumed and produced. The results showed that although ethanol from high-yield rice has a net energy yield, it is currently neither ecologically nor economically feasible to use it to replace gasoline as a transport fuel in Japan. There is a positive effect in that polluting gas emissions are reduced, but this benefit is too small to change the large negative balance in both the emergy and economic accounts. Furthermore, converting an abandoned rice field to the cultivation of intensified high-yield rice feedstock could have a large negative effect on biodiversity at both genetic and species levels, which if fully realized, would be over 300 times the ecological economic value of the rice-ethanol output. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to assess projects for the generation of clean, renewable energy. Such methodology is applied here to estimate the consumption of fossil fuels (referred to as 'oil'), required for the construction, operation and maintenance of a wind farm consisting of 97 turbines of 3 MW each. Results show that such consumption represents a conservative 8-9% of the total energy generated by the farm in 20 years of useful life. The need to include in the efficiency of the farm the 'unavoidable unintentional damage' to the population and its habitat, caused primarily by emissions related to the oil consumed is posed. Even though the efficiency of the wind farm is really acceptable as well as likely to be improved, the oil footprint is worryingly high. This raises serious questions as to the efficiency and feasibility of other renewable energies, particularly regarding the production of biofuels. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the European Union, growing attention to biofuels is directly linked to the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and lies therefore in the more general scope of actions to combat climate change. More specifically, in order to cut emissions from transport, the EU has chosen to opt decidedly for first generation biofuels, expecting them to make up 10% of fuels on the market by 2020. Amongst other things, this will add to the tendency of agricultural prices to increase and become more volatile, favouring the already strong financial speculations and weighing heavily on the possibilities of poorer countries to access food. Given these conditions, the choice to privilege first generation biofuels seems much more functional to the interests and profit strategies of a restricted number of big industrial groups, rather than to the so-claimed general environmental objectives.

AB  - The Department of Energy announced in 2009 of its plan to fund the FutureGen project, a partnership between private industry and the government to build a plant by 2012 that was to demonstrate technology that could capture emission from burning fossil fuels for energy production. The DOE has however set about spending billions of dollars on various technologies such as solar panels and biofuels. In mid July, the newspapers reported that the Navy had spent over $12 million for biofuels at $26 per gallon. With our government working to limit conventional energy production and overspending on unproven technology, the result has been to drive up prices to the consumer. Recycling activities are increasing across the land but the majority of wasted materials still find their way into landfills. Product ingredients are chosen based upon their ability to be recycled, while containers are marked so the consumer can identify recyclable materials.

AB  - The new renewable fuels standard (RFS 2) aims to distinguish corn-ethanol that achieves a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with gasoline. Field data from Kim et al. (2009) and from our own study suggest that geographic variability in the GHG emissions arising from corn production casts considerable doubt on the approach used in the RFS 2 to measure compliance with the 20% target. If regulators wish to require compliance of fuels with specific GHG emission reduction thresholds, then data from growing biomass should be disaggregated to a level that captures the level of variability in grain corn production and the application of life cycle assessment to biofuels should be modified to capture this variability. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the optimum nitrogen fertilizer rate for producing sweet sorghum (a promising biofuel crop) juice, sugar, and bagasse on silt loam, sandy loam, and clay soils in Missouri. Seven nitrogen fertilization rates were applied, ranging from 0 to 134 kg N ha-1. Regardless of the soil and year, the juice content of sweet sorghum stalk averaged 68.8% by weight. The juice yield ranged from 15.2 to 71.1 m3 ha-1. Soil and N rate significantly impacted the juice yield (P &lt; 0.0001). The pH and the density of the juice were not affected by the soil or N. The sugar content (Brix) of the juice varied between 10.7% and 18.9%. N fertilization improved the sugar content of the juice. A negative correlation existed between the sugar concentration and the juice yield. In general, the lowest sugar content was found in the clay soil and the impact of the N fertilization on juice sugar content was most pronounced in that soil. The juice sugar yield ranged between 2 and 9.9 Mg ha-1, with significant differences found between years, N rates, and soils. N fertilization always increased the sugar yield in the clay soil, whereas in loam soil, a significant sugar response was recorded when the sweet sorghum was planted after corn. The average juice water content was 84% by weight. The dry bagasse yield fluctuated between 3.2 and 13.8 Mg ha-1 with significant difference found with N rate, soil, and year. When sweet sorghum was grown after soybean or cotton, its N requirement was less than after a corn crop was grown the previous year. In general, a minimum of 67 kg N ha-1 was required to optimize juice, sugar, and bagasse yield in sweet sorghum. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Endophytic bacteria have been shown to provide several advantages to their host, including enhanced growth. Inoculating biofuel species with endophytic bacteria is therefore an attractive option to increase the productivity of biofuel feedstocks. Here, we investigated the effect of inoculating hard wood cuttings of Populus deltoides Bartr. × Populus. nigra L. clone OP367 with Enterobacter sp. 638. After 17 weeks, plants inoculated with Enterobacter sp. 638 had 55% greater total biomass than un-inoculated control plants. Study of gas exchange and fluorescence in developing and mature leaves over a diurnal cycle and over a 5 week measurement campaign revealed no effects of inoculation on photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic water use efficiency or the maximum and operating efficiency of photosystem II. However, plants inoculated with Enterobacter sp. 638 had a canopy that was 39% larger than control plants indicating that the enhanced growth was fueled by increased leaf area, not by improved physiology. Leaf nitrogen content was determined at two stages over the 5 week measurement period. No effect of Enterobacter sp. 638 on leaf nitrogen content was found indicating that the larger plants were acquiring sufficient nitrogen. Enterobacter sp. 638 lacks the genes for N2 fixation, therefore the increased availability of nitrogen likely resulted from enhanced nitrogen acquisition by the 84% larger root system. These data show that Enterobacter sp. 638 has the potential to dramatically increase productivity in poplar. If fully realized in the production environment, these results indicate that an increase in the environmental and economic viability of poplar as a biofuel feedstock is possible when inoculated with endophytic bacteria like Enterobacter sp. 638.

AB  - Biofuels from agricultural sources are an important part of California's strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil. Land conversion for agricultural and urban uses has already imperiled many animal species in the state. This study investigated the potential impacts on wildlife of shifts in agricultural activity to increase biomass production for transportation fuels. We applied knowledge of the suitability of California's agricultural landscapes for wildlife species to evaluate wildlife effects associated with plausible scenarios of expanded production of three potential biofuel crops (sugar beets, bermudagrass, and canola). We also generated alternative, spatially explicit scenarios that minimized loss of habitat for the same level of biofuel production. We explored trade-offs to compare the marginal changes per unit of energy for transportation costs, wildlife, land and water-use, and total energy produced, and found that all five factors were influenced by crop choice. Sugar beet scenarios require the least land area: 3.5 times less land per liter of gasoline equivalent than bermudagrass and five times less than canola. Canola scenarios had the largest impacts on wildlife but the greatest reduction in water use. Bermudagrass scenarios resulted in a slight overall improvement for wildlife over the current situation. Relatively minor redistribution of lands converted to biofuel crops could produce the same energy yield with much less impact on wildlife and very small increases in transportation costs. This framework provides a means to systematically evaluate potential wildlife impacts of alternative production scenarios and could be a useful complement to other frameworks that assess impacts on ecosystem services and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Growing concerns about energy and the environment have led to worldwide use of bioenergy. Switching from food crops to biofuel crops is an option to meet the fast-growing need for biofuel feedstocks. This land use change consequently affects the ecosystem carbon balance. In this study, we used a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, to evaluate the impacts of this change on the carbon balance, bioenergy production, and agricultural yield, assuming that several land use change scenarios from corn, soybean, and wheat to biofuel crops of switchgrass and Miscanthus will occur. We found that biofuel crops have much higher net primary production (NPP) than soybean and wheat crops. When food crops from current agricultural lands were changed to different biofuel crops, the national total NPP increased in all cases by a range of 0.14-0.88 Pg C yr-1, except while switching from corn to switchgrass when a decrease of 14% was observed. Miscanthus is more productive than switchgrass, producing about 2.5 times the NPP of switchgrass. The net carbon loss ranges from 1.0 to 6.3 Tg C yr-1 if food crops are changed to switchgrass, and from 0.4 to 6.7 Tg C yr-1 if changed to Miscanthus. The largest loss was observed when soybean crops were replaced with biofuel crops. Soil organic carbon increased significantly when land use changed, reaching 100 Mg C ha-1 in biofuel crop ecosystems. When switching from food crops to Miscanthus, the per unit area croplands produced a larger amount of ethanol than that of original food crops. In comparison, the land use change from wheat to Miscanthus produced more biomass and sequestrated more carbon. Our study suggests that Miscanthus could better serve as an energy crop than food crops or switchgrass, considering both economic and environmental benefits. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biobutanol is currently a hot topic within discussions about second-generation biofuels. Its advocates point to the fact that it possesses a higher energy content than traditional bioethanol and, most importantly, that it is compatible with existing fuel distribution infrastructure. While traditional biobutanol production processes have long since suffered from an inability to produce it in an economically viable manner, several recent technological advances have spurred interest from the private sector and several companies are now actively pursuing the commercialization of biobutanol as a transportation fuel. As such, a legal analysis of the regulatory frameworks affecting this commercialization is highly relevant. In this study, we detail and analyze the two most import regulatory frameworks affecting the successful commercialization of biobutanol as a transportation fuel in the United States. First, we provide a thorough description of the US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) and analyze its impact on biobutanol commercialization efforts. Next, we address the US Clean Air Act's so-called 'substantially similar' prohibition and detail the three distinct regulatory paths it creates for biobutanol commercialization. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways in which these regulatory frameworks could be altered to mitigate unjustified regulatory burdens. While our study focuses on the commercialization of biobutanol, its regulatory descriptions and analysis are equally informative in regards to the commercialization of other alcohol-based biofuels. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of biomass for energy production is considered a promising way to reduce net carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. However, land-use change to bioenergy crops can result in carbon emissions from soil and vegetation in amounts that could take decades to compensate. Perennial grasses such as Miscanthus offer a possible solution to this problem as measurements on experimental plots planted with Miscanthus have shown significant carbon sequestration in the soil. It can, however, be expected that sequestration potentials in commercial use might differ from those measured in experimental plots due to different farming practices and soil characteristics. For this study, Miscanthus plantations on 16 farms in SE Ireland as well as on-farm controls representing the former land-use (grassland and tillage) have been examined. The Miscanthus plantations were 2-3 years old. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content and a number of soil properties were measured and the amount of Miscanthus-derived carbon was determined using the 13C natural abundance method. On both former tillage fields and grasslands, although there were no significant differences in SOC contents between Miscanthus and control sites, it was shown that 2-3 years after Miscanthus establishment, 1.82 ± 1.69 and 2.17 ± 1.73 Mg ha-1 of the SOC under former-tilled and former grassland respectively were Miscanthus-derived. Mixed-effects models were used to link the total SOC concentrations and Miscanthus-derived carbon to the landuse parameters as well as to soil properties. It was shown that on control sites, pH had an effect on total SOC. In the case of Miscanthus-derived carbon, the initial SOC content, pH, former land-use and crop age had significant effects. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The production potential of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has not been estimated in a Mediterranean climate on a regional basis and its economic and environmental contribution as a biofuel crop remains unknown. The objectives of the study were to calibrate and validate a biogeochemical model, DAYCENT, and to predict the biomass yield potential of switchgrass across the Central Valley of California. Six common cultivars were calibrated using published data across the US and validated with data generated from four field trials in California (2007-2009). After calibration, the modeled range of yields across the cultivars and various management practices in the US (excluding California) was 2.4-41.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1, generally compatible with the observed yield range of 1.3-33.7 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Overall, the model was successfully validated in California; the model explained 66-90% of observed yield variation in 2007-2009. The range of modeled yields was 2.0-41.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1, which corresponded to the observed range of 1.3-41.1 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The response to N fertilizer and harvest frequency on yields were also reasonably validated. The model estimated that Alamo (21-23 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and Kanlow (22-24 Mg ha-1 yr-1) had greatest yield potential during the years after establishment. The effects of soil texture on modeled yields tended to be consistent for all cultivars, but there were distinct climatic (e.g., annual mean maximum temperature) controls among the cultivars. Our modeled results suggest that early stand maintenance of irrigated switchgrass is strongly dependent on available soil N; estimated yields increased by 1.6-5.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 when residual soil mineral N was sufficient for optimal re-growth. Therefore, management options of switchgrass for regional biomass production should be ecotypespecific and ensure available soil N maintenance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel initiatives in India have gained momentum with the national biofuel policy targeting 20% blending of both petrol and diesel by 2017. Most of India's biofuel plans revolve around using sugarcane for bioethanol and jatropha for biodiesel production. This study, taking the southern Indian state of Karnataka as an example, aims at estimating the potential to achieve policy targets. The study spatially analyses land-use change owing to biofuel expansion and its effects on food production. We used an integrated modelling framework to simulate land-use change and bioenergy production under two scenarios - Industrial Economy (IE) and Agricultural Economy (AE). Results indicate that meeting the 20% blending target is a challenging goal to achieve under both scenarios. Bioethanol requirements can be nearly fulfilled (88% under IE and 93% under AE) because of sugarcane expansion. However, biodiesel demands cannot be fulfilled using only degraded lands as currently planned in India, but additional agricultural land (3-4% of the total cropland) will be required for jatrophabased biodiesel production. Food production will not be directly impacted until 2025, because the largest source of additional land could be short- and long-term fallows. We conclude that conservation oriented initiatives, such as water harvesting and energy conservation measures can increase productivities of biofuel crops and reduce fuel demands, respectively. State support and Clean Development Mechanism opportunities can enhance economic incentives for energy cropping. Therefore, a simultaneous and multipronged approach is needed to accommodate food and fuel demands in India. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study dynamically monitors ecosystem performance (EP) to identify grasslands potentially suitable for cellulosic feedstock crops (e.g., switchgrass) within the Greater Platte River Basin (GPRB). We computed grassland site potential and EP anomalies using 9-year (2000-2008) time series of 250 m expedited moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data, geophysical and biophysical data, weather and climate data, and EP models. We hypothesize that areas with fairly consistent high grassland productivity (i.e., high grassland site potential) in fair to good range condition (i.e., persistent ecosystem overperformance or normal performance, indicating a lack of severe ecological disturbance) are potentially suitable for cellulosic feedstock crop development. Unproductive (i.e., low grassland site potential) or degraded grasslands (i.e., persistent ecosystem underperformance with poor range condition) are not appropriate for cellulosic feedstock development. Grassland pixels with high or moderate ecosystem site potential and with more than 7 years ecosyste normal performance or overperformance during 2000-2008 are identified as possible regions for future cellulosic feedstock crop development (ca. 68 000 km2 within the GPRB, mostly in the eastern areas). Long-term climate conditions, elevation, soil organic carbon, and yearly seasonal precipitation and temperature are important performance variables to determine the suitable areas in this study. The final map delineating the suitable areas within the GPRB provides a new monitoring and modeling approach that can contribute to decision support tools to help land managers and decision makers make optimal land use decisions regarding cellulosic feedstock crop development and sustainability. © 2011 USGS.

AB  - Growing second-generation energy crops on marginal land is conceptualized as one of the primary means of future bioenergy development. However, the extent to which marginal land can support energy crop production remains unclear. The Loess Plateau of China, one of the most seriously eroded regions of the world, is particularly rich in marginal land. On the basis of the previous field experiment of planting Miscanthus species in Qingyang of the Gansu Province, herein, we estimated the yield potential of Miscanthus lutarioriparius, the species with the highest biomass, across the Loess Plateau. On the basis of the radiation model previously developed from Miscanthus field trials, annual precipitation was introduced as an additional variable for yield estimate in the semiarid and semihumid regions of the Loess Plateau. Of 62 million hectares (Mha) of the Loess Plateau, our model estimated that 48.7 Mha can potentially support Miscanthus growth, with the average yield of 17.8 t ha-1 yr-1. After excluding high-quality cropland and pasture and land suitable for afforestation, a total of 33.3 Mha of presumably marginal land were left available for producing the energy crop at the average yield of 16.8 t ha-1 yr-1 and the total annual yield of 0.56 billion tons. The analysis of environmental factors indicated that erosion, aridity, and field steepness were the primary contributors to the poor quality of the marginal land. The change of land uses from traditional agriculture to energy crop production may prevent further erosion and land degradation and consequently establish a sustainable economy for the region. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A survey of Irish farmers was conducted to identify farmers' opinions on energy crop production and to characterize potential adopters of energy crop cultivation in Ireland. One hundred and seventy-two surveys were completed from 25 counties in Ireland. Miscanthus (48%) and grass (30%) were the preferred crops for adoption of energy crop production. Potential adopters described themselves as having a significantly greater level of knowledge of energy crop production compared with other respondents. The results indicate that lack of interest in adopting energy crop production may be due to lack of knowledge regarding the economic benefits of adoption and the variety of energy crops available for cultivation in Ireland. The establishment of long-term contracts and government schemes were identified as important requirements for the development of bioenergy crop production in Ireland. Energy crop adoption was not limited to farmers undertaking specific farm enterprises. Farmers were motivated to adopt energy crop production for both economic and environmental benefits. These results are the first to provide valuable information on the perspectives of potential adopters of bioenergy crop production in Ireland for the promotion and implementation of a national bioenergy industry. Policy requirements and outreach strategies to encourage adoption of energy crops by agricultural producers are suggested. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - As the global demand for food continues to increase, the displacement of food production by using agricultural land for carbon mitigation, via either carbon sequestration, bioenergy or biofuel is a concern. An alternative approach is to target abandoned salinized farmland for mitigation purposes. Australia, for example, has 17 million ha of farmland that is already or could become saline. At a representative, salinized, low rainfall (350 mm yr-1) site at Wickepin, Western Australia, we demonstrate that afforestation can mitigate carbon emissions through either providing a feedstock for bioenergy or second generation biofuel production and produce salt-tolerant fodder for livestock. A range of factors markedly affect this mitigation. These include hydrological conditions such as salinity, site factors such as slope position and soil properties and a range of silvicultural factors such as species, planting density and age of the planting. High density (2000 stems ha-1) plantings of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl. produced a mean total biomass of 4.6 t ha-1 yr-1 (8.5 t CO2-e ha-1 yr-1) averaged over 8 years. Atriplex nummularia Lindl. produced a mean total biomass of 3.8 t ha-1 yr-1 (6.9 t CO2-e ha-1 yr-1) averaged over 4 years and approximately 1.9 t ha-1 yr-1 of edible dry matter annually to 8 years of age. With differences in salt tolerance between E. occidentalis and A. nummularia, we propose an integrated approach to treating salinized sites that takes salinity gradients into account, replicates natural wetland ecosystems and produces both fodder and biomass. Continued mitigation is expected as the stands mature, assuming that growth is not affected by the accumulation of salt in the soil profile. Such carbon mitigation could potentially be applied to salinized farmland globally, and this could thus represent a major contribution to global carbon mitigation without competing with food production. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We present an approach for providing quantitative insight into the production-ecological sustainability of biofuel feedstock production systems. The approach is based on a simple crop-soil model and was used for assessing feedstock from current and improved production systems of cassava for bioethanol. Assessments were performed for a study area in Mozambique, a country considered promising for biomass production. Our focus is on the potential role of smallholders in the production of feedstock for biofuels. We take cassava as the crop for this purpose and compare it with feedstock production on plantations using sugarcane, sweet sorghum and cassava as benchmarks. Production-ecological sustainability was defined by seven indicators related to resource-use efficiency, soil quality, net energy production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Results indicate that of the assessed systems, sugarcane performed better than cassava, although it requires substantial water for irrigation. Targeted use of nutrient inputs improved sustainability of smallholder cassava. Cassava production systems on more fertile soils were more sustainable than those on less fertile soils; the latter required more external inputs for achieving the same output, affecting most indicators negatively and reducing the feasibility for smallholders. Cassava and sweet sorghum performed similarly. Cassava production requires much more labour per hectare than production of sugarcane or sweet sorghum. Production of bioethanol feedstock on cultivated lands was more sustainable and had potential for carbon sequestration, avoiding GHG emissions from clearing natural vegetation if new land is opened. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Current Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) models indicate that crop-based biofuels generate greenhouse gas savings, compared with fossil fuels. We argue that they do so only because they ignore the emissions of CO2 from vehicles burning the biofuels without determining if the biomass is "additional," and because they underestimate the ultimate emissions of N2O from nitrogen fertiliser use. Taking proper account of these factors would result in very different findings. It would be far better to derive biofuels from biomass, from waste feedstocks or highyielding bioenergy crops with low nitrogen demand, grown on currently unproductive land. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Accounting for bioenergy's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as done under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme, fails to capture the full extent of these emissions. As a consequence, other approaches have been suggested. Both the EU and United States already use value-chain approaches to determine emissions due to biofuels - an approach quite different from that of the KP. Further, both the EU and United States are engaged in consultation processes to determine how emissions connected with use of biomass for heat and power will be handled under regulatory systems. The United States is considering whether CO2 emissions from biomass should be handled like fossil fuels. In this context, this article reviews and evaluates the three basic bioenergy accounting options. 1 CO2 emissions from bioenergy are not counted at the point of combustion. Instead emissions due to use of biomass are accounted for in the land-use sector as carbon stock losses - a combustion factor (CoF) = 0 approach; 2 CO2 emissions from bioenergy are accounted for in the energy sector - a CoF = 1 approach; and 3 End users account for all or a specified subset of CO2 emissions, regardless of where geographically these emissions occur - 0 &lt; CoF &lt; 1. Following short descriptions of the basic options, this article discusses variations to these options and uses numerical examples to illustrate the impacts of approaches at a local and international level. Finally, the alternative accounting systems are evaluated against general criteria and for impacts on selected stakeholder goals. General criteria considered are: (a) comprehensiveness, (b) simplicity, and (c) scale independence. Stakeholder goals reviewed are: (a) stimulation of rural economies, (b) food security, (c) GHG reductions, and (d) preservation of forests. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sewage sludge is rich in essential plant nutrients, but its use is restricted for crop production due to the pollutants it contains, such as metalloids and heavy metals. Sludge is also very sticky and compact. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to evaluate (1) the impact of various amounts of sludge on bioenergy crop productivity and quality and (2) the use of peat as an adjuvant to reduce the stickiness, density and nutrient richness of the sludge. Three different applications of sludge were examined, high, low (50% of high) and low mixed with an equal volume of peat. The sludge-peat mix increased significantly leaf area and biomass accumulation of maize and hemp. High sludge and sludge-peat mix applications increased significantly the leaf area and biomass accumulation as well as the net photosynthesis of oilseed rape. High sludge application resulted in the highest heavy metal and metalloid accumulation in maize and hemp. Sludge-peat mix resulted in the highest heavy metal and metalloid accumulation in oilseed rape. However, the sludge-peat mix application provided the best feedstock quality in all three crops, since chloride, silicon and sulfur concentrations and ash content in plant material were the lowest of the three sludge treatments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Features of regional specialization of agriculture are analyzed. Calculations of the coefficient of localization of the main crops support the conclusion regarding relative stability of regions with specialized agriculture in the United States and France. Regional specialization of agriculture has reached its optimum in these countries and its changes are mostly the result of biofuel production growth. In Brazil which owns vast uncultivated land resources and is expanding on the world markets, the regions with specialized agriculture are the most mobile ones.

AB  - In the context of energy security, rural development and climate change, India actively promotes the cultivation of Jatropha curcas, a biodiesel feedstock which has been identified as suitable for achieving the Indian target of 20 biofuel blending by 2017. In this paper, we present results concerning the range of environmental impacts of different Jatropha curcas cultivation systems. Moreover, nine agronomic trials in Andhra Pradesh are analysed, in which the yield was measured as a function of different inputs such as water, fertilizer, pesticides, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Further, the environmental impact of the whole Jatropha curcas biodiesel value chain is benchmarked with fossil diesel, following the ISO 14040/44 life cycle assessment procedure. Overall, this study shows that the use of Jatropha curcas biodiesel generally reduces the global warming potential and the nonrenewable energy demand as compared to fossil diesel. On the other hand, the environmental impacts on acidification, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, and water depletion all showed increases. Key for reducing the environmental impact of Jatropha curcas biodiesel is the resource efficiency during crop cultivation (especially mineral fertilizer application) and the optimal site selection of the Jatropha curcas plantations. © 2012 Simon Gmünder et al.

AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was designed in which fuel is generated in the cell by the enzyme glucoamylase, which is displayed on the surface of yeast. The enzyme digests starch specifically into monomeric glucose units and as a consequence enables further glucose oxidation by microorganisms present in the MFC anode. The oxidative enzyme glucose oxidase was coupled to the glucoamylase digestive enzyme. When both enzymes were displayed on the surface of yeast cells in a mixed culture, superior fuel-cell performance was observed in comparison with other combinations of yeast cells, unmodified yeast, or pure enzymes. The feasibility of the use of the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca in such a genetically modified MFC was also demonstrated. Herein, we report the performance of such fuel cells as a proof of concept for the enzymatic digestion of complex organic fuels in the anode of MFCs to render the fuel more available to microorganisms.

AB  - The utilization of solid recovered fuels (SRF) for energy recovery has been increasing steadily in recent years, and this development is set to continue. In order to use SRF efficiently, it is necessary to define quality standards and introduce targeted quality assurance measures. SRF can be used both in mono-incineration and in co-incineration systems, for instance in power generation and cement plants; but as quality requirements differ, it is necessary to unambiguously define the term ‘solid recovered fuel’. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the origin, development and the current status of quality assurance for SRF. The basic principles of quality assurance for SRF are explained with reference to the development of the German RAL Quality Assurance System and in addition specifications that have emerged from European standardization work of CEN/TC 343 are analysed. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

AB  - Bioenergy from crops is expected to make a considerable contribution to climate change mitigation. However, bioenergy is not necessarily carbon neutral because emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 during crop production may reduce or completely counterbalance CO2 savings of the substituted fossil fuels. These greenhouse gases (GHGs) need to be included into the carbon footprint calculation of different bioenergy crops under a range of soil conditions and management practices. This review compiles existing knowledge on agronomic and environmental constraints and GHG balances of the major European bioenergy crops, although it focuses on dedicated perennial crops such as Miscanthus and short rotation coppice species. Such second-generation crops account for only 3% of the current European bioenergy production, but field data suggest they emit 40% to &gt;99% less N2O than conventional annual crops. This is a result of lower fertilizer requirements as well as a higher N-use efficiency, due to effective N-recycling. Perennial energy crops have the potential to sequester additional carbon in soil biomass if established on former cropland (0.44 Mg soil C ha-1 yr-1 for poplar and willow and 0.66 Mg soil C ha-1 yr-1 for Miscanthus). However, there was no positive or even negative effects on the C balance if energy crops are established on former grassland. Increased bioenergy production may also result in direct and indirect land-use changes with potential high C losses when native vegetation is converted to annual crops. Although dedicated perennial energy crops have a high potential to improve the GHG balance of bioenergy production, several agronomic and economic constraints still have to be overcome. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biomass in combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies is one of few options that makes an actual reduction of global CO2 concentration in the atmosphere possible and is likely to be required to meet low atmospheric concentration of CO2. This study shows the global potential for combining biomass with CCS technologies (bio-CCS) up to 2030 and 2050. The assessment includes six bio-CCS routes for the production of power and biofuels in combination with CCS. For these routes we have analysed the technical and economic potential. The results show the global technical potential for bio-CCS technologies is large and, if deployed, can result in negative greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) up to 10.4Gt CO2 eq. on an annual basis in 2050. This is a large reduction potential compared to the global energy-related CO2 emissions which grew to 30.6Gt CO2 in 2010. The economic potential reaches up to 3.5Gt of negative GHG emissions when assuming a CO2 price of 50€/tonne. Next to quantitative estimates of these potentials in the form of global cost supply curves, we present recommendations to overcome possible barriers and enhance drivers to stimulate the deployment of bio-CCS technologies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel is a fast growing sector in Tanzania. Foreign and domestic companies are acquiring big portions of land, some up to 440,000 hectares. It is believed that the country has a reserve of 88 million hectares for agriculture. The government is committed to promoting the sector. But what are the implications of biofuel plantations for rural development in Tanzania? This is an area of inquiry which has not received adequate attention. The main objective of the study was to investigate whether biofuel plantations will have any significant impact on rural development in Tanzania, using the case of Rufiji District. The choice of the district was fourfold. One, it has a considerable number of potential biofuel investors. Two, a high proportion of the investors intend to use the vertical integration model of production, processing and marketing. Three, the district is dominated by smallholder farmers, who are poor with chronic food insecurity. Four, Rufiji district is rich in biodiversity and natural resources. The findings from this study will reflect the likely impact of biofuel plantations on rural development as the selected district represents the characteristics of many rural areas of Tanzania. A total of 161 respondents were selected randomly for interview. There were also consultations with village governments, non-government organisations, policy makers and researchers. The findings show both high expectations and concerns. The respondents anticipate benefiting from employment, income-generating opportunities, access to markets for crops, and improved social services. More men than female respondents are hoping to become out-growers. However, male respondents in particular were concerned about land grabbing while for women it was about food security, water use conflicts and whether they will be able to access clean energy. The lack of a biofuel policy and legal framework as well as poor rural infrastructure may undermine the realisation of biofuel benefits. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Despite the significant growth in the number of published life-cycle assessments of biofuels, important aspects have not captured sufficient attention, namely soil carbon emissions from land use change (LUC) and uncertainty analysis. The main goal of this article is to evaluate the implications of different LUC scenarios and uncertainty in the life-cycle energy renewability efficiency and GHG (greenhouse gases) intensity of wheat-based bioethanol replacing gasoline. A comprehensive assessment of different LUC scenarios (grassland or cropland converted to wheat cultivation) and agricultural practices is conducted, which results in different carbon stock change values. The types of uncertainty addressed include parameter uncertainty (propagated into LC (life-cycle) results using Monte-Carlo simulation) and uncertainty concerning how bioethanol co-product credits are accounted for. Results show that GHG emissions have considerably higher uncertainty than energy efficiency values, mainly due to soil carbon emissions from direct LUC and N2O release from cultivated soil. Moreover, LUC dominates the GHG intensity of bioethanol. Very different GHG emissions are calculated depending on the LUC scenario considered. Conversion of full- or low-tillage croplands to wheat cultivation results in bioethanol GHG emissions lower than gasoline emissions, whereas conversion of grassland does not contribute to bioethanol GHG savings over gasoline in the short- to mid-term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a great need to provide energy to rural Africans in order to spark development and help to alleviate poverty. Although . Jatropha curcas L. is no longer considered to be a miracle crop, and large scale Jatropha biofuel programs have struggled, Jatropha still has potential to be successfully used in small scale development projects. To this end, there has been a great deal of interest in Jatropha and studies have shown the potential of Jatropha to be used with multifunctional platforms (MFPs) to provide energy to rural sub-Saharan Africa. This is a review paper which examines research on the various aspects of using Jatropha and MFPs to provide energy to rural Africans. Neat Jatropha can be used as a fuel for the type of simple diesel engines used in MFPs. Jatropha oil can also be converted to biodiesel through esterification and/or transesterification. The Jatropha plant can be used in many other ways and its utility increases the value it can bring to a village. There are challenges to increase the use of Jatropha, and among the greater difficulties are land issues (a Jatropha plantation to provide enough oil to power an MFP for a rural village would probably require about 8 ha after 5 years of growth). Despite the challenges, Jatropha has been successfully used in some development projects and merits further research. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The major cooking fuels in Nigeria, which are fuel wood and kerosene, face supply difficulties, price instabilities, safety, health and environmental challenges. In response to these challenges, the Federal Government of Nigeria recently announced the partial replacement of these cooking fuels with bio-ethanol produced from cassava in a project called 'cassakero'. The project involves the installation of 10,000 micro-scale bio-refineries across the country with a combined capacity of 4millionliters per day. The project includes the establishment of a 400,000ha cassava farm to supply cassava feedstock to the ethanol refineries. Though the detailed design of the project is not yet available, the aim of this paper is to appraise the project with the aim of highlighting the benefits of the project for enhancement while emphasizing the potential negative impacts for mitigation. The results of the appraisal revealed that the project will be beneficial in terms of job creation, boost rural agriculture, conserve forest from fuel wood exploitation, alleviate poverty and prevent indoor pollution. The impact of the project on greenhouse gas emission is ambiguous. While the shift to ethanol cooking fuel will release less CO2 comparatively, the conversion of 400,000ha of forest to cassava farm, the use of fossil fuel for processing cassava tubers to ethanol, fermentation of cassava starch and the use of agro-chemicals will release CO2 as well. Other potential negative impacts of the project include large input of water and energy and the production of large volume of waste stream, which need to be handled. There is a potential food versus fuel conflict, especially if the current production of cassava is not scaled up to meet the several emerging projects in Nigeria requiring cassava feedstock. © 2012 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The last 10 years have seen tremendous expansion in biofuels production, particularly in corn ethanol in the United States, at the same time that commodity prices (e. g., corn) have experienced significant spikes. While supporters claim that biofuels are renewable and carbon-friendly, concerns have been raised about their impacts on land use and food prices. This paper analyzes how US crop prices have responded to shocks in acreage supply; these shocks can be thought of as a shock to the residual supply of corn for food. Using a structural vector auto-regression framework, we examine shocks to a crop's own acreage and to total cropland. This allows us to estimate the effect of dedicating cropland or non-crop farmlands to biofuels feedstock production. A negative shock in own acreage leads to an increase in price for soybeans and corn. Our calculations show that increased corn ethanol production during the boom production year 2006/2007 explains approximately 27% of the experienced corn price rise. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This review addresses the main issues concerning anticipated demands for the use of land for food and for bioenergy. It should be possible to meet increasing demands for food using existing and new technologies although this may not be easily or cheaply accomplished. The alleviation of hunger depends on food accessibility as well as food availability. Modern civilizations also require energy. This article presents the vision for bioenergy in terms of four major gains for society: a reduction in C emissions from the substitution of fossil fuels with appropriate energy crops; a significant contribution to energy security by reductions in fossil fuel dependence, for example, to meet government targets; new options that stimulate rural and urban economic development, and reduced dependence of global agriculture on fossil fuels. This vision is likely to be best fulfilled by the use of dedicated perennial bioenergy crops. We outline a number of factors that need to be taken into account in estimating the land area available for bioenergy. In terms of provisioning services, the value of biofuels is estimated at $54.7-$330 bn per year at a crude oil price of $100 per barrel. In terms of regulatory services, the value of carbon emissions saved is estimated at $56-$218 bn at a carbon price of $40 per tonne. Although global government subsidies for biofuels have been estimated at $20 bn (IEA, 2010b), these are dwarfed by subsidies for fossil fuel consumption ($312 bn; IEA, 2010b) and by total agricultural support for food and commodity crops ($383.7 bn in 2009; OECD, 2010). © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Federal land managers are faced with the task of balancing multiple uses and goals when making decisions about land use and the activities that occur on public lands. Though climate change is now well recognized by federal agencies and their local land and resource managers, it is not yet clear how issues related to climate change will be incorporated into on-the-ground decision making within the framework of multiple use objectives. We conducted a case study of a federal land management agency field office, the San Juan Public Lands Center in Durango, CO, U.S.A., to understand from their perspective how decisions are currently made, and how climate change and carbon management are being factored into decision making. We evaluated three major management sectors in which climate change or carbon management may intersect other use goals: forests, biofuels, and grazing. While land managers are aware of climate change and eager to understand more about how it might affect land resources, the incorporation of climate change considerations into everyday decision making is currently quite limited. Climate change is therefore on the radar screen, but remains a lower priority than other issues. To assist the office in making decisions that are based on sound scientific information, further research is needed into how management activities influence carbon storage and resilience of the landscape under climate change. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Decrease of fossil fuel consumption in the energy sector is an important step towards more sustainable energy production. Environmental impacts related to potential future energy systems in Denmark with high shares of wind and biomass energy were evaluated using life-cycle assessment (LCA). Based on the reference year 2008, energy scenarios for 2030 and 2050 were assessed. For 2050 three alternatives for supply of transport fuels were considered: (1) fossil fuels, (2) rapeseed based biodiesel, and (3) Fischer-Tropsch based biodiesel. Overall, the results showed that greenhouse gas emissions per PJ energy supplied could be significantly reduced (from 68 to 17 Gg CO2-eq/PJ) by increased use of wind and residual biomass resources as well as by electrifying the transport sector. Energy crops for production of biofuels and the use of these biofuels for heavy terrestrial transportation were responsible for most environmental impacts in the 2050 scenarios, in particular upstream impacts from land use changes (LUCs), fertilizer use and NOx emissions from the transport sector were critical. Land occupation (including LUC effects) caused by energy crop production increased to a range of 600-2100×106m2/PJ depending on the amounts and types of energy crops introduced. Use of fossil diesel in the transport sector appeared to be environmentally preferable over biodiesel for acidification, aquatic eutrophication and land occupation. For global warming, biodiesel production via Fischer-Tropsch was comparable with fossil diesel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The heteropolyacid H3PW12O40 has been used as a catalyst for the production of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), a viable liquid biofuel, from fructose, sucrose, and inulin. An EMF yield of 65% can be obtained from fructose within 30min at 130°C in ethanol under microwave heating. The introduction of tetrahydrofuran as a co-solvent improved the yield of EMF to 76%. Longer reaction time, higher reaction temperature and higher catalyst amount lead to the decomposition of EMF to ethyl levulinate. The fructose moieties in sucrose and inulin are converted to EMF selectively. However, glucose moieties cannot be converted to EMF by this heteropolyacid catalyst. Instead ethyl glucoside is formed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the indirect energy-use emission implications of increases in the use of biofuels in the USA between 2001 and 2010 as mandates within a dynamic global computable general equilibrium model. The study incorporates explicit markets for biofuels, petroleum and other fossil fuels, and accounts for interactions among all sectors of an 18-region global economy. It considers bilateral trade, as well as the dynamics of capital allocation and investment. Simulation results show that the biofuel mandates in the USA generate an overall reduction in global energy use and emissions over the simulation period from 2001 to 2030. Consequently, the indirect energy-use emission change or emission leakage under the mandate is negative. That is, global emission reductions are larger than the direct emission savings from replacing petroleum with biofuels under the USA RFS2 over the last decade. Under our principal scenario this enhanced the direct emission reduction from biofuels by about 66%. The global change in lifecycle energy-use emissions for this scenario was estimated to be about -93. million tons of CO2e in 2010, -45. million tons of CO2e in 2020, and an increase of 5. million tons of CO2e in 2030, relative to the baseline scenario. Sensitivity results of six alternative scenarios provided additional insights into the pattern of the regional and global effects of biofuel mandates on energy-use emissions. © 2012.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy and expected shortage in the medium term, solicit innovative energy strategies to fulfill the increasing gap between demand-supply. For this purpose it is important to evaluate the potential supply of the energy crops and finding the areas of EU where it is most convenient. This paper proposes an agro-energy supply chain approach to planning the biofuel supply chain at a regional level. The proposed methodology is the result of an interdisciplinary team work and is aimed to evaluate the potential supply of land for the energy production and the efficiency of the processing plants considering simultaneously economic, energy and environmental targets. The crop simulation, on the basis of this approach, takes into account environmental and agricultural variables (soil, climate, crop, agronomic technique) that affect yields, energy and economic costs of the agricultural phase. The use of the Dijkstra's algorithm allows minimizing the biomass transport path from farm to collecting points and the processing plant, to reduce both the transport cost and the energy consumption. Finally, a global sustainability index (ACSI, Agro-energy Chain Sustainability Index) is computed combining economic, energy and environmental aspects to evaluate the sustainability of the Agro-energy supply chain (AESC) on the territory. The empirical part consists in a pilot study applied to the whole plain of Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) a region situated in the North-Eastern part of Italy covering about 161,300 ha. The simulation has been applied to the maize cultivation using three different technologies (different levels of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization: low, medium and high input). The higher input technologies allow to achieve higher crop yields, but affect negatively both the economic and energy balances. Low input levels provides, on the average, the most favourable energy and economic balances. ACSI indicates that low inputs levels ensure a more widespread sustainability of the agro-energy chain in the region. High ACSI values for high input levels are observed only for areas with very high yields or near the processing plant. © F. Ginaldi et al., 2012 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.

AB  - Some microalgae are particularly attractive as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production due to their rapid growth, high content of triacylglycerols, and ability to be grown on non-arable land. Unfortunately, obtaining oil from algae is currently cost prohibitive in part due to the need to pump and process large volumes of dilute algal suspensions. In an effort to circumvent this problem, we have explored the use of anion exchange resins for simplifying the processing of algae to biofuel. Anion exchange resins can bind and accumulate the algal cells out of suspension to form a dewatered concentrate. Treatment of the resin-bound algae with sulfuric acid/methanol elutes the algae and regenerates the resin while converting algal lipids to biodiesel. Hydrophobic polymers can remove biodiesel from the sulfuric acid/methanol, allowing the transesterification reagent to be reused. We show that in situ transesterification of algal lipids can efficiently convert algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters while allowing the resin and transesterification reagent to be recycled numerous times without loss of effectiveness. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - Current research on the environmental sustainability of bioenergy has largely focused on the potential of bioenergy crops to sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and possible impacts on water quality and quantity. A key assumption in these studies is that bioenergy crops will be grown in a manner similar to current agricultural crops such as corn and hence would affect the environment similarly. In this study, we investigate an alternative cropping system where bioenergy crops are grown in buffer strips adjacent to current agricultural crops such that nutrients present in runoff and leachate from the traditional row-crops are reused by the bioenergy crops (switchgrass, miscanthus and native prairie grasses) in the buffer strips, thus providing environmental services and meeting economic needs of farmers. The process-based biogeochemical model Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) was used to simulate crop yield, nitrous oxide production and nitrate concentrations in leachate for a typical agricultural field in Illinois. Model parameters have been developed for the first time for miscanthus and switchgrass in DNDC. Results from model simulations indicated that growing bioenergy crops in buffer strips mitigated nutrient runoff, reduced nitrate concentrations in leachate by 60-70% and resulted in a reduction of 50-90% in nitrous oxide emissions compared with traditional cropping systems. While all the bioenergy crop buffers had significant positive environmental benefits, switchgrass performed the best with respect to minimizing nutrient runoff and nitrous oxide emissions, while miscanthus had the highest yield. Overall, our model results indicated that the bioenergy crops grown in these buffer strips achieved yields that are comparable to those obtained for traditional agricultural systems while simultaneously providing environmental services and could be used to design sustainable agricultural landscapes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the role of changes in the fuel mix on emissions reduction and the diversification of risks associated to rising prices of energy. To this purpose we evaluate the average cost and the cost volatility of alternative fuel combinations in the road transport sector by means of the Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory. The results suggest big gains in diversification of risks and emissions reduction associated with shifts away the current fuel mix, which is more than 90% concentrated worldwide in fossil fuels. Those shifts are discussed vis à vis the policy recommendations of the International Energy Agency on fuel use in the transport sector, and both the business as usual and the low carbon scenarios of the European Commission. In particular, shifting toward an efficient system would involve optimizing the use of biofuels (mostly from endogenous feedstock), with second generation biofuels taking the lead in the long-run, and this combined with electricity from clean sources. This scenario would mean reducing cost volatility by more than 50% as well as CO2 emissions by more than 30% in the long-run. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae represent a promising target for the generation of bioenergy through slow pyrolysis, leading to the production of biochar. This study reports experiments conducted on the production of freshwater and saltwater macroalgal biochar in pilot-scale quantities, the physical and chemical characteristics of the biochars, and their impact on plant growth. The biochars are low in carbon (C) content, surface area and cation exchange capacity, while being high in ash and nutrients. Trace element analysis demonstrates that macroalgal biochar produced from unpolluted water does not contain toxic trace elements in excess of levels mandated for unrestricted use as a biosolids amendment to soils. Pot trials conducted using a C and nutrient-poor soil, without and with additional fertilizer, demonstrate dramatic increases between 15 and 32 times, respectively, in plant growth rate for biochar treatments compared with the no biochar controls, with additional smaller increases when fertilizer was added. Pot trials conducted using a relatively fertile agricultural soil showed smaller but significant impacts of biochar amendment over the controls. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - C4 perennial grasses are being considered as environmentally and economically sustainable high yielding bioenergy feedstocks. Temporal and spatial variation in yield across the conterminious United States is uncertain due to the limited number of field trials. Here, we use a semi-mechanistic dynamic crop growth and production model to explore the potential of Miscanthus × giganteus (Greef et. Deu.) and Panicum virgatum L. across the conterminous United States. By running the model for 32 years (1979-2010), we were able to estimate dry biomass production and stability. The maximum rainfed simulated end-of-growth-season harvestable biomass for M. × giganteus was ca. 40 Mg ha-1 and ca. 20 Mg ha-1 for P. virgatum. In addition, regions of the southeastern United States were identified as promising due to their high potential production and stability and their relative advantage when compared with county-level maize biomass production. Regional and temporal variation was most strongly influenced by precipitation and soil water holding capacity. Miscanthus 9 giganteus was on average 2.2 times more productive than P. virgatum for locations where yields were ≥10 Mg ha-1. The predictive ability of the model for P. virgatum was tested with 30 previously published studies covering the eastern half of the United States and resulted in an index of agreement of 0.71 and a mean bias of only -0.62 Mg ha-1 showing that, on average, the model tended to only slightly overestimate productivity. This study provides with potential production and variability which can be used for regional assessment of the suitability of dedicated bioenergy crops. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study presents a second-order energy return on investment analysis to evaluate the mutual benefits of combining an advanced wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (with biological nutrient removal) with algal biofuel production. With conventional, independently operated systems, algae production requires significant material inputs, which require energy directly and indirectly, and the WWTP requires significant energy inputs for treatment of the waste streams. The second-order energy return on investment values for independent operation of the WWTP and the algal biofuels production facility were determined to be 0.37 and 0.42, respectively. By combining the two, energy inputs can be reduced significantly. Consequently, the integrated system can outperform the isolated system, yielding a second-order energy return on investment of 1.44. Combining these systems transforms two energy sinks to a collective (second-order) energy source. However, these results do not include capital, labor, and other required expenses, suggesting that profitable deployment will be challenging.

AB  - As a key actor behind the emerging global biofuels market, the European Union has introduced environmental regulations governing such products. This article analyses the biofuels 'meta-standard' certification scheme which creates a transnational governance regime involving a regional bloc including States, non-governmental organisations and businesses in a hybrid regulatory model combining elements of private certification and public authority. A comparison of the role of Designated Operational Entities in the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the certification schemes in the EU sustainability regulatory regime demonstrates that the problems that threaten the environmental integrity of the CDM are less likely to emerge in the EU biofuels context. copy; The Author 2011.

AB  - The first replicated productivity trials of the C4 perennial grass Miscanthus × giganteus in the United States showed this emerging ligno-cellulosic bioenergy feedstock to provide remarkably high annual yields. This covered the 5 years after planting, leaving it uncertain if this high productivity could be maintained in the absence of N fertilization. An expected, but until now unsubstantiated, benefit of both species was investment in roots and perennating rhizomes. This study examines for years 5-7 yields, biomass, C and N in shoots, roots, and rhizomes. The mean peak shoot biomass for M. × giganteus in years 5-7 was 46.5 t ha-1 in October, declining to 38.1 t ha-1 on completion of senescence and at harvest in December, and 20.7 t ha-1 declining to 11.3 t ha-1 for Panicum virgatum. There was no evidence of decline in annual yield with age. Mean rhizome biomass was significantly higher in M. × giganteus at 21.5 t ha-1 compared to 7.2 t ha-1 for P. virgatum, whereas root biomass was similar at 5.6-5.9 t ha-1. M. × giganteus shoots contained 339 kg ha-1 N in August, declining to 193 kg ha-1 in December, compared to 168 and 58 kg ha-1 for P. virgatum. The results suggest substantial remobilization of N to roots and rhizomes, yet still a substantial loss with December harvests. The shoot and rhizome biomass increase of 33.6 t ha-1 during the 2-month period between June and August for M. × giganteus corresponds to a solar energy conversion of 4.4% of solar energy into biomass, one of the highest recorded and confirming the remarkable productivity potential of this plant. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Structural changes of land use are one of the hottest research fields among the regional environmental changes. Even so, there are few empirical studies touching the structural changes of land use by considering both the geophysical and socioeconomic influencing factors. This study is to build a computable general equilibrium of land-use changes (CGELUC) model to simulate the structural changes of land use in Jiangxi Province during 2010- 2020 under four designed scenarios based on a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The simulation results show that the areas of cultivated land, water area, and unused land will decline, while forest cover, grassland, and built-up area of Jiangxi Province will expand between 2010 and 2020 under the baseline scenario. Comparatively, the subsidy for returning cultivated land inhibits the expansion of grassland of Jiangxi Province. The agricultural subsidy policy plays a positive role in conserving cultivated land and expanding the grassland cover at the cost of shrinking the forest cover, water area, and unused land. Additionally, the policies of subsidy for production of biofuel crops and timber positively promote the forest conservation and the shrinkage of water area and unused land. The scenario-based analysis results indicate that the performance of the policies affecting changes of land- use structures may vary over time.

AB  - Accelerating biofuel production has been promoted as an opportunity to enhance energy security, offset greenhouse-gas emissions and support rural economies. However, large uncertainties remain in the impacts of biofuels on air quality and climate 1,2. Sugar-cane ethanol is one of the most widely used biofuels, and Brazil is its largest producer. Here we use a life-cycle approach to produce spatially and temporally explicit estimates of air-pollutant emissions over the whole life cycle of sugar-cane ethanol in Brazil. We show that even in regions where pre-harvest field burning has been eliminated on half the croplands, regional emissions of air pollutants continue to increase owing to the expansion of sugar-cane growing areas, and burning continues to be the dominant life-cycle stage for emissions. Comparison of our estimates of burning-phase emissions with satellite estimates of burning in São Paulo state suggests that sugar-cane field burning is not fully accounted for in satellite-based inventories, owing to the small spatial scale of individual fires. Accounting for this effect leads to revised regional estimates of burned area that are four times greater than some previous estimates. Our revised emissions maps thus suggest that biofuels may have larger impacts on regional climate forcing and human health than previously thought. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Dual-injection strategies in spark-ignition (SI) engines allow the in-cylinder blending of two different fuels at any blend ratio, when simultaneously combining port fuel injection (PFI) and direct-injection (DI). This offers increased flexibility and the potential to optimize the combustion process depending on the engine requirement and fuel availability. Until now, little or no research evidence exists on the experimental comparison of dual-injection to DI in the combustion of gasoline-biofuel blends. Therefore, in this work the authors evaluate this comparison using a new biofuel candidate: 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). The differences in performance are examined using D25 (25% DMF in gasoline, by volume) in a single cylinder SI research engine operating at 1500. rpm and varying load (3.5-8.5. bar IMEP). All tests were carried out at stoichiometry (λ= 1) using the cross-over theory of the carbon monoxide and oxygen emissions concentrations. The current results are promising for dual-injection. The improved mixture preparation compared to DI results in lower combustion durations and higher in-cylinder pressures. This gives rise to higher indicated thermal efficiencies and lower fuel consumption rates compared to the same blend (D25) in DI (up to 4% and 3.2%, respectively). More significantly, the lower fuel consumption rate with dual-injection (on a volumetric basis), is up to 1.2% lower than with gasoline in homogenous DI (GDI) up to 8. bar IMEP, despite the use of a lower energy density biofuel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study assesses the future impacts of biofuel production from the world's major biofuel producers (the US, Brazil and the EU) over the next decade on global markets and the resulting spatial implications on income distribution and agricultural production in China. Rising global commodity prices arising from either positive market conditions for biofuels or government mandates on biofuel production levels, are transmitted, albeit imperfectly, into China's domestic food economy. For those crops that are being used for feedstocks internationally (maize) or are close substitutes for feedstocks (soybeans), production rises sharply. Imports also fall significantly. Such dynamics help China to realize its self-sufficiency goals more fully. Another unintended benefit of the increase in global biofuel use is the impact on Chinese income distribution.

AB  - Oil-accumulating microalgae have the potential to enable large-scale biodiesel production without competing for arable land or biodiverse natural landscapes. High lipid productivity of dominant, fast-growing algae is a major prerequisite for commercial production of microalgal oil-derived biodiesel. However, under optimal growth conditions, large amounts of algal biomass are produced, but with relatively low lipid contents, while species with high lipid contents are typically slow growing. Major advances in this area can be made through the induction of lipid biosynthesis, e.g., by environmental stresses. Lipids, in the form of triacylglycerides typically provide a storage function in the cell that enables microalgae to endure adverse environmental conditions. Essentially algal biomass and triacylglycerides compete for photosynthetic assimilate and a reprogramming of physiological pathways is required to stimulate lipid biosynthesis. There has been a wide range of studies carried out to identify and develop efficient lipid induction techniques in microalgae such as nutrients stress (e.g., nitrogen and/or phosphorus starvation), osmotic stress, radiation, pH, temperature, heavy metals and other chemicals. In addition, several genetic strategies for increased triacylglycerides production and inducibility are currently being developed. In this review, we discuss the potential of lipid induction techniques in microalgae and also their application at commercial scale for the production of biodiesel. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - The study assesses the environmental sustainability of palm biodiesel production systems in Thailand by focusing on their energy efficiency and environmental impact potentials. The Net Energy Balance (NEB) and Renewability indicate energy gain for palm biodiesel and its co-products as compared to fossil energy inputs. In addition, life cycle assessment also reveals lower values of environmental impact potentials of biodiesel as compared to conventional diesel. For example, palm biodiesel can provide greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of around 46-73% as compared to diesel. Nitrogen-fertilizer production and application in the plantation and the air emissions from the ponds treating palm oil mill effluent (POME) are found to be the major environmental aspects. However, the energy and environmental performances depend on various factors such as the management efficiency of empty fruit bunches (EFB) and POME and the possible land-use change in the future. Recommendations are made for improving environmental performance of palm biodiesel and for securing the long-term availability of crude palm oil supply with a view towards sustainable palm biodiesel production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of biofuels to mitigate global carbon emissions is highly dependent on direct and indirect land use changes (LUC). The direct LUC (dLUC) can be accurately evaluated using remote sensing images. In this work we evaluated the dLUC of about 4 million hectares of sugarcane expanded from 2005 to 2010 in the South-central region of Brazil. This region has a favorable climate for rain-fed sugarcane, a great potential for agriculture expansion without deforestation, and is currently responsible for almost 90% of Brazilian's sugarcane production. An available thematic map of sugarcane along with MODIS and Landast images, acquired from 2000 to 2009, were used to evaluate the land use prior to the conversion to sugarcane. A systematic sampling procedure was adopted and the land use identification prior to sugarcane, for each sample, was performed using a web tool developed to visualize both the MODIS time series and the multitemporal Landsat images. Considering 2000 as reference year, it was observed that sugarcane expanded: 69.7% on pasture land; 25.0% on annual crops; 0.6% on forest; while 3.4% was sugarcane land under crop rotation. The results clearly show that the dLUC of recent sugarcane expansion has occurred on more than 99% of either pasture or agriculture land. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - The present study explores the characteristics of the literature on the biofuels published during the last three decades, based on the databases of Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and its implications using the scientometric techniques. The results of this study reveal that the literature on the biofuels has grown exponentially during this period reaching 6,770 papers in total with paralleling enormous changes in the research landscape. Papers mostly have been journal articles, reviews, and proceedings, predominantly in English. USA, China, and Germany have been the three most prolific countries. The "University of Illinois" has been the most prolific institution. The most prolific authors have been "Demirbas A" and "Minter SD". "Biomass & Bioenergy" has been the most prolific journal whilst, "Energy Fuels" has been the most prolific subject area. The total number of citations is 79,304, giving a ratio for the "Average Citations per Item" as 11.71 and "H-index" as 101. Ragauskas et al. has had the highest impact on the literature. Both the research output and the citations have thrived spectacularly after 2005. The results of this first ever such study of its kind, show that the scientometric analysis has a great potential to gain valuable insights into the evolution of the high-profile research on the biofuels, complementing other research techniques. © Sila Science.

AB  - We provide a quantitative assessment of the prospects for current and future biomass feedstocks for bioenergy in Australia, and associated estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation resulting from their use for production of biofuels or bioelectricity. National statistics were used to estimate current annual production from agricultural and forest production systems. Crop residues were estimated from grain production and harvest index. Wood production statistics and spatial modelling of forest growth were used to estimate quantities of pulpwood, in-forest residues, and wood processing residues. Possible new production systems for oil from algae and the oilseed tree Pongamia pinnata, and of lignocellulosic biomass production from short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops were also examined. The following constraints were applied to biomass production and use: avoiding clearing of native vegetation; minimizing impacts on domestic food security; retaining a portion of agricultural and forest residues to protect soil; and minimizing the impact on local processing industries by diverting only the export fraction of grains or pulpwood to bioenergy. We estimated that it would be physically possible to produce 9.6 GL yr-1 of first generation ethanol from current production systems, replacing 6.5 GL yr-1 of gasoline or 34% of current gasoline usage. Current production systems for waste oil, tallow and canola seed could produce 0.9 GL yr-1 of biodiesel, or 4% of current diesel usage. Cellulosic biomass from current agricultural and forestry production systems (including biomass from hardwood plantations maturing by 2030) could produce 9.5 GL yr-1 of ethanol, replacing 6.4 GL yr-1 of gasoline, or ca. 34% of current consumption. The same lignocellulosic sources could instead provide 35 TWh yr-1, or ca. 15% of current electricity production. New production systems using algae and P. pinnata could produce ca. 3.96 and 0.9 GL biodiesel yr-1, respectively. In combination, they could replace 4.2 GL yr-1 of fossil diesel, or 23% of current usage. Short-rotation coppiced eucalypt crops could provide 4.3 GL yr-1 of ethanol (2.9 GL yr-1 replacement, or 15% of current gasoline use) or 20.2 TWh yr-1 of electricity (9% of current generation). In total, first and second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 26 Mt CO2-e, which is 38% of road transport emissions and 5% of the national emissions. Second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 13 Mt CO2-e, which is 19% of road transport emissions and 2.4% of the national emissions lignocellulose from current and new production systems could mitigate 48 Mt CO2-e, which is 28% of electricity emissions and 9% of the national emissions. There are challenging sustainability issues to consider in the production of large amounts of feedstock for bioenergy in Australia. Bioenergy production can have either positive or negative impacts. Although only the export fraction of grains and sugar was used to estimate first generation biofuels so that domestic food security was not affected, it would have an impact on food supply elsewhere. Environmental impacts on soil, water and biodiversity can be significant because of the large land base involved, and the likely use of intensive harvest regimes. These require careful management. Social impacts could be significant if there were to be large-scale change in land use or management. In addition, although the economic considerations of feedstock production were not covered in this article, they will be the ultimate drivers of industry development. They are uncertain and are highly dependent on government policies (e.g. the price on carbon, GHG mitigation and renewable energy targets, mandates for renewable fuels), the price of fossil oil, and the scale of the industry. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article reviews the history and current state of ethanol production from sugais approach to the future of sustainable and responsible ethanol production is termed the 'midway' strategy. The 'midway' strategy involves producing the necessary biotechnology to increase productircane in Brazil and presents a strategy for improving ecosystem services and production. We propose that it is possible to produce ethanol from sugarcane while maintaining or even recovering some of Brazil's unique neotropical biodiversity and ecosystem climate services. Thvity while synergistically protecting and regenerating rainforest. Three main areas of scientific and technological advance that are key to realizing the 'midway' strategy are: (i) improving the quality of scientific data on sugarcane biology as pertains to its use as a bioenergy crop; (ii) developing technologies for the use of bagasse for cellulosic ethanol; and (iii) developing policies to improve the ecosystem services associated with sugarcane landscapes. This article discusses these three issues in the general context of biofuels production and highlights examples of scientific achievements that are already leading towards the 'midway' strategy. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Antibiotics of inorganic and organic origin in pig manure can inhibit the anaerobic process in biogas plants. The influence of three frequently used antibiotics, copper dosed as CuSO 4, sulfadiazine (SDZ), and difloxacin (DIF), on the anaerobic digestion process of pig manure was studied in semi-continuous experiments. Biogas production recovered after every Cu dosage up to a sum of 12.94g Cukg -1 organic dry matter (ODM), probably due to Cu precipitation following the formation of sulphide from sulphate. Complete inhibition was found at the very high Cu concentration of 19.40g Cukg -1 ODM. Inhibitory effect of SDZ and DIF was observed at concentrations as high as 2.70gkg -1 ODM and 0.54gkg -1 ODM, respectively. It seems very unlikely that the antibiotics tested would inhibit the anaerobic process in a full-scale biogas plant. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass gasification is being considered as one of the most promising technologies for converting biomass into gaseous fuel. Here we present results of gasification, using an adiabatic bed gasifier with air as gasification medium, of mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii), two woody species that dominate uncultivated lands in the Southern Great Plains, U.S.A., that may have potential for bioenergy utilization. The effects of equivalence ratio (ER), particle size, and moisture content on the temperature profile, gas composition (CO, CO2, H2, N2, CH4, and C2H6), and higher heating value (HHV) were investigated. As ER decreased from 4.2 to 2.7, the mole composition of the end product gas for mesquite contained: 13-21% CO, 1.6-3% H2, 1-1.5% CH4, 0.4-0.6% C2H6, 60-64% N2, 11-25% CO2, and 1-2% O2. The mole composition of the end product gas for juniper consisted of 21-25% CO, 2.5-3.5% H2, 1.5-1.8% CH4, 0.3-0.5% C2H6, 58-61% N2, 9-12% CO2, and 1-2% O2. The H2 and CO mole percentages decreased with increasing ER while the CO2 and N2 mole percentage increased. After removing N2, the HHV of the end-product gas for mesquite and juniper reached 26 and 27.5% of natural gas HHV, respectively, when ER ≈ 2.7. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the development and use of an optimisation model suitable for analysis of biofuel production scenarios in the EU, with the aim of examining second generation biofuel production. Two policy instruments are considered - targeted biofuel support and a CO2 cost. The results show that over 3% of the total transport fuel demand can be met by second generation biofuels at a cost of approximately 65-73 EUR/MWh. With current energy prices, this demands biofuel support comparable to existing tax exemptions (around 30 EUR/MWh), or a CO2 cost of around 60 EUR/tCO2. Parameters having large effect on biofuel production include feedstock availability, fossil fuel price and capital costs. It is concluded that in order to avoid suboptimal energy systems, heat and electricity applications should also be included when evaluating optimal bioenergy use. It is also concluded that while forceful policies promoting biofuels may lead to a high biofuel share at reasonable costs, this is not a certain path towards maximised CO2 emission mitigation. Policies aiming to promote the use of bioenergy thus need to be carefully designed in order to avoid conflicts between different parts of the EU targets for renewable energy and CO2 emission mitigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the major minerals producing countries and the potential that local energy mix and renewable energy resources have for lowering the impact of the industry, with respect to carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, it seeks to estimate the potential for new technologies, energy efficiency and demand-side measures to reduce emissions. Of total carbon dioxide emissions, 71% arise from fossil fuels used in thermal applications and 29% from indirect electricity generation. We find the highest theoretical potential for reduction of emissions from thermal applications is from the increased use of renewable biofuels and charcoal instead of fossil fuels (up to 46% of total industry net emissions), while conversion of various applications to use renewable hydrogen may reduce emissions by 28%. Electricity generation emissions could be "substantially reduced" by switching to electricity generation from cleaner sources, with hydropower a key potential contributor (reduction of 22% of total industry emissions). Solar thermal and electrical production may only be capable of 2-7% reduction in the industry's emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Union Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC (RED) has adopted climate change assessment as one of the environmental criteria used to evaluate the level of sustainability by indicating the impact values for every phase of the biofuel chain. This paper shows the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivation of sunflower for biodiesel production in Tuscany, Italy. In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO2eq] MJ-1) indicated by the RED. This is mainly due to diesel consumption and emissions from nitrogen fertilisers that are on average 180% and 255% higher than the reference values, respectively. GHG emissions allocation among sunflower biodiesel and co-products was made according to energy content principle. Only the biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in the two most efficient farms achieved a GHG saving with respect to conventional diesel (36%) that made it possible to fulfil the RED's requirements. From these results, it seems that the observance of such requirements on GHG emissions for sunflower biodiesel cultivation phase in Tuscany will not be easy to satisfy without a significant revision of local farm practices, aimed primarily at reducing the use of nitrogen fertilisers and diesel consumption. In fact, the GHG emissions reported in the RED for sunflower cultivation were calculated using excessively low farm inputs compared with the typical amounts for sunflower cultivation practices in Tuscany. © 2012 IAgrE.

AB  - Researchers around the world are developing sustainable plant-based liquid transportation fuels (biofuels) to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Algae are attractive because they promise large yields per acre compared to grasses, grains and trees, and because they produce oils that might be converted to diesel and gasoline equivalents. It takes considerable energy to produce algal biofuels with current technology; thus, the potential benefits of algal biofuels compared to petroleum fuels must be quantified. To this end, we identified key parameters for algal biofuel production using GREET, a tool for the life-cycle analysis of energy use and emissions in transportation systems. The baseline scenario produced 55400 g CO2 equivalent per million BTU of biodiesel compared to 101000g for low-sulfur petroleum diesel. The analysis considered the potential for greenhouse gas emissions from anaerobic digestion processes commonly used in algal biofuel models. The work also studied alternative scenarios, e.g., catalytic hydrothermal gasification, that may reduce these emissions. The analysis of the nitrogen recovery step from lipid-extracted algae (residues) highlighted the importance of considering the fate of the unrecovered nitrogen fraction, especially that which produces N 2O, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential 298 times that of CO2. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In earlier work, we compared the amount of newly fixed nitrogen (N, as synthetic fertilizer and biologically fixed N) entering agricultural systems globally to the total emission of nitrous oxide (N2O). We obtained an N2O emission factor (EF) of 3-5%, and applied it to biofuel production. For 'first-generation' biofuels, e.g. biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), that require N fertilizer, N2O from biofuel production could cause (depending on N uptake efficiency) as much or more global warming as that avoided by replacement of fossil fuel by the biofuel. Our subsequent calculations in a follow-up paper, using published life cycle analysis (LCA) models, led to broadly similar conclusions. The N2O EF applies to agricultural crops in general, not just to biofuel crops, and has made possible a top-down estimate of global emissions from agriculture. Independent modelling by another group using bottom-up IPCC inventory methodology has shown good agreement at the global scale with our top-down estimate. Work by Davidson showed that the rate of accumulation of N2O in the atmosphere in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries was greater than that predicted from agricultural inputs limited to fertilizer N and biologically fixed N (Davidson, E. A. 2009 Nat. Geosci. 2, 659-662.). However, by also including soil organic N mineralized following land-use change and NOx deposited from the atmosphere in our estimates of the reactive N entering the agricultural cycle, we have now obtained a good fit between the observed atmospheric N2O concentrations from 1860 to 2000 and those calculated on the basis of a 4 per cent EF for the reactive N. © 2012 The Royal Society.

AB  - It is important to demonstrate that replacing fossil fuel with bioenergy crops can reduce the national greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. We compared field emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and soil respiration rates from the C4 grass Miscanthus × giganteus and willow (salix) with emissions from annual arable crops grown for food production. The study was carried out in NE England on adjacent fields of willow, Miscanthus, wheat (Triticum aetivum) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus). N2O, CH4 fluxes and soil respiration rates were measured monthly using static chambers from June 2008 to November 2010. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured by eddy covariance on Miscanthus from May 2008 and on willow from October 2009 until November 2010. The N2O fluxes were significantly smaller from the bioenergy crops than that of the annual crops. Average fluxes were 8 and 32 μg m-2 h-1 N2O-N from wheat and oilseed rape, and 4 and 0.2 μg m-2 h-1 N2O-N from Miscanthus and willow, respectively. Soil CH4 fluxes were negligible for all crops and soil respiration rates were similar for all crops. NEE of CO2 was larger for Miscanthus (-770 g C m-2 h-1) than willow (-602 g C m-2 h-1) in the growing season of 2010. N2O emissions from Miscanthus and willow were lower than for the wheat and oilseed rape which is most likely a result of regular fertilizer application and tillage in the annual arable cropping systems. Application of 15N-labelled fertilizer to Miscanthus and oil seed rape resulted in a fertilizer-induced increase in N2O emission in both crops. Denitrification rates (N2O + N2) were similar for soil under Miscanthus and oilseed rape. Thus, perennial bioenergy crops only emit less GHGs than annual crops when they receive no or very low rates of N fertilizer. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Crop-based biofuels represent an environmental and political alternative to fossil fuels, as well as an important source of rural development income; as global biofuel markets continue to mature, however, their impact on food security remains controversial. This study investigates the effects of biofuel feedstock adoption by smallholders in the northwestern Cambodian province of Banteay Meanchey, a region undergoing rapid land use change following the formal end of the Khmer Rouge era in 1989 and subsequent rural resettlement. Remote sensing data combined with field interviews pointed to three discrete phases of land use change in this period: first, as a result of the establishment of new settlements (mainly subsistence rice production); second, via the expansion of cash crop cultivation into forested areas (mainly grown on upland fields); and third, due to the response of smallholders to a sharp increase in regional demand for cassava starch (grown exclusively on upland fields). The study found that agricultural expansion due to cassava growing was severe, but it was not the sole contributor to deforestation in the region. The exposure of smallholder economies to the volatile cassava market had severe consequences for livelihoods and food security. The paper concludes with a discussion of the probable impacts of the emerging cassava market on trajectories in land use, land ownership, and land access in rural Cambodia. The case looks at biofuel adoption in the context of other land use changes, but also provides evidence at the local scale of how a strongly market driven crop, in this case biofuel feedstock, can have striking environmental and socioeconomic consequences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing biochar and biofuels from poultry litter (PL) through slow pyrolysis is a farm-based, value-added approach to recycle the organic waste. Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the quality PL biochar and to identify the optimal pyrolysis temperature for converting PL to agricultural-use biochar. As peak pyrolysis temperature increased incrementally from 300 to 600 °C, biochar yield, total N content, organic carbon (OC) content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) decreased while pH, ash content, OC stability, and BET surface area increased. The generated biochars showed yields 45.7-60.1% of feed mass, OC 325-380 g kg-1, pH 9.5-11.5, BET surface area 2.0-3.2 m2 g-1, and CEC 21.6-36.3 cmolc kg-1. The maximal transformation of feed OC into biochar recalcitrant OC occurred at 500 °C, yet 81.2% of the feed N was lost in volatiles at this temperature. To produce agricultural-use PL biochar, 300 °C should be selected in pyrolysis; for carbon sequestration and other environmental applications, 500 °C is recommended. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a mass-produced by-product of the meat rendering industry. It has great potential as a feedstock for the production of bio-fuels. Meat and bone meal, however, is a highly cohesive and temperature sensitive material and has traditionally been found to be very difficult, if not impossible, to feed properly into pyrolysis reactors or bubbling fluidized beds. This study showcases an application of the ICFAR intermittent solid slug feeder technology and its capability of successfully feeding the MBM regularly at an average feeding rate of 0.34 g/s into the reactor. A highly automated and instrumented fast pyrolysis pilot plant has been used to process meat and bone meal residues and to operate within a wide range of temperatures (450-600 °C). This is the first study dealing with the pyrolysis of pure meat and bone meal at various operating conditions continuously fed into a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor. All liquid and solid products have been analyzed (yields, HHV, GC-MS, elemental analysis, and ash mineral analysis). The homogenous bio-oil produced is an attractive fuel with a significant high heating value (HHV) of 31.5 MJ/kg and an average liquid yield of 43 wt% at 550 °C. The highest water-free HHV (36.7 MJ/kg) was found at 500 °C, with a liquid yield of 35 wt% at this temperature. The optimized pyrolysis temperature, at which the heat from the gas combustion can provide the heat required for processing MBM, while maximizing the bio-oil liquid yield and process energy yield, is 550 °C. Under these conditions, the pyrolysis process energy yield is 91%. The study also demonstrates a new technique to accurately determine the heat of pyrolysis reaction energy required by the process, using a non-invasive water calibration method. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study tests the assumptions that justified the establishment of the Brazilian Biodiesel Production Program (PNPB), to see whether this program has achieved its promised results. Given the connection between socioeconomic, political, technological and environmental issues, the study performs an analysis covering these different dimensions. From the socioeconomic standpoint, findings of the study show that the generation of jobs in the agricultural sector has been much lower than the expected 1.3-million-job creation figure. From the standpoint of reducing the outflow of foreign exchange because of potentially lower demand for imported diesel, the option for the methanol instead of ethanol production route has led to an increased net outflow, as the greater need to import methanol to produce biodiesel more than offsets the lesser need to import mineral diesel. Nevertheless, even though the "Promised Land" has not been reached, particularly from a socioeconomic standpoint, the premises of energy efficiency and the potential to mitigate GHG emissions appear to be on solid ground. In this respect, the input/output energy ratio of producing soy-based biodiesel and the GHG mitigation potential of pure biodiesel justify the continuing effort to improve the PNPB to achieve more promising results in relation to the other indicators. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - David Sawaya, a specialist in plant biotechnology, writes here on the broad developmental trends we are likely to see in this sector up to the year 2030. He begins by recalling the general trends in world agriculture, beginning with the rise in demand for agricultural products that is linked to demographic growth, to the rise in average incomes and to the development of products, such as biofuels, derived from agricultural sources. He sees two possible options for responding to this: to increase the area of cultivable land - though the scope for manoeuvre in this area is decreasing - or to increase yields, particularly thanks to advances in the plant biotechnologies, both transgenic and non-transgenic. After reminding us of the situation regarding GM crops worldwide, David Sawaya presents the prospects for the development of GM crops in light of the existing data. He also points out the changes there have been in the characteristics most sought after within plant biotechnology, showing that the firstgeneration characteristics (resistance to pests and herbicides) are tending to give way to second-generation characteristics that are more agronomic in character (resistance to various kinds of stress, better yields). He stresses the greater role of developing countries in terms of GM production - and also in research into plant biotechnology, which might increase in the future. Lastly, he clarifies the importance of non-transgenic biotechnologies in the improvement of plant species. Despite factors likely to slow the development of plant biotechnology - the concentration of the enterprises in the sector around multinationals focussed on large-scale crops to the detriment of small seed companies that are likely to develop innovations in less widespread species, and a highly sceptical public opinion - he takes the view that by 2030, if not indeed by 2015 in the case of the most widely cultivated species, there will be very few plants intended for commercial growing that have not been subjected to some form of biotechnological intervention.

AB  - Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) is one of China's strategic energy bases for the 21st century. While bioenergy in IMAR may play an important role in securing future energy supply, little research has been done so far, particularly for crop stalk resources as a potential source of bioenergy in this region. In this study we systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of crop stalk resources, evaluated the bioenergy potential of crop stalk resources, and explored possible pathways of developing stalk-based energy strategies in Inner Mongolia. Our results show that the total crop stalk yield in IMAR increased consistently from 1980 to 2008, with an average annual increase of 16.3%. Between 2004 and 2008, 26.14. million tons of crop stalks were produced each year in IMAR, 8.82. million tons of which could be used for biofuel production. Grain crops contributed most to the total amount of stalks for energy production, of which corn stalks were the largest contributor, accounting for 62% of the total crop stalk yield. Based on the current trend, crop stalk yields may continue to increase in the future. Geographically, the abundance of biofuelable crop stalk resources, either on a per capita or per unit of area basis, had a spatial pattern of "high on East and West and low in the middle" Our findings suggest that IMAR has the potential for developing stalk-based bioenergy to improve its current overwhelmingly coal-dominated energy structure. However, more detailed and comprehensive studies are needed to figure out how exactly such bioenergy development should be carried out in a way that would promote the regional sustainability of Inner Mongolia - i.e., simultaneously providing social, economic, and ecological benefits. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set an annual US national production goal of 39.7billionl of cellulosic ethanol by 2020. This paper explores the possibility of meeting that target by growing and processing Miscanthus × giganteus. We define and assess six production scenarios in which active cropland and/or Conservation Reserve Program land are used to grow to Miscanthus. The crop and biorefinery locations are chosen with consideration of economic, land-use, water management and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction objectives. Using lifecycle assessment, the net GHG footprint of each scenario is evaluated, providing insight into the climate costs and benefits associated with each scenarios objectives. Assuming that indirect land-use change is successfully minimized or mitigated, the results suggest two major drivers for overall GHG impact of cellulosic ethanol from Miscanthus: (a)net soil carbon sequestration or emissions during Miscanthus cultivation and (b)GHG offset credits for electricity exported by biorefineries to the grid. Without these factors, the GHG intensity of bioethanol from Miscanthus is calculated to be 11-13g CO2-equivalent per MJ of fuel, which is 80-90% lower than gasoline. Including soil carbon sequestration and the power-offset credit results in net GHG sequestration up to 26g CO2-equivalent per MJ of fuel. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Scientists predict that global agricultural lands will expand over the next few decades due to increasing demands for food production and an exponential increase in cropbased biofuel production. These changes in land use will greatly impact biogeochemical and biogeophysical cycles across the globe. It is therefore important to develop models that can accurately simulate the interactions between the atmosphere and important crops. In this study, we develop and validate a new process-based sugarcane model (included as a module within the Agro-IBIS dynamic agro-ecosystem model) which can be applied at multiple spatial scales. At site level, the model systematically under/overestimated the daily sensible/latent heat flux (by -10.5% and 14.8%, H and λE, respectively) when compared against the micrometeorological observations from southeast Brazil. The model underestimated ET (relative bias between -10.1% and -12.5%) when compared against an agro-meteorological field experiment from northeast Australia. At the regional level, the model accurately simulated average yield for the four largest mesoregions (clusters of municipalities) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, over a period of 16 years, with a yield relative bias of -0.68% to 1.08%. Finally, the simulated annual average sugarcane yield over 31 years for the state of Louisiana (US) had a low relative bias (-2.67%), but exhibited a lower interannual variability than the observed yields. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels is currently driving the interest in bioenergy sector. The recently issued Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) confirms the 10% target, set by the EC, for energy from renewable sources in transport. The European Union is the largest producer of biodiesel in the world and biodiesel is also the most important biofuel used in the EU. The aim of this paper is to investigate the biomass feedstock requirement, under different scenarios, with a focus on vegetable oils. The European production potential is compared with the amount of biomass required to meet the target on biofuels. Next generation biofuels and alternative feedstock for first generation pathways are considered as well as the share of biomass import. The scenario proposed allows to estimate the land required to meet the target at 2020 on biodiesel. Assuming different contribution of the next generation biofuels, from the 10% to the 30% is possible to estimate the contribution of first generation biodiesel. The results showed that, considering the total European arable land, this production will utilise 9-13%. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Grasslands have been recognized as important source of biomass for biofuel production recently. In this study, our objective was to assess the potential supply of biofuel production of main plants in Leymus chinensis steppe in Xilin River Basin,Inner Mongolia. And we also wanted to understand how will the caloric value respond to ash content and other mineral elements composition. We charaterizing their correlationships. We determined the caloric value(Testing by the Parr6300 calorimeter produced by U. S), ash content(Testing by the quick determination method), concentrations of carbon(Testing by the K2 Cr2 O7 -H2 SO4 oxidation method), nitrogen(Testing by the Kjeldahl procedure) and mineral nelements(Testing by Microwave Digestion-ICP) of fifteen native plant species. These tested species, which were selected in August 2009, are most commonly found in Leymus chinensis steppe and account for more than 80% of totoal community biomass. The results showed that the variables determined varied among the fifteen species to different extent. The caloric value ranged from 16. 19 MJ/ kg in Kochia prostrate to 20. 99 MJ/ kg in Caragana microphylla, with a mean value of 18. 76 MJ/ kg which is greater than that of worldwide terrestrial plants. And the rank ordering of the fifteen species was Caragana microphylla Lam&gt;Poa annua L. &gt;Stipa baicalensis Roshev&gt;Agropyron cristatum L&gt;Achnatherum sibiricum L&gt;Aneurolepidium chinense Kitag &gt; Cleistogenes squarrosa Keng. &gt; Artemisia commutata L &gt; Achnatherum splendens Nevski &gt; Potentilla tanacetifolia Willd&gt;Artemisia sievrsiana willd&gt;Artemisia frigida Willd&gt;Setaria viridis L&gt;Convolvulus ammannii L&gt;Kochia prostrate L. The ash, which ranged from 3. 26% in Achnatherum splendens Nevski to 20. 25% in Convolvulus ammannii L, indicated significantly difference at level 0. 05 among the fifteen species. And the number of fifteen species was Convolvulus ammannii L&gt; Kochia prostrate L. &gt;Artemisia frigida Willd&gt;Artemisia sievrsiana willd&gt;Potentilla tanacetifolia Willd&gt;Setaria viridis L&gt; Agropyron cristatum L&gt; Aneurolepidium chinense Kitag&gt; Poa annua L&gt;Cleistogenes squarrosa Keng&gt;Artemisia commutata L &gt; Achnatherum sibiricum L &gt; Caragana microphylla Lam &gt; Stipa baicalensis Roshev &gt; Achnatherum splendens Nevski. Calorica value of leguminous plants (Caragana microphylla Lam) was higher than perennial gramineous plants (Caragana microphylla Lam, Poa annua L., Stipa baicalensis Roshev, Agropyron cristatum L, Achnatherum sibiricum L., Cleistogenes squarrosa Keng), and the caloric value of Kochia prostrate L. was the lowest. Pearson's correlationship analyses revealed a negatively significant correlation between caloric value and ash content (P &lt; 0. 01), while a positively significant correlation btween caloric value and carbon concentration (P &lt; 0. 01). However, there were no consistent relationships found between caloric value and concentrations of mineral elements. The greater caloric value of the steppe grasses showed in this study, compared with that of switchgrass which is one of most promising biofuel crops, indicates provides an evedent that the grassland has a potential for bioenergy production, especially leguminous plants and perennial gramineous plants. Such as Caragana microphylla Lam, Poa annua L., Stipa baicalensis Roshev, Agropyron cristatum L, Achnatherum sibiricum L, Cleistogenes squarrosa Keng and so on.

AB  - For the soil and plant analysis community, development and expansion of biofuels will create many opportunities to provide a wide variety of analytical services. Our objective is to explore potential areas where those services could be marketed to support sustainable development of biofuels. One of the first is to provide soil fertility and plant nutrition information for sustainable feedstock production. Chemical, physical, and biological indicators of soil quality should also be monitored and interpreted using tools such as the soil management assessment framework (SMAF) to ensure soil resources can continue to meet global food, feed, and fiber demands as well as the new demands for biofuels. Feedstock sugar profile information will be needed to help manage conversion processes, calculate economic drivers such as the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP), and determine suitability for other bioproducts. There will also be an increasing need to evaluate a variety of coproducts created by corn (Zea mays) milling, soybean (Glycine max Merr.) processing, and the fledgling lignocellulosic conversion processes. For coproducts produced from wet or dry corn milling and dry grind ethanol production, accurate and efficient analysis and digestibility of fiber components [neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and total dietary fiber (TDF)], amino acids (lysine, trypotophan, and methionine), fatty acids, and minerals (phosphorus and sulfur) will be needed. In addition, a capacity to accurately and rapidly detect contamination by mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, zearalenone, and fumonisisn or the presence of antibiotics such as penicillin or virginiamycin could potentially be important. For the biodiesel industry, methanol concentrations in crude glycerin must be reduced to meet Food and Drug Administration guidelines and quantified to ensure this coproduct is safe for use in livestock feeds. Finally, monitoring for several processes and coproducts associated with pyrolysis, a thermochemical platform for biomass conversion to bio-oils, biochar, and other products will be needed. We conclude that sustainable development of biofuel industries will have many positive benefits for soils, plant, and animal production systems and the analysts who will provide analytical services for monitoring all aspects of the biofuels industry. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Reduction of greenhouse gases as prescribed by the Kyoto Protocol encourages substituting fossil fuels with biofuels. Ecuador's engagement with such climate change policy frameworks and subsequent biofuel production plans have led to drastic landscape transformation. Since the implementation of the first large-scale oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantation in the Canton of San Lorenzo, Esmeraldas province in 1998, palm monoculture has replaced 22, 242 ha of Ecuador's coastal Chocó rainforest. The recent and rapid expansion of oil palm plantations has serious and detrimental socio-ecological repercussions for the local Afro-Ecuadorian and indigenous communities. This article highlights both the agro-ecological and cultural practices and the inter-ethnic networks through which these communities construct and sustain "geographies of hope" amid landscapes characterized by fallen forests, poisoned rivers, social conflicts, and a sea of oil palms. Drawing on the theoretical linkages between climate change, colonialism, and capitalism, this study investigates San Lorenzo as an agricultural frontier where "CO 2lonialism" is articulated through biofuel (oil palm) production. Expounding on the ecological debt of the Global North to the Global South, this article critically examines actions and discourses that bulldoze rainforests, livelihoods, and constructive discussions regarding the global warning of global warming. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To test the potential for production of bioenergy crops, such as canola and corn, an organic cover was constructed over acid-producing mine tailings containing nickel and copper, belonging to Vale in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The 1 m deep cover was of organic residuals (biosolids) obtained from a regional paper mill. Corn and canola crops were successfully grown using agricultural techniques. Crop yields from each of 2 yr from the tailings site were greater than those obtained at an agricultural site in the region. Root, shoot and grain analyses indicated low potential for bioaccumulation of potentially hazardous metals from the organic residual cover or the underlying tailings. Over the short term, there was no evidence of metal movement into the biosolids cover or uptake by the crops from the underlying tailing deposits. Importantly, canola seeds and corn kernels, the feedstocks for biodiesel and ethanol biofuels production, did not accumulate environmentally sensitive metals. This preliminary study demonstrates that the placement of an organic residuals cover on mine tailings to support growth of bioenergy crops is a potential novel reclamation strategy for the mining and smelting industry, or for industrial brownfields in general.

AB  - Brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol in the world and is likely to play a leading role in meeting global demand in the future. Increased ethanol production is not without a risk, however, as ethanol expansion could increase deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Some argue that technological improvements in sugarcane varieties, cultivation, and ethanol production will reduce the need for new deforestation. Others maintain that demand for ethanol may shift production of food crops to sugarcane, resulting in higher food prices and have a disproportionate impact on the poor. To evaluate these arguments we developed a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Brazil to estimate the socioeconomic and land use impacts of (a) an improvement in sugarcane and ethanol production technology; (b) an increase in ethanol demand; and (c) the combined effects of improved technology and increased ethanol demand. Our results indicate that ethanol expansion has little effect on levels of deforestation. Technological improvements reduce the area of sugarcane cultivation in all regions of Brazil while other agricultural sectors tend toward expansion. Agricultural product prices decrease in the short-run, but return close to their original levels in the longer-run thus having almost no affect on the poor. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Southern Africa has been identified globally as one of the areas with high potential for extensive biofuel production. Unlike most commodities, biofuel is not market-limited. Instead, access to feedstock-and more particularly the land on which to grow the feedstock-is the main constraint for biofuel production, and hence the greatest competition in the industry is to acquire land. Countries in southern Africa have taken very different policy stances on biofuel. South Africa is taking a conservative approach; concerns about potential invasiveness of Jatropha curcas have led to a moratorium on planting, and maize-based bioethanol is banned due to possible food security impacts. On the contrary, Mozambique sees biofuel production as one of the key strategies to obtain foreign investment in the agricultural sector, which it is actively trying to revive. What remains unclear is to what extent primary and secondary forest and woodland will be cleared to enable this biofuel expansion. Although early indications suggested that extensive deforestation would occur, more recently companies seem to be taking more conservative approaches to deforestation due to concerns over certification requirements. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., a multipurpose shrub, has acquired significant economic importance for its seed oil which can be converted to biodiesel an emerging alternative to petro-diesel. In addition to the commercial value, it is also having medicinal and even high nutritional value to use as animal fodder which is limited due to the toxicity. Development of molecular marker will enable to differentiate non-toxic from toxic variety of J. curcas in a mixed population and also for quality control since the toxic components of J. curcas has deleterious effect on animals. In the present study, the efforts were made to generate the specific SCAR marker for toxic and/or non-toxic J. curcas from RAPD markers. Among the markers specific for toxic and non-toxic varieties, four were selected, purified, cloned, sequenced, and designed primers out of which one set of primers NT-JC/SCAR I/OPQ15-F and R could able to discriminate the non-toxic with toxic Jatropha by giving expected 430 bp size amplification in non-toxic variety. Furthermore, novel multiplex PCR was designed using the nrDNA ITS primers to overcome the false negatives. Present work also demonstrates utility of the conserved regions of nrDNA coding genes in ruling out the artifacts in PCR-like false negatives frequently occur in SCAR due to various reasons. The specific SCAR markers generated in the present investigation will help to distinguish non-toxic from toxic varieties of J. curcas or vice versa, and isolated marker along with designed multiplex protocol has applications in quality control for selective cultivation of non-toxic variety and will also assist in breeding and molecular mapping studies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - We examine the effect of biofuels mandates and climate policy on the European vehicle fleet, in particular the prospects for diesel and gasoline vehicles. Our analysis is based on a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the world economy which explicitly incorporates current generation biofuels, accounts for stock turnover of the vehicle fleets, disaggregates gasoline and diesel cars, and represents an advanced E85 vehicle. We find that the European vehicle fleet is robust to proposed biofuels mandates owing to an existing fuel tax and tariffs structure that favours diesel vehicles. Harmonising excise duties on diesel and gasoline or lowering tariffs on biofuel imports, however, is shown to reverse the trend toward more diesel vehicles and significantly alters the efficiency costs and environmental effectiveness of renewable fuel policies.

AB  - Scientists and economists are increasingly worried that biofuels production is leading to land use changes in the form of competition with food crops or loss of natural ecosystems. I estimate acreage conversion in response to shocks in sugarcane (a biofuels feedstock) and soybean (thought to be affected by United States corn ethanol production) prices in Brazil at a national and regional level. Using county-level data from 1973 to 2005, I consider a dynamic panel data model of input demand for agricultural land, conditioning on price changes of other commodities. The short-run crop-price elasticity of sugarcane acreage in Brazil is estimated to be approximately zero, whereas the elasticity of soybean acreage is 0. 9 when both spot and futures prices change. The regional estimates for soybeans show considerable variation, and are highest in areas of ecological importance, such as the cerrado. Sugarcane estimates are more homogeneous. These results should be taken into account in impact assessments of biofuels. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The increasing demand for bioenergy crops presents our society with the opportunity to design more sustainable landscapes. We have created a Biomass Location for Optimal Sustainability Model (BLOSM) to test the hypothesis that landscape design of cellulosic bioenergy crop plantings may simultaneously improve water quality (i.e. decrease concentrations of sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen) and increase profits for farmer-producers while achieving a feedstock-production goal. BLOSM was run using six scenarios to identify switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) planting locations that might supply a commercial-scale biorefinery planned for the Lower Little Tennessee (LLT) watershed. Each scenario sought to achieve different sustainability goals: improving water quality through reduced nitrogen, phosphorus, or sediment concentrations; maximizing profit; a balance of these conditions; or a balance of these conditions with the additional constraint of converting no more than 25% of agricultural land. Scenario results were compared to a baseline case of no land-use conversion. BLOSM results indicate that a combined economic and environmental optimization approach can achieve multiple objectives simultaneously when a small proportion (1.3%) of the LLT watershed is planted with perennial switchgrass. The multimetric optimization approach described here can be used as a research tool to consider bioenergy plantings for other feedstocks, sustainability criteria, and regions. © 2012.

AB  - Microalgae are emerging as a promising source for environmentally friendly biofuels. Acoustic manipulation of algal cells using standing waves is a relatively new method for dewatering and/or sorting algae harvests. Recent work in the field has shown that acoustic dewatering methods may be more efficient and economical than traditional methods. Optimization of acoustic algal cell manipulation requires a knowledge of the acoustic radiation force upon the cells. Previous work in the field does not account for viscosity of the algal cells or surrounding fluid. We have implemented inviscid and viscous acoustic force models for standing waves incident upon algal cells in salt and freshwater. The results presented in this paper show that significant viscous effects can occur at certain frequencies and/or cell sizes and may need to be taken into account in the development of efficient experimental techniques. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Information on temporal and spatial variation in switch grass (Panicum virgatum L.) biomass composition as it affects ethanol yield (L Mg -1) at a biorefinery and ethanol production (L ha -1) at the field-scale has previously not been available. Switch grass biomass samples were collected from a regional, on-farm trial and biomass composition was determined using newly developed near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) prediction equations and theoretical ethanol yield (100% conversion efficiency) was calculated. Total hexose (cell wall polysaccharides and soluble sugars) concentration ranged from 342 to 398 g kg -1 while pentose (arabinose and xylose) concentration ranged from 216 to 245 g kg -1 across fields. Theoretical ethanol yield varied signifycantly by year and field, with5 yr means ranging from 381 to 430 L Mg -1. Total theoretical ethanol production ranged from 1749 to 3691 L ha -1 across fields. Variability (coefficient of variation) within established switch grass fields ranged from 1 to 4% for theoretical ethanol yield (L Mg -1) and 14 to 38% for theoretical ethanol production (L ha -1). Most fields showed a lack of spatial consistency across harvest years for theoretical ethanol yield or total theoretical ethanol production. Switch grass biomass composition from farmer fields can be expected to have significant annual and field-to-field variation in a production region, and this variation will significantly affect ethanol or other liquid fuel yields per ton or hectare. Cellulosic biorefineries will need to consider this potential variation in biofuel yields when developing their business plans. © 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - The perennial political and social upheavals in major oil-producing regions, the increasing energy demand from emerging economies, the global economic crisis and even environmental disasters, like the recent major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, all contribute to price fluctuations and escalations. Usually price instability affects the least-developed countries with the most fragile economies, like Ghana, the most. This paper gives a brief overview of the Ghanaian energy situation, describes the liquid biofuel production processes and examines the possibility of replacing some of the fossil fuels consumed annually, with locally produced renewable biofuels. Various scenarios for substituting different portions of petrol and diesel with biofuels derived from cassava and palm oil are examined. Based on 2009 crop production and fuel consumption data, replacement of 5% of both petrol and diesel with biofuels would require 1.96% and 17.3% of the cassava and palm oil produced in that year, respectively; while replacement of 10% of both fossil fuels would need 3.91% and 34.6% of the corresponding biofuels. Thus while petrol replacement could be initiated with little difficulty, regarding raw material availability, biodiesel would require enhanced palm oil production and/or oil supplement from other sources, including, potentially, jatropha. An implementation strategy is proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years prices on global food markets showed large fluctuations. The use of biomass as energy source (biofuel) in the developed world is frequently mentioned as one of the reasons for this instability. This paper compares the need for biofuel and needs for food and feed on global scale. A simple model is developed to estimate present and near future global needs for food, livestock feed and energy. We distinguish between developing countries, transition countries and the developed countries. The first group of countries needs extra food for their growing population, the second one needs extra feed, since the increased incomes among their population lead to increased demands for animal products. The developed countries require biomass to reduce the CO2 emissions of their energy use. On global scale the extra needs for biomass as a fuel (1100MT) turn out to be larger than the extra needs for food and feed (800MT each). At present the developed countries are food exporters, their produce is essential for several food insecure countries in Africa and Asia. The increased need for biomass for energy is likely to affect these exports and therefore affect food security in parts of the world. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An accurate understanding of the factors that influence farmers' adoption of a crop is critical for effective policy promotion and technical support. Agroforestry crop adoption is a complex topic involving many factors not often addressed by tradition crop adoption models. This complexity, when applied to Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.), an often widely promoted yet poorly understood biofuel feedstock crop, requires a detailed analysis across diverse topics. Such an analysis was carried out through applying rigorous statistical tools to the data acquired from an interview-based household survey among Malian farmers and was combined with relevant geospatial datasets. The results showed that though farmers' adoption is based on a wide variety of factors from household preferences, resource endowments, bio-physical factors, and market incentives, factors related to risk and uncertainty appear to provide the strongest correlation. Specifically, the number of visits that an agriculture extension agent makes with a farmer was found to be the most significant factor influencing adoption. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs) often include models that can be used to assess the impact of possible decisions. These models usually simulate complex spatio-temporal phenomena, with input variables and parameters that are often hard to measure. The resulting model uncertainty is, however, rarely communicated to the user, so that current SDSSs yield clear, but therefore sometimes deceptively precise outputs. Inclusion of uncertainty in SDSSs requires modeling methods to calculate uncertainty and tools to visualize indicators of uncertainty that can be understood by its users, having mostly limited knowledge of spatial statistics. This research makes an important step towards a solution of this issue. It illustrates the construction of the PCRaster Land Use Change model (PLUC) that integrates simulation, uncertainty analysis and visualization. It uses the PCRaster Python framework, which comprises both a spatio-temporal modeling framework and a Monte Carlo analysis framework that together produce stochastic maps, which can be visualized with the Aguila software, included in the PCRaster Python distribution package. This is illustrated by a case study for Mozambique in which it is evaluated where bioenergy crops can be cultivated without endangering nature areas and food production now and in the near future, when population and food intake per capita will increase and thus arable land and pasture areas are likely to expand. It is shown how the uncertainty of the input variables and model parameters effects the model outcomes. Evaluation of spatio-temporal uncertainty patterns has provided new insights in the modeled land use system about, e.g., the shape of concentric rings around cities. In addition, the visualization modes give uncertainty information in an comprehensible way for users without specialist knowledge of statistics, for example by means of confidence intervals for potential bioenergy crop yields. The coupling of spatio-temporal uncertainty analysis to the simulation model is considered a major step forward in the exposure of uncertainty in SDSSs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Though the development of biofuel has attracted numerous studies for quantifying potential water demand applying life cycle thinking, the impacts of biofuel water consumption still remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to quantify ecological impact associated with corn-based bioethanol water consumption in Minnesota in responding to different refinery expansion scenarios by applying a life cycle impact assessment method. Methods : This ecological damage assessment method for quantifying water consumption impacts was proposed by Pfister et al. in 2009 (Environ Sci Technol 43: 4098-4104, 2009) using an impact characterization factor integrating terrestrial net primary production and precipitation. In this study, we derived the spatially explicit eco-damage characterization factors for 81 watersheds in Minnesota and compiled location-specific water consumption data for all current and planned bioethanol production facilities and feedstock production. The ecological damage caused by bioethanol production (ΔEQEtOH in m2·yr) was then calculated on both watershed and refinery-plant levels. Additional refinery expansion scenarios were established for testing the effectiveness in changing ΔEQEtOH. Results and discussion: The results show that ecological impact ΔEQEtOH varied by more than a factor of 3 between watersheds. Minnesota consumed 40 billion liters of water to produce 2.3 billion liters of ethanol as of 2007 (17 L water per liter of ethanol). The geographical distribution of ΔEQEtOH was shown to be uneven with a cluster of high-impact regions around the center of the state. The planned refinery expansion is expected to increase the state's corn ethanol production capacity by 75% and ΔEQEtOH by 65%. However, strategically locating the planned expansion in the low-impact areas is expected to minimize the increases in ΔEQEtOH down to 19% from 65%. Conclusions: The scenario analysis shows that strategically sourcing corn from low-impact regions can result in significantly less water use impact compared to a baseline scenario. The results indicate that employing the water consumption impact assessment can provide additional insights in policy making. The environmental impacts related to the change of plant infrastructure and agricultural practices associated with the development of the renewable energy industry should be considered as well for identifying the most sustainable alternatives. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper presents laboratory results of biological production of hydrogen by photoautrotophic cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. Additional hydrogen production from residual Cyanobacteria fermentation was achieved by Enterobacter aerogenes bacteria. The authors evaluated the yield of H 2 production, the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions and the technological bottlenecks and possible improvements of the whole energy and CO 2 emission chain. The authors did not attempt to extrapolate the results to an industrial scale, but to highlight the processes that need further optimization. The experiments showed that the production of hydrogen from cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. is technically viable. The hydrogen yield for this case was 0.0114 kg H2/kg biomass which had a rough energy consumption of 1538 MJ/MJ H2 and produced 114640 gCO 2/MJ H2. The use of phototrophic residual cyanobacteria as a substrate in a dark-fermentation process increased the hydrogen yield by 8.1% but consumed 12.0% more of energy and produced 12.1% more of CO 2 showing that although the process increased the overall efficiency of hydrogen production it was not a viable energy and CO 2 emission solution. To make cyanobacteria-based biofuel production energy and environmentally relevant, efforts should be made to improve the hydrogen yield to values which are more competitive with glucose yields (0.1 kg H2/kg biomass). This could be achieved through the use of electricity with at least 80% of renewables and eliminating the unessential processes (e.g. pre-concentration centrifugation). © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Three different strains of colonial green alga Botryococcus bruanii Kutz. AP103, AP104 and AP105 were isolated from the freshwater lake Kolleru, Andhra Pradesh, India. The morphological features of these three isolates were studied under laboratory conditions. Molecular identification of the strains was carried out using 18S rRNA analysis and their systematic position was confirmed to species level as B. braunii. Among these isolates, B. braunii AP103 recorded highest biomass concentration of 1.7±0.12gL -1, 17% lipids, 17% proteins, 32% carbohydrates and 13% hydrocarbons under laboratory condition. Under open raceway pond AP103 produced a biomass concentration of 1.8±0.13gL -1, 19% lipids, 33% carbohydrates, 18% proteins and 11% hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons profile showed the presence of heptadecane (34%) and hexadecane (12.5%). Oleic (25.7%), linolenic (34.26%) and palmitic (9.42%) acids were the major fatty acids present in the lipids extracted from AP103. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable production systems for woodfuels in developing countries require basic information on tree productivity, and particularly on their coppicing productivity under current forms of management. We report biomass equations and sprouting productivity of two oak species (Quercus castanea and Quercus laeta) subject to traditional forms of woodfuel harvesting at Cuitzeo basin in central Mexico. Biomass components analyzed were total aboveground biomass (AGB), woody biomass suitable for charcoal making (WSC) and residues (foliage and small branches). The estimation of total aboveground biomass (AGB) and woody biomass suitable for charcoal making (WSC) of individual trees, when expressed as a function of DBH in the form y  a(DBH) b, resulted in values of pseudo-R 2 higher than 92%. The Mean Annual Increment (MAI) of both species increased with site age. Significant differences were found in regrowth rates of these species. Maximum charcoal potential productivity in kg ha -1 year -1 is achieved between 30 and 50 years depending on the decay rate of coppicing-shoot density over time. This roughly doubles current harvest cycles of 10-15 years followed by charcoalers. Oaks in developing countries have the potential to be used as a mid-term rotation coppice species for energy purposes. We argue that the results shown in this study are an important input for designing appropriate management strategies for traditional oak charcoal production in developing countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Corn stover as well as perennial grasses like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus are being considered as candidates for the second generation biofuel feedstocks. However, the challenges to biofuel development are its effects on the environment, especially water quality. This study evaluates the long-term impacts of biofuel production alternatives (e.g., elevated corn stover removal rates and the potential land cover change) on an ecosystem with a focus on biomass production, soil erosion, water quantity and quality, and soil nitrate nitrogen concentration at the watershed scale. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was modified for setting land cover change scenarios and applied to the Iowa River Basin (a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River Basin). Results show that biomass production can be sustained with an increased stover removal rate as long as the crop demand for nutrients is met with appropriate fertilization. Although a drastic increase (4.7-70.6%) in sediment yield due to erosion and a slight decrease (1.2-3.2%) in water yield were estimated with the stover removal rate ranging between 40% and 100%, the nitrate nitrogen load declined about 6-10.1%. In comparison to growing corn, growing either switchgrass or miscanthus can reduce sediment erosion greatly. However, land cover changes from native grass to switchgrass or miscanthus would lead to a decrease in water yield and an increase in nitrate nitrogen load. In contrast to growing switchgrass, growing miscanthus is more productive in generating biomass, but its higher water demand may reduce water availability in the study area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mediterranean countries are faced with severe water shortage and unavailability of agricultural land that limit the cultivation of energy crops that supply the feedstock for biofuel production. A possibility would be to use Ferula communis that is encountered in Cyprus and other Mediterranean countries, growing wild in pastures. Its flower stalks contain sugars and starch that were measured to be 0.50-0.55 kg kg -1, based on dry material. The ethanol is produced by fermentation of the juice extracted by crashing and pressing the flower stalks of the plant. The first stage of the process was cooking the juice at a temperature of 95 °C, combined by liquefaction and saccharification of the starch using enzymes, like alpha amylase and glucoamylase. The process was followed by fermentation of the juice for three days and finally distillation of ethanol. The alcohol yield per kilogram dry stalks was 55.8 cm 3 kg -1, compared to the theoretical value of 57.3 cm 3 kg -1, mainly due to the incomplete fermentation of the sugars. The plant seems to be a potential energy plant for ethanol production in arid regions cultivated on degraded land with minimal attention. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crop-derived first-generation biofuels are controversial because of their competition with food supplies and the uncertainty regarding their environmental performance. However, they are currently being used in practical applications, particularly because the second and third generation biofuels are not likely to replace them for another few years. In this study, we performed a life cycle assessment of 5 energy crops for bioethanol production in Japan to evaluate the improvements in breeding and cultivation practices. In addition, to determine the possibilities of first-generation biofuels, we analysed the contribution of different components to the crop cultivation system and the potential for improvements by constructing a regionalised database. The results showed that the introduction of yield increases are expected to significantly reduce the values for almost all evaluated environmental impact categories, together with disease-resistant varieties, direct seeding, reduced operations and the increased ratooning of sugarcane, primarily by reducing the input of materials per yield. Moreover, the results demonstrated the significance of combining multiple improvements in breeding and cultivation practices. We observed different relationships among the values between the crops under different impact categories, indicating the importance of a comprehensive assessment. A comparison between petrol and bioethanol showed unfavourable outcomes for bioethanol production and use on the environment, suggesting that further improvements are needed to ensure the potential of bioethanol production in Japan. These improvements will be accomplished by focusing on improvements in the environmental performance of particular factors such as reducing compost-derived ammonia discharge and decreasing nitrogen input through adequate fertilising. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolitic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as switchgrass and other agricultural residues, to bio-fuels is being considered for national energy security and for environmental advantages. Bio-oil, syn-gas and bio-char were produced and characterized from switchgrass at 400, 500 and 600°C by pyrolysis. Bio-oil yield increased from 22 to 37%, syn-gas yield increased from 8 to 26%, and bio-char yield decreased from 48 to 25% with increases of pyrolysis temperatures from 400 to 600°C. Bio-oil heating value was 36.3 MJ/kg, density was 920 kg/m3 and viscosity was 10 cST. GC-MS study indicated that the bio-oil contained 37% oxygenates that can be upgraded to transportation fuel in future research. Syn-gas compositional analysis shows that, with increasing pyrolysis temperature, CO2, CO, C 2H4 and C2H6 contents increased, whereas H2 and CH4 contents decreased. Part of the syn-gas consisting of H2, CO and CO2, when converted to syn-fuel, can be beneficial to the environment; sulfur free, presence of oxygenates results in less CO emissions and ozone to the atmosphere. Bio-char may be used as a co-product to enhance soil quality, and for carbon sequestration. Analysis of elemental composition and physical properties of bio-char show increase in carbon content, decrease in oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen content, and increase in surface area and pore volume with increases of pyrolysis temperature. The optimized pyrolysis process for bio-oil production in this study will help meet future goals of oil upgrading to produce transportation fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The climate impact of new cars in Sweden 2009 has been evaluated by the Swedish Transport Administration. Their report takes into account reduction factors to attribute the positive impact of renewable fuels on CO2 emissions. The Swedish Transport Administration recommends the public to buy cars that can run on biofuels. Besides acknowledging prevailing uncertainties for many of the input parameters to the index of new cars' climate impact, reduction factors are based on calculations from point estimates of input parameters. A probabilistic re-assessment of the index is presented to find out the importance of these uncertainties and to assess whether the point estimated recommendation might be misguiding. Probabilistic reduction factors for CO2 emissions were derived with the same deterministic model proposed by the Swedish Transport Administration, were Bayesian probability distributions or intervals assigned by expert judgements were used to describe uncertainty in the model input parameters. The use of biofuels most likely reduces CO2 emissions. Probabilistic modelling indicated a CO2 reduction for E85 as a fuel of 30% (95% credibility interval=10-52%) in the same order as the 20% given by the Swedish Transport Administration. The best estimate of 28% decrease for gas cars (95% credibility interval=3-44%) and is lower than the originally proposed reduction of 42%, but still within a similar range. The difference is due to the large extent of optimistic values used in the assessment by the Swedish Transport Administration. The CO2 emissions from the production of the biofuel had most influence on the model results. We conclude that the recommendation of the Swedish Transport Administration to consumers is still valid after probabilistic recalculation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 'Land grab' has become a catch-all phrase to refer to the current explosion of (trans)national commercial land transactions mainly revolving around the production and export of food, animal feed, biofuels, timber and minerals. Two key dimensions of the current land grab - namely, the politics of changes in land use and property relations change (and the links between them) - are not sufficiently explored in the current literature. We attempt to address this gap by offering a preliminary analysis through an analytical approach that suggests some typologies as a step towards a fuller and better understanding of the politics of global land grabbing. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The removal and determination of trimethylsilanol (TMSOH) in landfill gas has been studied before and after the special E3000-ITC System. The system works according to principle of temperature swing. The performance of TMSOH and humidity removal was 20% and more than 90%, respectively. The six of active carbons and impinger method were tested on the full-scale landfill in Poland for TMSOH and siloxanes determination. The extraction method and absorption in acetone were used. The concentration of TMSOH and siloxanes were found in range from 23.6 to 29.2mg/m 3 and from 18.0 to 38.9mg/m 3, respectively. The content of TMSOH in biogas originating from landfill was 41% out of all siloxanes. Moreover, the used system is alternative to other existing technique of landfill gas purification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy is one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing sectors of the global energy economy. The use of food crops for conversion to biofuel has been criticized for several reasons, among which its competition with the global food chain. Instead, lignocellulosic substrates are claimed to provide a bioenergy alternative without competing with food demand. This is particularly true when dealing with residues or waste. In this paper, we explored the environmental performance and sustainability of a bioenergy production system that integrates wastewater treatment, willow farming, and a Combined Heat and Power plant (CHP) located in Enköping (Sweden). Several methodologies for environmental assessment are integrated in this study within a life cycle perspective to investigate material and energy requirements as well as emissions and related impacts of the whole bioenergy production chain. Results show that full integration of different subsystems of a productive network is a desirable option for bioenergy production, within a zero emission oriented production pattern. The investigated wood biomass powered CHP plant was able to co-generate heat and electricity with high production efficiency and much better environmental performance and sustainability than fossil fuel based power plants. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) is a native grass of the North American tallgrass prairie, used as a forage crop and as a possible biofuel feedstock. Understanding the genetic diversity of big bluestem can enable better classification of accessions and increase the ability to recognize unique genetic variation for use within breeding programs. Previous studies of the genetic diversity of big bluestem have generated mixed conclusions; further study is warranted to provide clarifi cation of the genetic structure. Genetic diversity was measured both among and within three groups of big bluestem populations: natural populations collected in Wisconsin, natural populations from the northeastern United States, and cultivars or accessions available through various gene banks (mostly originating in the Great Plains). A total of 417 amplifi ed fragment length polymorphism loci were used for principal coordinate analysis, analysis of molecular variance, and Mantel tests. Results indicate that germplasm groups represent three distinct genetic pools with overlapping regions. Partitioning of genetic variance for each of the three groups revealed signifi cant variance among ecoregions and hardiness zones and among populations within ecoregions and hardiness zones. Unique big bluestem germplasm is present outside of the Great Plains, providing opportunities to increase genetic variation within breeding germplasm. Efforts should be made to preserve these genetic resources. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - The present study describes production of bio-ethanol from fresh red alga, Kappaphycus alvarezii. It was crushed to expel sap - a biofertilizer - while residual biomass was saccharified at 100°C in 0.9N H 2SO 4. The hydrolysate was repeatedly treated with additional granules to achieve desired reducing sugar concentration. The best yields for saccharification, inclusive of sugar loss in residue, were 26.2% and 30.6% (w/w) at laboratory (250g) and bench (16kg) scales, respectively. The hydrolysate was neutralized with lime and the filtrate was desalted by electrodialysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCIM 3523) was used for ethanol production from this non-traditional bio-resource. Fermentation at laboratory and bench scales converted ca. 80% of reducing sugar into ethanol in near quantitative selectivity. A petrol vehicle was successfully run with E10 gasoline made from the seaweed-based ethanol. Co-production of ethanol and bio-fertilizer from this seaweed may emerge as a promising alternative to land-based bio-ethanol. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Preparation of activated carbon has been attempted using KOH as activating agent by microwave heating from biodiesel industry solid residue, oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFBAC). The significance of chemical impregnation ratio (IR), microwave power and activation time on the properties of activated carbon were investigated. The optimum condition has been identified at the IR of 1.0, microwave power of 600W and activation time of 7min. EFBAC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. The surface chemistry was examined by zeta potential measurement, determination of surface acidity/basicity, while the adsorptive property was quantified using methylene blue as dye model compound. The optimum conditions resulted in activated carbon with a monolayer adsorption capacity of 395.30mg/g and carbon yield of 73.78%, while the BET surface area and total pore volume were corresponding to 1372m 2/g and 0.76cm 3/g, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) is a promising crop for biodiesel production that avoids many of the potential pitfalls of traditional biofuel crops, such as land use change (LUC) and food versus fuel. In this study the environmental viability of camelina biodiesel was assessed using life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology. The LCA was conducted using the spreadsheet model dubbed KABAM. KABAM found that camelina grown as a niche filling crop (in rotation with wheat or as a double crop) reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel use by 40-60% when compared to petroleum diesel. Furthermore, by avoiding LUC emissions, camelina biodiesel emits fewer GHGs than traditional soybean and canola biodiesel. Finally, a sensitivity analysis concluded that in order to maintain and increase the environmental viability of camelina and other niche filling biofuel crops, researchers and policy makers should focus their efforts on achieving satisfactory yields (1000-2000. kg/ha) while reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard calls for 136 billion liters of renewable fuels production by 2022. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has emerged as a leading candidate to be developed as a bioenergy feedstock. To reach biofuel production goals in a sustainable manner, more information is needed to characterize potential production rates of switchgrass. We used switchgrass yield data and general additive models (GAMs) to model lowland and upland switchgrass yield as nonlinear functions of climate and environmental variables. We used the GAMs and a 39-year climate dataset to assess the spatio-temporal variability in switchgrass yield due to climate variables alone. Variables associated with fertilizer application, genetics, precipitation, and management practices were the most important for explaining variability in switchgrass yield. The relationship of switchgrass yield with climate variables was different for upland than lowland cultivars. The spatio-temporal analysis showed that considerable variability in switchgrass yields can occur due to climate variables alone. The highest switchgrass yields with the lowest variability occurred primarily in the Corn Belt region, suggesting that prime cropland regions are the best suited for a constant and high switchgrass biomass yield. Given that much lignocellulosic feedstock production will likely occur in regions with less suitable climates for agriculture, interannual variability in yields should be expected and incorporated into operational planning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Policy makers in the agricultural sector are confronted with challenges which might drive land use change and ultimately agricultural profitability to a substantial degree. The challenges include questions around climate variability, demographic changes, use of land for bio-fuel production and ensuring an increase in food production. As profitability triggers many agri-business decisions, knowledge about the existing socio-economic landscape and the economic profile of a region as well as potential impacts on profits provides useful contextual information when agricultural policies are designed. Given the upcoming challenges and their associated uncertainties, it is important to ensure that a map of agricultural profit can be reproduced in a scenario and simulation setting which will allow exploring uncertainties around the impacts on agricultural profits as well. There is however currently no flexible system in operation which allows for a consistent update of a map of agricultural profits in Australia or elsewhere. This paper describes a process that has been developed to produce a map of agricultural profit for Australia for the year 2005/2006. The process involves a complex data architecture that accounts for heterogeneous information that is collected by a variety of institutions across different scales. All information can be comfortably queried and query results can be forwarded for immediate processing and subsequent visualisation in a geographic information system (GIS). To facilitate the production of profit maps in the future, the system provides flexibility regarding an update of new economic information but it can also be linked to maps that show an updated distribution of land use. A map of agricultural profit on a large scale and regular updates thereof will help understand profit trends in time and across space. It will help identifying regions that have a lower economic profile and will inform decisions regarding the design of regulatory policies. As these maps are developed using national scale data, we do not recommend using the results at the farm level but we suggest using separate catchment scale profit assessments to calibrate the national scale profit map. The proposed system is well suited to be used in various land use management and economic scenarios and will represent a step forward regarding a scenario impact assessment on agricultural profits. It will also help understand the economic benefit of land use on a large scale. © 2011.

AB  - Interest in bioenergy in recent years has been stimulated by both energy security and climate change concerns. Fuels derived from agricultural crops offer the promise of reducing energy dependence for countries that have traditionally been dependent on imported energy. Nevertheless, it is evident that the potential for biomass production is heavily dependent on the availability of land and water resources. Furthermore, capacity expansion through land conversion is now known to incur a significant carbon debt that may offset any benefits in greenhouse gas reductions arising from the biofuel life cycle. Because of such constraints, there is increasing use of non-local biomass through regional trading. The main challenge in the analysis of such arrangements is that individual geographic regions have their own respective goals. This work presents a multi-region, fuzzy input-output optimization model that reflects production and consumption of bioenergy under land, water and carbon footprint constraints. To offset any local production deficits or surpluses, the model allows for trade to occur among different regions within a defined system; furthermore, importation of additional biofuel from external sources is also allowed. Two illustrative case studies are given to demonstrate the key features of the model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Indonesia, the high subsidy on fossil fuel significantly burdens the country's economy. The partial replacement of fossil fuel by biofuel in the transportation sector would significantly reduce fossil oil consumption. To enable this replacement, a model was built to predict the effects of biofuel in the energy system. This paper examines the importance of technological changes in biofuel production. The objective is to find the optimal net energy balance under land and technology constraints. An optimization model to find this optimum was developed by using GAMS as a tool to provide the optimal answer about the potential of biofuel production in Indonesia in a scenario of technology development and a base scenario. The model shows that a net energy balance can be achieved with up to 3.8. kPJ in the technology scenario and 0.9. kPJ in the base scenario (a scenario describing present government policy). The export value could rise to 33 billion US$ in the technology scenario. In the base scenario, the export value of biofuel drops from 7 billion US$ in 2023 and further declines thereafter due to the low growth in land allocation whilst domestic demand is increasing. The lowest production cost is achieved with palm oil production at 9.5 US$/GJ in 2025. The net emission balance in the base scenario could achieve 54. Mtce, while in the technology scenario it could achieve 212. Mtce. The technology scenario relies on technological changes through R&D and economies of scale, which are not considered in the base scenario. The outcome of the model is that technological changes could have a positive impact on the introduction of biofuel in the transportation sector in Indonesia, i.e.: a higher net energy balance, higher export value, lower production cost and higher net emission balance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study uses a site-specific life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental profile and energy and water demand of potential production options for rapeseed biodiesel in Chile. The first step is the analysis of the biodiesel supply chain in a standard scenario, associated with the most likely production conditions. The second step is the evaluation of the following alternative scenarios related to a production strategy involving low-impact or renewable resources: (1) Addition of livestock manure as organic fertilizer, (2) Use of degraded grassland, (3) Biodiesel transport by rail, and (4) Use of forest residues for industrial steam. The results show that the biodiesel in the standard scenario has less environmental impacts than fossil diesel in 4 of the 13 indicators evaluated. The rapeseed production is the stage with the highest contribution to impacts. The scenario 1 presents the best environmental profile. The scenario 2 reduces the greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel. The scenarios 3 and 4 moderately improve the profile of the biofuel. The four situations could be implemented in the short term, but should be backed up by economic and social studies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Remarkable research has been carried out in the past decade in the field of biofuels in general and, more specifically, in the feasibility of their production. A number of studies have been published that focus on the viability of the investments on biodiesel production plants from a technical-economic perspective. The common characteristic of these studies is that they refer to medium to large-scale production plants. The principal aim of this study is to investigate the viability of a small-scale biodiesel production plant investment in Greece determining the factors and figures that rule the economics of such a plant. Having in mind that a small-scale plant offers greater opportunities for rural development and decentralization as well as that rural development is a focal point in the Greek economy, the financial performance of a small-scale biodiesel plant in Crete Island is analysed in the present work. It is believed that the results obtained may prove very useful in determining the technical and financial characteristics and parameters of similar production facilities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of alternative fuels from microalgae involves lengthy processing steps. Cell disruption is an integral part of the downstream pool of unit operations as it facilitates the release of intracellular products essential for biofuel production. This study investigated the use of high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonication, bead beating, and sulfuric acid treatment as laboratory-scale disruption methods for microalgal cells. The performance of each cell disruption method was evaluated in terms of two key indicators: reduction in the intact cell count and reduction in the average colony diameter. The microalgal strain, Chlorococcum sp., was used throughout the study. The most effective disruption was obtained using high-pressure homogenization (average disruption = 73.8% of initial intact cells) followed by sulfuric acid treatment (average disruption = 33.2% of initial intact cells) and bead beating (average disruption = 17.5% of initial intact cells). Even though ultrasonication failed to disrupt the microalgal cells under the investigated conditions (average disruption = 4.5% of initial intact cells), it still managed to disintegrate cellular colonies. © 2011 .

AB  - Consumption of natural resources should not exceed sustainable levels. The increasing use of biofuels and to some extent biomaterials, on top of rising food and feed demands, is causing countries to use a growing amount of global land, which may lead to land use conflicts and the expansion of cropland and intensive cultivation at the expense of natural ecosystems. Selective product certification cannot control the land use change triggered by growing overall biomass consumption. We propose a comprehensive approach to account for the global land use of countries for their domestic consumption, and assess this level with regard to globally acceptable levels of resource use, based on the concept of safe operating space. It is shown that the European Union currently uses one-third more cropland than globally available on a per capita basis and that with constant consumption levels it would exceed its fair share of acceptable resource use in 2030. As the use of global forests to meet renewable energy targets is becoming a concern, an approach to account for sustainable levels of timber flows is also proposed, based on the use of net annual increment, exemplified with preliminary data for Switzerland. Altogether, our approach would integrate the concept of sustainable consumption into national resource management plans; offering a conceptual basis and concrete reference values for informed policy making and urging countries to monitor and adjust their levels of resource consumption in a comprehensive way, respectful of the limits of sustainable supply. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel, which is manufactured from vegetables oils, animal fats, or algae can be an excellent alternative fuel to petroleum diesel due to its superior fuel properties and lower pollutant emissions. In contrast, fishing-boat fuel generally has much poorer fuel properties and a high sulfur content that can reach several hundred times that of the premium diesel used in land-based vehicles. Pollutant emissions from fishing boats are known to be a significant source of air pollution in the global environment. This study examines the use of biodiesel to replace fishing-boat fuel A to reduce pollutant emissions from fishing boats. The incremental cost, reduction in emissions, and cost-benefit corresponding to various weight proportions of biodiesel to replace fishing-boat fuel A are evaluated. The results show that the annual consumption of fishing-boat fuel A by Taiwanese fishing boats amounts to 649,201 kiloliters (kl) and total emissions from burning the fuel is 958.93 tons per year. If all fishing-boat fuel A were replaced with biodiesel, then pollutant emissions would be decreased by 421.94 tons, or 44.0%. However, this would also result in a USD 144.45 million or 25.85% increase in fuel cost. This study also finds that a replacing 20. wt% of fishing-boat fuel A with biodiesel has the highest cost-benefit ratio, which implies a larger reduction in emissions with a lower fuel cost increase, and is the most suitable option for fishing boats in Taiwan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
