AB  - Environmental impact assessment is a crucial aspect of biofuels production to ensure that the process generates emissions within the designated limits. In typical cellulosic biofuel production process, the pretreatment and downstream processing stages were reported to require a high amount of chemicals and energy, thus generating high emissions. Cellulosic butanol production while using low moisture anhydrous ammonia (LMAA) pretreatment was expected to have a low chemical, water, and energy footprint, especially when the process was combined with more efficient downstream processing technologies. In this study, the quantification of environmental impact potentials from cellulosic butanol production plants was conducted with modeled different pretreatment and product separation approaches. The results have shown that LMAA pretreatment possessed a potential for commercialization by having low energy requirements when compared to the other modeled pretreatments. With high safety measures that reduce the possibility of anhydrous ammonia leaking to the air, LMAA pretreatment resulted in GWP of 5.72 kg CO2 eq./L butanol, ecotoxicity potential of 2.84 × 10−6 CTU eco/L butanol, and eutrophication potential of 0.011 kg N eq./L butanol. The lowest energy requirement in biobutanol production (19.43 MJ/L), as well as better life-cycle energy metrics performances (NEV of 24.69 MJ/L and NER of 2.27) and environmental impacts potentials (GWP of 3.92 kg N eq./L butanol and ecotoxicity potential of 2.14 × 10−4 CTU eco/L butanol), were recorded when the LMAA pretreatment was combined with the membrane pervaporation process in the product separation stage. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Programmed cell death (PCD) induced by acetic acid, the main by-product released during cellulosic hydrolysis, cast a cloud over lignocellulosic biofuel fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and became a burning problem. Atg22p, an ignored integral membrane protein located in vacuole belongs to autophagy-related genes family; prior study recently reported that it is required for autophagic degradation and efflux of amino acids from vacuole to cytoplasm. It may alleviate the intracellular starvation of nutrition caused by Ac and increase cell tolerance. Therefore, we investigate the role of atg22 in cell death process induced by Ac in which attempt is made to discover new perspectives for better understanding of the mechanisms behind tolerance and more robust industrial strain construction. Results: In this study, we compared cell growth, physiological changes in the absence and presence of Atg22p under Ac exposure conditions. It is observed that disruption and overexpression of Atg22p delays and enhances acetic acid-induced PCD, respectively. The deletion of Atg22p in S. cerevisiae maintains cell wall integrity, and protects cytomembrane integrity, fluidity and permeability upon Ac stress by changing cytomembrane phospholipids, sterols and fatty acids. More interestingly, atg22 deletion increases intracellular amino acids to aid yeast cells for tackling amino acid starvation and intracellular acidification. Further, atg22 deletion upregulates series of stress response genes expression such as heat shock protein family, cell wall integrity and autophagy. Conclusions: The findings show that Atg22p possessed the new function related to cell resistance to Ac. This may help us have a deeper understanding of PCD induced by Ac and provide a new strategy to improve Ac resistance in designing industrial yeast strains for bioethanol production during lignocellulosic biofuel fermentation. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Wastewater biological treatment with microalgae can be an effective technology, removing nutrients and other contaminants while reducing chemical oxygen demand. This can be particularly interesting for the meat producing industry which produces large volumes of wastewater from the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of their facilities. The main purpose of this research was the treatment of poultry wastewater using Scenedesmus obliquus in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. Two wastewaters were collected from a Portuguese poultry slaughterhouse (poultry raw–PR and poultry flocculated–PF) and the bioremediation was evaluated. The performance of microalga biomass growth and biochemical composition were assessed for two illumination sources (fluorescent vs LEDs). S. obliquus achieved positive results when grown in highly contaminated agro-industrial wastewater from the poultry industry, independently of the light source. The wastewater bioremediation revealed results higher than 97% for both ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency, for a cultivation time of 13 days. The saponifiable matter obtained from the biomass of the microalga cultures was, on average, 11% and 27% (m/malga) with PR and PF wastewater, respectively. In opposition, higher sugar content was obtained from microalgae biomass grown in PR wastewater (average 34% m/malga) in comparison to PF wastewater (average 23% m/malga), independently of the illumination source. Therefore, biomass obtained with PR wastewater will be more appropriate as a raw material for bioethanol/biohydrogen production (higher sugar content) while biomass produced in PF wastewater will have a similar potential as feedstock for both biodiesel and bioethanol/biohydrogen production (similar lipid and sugar content). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Heterotrophic soil respiration (RH) is the primary pathway of carbon (C) loss from litter and soil organic matter, and thus RH partially determines ecosystem C storage. Because RH is sensitive to soil temperature and moisture, aboveground factors that influence soil microclimate, such as plant structure and residue management, may in turn affect belowground C loss via RH, but this relationship has not been quantified. We examined multiyear soil microclimate differences to 1-m depth, measured seasonal trends of RH, and parameterized crop-specific microclimate-RH models to quantify the effect of soil microclimate differences on annual RH in temperate no-till maize and switchgrass bioenergy cropping systems. Summertime soil temperatures were typically warmer in maize compared to switchgrass, likely resulting from lower leaf area index (LAI) in maize. In contrast, winter soil temperatures were usually warmer in switchgrass than maize, due in part to more consistent snow retention within the switchgrass litter stubble. Daily soil temperature ranges were less extreme in the perennial switchgrass system compared to the annual no-till maize system. Soil moisture near the soil surface was usually lower in maize than switchgrass, but the opposite was true below about 50 cm. RH showed strong seasonal trends, with warmer and drier soil conditions generally leading to higher RH in both crops. Modeled scenarios indicated that the differences in crop-specific soil microclimates accounted for 4 to 17% of the annual RH flux, with the dominant soil microclimate effects on RH occurring during the summer. Thus, the soil microclimate serves as a strong coupling between aboveground properties and belowground C loss via RH in temperate agroecosystems. Agricultural management practices such as planting date, plant density, and residue management could be targeted to promote soil microclimates that reduce RH, thereby reducing gaseous belowground C losses and potentially enhancing ecosystem C storage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nickel catalysts supported on palygorskite of varying Ni content were synthesized following the deposition–precipitation method. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques and evaluated in a semi-batch reactor for the transformation of waste cooking oils (WCO) into green diesel at 310 °C and hydrogen pressure 40 bar. The nickel nanoparticles supported on palygorskite were proved to be very active. The conversion of the WCO was about 100%. The green diesel content of the liquid product depends mainly on the nickel surface exposed per gram of catalyst, following a volcano like trend and maximized (81.9 wt %) over the sample with 30 wt % Ni. Taking into account the very high ratio of WCO volume to catalyst mass (100 mL/g) and that the evaluation of the catalysts was performed under solvent free conditions, these results demonstrate the successful use of mineral palygorskite for developing promising “natural catalysts” for green diesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3), common impurities in biogas, need to be removed before utilizing it. In this study, a combined system, which consisted of an absorption column and an electrochemical oxidation reactor, was tested to simultaneously remove these impurities. The effects of the current density and the chemical loading rate on the system performance were investigated. Firstly, the mass transfer coefficients for the absorption column were determined at various gas flow rates. More mass of NH3 was transferred, compared with that of H2S, because of its higher solubility. In the electro-oxidation reactor, reactive chlorine species (RCSs) were generated and oxidized both H2S and NH3; however, NH3 started to degrade only after H2S was completely eliminated. At a current density of 400 A/m2, the current efficiencies of H2S and NH3 were 23.1% and 5.9%, respectively. In the combined system, the removal efficiency of H2S was closely related to the mass ratio of the H2S transferred and the RCSs generated. The removal efficiency of H2S was greater than 99% when the ratio was less than 1. The mass transfer potential and the oxidation kinetics should be balanced to improve the system performance for the simultaneous removal of H2S and NH3. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The hydrotreatment of oleochemical/lipid feedstocks is currently the only technology that provides significant volumes (millions of litres per year) of "conventional" biojet/sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, if biojet fuels are to be produced in sustainably sourced volumes (billions of litres per year) at a price comparable with fossil jet fuel, biomass-derived "advanced" biojet fuels will be needed. Three direct thermochemical liquefaction technologies, fast pyrolysis, catalytic fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction were assessed for their potential to produce "biocrudes" which were subsequently upgraded to drop-in biofuels by either dedicated hydrotreatment or co-processed hydrotreatment. Results: A significant biojet fraction (between 20.8 and 36.6% of total upgraded fuel volume) was produced by all of the processes. When the fractions were assessed against general ASTM D7566 specifications they showed significant compliance, despite a lack of optimization in any of the process steps. When the life cycle analysis GHGenius model was used to assess the carbon intensity of the various products, significant emission reductions (up to 74%) could be achieved. Conclusions: It was apparent that the production of biojet fuels based on direct thermochemical liquefaction of biocrudes, followed by hydrotreating, has considerable potential. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Potential land-use change impact has been of concern for producing biomass-derived fuels. To avoid displacing crop production, this study considered north central and western U.S. nonirrigated wheat-growing states for integration of oilseed that fits well into rotations with existing grain crops for renewable jet fuel production. We conducted analyses showing oilseed supply and natural resource impacts based on 2326 9 km × 9 km grid cells in the U.S. Northern Great Plains and further examined the cradle-to-grave environmental impact based on inputs taken from a collection of biogeochemical, hydrological, farmer behavior, and biomass logistics models. Life cycle assessment results from this study show that introducing oilseeds to existing crop rotations for coproduction of food and renewable jet fuel has significant advantages in terms of global-warming potential compared to fossil jet (88 g CO2 eq/MJ), with considerable soil carbon savings from replacing the fallow period. The greenhouse gas emissions can be as low as -235 to -349 g CO2eq per MJ of jet fuel using displacement allocation, and -55 to -107 g CO2eq per MJ jet fuel using energy allocation, over the price points from $400 to $800 per Mg of rapeseed. Total net revenue from this land transition also creates opportunities to boost fuel oilseeds production and farmer incomes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Low carbon alternatives are an imperative for decarbonizing the transportation sector. There is growing interest in electrification of transportation but even with aggressive growth in sales, a significant share of transportation is expected to rely on liquid fuel by midcentury. Biofuels are appealing as low carbon fuels but those produced from food crops generate a food vs. fuel dilemma. We discuss the prospects for expanding biofuels, while mitigating the competition with food production though a transition to second generation biofuels from biomass as well as the potential for biotechnology to transform the agricultural sector globally to increase crop productivity and make biofuels and food production complementary. We highlight the role for policy, technological innovations, and institutions to achieve increased food and biofuel production. © 2019 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association

AB  - A study was conducted to estimate the possible environmental impacts arising from the generation of bioethanol from oil palm frond sugar juice in a theoretical oil palm based biorefinery model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) with the gate-to-gate approach was performed with the aid of SimaPro version 8.0 whereby ten impact categories were evaluated. The scope included frond collection and transportation, frond sugar juice extraction, and bioethanol fermentation and purification. Evaluation on the processes involved indicated that fermentation contributed to the environmental problems the most, with a contribution range of 52% to 97% for all the impact categories. This was due to a substantial usage of nutrient during this process, which consumes high energy for its production thus contributing a significant burden to the surrounding. Nevertheless, the present system offers a great option for biofuel generation as it utilizes sugar juice from the readily available oil palm waste. Not only solving the issue of land utilization for feedstock cultivation, the enzymatic saccharification step, which commonly necessary for lignocellulosic sugar recovery could also be eliminated. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Ethanol is an energy commodity and a biofuel that has contributed to mitigate the use of fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the environmental benefits derived from the use of ethanol can occur at the expense of the agricultural commodities prices, affecting their volatilities and efficiency. This problem occurs because most of the raw materials currently used to produce biofuels, such as corn in the US, sugarcane in Brazil and oilseeds in Europe, are also important global commodities. This work adopts several mathematical tools, namely the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, fractal dimension, and the Hurst and Lyapunov exponents. This set of tools measures the market efficiency and the prices' predictability for the ethanol and some agriculture commodities that revealed price transmission (cointegration), in a previous work. The results show that, in general, the ethanol has a lower predictability horizon than the other commodities. Moreover, it is discussed a quantitative measure to assess the market performance, by means of the efficiency index. We observe that the ethanol efficiency is similar to the other agricultural commodities evaluated. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The application of fuels from renewable energy sources for combustion engine powering involves a great demand for this kind of energy while its production infrastructure remains underdeveloped. The use of this kind of fuel is supposed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and the depletion of natural resources and to increase the share of renewable energy sources in total energy consumption and thus support sustainable development in Europe. This study presents the results of research on selected performance parameters of transport by internal combustion engines including: power, torque, the emission of sound generated by the engine, the content of exhaust components (oxygen O2, carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, nitrogen dioxide NO2), and the content of particulate matter (PM) in exhaust emission. Three self-ignition engines were tested. The fuel injection controllers of the tested internal combustion engines were additionally adjusted by increasing the fuel dose and the load of air. The material used in the tests were mixtures of diesel oil and fatty acid methyl esters of dierent concentration. A statistical analysis was performed based of the results. The purpose of the work was to develop a resulting model for assessing the operation of engines fueled with biofuel and diesel mixtures while changing the vehicle's computer software. A computer simulation algorithm was also developed for the needs of the tests which was used to prognose the state of the test results for variable input parameters. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Maize has great potential, especially as a substrate for biofuels production. The aim of this paper is to analyze the possibility of usage in methane fermentation maize straw harvested in different weather conditions, which had an influence on different physical parameters, mainly the dry mass content. The research has shown that maize straw harvested in Central-Eastern Europe can have a broad spectrum of dry mass content, which is related to diverse weather conditions during autumn. However, independently from moisture content, maize straw can be a good (for more wet material) or very good (for more dried straw) substrate for the biogas plant. With the methane productivity reaching 201-207 m3/Mg of fresh mass, this material is a significantly better substrate than that typically used in Europe maize silage (approximately 105 m3/Mg FM). It was noted that the retention time for maize straw (36-42 days) is longer than in the case of maize silage (less than 30 days). However, this difference is quite small and can be accepted by the biogas plant operators. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - One of the most crucial problems in today's world is food insecurity, with nearly 842 million people in the world are estimated to be suffering from not regularly getting enough and healthy food for their life. This issue is likely to be exacerbated by the rapid development of biofuel industry across the globe. Hence, this study investigates the implications of biofuels on food security in 51 developing countries from 2011 to 2016. Applying generalized method of moments (GMM), our results provide supportive evidence that biofuels worsen food security in developing countries. Although our undesirable result is in line with other few past studies, we believe that this result could be the short-term phenomenon and in the long-run, more win-win guidelines for the production of biofuels and food must be provided by the government. © 2019 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy

AB  - In this study, the growth and high-valued products accumulation characteristics of three common high-valued microalgae (Chlorella sp. HQ, Scenedesmus sp. LX1, and Chlorella vulgaris) in saline-alkali leachate were compared to select the species with greatest utilization potential. The results showed that after 28 days of cultivation, among three microalgae, Chlorella sp. HQ grew best with its maximum density at peak of 1.16 × 107 cells mL−1 and lipid production per unit cell (0.047 ± 0.006 × 10−7 mg cell−1) and lipid content (18.18 ± 3.14%) were largest. The triacylglycerol (TAG) yield and content of Scenedesmus sp. LX1 were the highest, reaching 0.005 ± 0.000 × 10−7 mg cell−1 and 19.74 ± 2.53%, respectively, which was slightly higher than those of Chlorella sp. HQ. According to comprehensive comparison, Chlorella sp. HQ was most suitable to grow in the saline-alkali leachate in terms of algal density, lipid yield, and content. The potential comparison and effects of salinity on the high-valued products accumulation of Chlorella sp. HQ compared with those in SE standard medium, reclaimed water, and tap water were further carried out. It was found that the density order of Chlorella was saline-alkali leachate &gt; SE medium &gt; reclaimed water &gt; tap water. And the Chlorella density in the leachate with a salinity of 0.14% was greater than the other three salinities (0.32%, 0.45%, and 0.6%) at the end of cultivation. While the maximum lipid yield per unit cell and lipid content of Chlorella occurred in the salinity of 0.6%, which indicated that high salinity promoted the accumulation of lipid. Furthermore, other high-valued products (including starch, protein, total sugar, and photosynthetic pigments) accumulation characteristics were analyzed and found that they were all superior than those in SE medium. And with the salinity decreased, the microalgal protein and starch contents decreased. The contents of photosynthetic pigment and total sugar reached a maximum at salinities of 0.32% and 0.45%, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In order to reach the renewable energy policy targets in the transport sector, biofuels from forest raw materials (e.g., harvesting residues) can play an important role. However, these raw materials are currently used in both the heat and power (HP) sector and the traditional forest industries. It is essential to understand how these sectors would be affected by an increased penetration of second generation (2G) biofuels. This study investigates price development and resource allocation in the Swedish forest raw materials market in the presence of 5–30 TWh of 2G biofuel production. Sweden is an interesting case study due to its well-developed forest industries and mature district heating sector, something which makes it a suitable country for future 2G biofuel production. A national partial equilibrium model of the forest sector is extended with a 2G biofuel module to address the impacts of such production. The simulation results show increasing forest industry by-product (e.g. sawdust) prices, thus displaying that the 2G biofuel targets lead to increased raw material competition. The higher feedstock prices make the use of forest biomass in the HP sector less profitable, but we find meagre evidence of substitution of fossil fuels for by-products. In this sector, there is instead an increased use of harvesting residues. Fiberboard and particleboard production ceases entirely due to increased input prices. There is also evidence of synergy effects between the sawmill sector and the use of forest raw materials in the HP sector. Higher by-product prices spur sawmills to produce more sawnwood, something that in turn induces forest owners to increase harvest levels. Already in the 5 TWh Bio-SNG scenario, there is an increase in the harvest level, suggesting that this by-product effect kicks in from start. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phytoremediation potential of Miscanthus sinensis and its impacts on soil microbial community and nutrients were evaluated by pot experiment at soil mercury concentration from 1.48 to 706 mg kg−1. The changes in biomass yield in dry mass, chlorophyll content, and SOD activity indicated Miscanthus sinensis was tolerant to higher levels of soil mercury exposure, and could grow even if at soil mercury up to 706 mg kg−1. Mercury bioconcentration and translocation factors were close to or greater than 1 when exposed to soil mercury up to 183 mg kg−1, demonstrating Miscanthus sinensis a potential phytoremediator for mercury-polluted soils. Miscanthus sinensis planting could significantly improve the diversity and abundance of soil microbial community, but might cause potential loss of soil nitrogen and phosphorus in the early and middle of its growth. In a word, the study indicated Miscanthus sinensis was a promising energy crop linking biofuel production and phytoremediation of mercury-contaminated sites. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgae constitute a heterogeneous and diverse group of organisms capable of accumulating high-value products under specific conditions, making them promising organisms for biotechnological applications in the nutraceutical, functional food, animal feed, biofertilisation or biofuel sectors. Recent studies have shown that most regions of the world display low to very low levels of nutritional intakes of the long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, highlighting the requirement for economically and environmentally sustainable means of raising the nutritional quality of foods and feeds. Eighty-five microalgae strains isolated from aquatic habitats in Ireland were successfully brought into culture and phototrophically grown, which was assessed for fatty acid composition using GC/MS. Hierarchical clustering grouped the strains into five assemblages based on their fatty acid profiles. Three marine strains (diatom cf. Stauroneis sp. LACW24, ochrophyte cf. Phaeothamnion sp. LACW34 and haptophyte Diacronema sp. GMC30) which could synthesise EPA and/or DHA were further studied in 15 L reactors to ascertain variation in their fatty acid profiles over a 65-day cultivation regime. The average yields of EPA were 3.9, 11.9 and 1.3 mg EPA / g DW for GMC30, LACW24 and LACW34, respectively. The average yields of DHA were 3.0 and 2.0 mg DHA / g DW for GMC30 and LACW34, respectively. The capacity of the strains to produce EPA and/or DHA, together with the fact that they have been previously shown to exhibit antioxidant activity and to contain appreciable levels of carotenoid pigments, make them potential candidates for the biorefining of high-value metabolites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chlorella vulgaris is a fast-growing fresh-water microalga cultivated on the industrial scale for applications ranging from food to biofuel production. To advance our understanding of its biology and to establish genetics tools for biotechnological manipulation, we sequenced the nuclear and organelle genomes of Chlorella vulgaris 211/11P by combining next generation sequencing and optical mapping of isolated DNA molecules. This hybrid approach allowed us to assemble the nuclear genome in 14 pseudo-molecules with an N50 of 2.8 Mb and 98.9% of scaffolded genome. The integration of RNA-seq data obtained at two different irradiances of growth (high light, HL versus low light, LL) enabled us to identify 10 724 nuclear genes, coding for 11 082 transcripts. Moreover, 121 and 48 genes, respectively, were found in the chloroplast and mitochondrial genome. Functional annotation and expression analysis of nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences revealed particular features of Chlorella vulgaris. Evidence of horizontal gene transfers from chloroplast to mitochondrial genome was observed. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomic analyses of LL versus HL provided insights into the molecular basis for metabolic rearrangement under HL versus LL conditions leading to enhanced de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and triacylglycerol accumulation. The occurrence of a cytosolic fatty acid biosynthetic pathway could be predicted and its upregulation upon HL exposure was observed, consistent with the increased lipid amount under HL conditions. These data provide a rich genetic resource for future genome editing studies, and potential targets for biotechnological manipulation of Chlorella vulgaris or other microalgae species to improve biomass and lipid productivity. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Jatropha curcas, an economically important biofuel feedstock with oil-rich seeds, has attracted considerable attention among researchers in recent years. Nevertheless, valuable information on the yield component of this plant, particularly regarding ovule development, remains scarce. In this study, transcriptome profiles of anther and ovule development were established to investigate the ovule development mechanism of J. curcas. In total, 64,325 unigenes with annotation were obtained, and 1723 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between different stages. The DEG analysis showed the participation of five transcription factor families (bHLH, WRKY, MYB, NAC and ERF), five hormone signaling pathways (auxin, gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinin, brassinosteroids (BR) and jasmonic acid (JA)), five MADS-box genes (AGAMOUS-2, AGAMOUS-1, AGL1, AGL11, and AGL14), SUP and SLK3 in ovule development. The role of GA and JA in ovule development was evident with increases in flower buds during ovule development: GA was increased approximately twofold, and JA was increased approximately sevenfold. In addition, the expression pattern analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that CRABS CLAW and AGAMOUS-2 were also involved in ovule development. The upregulation of BR signaling genes during ovule development might have been regulated by other phytohormone signaling pathways through crosstalk. This study provides a valuable framework for investigating the regulatory networks of ovule development in J. curcas. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Global primary production is driven largely by oxygenic photosynthesis, with algae as major contributors. The green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis reversibly switches off photosynthesis in the presence of glucose in the light and augments production of biofuel precursors (triacylglycerols) and the high-value antioxidant astaxanthin. Here we used forward genetics to reveal that this photosynthetic and metabolic switch is mediated by the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase (CzHXK1). In contrast to wild-type, glucose-treated hxk1 mutants do not shut off photosynthesis or accumulate astaxanthin, triacylglycerols, or cytoplasmic lipid droplets. We show that CzHXK1 is critical for the regulation of genes related to photosynthesis, ketocarotenoid synthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. Sugars play fundamental regulatory roles in gene expression, physiology, metabolism, and growth in plants and animals, and we introduce a relatively simple, emerging model system to investigate conserved eukaryotic sugar sensing and signaling at the base of the green lineage. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - There is a growing interest worldwide to search new, cheap and non-food biomass source for ethanol production. Bioethanol is a liquid fuel produced from renewable biomass source. In the present study, ethanol production from flowers of Madhuca latifolia trees was investigated by yeast strain isolated from milk whey. The isolated yeast was screened for fermentation ability by carbohydrate fermentation test and subjected to fermentation using M. latifolia flowers as substrate. The isolated yeast strain was identified as Pichia kudriavzevii on the basis of sequencing of D1/D2 domain of rRNA gene through basic local alignment search tool and molecular phylogenetic analysis. Maximum ethanol production, 371 g kg−1 from the flowers was achieved via optimizing operational parameters; a fermentation duration of 48 h, temperature 25°C, and pH 5.0. The effect of nitrogen supplements, enzymatic treatment and co-culture on bioethanol production with the optimized conditions revealed that the optimal condition could produce maximum ethanol without any supplementation or treatment. Co-culturing of P. kudriavzevii strain with Pichia stipitis NCIM 3497 was able to enhance ethanol production. The present study provides baseline information for further scale up of bioethanol production process on industrial level using M. latifolia flowers as a cheap and non-food biomass source. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Limited access to energy has led to interest in biofuels in most West African countries where Jatropha curcas (jatropha) has been the most widely studied energy crop. However, due to difficulties in obtaining enough jatropha seed at acceptable costs, Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) could be an alternative feedstock for biofuel production at lower costs. We report the results of a comparative study of the optimal supply cost and supply network configuration of a cultivated and a wild energy crop. These optimal items were determined using a mixed integer linear programming model designed to help decision making concerning biomass supply chains for biofuel production. The model was applied to a case study on jatropha and B. aegyptiaca seed supply chains in Burkina Faso. By considering different options for location and technologies used for pre-processing as well as different cropping systems for jatropha cultivation, the case study showed that in contexts like those found in Burkina Faso, a wild energy crop like B. aegyptiaca cannot be competitive compared to cultivated energy crops like jatropha because of its costly logistic operations. © 2019 International Energy Initiative

AB  - First generation bioethanol production can be sustainable if food wastes are used as feedstock. Novel to this study, it is estimated that Turkey's wheat, maize, rice and potato (i) production, (ii) consumption, (iii) production losses, (iv) consumption losses, (v) bioethanol yield from production losses, and (vi) bioethanol yield from consumption losses in 2030 could be (i) 25.0, 6.2, 0.6 and 5.5 million tonnes; (ii) 19.3, 1.5, 0.8 and 4.7 million tonnes; (iii) 1.375, 0.184, 0.006 and 0.094 million tonnes, (iv) 0.710, 0.182, 0.020 and 0.160 million tonnes, (v) 0.511, 0.073, 0.003, and 0.009 billion litres, and (vi) 0.264, 0.072, 0.009, and 0.015 billion litres, respectively. It is also estimated that in 2023 up to 0.555 and 0.335 billion litres of bioethanol can be collectively generated from Turkey's wheat, maize, rice and potato production and consumption losses, respectively. Finally, it is pinpointed that these amounts would be more than enough to supply Turkey's potential bioethanol (E10) demand in 2023. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a renewed interest in large-scale production of non-food energy crops in the UK to enable it to meet its renewable energy targets. There are strong indications that with increasing demand for biomass feedstocks, energy crops will be grown in arable farms alongside food crops. This raises environmental, socio-political and economic concerns on the energy-food-environment balance. It also raises a fundamental question on where and how much bioenergy crop could be cultivated in farms without adversely affecting food production and ecosystem services. Therefore, this research sets out to firstly ascertain whether the introduction of bioenergy crops in conventional farms could have beneficial or adverse effects on food production and the environment, and secondly, to explore various strategies through which bioenergy crops could be integrated in farms. Spatially explicit datasets and models were used to investigate the interaction of energy and food crops at the farm level, and associated effects over a 20-year period. Using appropriate biophysical and biomass indicators the impacts of were assessed. This study found that careful integration of Miscanthus in farms is beneficial as it reduces sediment and nutrient loss, and increases biomass yield, without adversely affecting food production. This research is significant as it demonstrates the potential of largescale production of bioenergy crops from fragmented sources. It also presented effective strategies through which bioenergy crops can co-exist with food crops, without leading to the food-energy-environment trilemma. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, molasses was used as binder for the pelletization of hydrochar to enhance the fuel and storage properties. The basic fuel properties of the pellets including the proximate analysis and the higher heating value (HHV) were evaluated. The compressive strength was assessed and binding surface of the pellets was analyzed by SEM and ZIESS microscope, and the moisture uptake and combustion properties were analyzed by TG. The results suggested that, with molasses addition from 10% to 20%, the HHV of pellets was decreased while the mass density and energy density of the pellets significantly increased to a range of 947.1–1301.9 kg/m3 and 23.55–33.40 GJ/m3, respectively. The “sold bridge” formation from molasses by recrystallization of sugar enhanced the tensile strength of the pellets, with 260–20% exhibiting the highest value (6.44 MPa), while the maximum load distance of the molasses pellets decreased. In addition, the molasses binder also delayed the moisture uptake rate and slightly increased the EMC content which depended more on the HTC temperature. The combustion analysis showed that the molasses binder decreased the ignition temperature (17–42 °C), and the maximum mass lose rate decreased about 0.6–0.8%/°C, indicating that molasses pellets was combusted in a moderate process. The results suggested that molasses binder assisted pelletization of hydrochar from food waste had potentials for the preparation as solid biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The air pollution of conventional fuels, increases the tendency to alternative cleaner fuels like biodiesel fuels. Biodiesel is an expensive fuel and can be used as an additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants released from diesel fuel. The proportion of biodiesel in the produced fuel can be planned and controlled according to the conditions. This study forms a comprehensive multi-objective-period model for designing a biodiesel development program and compares different biodiesel blends and primary resources. The study considers B5, B10, B20, B40, and B100 along with diesel as the candidate fuels for demand fulfillment; furthermore, model considers waste cooking oil, soya, sunflower, and rapeseed as the primary resources. The objectives are the facilities' implementation costs and environmental effects minimization. The decision variables are the capacity planning and the facility location variables. The exact Pareto set is obtained by using the augmented e-constraint method. The study considers economic and environment objectives interactions. Based on the results, B5 and B40 are the most appropriate options in the exact Pareto set; moreover, the results show the advantages of this approach to select the most appropriate fuels and primary resources according to different conditions during the studied period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of bioethanol from Miscanthus biomass has been studied for years, yet many important aspects still remain to be evaluated and optimised. It may be assumed that the three-year yield-building phase of Miscanthus growth would be sufficient for stabilisation of biomass composition to provide suitable biomass as a bioethanol feedstock. Such early biomass harvesting could be important for the economics of newly established plantations. This study shows the gradual stabilisation of biomass production by genotypes of M. × giganteus, M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus within the first three years of cultivation on moderately fertile soil, under the climatic conditions of west-central Poland. Photosynthesis, plant growth, biomass yield, and biochemical and elemental composition, simultaneously stabilised. The tested genotypes differed in their photosynthesis intensity and yield traits. There was little variation in the biochemical composition among genotypes; in comparison to Miscanthus cultivated in a more oceanic climate there was lower cellulose content, but higher lignin content. Aside from basal elements, the tested genotypes varied considerably in their accumulation of most macro- and especially microelements. The three-year old, winter-harvested technical biomass was used for pilot-scale bioethanol production including alkaline delignification and SSF technology. The particular biochemical components and elements in the biomass differently impacted the production process, yet for most genotypes the bioethanol produced was highly correlated with the cellulose:lignin ratio. The highest yield (g/kg DM) and efficiency (%) of raw bioethanol production were recorded for genotypes of M. sinensis (234–253 g/kg DM, 83–86%), followed by M. sacchariflorus (207–237 g/kg DM, 76–81%) and M. × giganteus (185–222 g/kg DM, 62–76%). However, biomass yield had a substantial effect on the estimated bioethanol production. The study pointed to the high potential for raw bioethanol production (4,400-5,600 L/ha) exploiting 3-year Miscanthus plantations, comparably for M. × giganteus and M. sinensis cultivated in a temperate transitional climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The attributes of environmental balance, lower exhaust emission and renewability have made ethylic biodiesel production a preferable technique to methylic biodiesel production from inedible lipid oil. Hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (HCR), in particular has engaged a global interest due to its flexibility and desirable biodiesel properties. For the first time, the study adopted HCR to produce ethyl esters (biodiesel) from low FFA rubber seed oil (RSO). The effects of transesterification variables namely catalyst dosage (KOH) (3–5 wt.%), reaction time (30–50 min) and ethanol/RSO molar ratio (3.5 7.0) were examined on the biodiesel yield. The yield of rubber seed oil ethyl ester (RSOEE) (92.5%) was the highest at the ethanol/oil molar ratio of 6/1, KOH of 4.5 wt.% and reaction time of 40 min. The cavitational yield for RSOEE production in the cavitation reactor was 4.13 g/J. The fuel properties of the RSO ethyl esters synthesized from the HCR were within the ranges of the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. However, the oxidation stability (OS) did not comply with the standards. To further improve the low OS, the antioxidant can be included in the RSOEE to enhance the OS to an acceptable limit (> 6 h). Therefore, the HCR can be a feasible reactor for the production of cleaner and renewable fuel from various feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Perennial grasses are promising feedstocks for biofuel production, with potential for leveraging their native microbiomes to increase their productivity and resilience to environmental stress. Here, we characterize the 16S rRNA gene diversity and seasonal assembly of bacterial and archaeal microbiomes of two perennial cellulosic feedstocks, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus). We sample leaves and soil every three weeks from pre-emergence through senescence for two consecutive switchgrass growing seasons and one miscanthus season, and identify core leaf taxa based on occupancy. Virtually all leaf taxa are also detected in soil; source-sink modeling shows non-random, ecological filtering by the leaf, suggesting that soil is an important reservoir of phyllosphere diversity. Core leaf taxa include early, mid, and late season groups that were consistent across years and crops. This consistency in leaf microbiome dynamics and core members is promising for microbiome manipulation or management to support crop production. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Allometric biomass equations were developed based on harvests of 198 trees from 15 field sites in the north-central USA, with the trees representing 4 hybrid poplar genomic groups and a total of 11 clones within these groups. Specifically, equations were developed to describe woody (branch + stem) total dry weight (TDW) as a function of diameter at breast height (DBH), along with hypothesis tests of differences among genomic groups and clones for equation intercepts and slopes. Inclusion of groups or clones improved model fit (r2 = 0.90 or 0.91, respectively) compared to the generic model consisting of only DBH (r2 = 0.85). Differences in equation parameters translated into significant differences among groups and clones for estimated TDW when compared at mean DBH (20 cm). Equations were also developed to describe branch-to-stem weight ratio (BSR) as a function of TDW and tree height (H), also with hypothesis tests of differences in intercepts and slopes among genomic groups and clones. Inclusion of genomic groups somewhat improved model fit (r2 = 0.57) compared to the generic model consisting of only TDW and H (r2 = 0.53), whereas model fit improved more markedly with the inclusion of clones (r2 = 0.75). Our results indicate that group- and clone-specific equations (rather than generic ones) are warranted for hybrid poplars, and that group-specific equations are adequate for estimating TDW whereas clone-specific equations are more appropriate for estimating BSR. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Mallee eucalypts are hardy, woody perennials that are being developed as a short-rotation coppice crop in Australia for the production of eucalyptus oil, biofuels and other biomass products. The economic viability of this prospective crop is dependent on its ability to survive and regenerate following repeated harvesting of the above ground component. Here we report on survival and biomass yield of mallee belt plantings of Eucalyptus polybractea, E. loxophleba ssp lissophloia and E. kochii ssp plenissima, at 19 sites, under two harvest-frequencies (3–8 year cycles) and harvest seasons (autumn or spring) over a decade from 2006 to 2015. 16 sites had post-harvest mortality ranging from 1.0% to 12.2% while the remaining three sites with either shallow saline water tables or a silcrete hardpan failed. Average site dry biomass yield across treatments ranged from 2.2 to 32.8 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Higher yielding sites were generally characterised by pH between 3.8 and 8, ECe below 15.0 dS m−1 and high soil fertility. Lower yielding sites were generally near saline valley floors. After 7-years, biomass yield from unharvested treatments exceeded the average cumulative yield of harvest treatments at eight of the 16 sites, including all three E. kochii sites. For E. loxophleba, significant interactions were found between season and frequency of harvest with highest yields in long rotation spring treatments. There were also interactions between site and frequency of harvest, which were mainly driven by the variable performance of the uncut treatment. On average E. loxophleba yielded more biomass following spring harvests whereas E. kochii yielded more following autumn harvests. E. polybractea yield was unaffected by season or frequency of harvest; however, harvest treatments yielded more biomass than uncut treatments. After 10 years, at eight of the nine sites subjected to three 3-year cycles, no decline in biomass yield was observed. The site that declined in production was attributed to depletion of a sandplain aquifer by extensive mallee plantings. Overall, the results from this decadal study indicate that in warm-temperate semi-arid areas, such as the south-west of WA, mallees biomass can be harvested sustainably at most sites even in short (3-year) rotation cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, the profit allocation problem, which was overlooked in the collaborative bioenergy and biofuel supply chain literature, is considered. The optimization model for the strategic and tactical planning of a bioenergy and biofuel supply chain is modified and a number of cooperative game theory allocation methods are evaluated for a case study of collaboration among three potential bioconversion facilities in British Columbia, Canada. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the stability of the methods with changes in parameters. The results show that the collaboration of three bioconversion plants would generate the highest profit compared with other coalitions. Based on the results, the savings from collaboration could improve the total net present value by 5%. The results highlight that the profitability and stability of collaboration are closely related to bio-oil market prices and demand. The proportional allocation methods hardly generate stable (efficiency and individual rationality) results. Therefore, caution should be taken about the frequent use of proportional methods for costs/benefits allocation by the industry. Instead, the nucleolus and equal profit methods are recommended as alternative methods since they are always stable regardless of variations in model parameters, such as bioproduct demand and prices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forests can mitigate climate change by sequestrating carbon in tree growth or producing energy wood. In this study, the impact of joint production of timber, carbon, and biofuel on forest management is evaluated with the Faustmann model and real options theory. The prices of the three outputs are allowed to evolve stochastically over time. The method is illustrated with a numerical application on pine forests in the southern United States. The analyses reveal that stochastic prices generally motivate landowners to harvest trees earlier, give them more speculation opportunities in the market, and bring higher land values with some uncertainty. Nonetheless, the quantity of carbon sequestered may not be optimized for the purpose of mitigating climate change when landowners maximize their profits. Policies related to forests and climate change will need to be assessed with a consideration of both the financial return to landowners and the welfare to the general public. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - European and United States' (U.S.) regulatory schemes mandate the use of biofuels based on estimates of life cycle GHG emissions that indicate their environmental superiority compared with conventional fuels. This paper analyzes the quality of the activity data used in calculating these estimates for Brazilian sugarcane and U.S. corn ethanol, in terms of completeness, reliability, and transparency. The findings demonstrate that it is impossible to determine the completeness of the data because the regulation's texts and related documents, and their sources fail to provide information on the representativeness or origins of the data. Moreover, there is no transparency about the sample from which data is extracted. To obtain this information it is necessary to review the literary sources referenced in the regulation's documents. Among the 37 sources of data examined in this analysis, 23 are no longer available, and only 3 sources contain information allowing for the characterization of the adequacy of the sample. In addition, none of the data items analyzed were subject to a verification process. These findings highlight the urgent need to modify biofuel regulation to set minimum standards for data quality and the reporting of data sources, paying particular attention to default activity data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Studies on microalgae species and strain selection have demonstrated the potential of a broad range of algal species suitable for large-scale mass production, but provided little data on the reliability and productivity of the cultures under outdoor conditions over a long period. Long-term studies as part of the development of large-scale microalgae mass production are essential at small scale to minimise expenditure in scaling-up and large-scale operations. The current study describes the long-term semi-continuous culture of 4 wild-type isolates of euryhaline Tetraselmis sp. grown in 1 m2 raceway ponds outdoors in 7% (w/w NaCl) saline water enriched with N and P without any additional carbon source under the environmental conditions in Perth, Western Australia. The long-term investigation indicated that Tetraselmis MUR-231 was not able to grow outdoors, while Tetraselmis strains MUR-167, MUR-230 and MUR-233 grew outdoors over long periods. Tetraselmis MUR-167 was cultured for over 16 months outdoors before terminated due to cell clump formation and heavy biofilm development on the pond walls, whereas Tetraselmis strains MUR-230 and MUR-233 were cultured in semi-continuous culture over 20 months. The latter two strains grew at high solar irradiance with daily maximum values of 58890 W m−2 and temperatures ranging from about 40 to 0 °C. Both strains had a similar average specific growth rate of 0.19 day−1 over the experimental period. Maximum biomass productivities were 9.11 g m−2 day−1 and 9.99 g m−2 day−1 for Tetraselmis MUR-230 and MUR-233, respectively. The maximum total lipid productivity of 4.30 g m−2 day−1 of Tetraselmis MUR-230 was slightly higher than Tetraselmis MUR-233 (4.05 g m−2 day−1). These results clearly indicate the potential of these two Tetraselmis strains for commercial application, such as a high lipid yielding feedstock under minimal culture management conditions in arid and semi-arid coastal regions such as northern Western Australia. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The aviation sector is currently responsible for 2.6% of global carbon emissions. Carbon emissions of the aviation sector are expected to increase by 3–4% each year due to the rising demand for air travel. The use of bio-jet fuel derived from carinata (Brassica carinata) is a potential solution for mitigating carbon emissions from the aviation sector. This study determines suitable sites for growing carinata across three southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Suitable edaphic (average soil storage, soil organic carbon, root zone depth) and climatic variables (temperature) along with historical land use trajectories were used for determining the land suitability for carinata production. The weights of the edaphic variables were decided by surveying experts using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. This study also determined the susceptibility of frost events in growing season of carinata from 2010 to 2017. Finally, the composite risk was calculated by multiplying the probability of potential damage risk and probability of land risk. Considering minimum risk level of 5%, about 45.56% (0.77 million ha) of land in Georgia, 0.81% (0.01 million ha) land in Alabama and about 3.04% (0.05 million ha) of land in Florida is suitable for growing carinata. Depending upon the composite risk level and expected carinata yields, the total production potential of carinata was between 1.87 and 3.91 million metric tons which was sufficient for producing between 980 and 2045 million liters of bio-jet fuel sufficient enough to replace 1.4%–2.33% of the current jet fuel consumption in the United States. Our study will feed into current policy debate about reducing carbon footprint of the aviation sector in the United States and promote development of bio-economy for rural America. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heavy metal-polluted soil is obtaining increasing global concerns. The phytoremediation is a promising technology that needs further research. This study was aiming to perform a field survey to assess the restoration and accumulation potential of five hybrid sweet sorghum species with high biomass. Those sweet sorghums were planted in three sites containing different toxic levels of Zn, Pb and Cd with one local commercial sweet sorghum as contrast sample. Plants and soils were sampled for the analysis of heavy metal concentrations. BCF and TF values showed that hybrid sweet sorghum species have higher accumulation ability than local one. Five species of hybrid sweet sorghum planted in all three sites showed no obvious toxicity symptoms, and moreover, their biomass were 12–24 times higher than that of the local one, indicating their high tolerance to heavy metals. Among them, the 9312 and G38 specimens were considered as the best-performing specimens due to their high ability to accumulate multiple metals in their shoots and roots without being affected by excessive metal contents. A reasonable disposed plan for harvested sweet sorghum after phytoremediation was proposed. The harvest sweet sorghums used for industrial ethanol and densified biofuel production could combine soil remediation with creating economic benefit. Consequently, those five hybrid sweet sorghum species, especially 9312 and G38 with high biomass production, metal accumulation ability and high tolerance against metal toxicity might have great potential in phytoremediation field. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As global temperatures continue to increase the move to renewable energy sources is becoming an essential step in achieving a sustainable future. Biofuels from microalgae, while still more expensive to produce than fossil fuels, are of great interest for the high microalgae biomass growth rates, high lipid content, relatively low water requirements, and ability to be grown on non-arable land. Botryococcus braunii is a freshwater green microalga which grows in colonies supported by an extracellular matrix (ECM) of liquid hydrocarbons. Recent studies have investigated the efficiency of non-destructive in situ solvent extraction of lipids from B. braunii with a variety of solvents. These lipids are encapsulated in a retaining wall coated by a sheath of amphiphilic fibrils which have been found to act as a barrier to solvents. By carrying out repeated in situ solvent extraction in a high shear environment, we found that access to the ECM can be significantly improved. Sustainable botryococcene and total lipid productivities respectively of 29.9 ± 8.5 and 71.3 ± 20.3 mg L−1 day−1 were achieved with heptane extraction, a shear rate of 415 s−1, initial culture density of 1.62 ± 0.12 g L−1, contact period of 4 h, and a recovery period of 3 days. Nutrient supplementation to replace those lost in the emulsion entrained biomass will be required to maintain a sustainable process. The combined presence of heptane with high shear proved to be an effective colony disruption method which could be an effective pre-treatment followed by a low shear, high solvent contact, and extraction method. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the isolation and characterization of three novel bacterial strains; Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Sphingobacterium multivorum, and Sinorhizobium, isolated form agriculture land. From three hundred strains of bacteria, the three isolates were identified for their superior diesel degradation ability by a series of bench-scale tests. The isolates were further investigated in bench tests for their ability to grow in different diesel fuel concentrations, temperature and pH; degrade diesel fuel in vitro; and for the identification of functional genes. Semi-pilot bioelectrokinetic tests were conducted in three electrokinetic cells. An innovative electrode configuration was adopted to stabilize the soil pH and water content during the test. The genes expressed in the diesel degradation process including Lipases enzymes Lip A, LipB, Alk-b2, rubA, P450, and 1698/2041 were detected in the three isolates. The results showed that the solar panel voltage output is in agreement with the trapezoid model. The temperatures in the cells were found to be 5–7 °C higher than the ambient temperature. The electrode configuration succeeded in stabilizing the soil pH and water content, preventing the development of a pH gradient, important progress for the survival of bacteria. The diesel degradation in the soil after bioelectrokinetic tests were 20–30%, compared to 10–12% in the controls. The study succeeded in developing environmentally friendly technology employing novel bacterial strains to degrade diesel fuel and utilizing solar panels to produce renewable energy for bioelectrokinetics during the winter season. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The identification of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) for efficient polysaccharide deconstruction is essential for the development of biofuels. Here, we investigate the potential of sequential HMM-profile identification for the rapid and precise identification of the multi-domain architecture of GHs from various datasets. First, as a validation, we successfully reannotated >98% of the biochemically characterized enzymes listed on the CAZy database. Next, we analyzed the 43 million non-redundant sequences from the M5nr data and identified 322,068 unique GHs. Finally, we searched 129 assembled metagenomes retrieved from MG-RAST for environmental GHs and identified 160,790 additional enzymes. Although most identified sequences corresponded to single domain enzymes, many contained several domains, including known accessory domains and some domains never identified in association with GH. Several sequences displayed multiple catalytic domains and few of these potential multi-activity proteins combined potentially synergistic domains. Finally, we produced and confirmed the biochemical activities of a GH5-GH10 cellulase-xylanase and a GH11-CE4 xylanase-esterase. Globally, this “gene to enzyme pipeline” provides a rationale for mining large datasets in order to identify new catalysts combining unique properties for the efficient deconstruction of polysaccharides. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Soil tillage for sugarcane production has a significant impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil carbon (C) stocks. However, the short- and long-term effects of different soil tillage methods in sugarcane systems on C footprints are still poorly studied. We conducted a field experiment in a sugarcane system to evaluate the effects of conventional tillage (CT), chiseling (CHI), no tillage (NT), and compacted no-till (NTC) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions and stalk yields in the cane plant cycle and on soil C changes in the short term (3 years) in a Brazilian subtropical climate. Furthermore, we used the DayCent model to predict soil C dynamics for the next 30 years under green harvest management in scenarios with 0, 50 and 75% straw removal and to estimate the C savings of different soil tillage methods. Soil C stocks were determined before the treatments were applied and 1, 2 and 3 years after planting sugarcane. GHG sampling was performed only 1 year during the sugarcane plant cycle. Soil tillage did not significantly affect sugarcane stalk yield. The CH4 fluxes ranged from − 58.2 to − 3.6 μg CH4 m−2 h−1, and annual emissions did not differ between soil tillage systems. The N2O fluxes after soil tillage for sugarcane ranged from 3.8 to 2279 μg N2O m−2 h−1, and the highest annual emissions were observed in NTC. The conversion from grain production system to sugarcane production resulted in an initial decrease in soil C stocks, with C losses in the 0–20-cm layer over 3 years varying from 0.26 to 2.12 Mg C ha−1. The simulated data for the period 2016–2046 indicated recovery of C stocks in all soil tillage systems, with accumulation rates varying from 0.01 to 0.10 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Regardless of the soil tillage system, straw removal decreased the soil C stocks. The time interval for recovery of the initial C stocks ranged from 10 to 20 years, depending on the intensity of straw removal and soil tillage. Soil C losses and GHG emissions reduced the potential C savings of sugarcane ethanol. The CO2eq emissions observed during soil tillage and the sugarcane growing cycle should be quantified and included in the C savings estimates of biofuel production systems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aerobic methane oxidation is catalyzed by particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), a copper-dependent, membrane metalloenzyme composed of subunits PmoA, PmoB, and PmoC. Characterization of the copper active site has been limited by challenges in spectroscopic analysis stemming from the presence of multiple copper binding sites, effects of detergent solubilization on activity and crystal structures, and the lack of a heterologous expression system. Here we utilize nanodiscs coupled with native top-down mass spectrometry (nTDMS) to determine the copper stoichiometry in each pMMO subunit and to detect post-translational modifications (PTMs). These results indicate the presence of a mononuclear copper center in both PmoB and PmoC. pMMO-nanodisc complexes with a higher stoichiometry of copper-bound PmoC exhibit increased activity, suggesting that the PmoC copper site plays a role in methane oxidation activity. These results provide key insights into the pMMO copper centers and demonstrate the ability of nTDMS to characterize complex membrane-bound metalloenzymes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Regionalization in life cycle assessment (LCA) aims to increase the representativeness of LCA results and reduce the uncertainty due to spatial variability. It may refer to adapting processes to better account for regional technological specificities (inventory regionalization) or adding of spatial information to the elementary flows (inventory spatialization) which allow using more regionalized characterization factors. However, developing and integrating regionalization requires additional efforts for LCA practitioners and database developers that must be prioritized. Methods: We propose a stepwise methodology for LCA practitioners to prioritize data collection for regionalization based on global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using Sobol indices. It involves several GSA to select the impact categories (ICs) that require further inventory data collection (IC ranking), prioritize between inventory regionalization and inventory spatialization (LCA phase ranking), and target specific data to collect. Then we propose a method to derive sector-specific recommendations using statistical tests to prioritize inventory regionalization versus spatialization and the ICs on which to focus inventory data collection. These recommendations are meant to help LCA practitioners and database developers define their strategy for regional data collection by focusing on data that have the highest potential to reduce the uncertainty of the results. Results and discussion: The applicability of the methodology is illustrated through three case studies using the ecoinvent v3 database and the regionalized impact methodology IMPACT World+: one on prioritizing data collection in a single biofuel product system and two meta-analyses of all product systems in two distinct economic sectors (biofuel production and land passenger transport). Recommendations for regionalization can be derived for an economic sector and appear to be different from one economic sector to another. GSA seems to be more relevant to prioritize regionalization efforts than an impact contribution analysis (ICA) approach often used to prioritize data collection in LCA. However, further improvements, such as accounting for spatial correlations and better computational times for GSA, are required to implement it in LCA. Conclusions: We recommend using the methodology based on GSA to efficiently prioritize regionalization efforts between ICs and between inventory regionalization and inventory spatialization. We proved that the implementation of IC ranking and LCA phase ranking is computationally feasible and therefore invite current LCA software providers to unlock this new horizon in LCA interpretation. We also invite to expand the meta-analysis to all sectors in an LCA database. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work explores the use of advanced thermal technologies for the conversion of refuse derived fuel prepared from MSW into clean syngas suitable for catalytic transformation into light hydrocarbon products. In particular, the possibilities for the specific production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons utilising a good quality syngas produced by two-stage plasma assisted gasification method are investigated. A number of catalytic tests were prepared with modified chemistry to evaluate the preliminary component activities on real waste-derived syngas. C1–C4 paraffins formed in all cases as a main products, with different product distribution for different conditions examined (up to 95% bioSNG on hydrocarbon product for supported nickel, 40% bioLPG for Cu–Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts mix). CO2 was the main byproduct with outlet concentrations ranging from 10 to 50% in volume. When increasing H2:CO in the syngas by external addition of hydrogen, CO conversion increases, as well as paraffin selectivity and hydrocarbons yield. Projections on a 65 MW thermal input bioSNG plant show that if 40 MW of electrical output from renewable sources are used to power a PEM stack during high power availability, the production of bioSNG could be increased by more than 33%, with a simultaneous reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 43%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change is undoubtedly altering the atmosphere, occasioning extreme temperatures that can cause weather calamities such as droughts and floods. Among the major constraints limiting crop production, drought is one of the most important. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) is considered an important economic crop not only for sugar production, but also for ethanol generation, serving as an expandable green alternative to crude oil use. To take advantage of the use of sugarcane as renewable source for bioethanol production, it is important to increase its productivity without increasing land use, which includes cultivation under hostile conditions, such as water-limited environments. Previously, we demonstrated that stress-inducible overexpression of the transcription factor AtDREB2A CA conferred drought tolerance in sugarcane subjected to water deficit under greenhouse conditions. In the present work, the AtDREB2A CA transgenic sugarcane lines were evaluated in the field in two representative seasonally dry regions of Brazil. The results demonstrated that the AtDREB2A CA sugarcane lines presented higher yield and productivity when compared to non-transformed plants under drought, representing a suitable strategy for the development of new drought-tolerant cultivars. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Stream CO 2 emissions contribute significantly to atmospheric climate forcing. While there are strong indications that groundwater inputs sustain these emissions, the specific biogeochemical pathways and timescales involved in this lateral CO 2 export are still obscure. Here, via an extensive radiocarbon ( 14 C) characterisation of CO 2 and DOC in stream water and its groundwater sources in an old-growth boreal forest, we demonstrate that the 14 C-CO 2 is consistently in tune with the current atmospheric 14 C-CO 2 level and shows little association with the 14 C-DOC in the same waters. Our findings thus indicate that stream CO 2 emissions act as a shortcut that returns CO 2 recently fixed by the forest vegetation to the atmosphere. Our results expose a positive feedback mechanism within the C budget of forested catchments, where stream CO 2 emissions will be highly sensitive to changes in forest C allocation patterns associated with climate and land-use changes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The benefits of shelter in increasing crop yields and accelerating ripening has been well researched in fruit, arable and horticultural crops. Its benefits to pasture, despite its importance for livestock production, is less well researched. In this work, Miscanthus shelterbelts were established on an intensively irrigated dairy farm. Seven key ecosystem services associated with these belts were identified and quantified. Pasture yield and quality were recorded in Miscanthus-sheltered and control field boundaries with little shelter. Pasture yield increased by up to 14% in the sheltered areas downwind of Miscanthus. Pasture quality was equivalent in the sheltered and open areas. Miscanthus provided more favourable nesting sites for bumblebees and for New Zealand endemic lizards (skinks) compared to field boundaries. The sheltered areas also had higher mineralisation rates of organic matter and higher numbers of earthworms. Using a high-yielding sterile grass such as Miscanthus to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services also produced a bioenergy feedstock. In conclusion, full benefits of shelterbelts to the farming system cannot be fully assessed unless direct and indirect benefits are properly assessed, as in this work. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of the study was to outline a global scheme for furthering mitigation of climate change in the Managed Forest subsector of the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector. The core of the study is an analysis of the emissions associated with the start-up of steady-state utilization of previously unutilized forest areas. Example forest growth curves are employed to demonstrate the dependence of the start-up emissions on the forest characteristics. In the case of fiber production, the start-up leads to an effective step-like increase in cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. In the case of biofuel production, a significant level of CO2 removal is attainable in the longer term, but, because of the start-up emission, there is usually an initial period of effective CO2 emission. The duration of this initial period has a strong dependence on the growth rate of the forest and the type of fossil fuel replaced. The results of the analysis were exploited in the compilation of a proposal for a global scheme aimed at mitigating climate change without unduly constraining forest utilization. In the scheme, increased forest utilization for the production of solid-wood products and fiber products would be penalized on the basis of the consumption of such products, while, in certain cases, increased forest utilization for biofuel production would be rewarded. Acceptable biofuel options were identified in the study. An example is the replacement of coal by wood chips originating from forest which has a growth rate at least as great as that of a typical boreal forest. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Excessive nitrogen runoff leads to degraded water quality, harming human and ecosystem health. We examine the impact of changes in land use and land management for six combinations of socioeconomic pathways and climate outcomes, and find that societal choices will substantially impact riverine total nitrogen loading (+54% to −7%) for the continental United States by the end of the century. Regional impacts will be even larger. Increased loading is possible for both high emission and low emission pathways, due to increased food and biofuel demand, respectively. Some pathways, however, suggest that limiting climate change and eutrophication can be achieved concurrently. Precipitation changes will further exacerbate loading, resulting in a net increase of 1 to 68%. Globally, increases in cropland area and agricultural intensification will likely impact vast portions of Asia. Societal and climate trends must therefore both be considered in designing strategies for managing inland and coastal water quality. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum is a good candidate organism for producing cellulosic biofuels due to its native ability to ferment cellulose, however its maximum biofuel titer is limited by tolerance. Wild type C. thermocellum is inhibited by 5 g/L n-butanol. Using growth adaptation in a chemostat, we increased n-butanol tolerance to 15 g/L. We discovered that several tolerant strains had acquired a D494G mutation in the adhE gene. Re-introducing this mutation recapitulated the n-butanol tolerance phenotype. In addition, it increased tolerance to several other primary alcohols including isobutanol and ethanol. To confirm that adhE is the cause of inhibition by primary alcohols, we showed that deleting adhE also increases tolerance to several primary alcohols. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgae of the genus Chlorella vulgaris are candidates for the production of lipids for biofuel production. Besides that, Chlorella vulgaris is marketed as protein and vitamin rich food additive. Its potential as a novel expression system for recombinant proteins inspired us to study its asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycans) by mass spectrometry, chromatography and gas chromatography. Oligomannosidic N-glycans with up to nine mannoses were the structures found in culture collection strains as well as several commercial products. These glycans co-eluted with plant N-glycans in the highly shape selective porous graphitic carbon chromatography. Thus, Chlorella vulgaris generates oligomannosidic N-glycans of the structural type known from land plants and animals. In fact, Man5 (Man5GlcNAc2) served as substrate for GlcNAc-transferase I and a trace of an endogenous structure with terminal GlcNAc was seen. The unusual more linear Man5 structure recently found on glycoproteins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii occurred - if at all - in traces only. Notably, a majority of the oligomannosidic glycans was multiply O-methylated with 3-O-methyl and 3,6-di-O-methyl mannoses at the non-reducing termini. This modification has so far been neither found on plant nor vertebrate N-glycans. It’s possible immunogenicity raises concerns as to the use of C. vulgaris for production of pharmaceutical glycoproteins. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Albania has historically been known to have an active but challenging drilling activity that demands the most innovative technology to develop, predominantly, medium-heavy oil reservoirs. Although recent efforts have been made by the government to stimulate and expand the largest onshore European oilfield, technical and economical obstacles are prevalent. These obstacles make it difficult to fully develop reliable and profitable hydrocarbon bearing zones in a downturn economy, especially since Albanian oil can be costly to produce and refine. Due to these typical issues that affect many local energy sectors, many developed countries diversify their energy production to avoid strict dependency on crude oil. An emblematic and modern option that is extensively gaining popularity in Europe focuses on renewable energy from sophisticated recycling programs. Although Albania is a relatively “green” country when it pertains to its electricity production (97% hydropower and 3% fossil fuels), it has yet to develop energy-recycling programs that it can salvage for self-sustainable energy sources. The past years have seen a conscious revitalization and stimulation in the mentality of green economy in Albania. But, in comparison to the rest of “western Europe” that are leading world examples in efficient recycling, it is significantly lagging with initial strides just now focusing on aligning national legislations with current EU models. Furthermore, two crucial reasons that should motivate Albania to investigate new applications for energy recycling are: (1) alternatives to crude oil and petroleum products that can be supplemental and provide stable access to fossil fuels; (2) industrial and municipal recycling via waste management to reprocess waste and produce industrial raw material-spawning the emergence of a “circular economy” to develop the backbone needed to strengthen the industrial and manufacturing markets for a self-sustaining economy. Accordingly, in this paper, the topic that will be addressed, given the recent decrease in oil & gas prices, focuses on the Albanian energy sector’s capability to sustain and develop a supplementary recycling program via “waste-to-fuel” (WTF) technology (biofuels and/or inorganic waste). With the intent that it could function cooperatively with Albania’s active drilling program to mitigate dependency on a single fuel source and produce enough fossil fuel in an effective and sustainable manner. © 2018, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Quantifying Populus growth and the impacts on hydrology and water quality are important should it be widely planted. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) tree growth algorithms and parameters for hybrid poplar in Midwestern US and cottonwood in Southern US were improved. Tree growth representation led to SWAT2012 code changes including a new leaf area parameter (TREED), new leaf area index algorithm, and leaf biomass algorithm. Simulated hybrid poplar LAI and aboveground woody biomass (PBIAS: 34 - 5%, NSE: 0.51–0.99, and R2: 0.72–0.99), and cottonwood aboveground biomass, runoff, sediment, and nitrate-N (PBIAS: 39 - 11%, NSE: 0.86–0.99, and R2: 0.93–0.99) from the modified SWAT were satisfactory. Improved algorithms, and parameter values and potential ranges for Populus were reasonable. Thus, the modified SWAT can be used for Populus biofeedstock production modeling and hydrologic and water quality response to its growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new genotype of Miscanthus sacchariflorus Geodae-Uksae 1, which was recently collected from damp land in South Korea, was pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor for bio-crude oil production. Comparing to woody biomass this has a remarkably economic advantage of very low water content, because it is collected after naturally dried in autumn. This biomass was ground and sieved to acquire the fine size less than 1 mm and fed into the reactor with feeding rate of 200 g/hr continuously. Four reactor temperatures, 400, 450, 500, and 550 °C were set to investigate the optimal temperature for highest bio-crude oil yield and quality. Proximate and ultimate analyses were done for both biomass and bio-crude oil to scrutinize the property change during the fast pyrolysis. Experimental results showed that the maximum bio-crude oil yield was obtained to be 51.88 wt% at the pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C. The maximum higher heating value (HHV) of bio-crude oil was determined to be 15.88 MJ/kg at 400 °C, which was similar to the original biomass. At the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, the moisture content of bio-crude oil was 19.46 wt% which was increased by 8.61 wt% than the original biomass. Overall fuel properties of miscanthus sacchariflorus Gedae-Uksae 1 was thought to be similar to the general woody bio-crude oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The application of biogas slurry as an organic fertilizer is a promising method for utilizing breeding manure wastewater. At present, the impact of biogas slurry on the properties of organic matter in soil is not clear. In this study, a pot experiment in which chemical fertilizers were replaced with biogas slurry from a swine farm was performed. The fluorescence spectra combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to explore the influence of biogas slurry on the protein and humic substance contents in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil. The results showed that there were two proteins (component 3 (C3) and component 4 (C4)) and two humic substances ( component 1 (C1) and component 2 (C2)) in the DOM of the experimental soil. The application of swine biogas slurry can significantly increase the content of DOM in soil, but the increase was weakened with extended time. Compared with the CKA, the biogas slurry significantly increased the C1, C2, C3 and C4 contents in the initial stage by 116.17%, 76.41%, 578.71% and 278.13%, respectively. Within 28 days of planting corn, proteins with simple molecular structure in the DOM in the soil began to be transformed into humic substances with high molecular weight and more complex molecular structures. On the 60th day, the contents of C1 and C2 in the DOM of the treated treatments soil increased by 13.72%–34.40% and 5.05%–17.78% respectively, and tyrosine content decreased by 90.11%–94.41%. This study provides a new perspective on the effects of biogas slurry application on soil properties and sustainable utilization of soil. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Plants that use crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have the potential to meet growing agricultural resource demands using land that is considered unsuitable for many common crop species. Agave americana L., an obligate CAM plant, has potential as an advanced biofuel crop in water-limited regions, and has greater cold tolerance than other high-yielding CAM species, but physiological tolerances have not been completely resolved. We developed a model to estimate the growth responses of A. americana to water input, temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The photosynthetic response to PAR was determined experimentally by measuring the integrated leaf gas exchange over 24 h after acclimation to six light levels. Maximum CO2 fixation rates were observed at a PAR intensity of 1250 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Growth responses of A. americana to water and temperature were also determined, and a monthly environmental productivity index (EPI) was derived that can be used to predict biomass growth. The EPI was calculated as the product of water, temperature, and light indices estimated for conditions at a site in Maricopa (Arizona), and compared with measured biomass at the same site (where the first field trial of A. americana as a crop was completed). The monthly EPI summed over the lifetime of multi-year crops was highly correlated with the average measured biomass of healthy 2- and 3-year-old plants grown in the field. The resulting relationship between EPI and biomass provides a simple model for estimating the production of A. americana at a monthly time step according to light, temperature, and precipitation inputs, and is a useful tool for projecting the potential geographic range of this obligate CAM species in future climatic conditions. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: The EU bioeconomy strategy aims to accelerate the European bioeconomy and its contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. National policies and strategies in many countries promote their bioeconomies. The importance of agricultural crops and residues as raw materials for the bioeconomy is increasingly recognised, but agricultural production also contributes to large impacts on nature and environment. With the aim of assessing the governance measures and their effectiveness in addressing the sustainability of bioenergy and biofuel production, the purpose of this study was to map the governance complex relevant to agricultural crop production in Denmark, and to identify the achievements, challenges and lessons learned. Methods: The analysis is based on a review and assessment of publicly available databases, inventory reports and scientific literature on governance measures and their effectiveness. Governance here includes a variety of legislation, agreements, conventions and standardisation. Environmental sustainability is represented by greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, soil carbon, water quality and biodiversity. Results: The agricultural sector has a significant impact on Danish climate performance and on landscapes in the form of soil carbon losses, leaching of nutrients to water bodies and pressures on biodiversity. The governance complex addressing these issues is made up of a variety of state regulation and co-regulation between state and firms, state and NGOs, or NGOs and firms. Much regulation is adopted from EU directives and implemented nationally. Conclusions: The analysis found that greenhouse gas emission is a virtually unregulated field and additional regulation is required to live up to Denmark's 2030 emission reduction targets. The regulatory framework for soil carbon is criticised for its complexity, its competing instruments and its recognition procedures of voluntary co-regulation. For water quality governance measures in place have improved water quality, but it is still difficult to achieve the goals of the Water Framework Directive. It remains a challenge to protect biodiversity in agriculture. Biodiversity is mainly governed by national and supranational regulation, but co-regulating between state and firms and NGOs and firms have been initiated in the framework of the Agricultural Agreement. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Pellet boilers and pellet stoves are widely used for heat production. But in most cases, only specific wood pellets with a low ash content are approved due to the increased risk of slagging and limited deashing capacity. The ash fusion test (AFT), according to prCEN/TS 15370-1, is currently the only standard method for the prediction of slagging. This method is not feasible for all biomass fuel types, since sometimes the characteristic temperatures cannot be determined or the characteristic shapes do not occur for temperature determination. Furthermore, the method is costly and requires complex instrumental infrastructure. Hence, a demand for more expressive or more rapid methods to characterize slag formation potential of fuels is often claimed. Based on a literature study, four such laboratory test methods were chosen, partly adapted, and then experimentally investigated. These methods included thermal treatment of the fuel itself or the ashes of the fuel and were the rapid slag test, CIEMAT, the slag analyzer, and the newly developed pellet ash and slag sieving assessment (PASSA) method. Method performance was practically assessed using 14 different biomass fuel pellets, which were mainly from different assortments of wood, but also herbaceous or other nonwoody fuels. The results from the tests with these four alternative methods were evaluated by comparing to both results from standard AFT and results from full-scale combustion tests performed over a maximum of 24 h. Seven different pellet boilers were assessed, of which one boiler was used to apply all 14 test fuels. According to the granulometric ash analysis (i.e., the ratio of >1 mm-fraction toward total ash formed), the sensitivity of the new test methods to depict slagging phenomena at a suitable level of differentiation was assessed. Satisfactory conformity of the boiler ash assessment (reference) was found for both, the slag analyzer and the PASSA method. The latter may, in particular, be seen as a promising and relatively simple low-input procedure, which can provide more real-life oriented test results for fixed-bed combustion. The standardized AFT could, however, not sufficiently predict the degree of slag actually formed in the reference boiler, particularly when only wood fuels are regarded.

AB  - Background: Sorghum bicolor (L.) is an important bioenergy source. The stems of sweet sorghum function as carbon sinks and accumulate large amounts of sugars and lignocellulosic biomass and considerable amounts of starch, therefore providing a model of carbon allocation and accumulation for other bioenergy crops. While omics data sets for sugar accumulation have been reported in different genotypes, the common features of primary metabolism in sweet genotypes remain unclear. To obtain a cohesive and comparative picture of carbohydrate metabolism between sorghum genotypes, we compared the phenotypes and transcriptome dynamics of sugar-accumulating internodes among three different sweet genotypes (Della, Rio, and SIL-05) and two non-sweet genotypes (BTx406 and R9188). Results: Field experiments showed that Della and Rio had similar dynamics and internode patterns of sugar concentration, albeit distinct other phenotypes. Interestingly, cellulose synthases for primary cell wall and key genes in starch synthesis and degradation were coordinately upregulated in sweet genotypes. Sweet sorghums maintained active monolignol biosynthesis compared to the non-sweet genotypes. Comparative RNA-seq results support the role of candidate Tonoplast Sugar Transporter gene (TST), but not the Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter genes (SWEETs) in the different sugar accumulations between sweet and non-sweet genotypes. Conclusions: Comparisons of the expression dynamics of carbon metabolic genes across the RNA-seq data sets identify several candidate genes with contrasting expression patterns between sweet and non-sweet sorghum lines, including genes required for cellulose and monolignol synthesis (CesA, PTAL, and CCR), starch metabolism (AGPase, SS, SBE, and G6P-translocator SbGPT2), and sucrose metabolism and transport (TPP and TST2). The common transcriptome features of primary metabolism identified here suggest the metabolic networks contributing to carbon sink strength in sorghum internodes, prioritize the candidate genes for manipulating carbon allocation with bioenergy purposes, and provide a comparative and cohesive picture of the complexity of carbon sink strength in sorghum stem. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Second generation biofuels, such as perennial grasses, have potential to provide biofuel feedstock while growing on degraded land with minimal inputs. Perennial grasses have been reported to sequester large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Midwestern United States (USA). However, there has been little work on biofuel and carbon sequestration potential of perennial grasses in the Southeastern US. Biofuel productivity for dryland Miscanthus × gigantus and irrigated maize in Georgia, USA were quantified using eddy covariance observations of evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon. Miscanthus biomass yield was 15.54 Mg ha−1 in 2015 and 11.80 Mg ha−1 in 2016, while maize produced 30.20 Mg ha−1 of biomass in 2016. Carbon budgets indicated that both miscanthus and maize fields lost carbon over the experiment. The miscanthus field lost 5 Mg C ha−1 in both 2015 and 2016 while the maize field lost 1.37 Mg C ha−1 for the single year of study. Eddy covariance measurement indicated that for 2016 the miscanthus crop evapotranspired 598 mm and harvest water use efficiencies ranged from 6.95 to 13.84 kg C ha−1 mm−1. Maize evapotranspired 659 mm with a harvest water use efficiency of 19.12 kg C ha−1 mm−1. While biomass yields and gross primary production were relatively high, high ecosystem respiration rates resulted in a loss of ecosystem carbon. Relatively low biomass production, low water use efficiency and high respiration for Miscanthus × gigantus in this experiment suggest that this strain of miscanthus may not be well-suited for dryland production under the environmental conditions found in South Georgia USA. © 2019

AB  - A steam explosion (SE) process was evaluated as a pretreatment method to achieve simultaneously the pretreatment and the decontamination of trace elements (TE) from woody biomass for bioethanol applications. The willow biomass used in this study was obtained from short rotation coppice phyto-managed plots harvested on a TE-contaminated soils (Zn, Mn). The inﬂuence of the SE reaction severity on the composition of the cellulosic pulp and on the TE extraction in the water effluent was investigated. SE performed at 220 °C after a 2% sulfuric acid presoaking allowed an extraction of ̴ 80% of Mn and Zn in the water effluent. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting pulps was examined. A cellulose-to-glucose conversion of ˜80% was obtained after 75 h of incubation of the pulp obtained after a SE treatment performed at 180 °C. The subsequent fermentation into ethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae was successfully performed. No significant influence of TEs on the action of the biocatalysts (enzymes and yeast) was observed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Plant secondary cell wall is a renewable feedstock for biofuels and biomaterials production. Arabidopsis VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN (VND) has been demonstrated to be a key transcription factor regulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis. However, less is known about its role in the woody species. Results: Here we report the functional characterization of Populus deltoides WOOD-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN protein 3 (PdWND3A), a sequence homolog of Arabidopsis VND4 and VND5 that are members of transcription factor networks regulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis. PdWND3A was expressed at higher level in the xylem than in other tissues. The stem tissues of transgenic P. deltoides overexpressing PdWND3A (OXPdWND3A) contained more vessel cells than that of wild-type plants. Furthermore, lignin content and lignin monomer syringyl and guaiacyl (S/G) ratio were higher in OXPdWND3A transgenic plants than in wild-type plants. Consistent with these observations, the expression of FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE1 (F5H1), encoding an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sinapyl alcohol (S unit monolignol), was elevated in OXPdWND3A transgenic plants. Saccharification analysis indicated that the rate of sugar release was reduced in the transgenic plants. In addition, OXPdWND3A transgenic plants produced lower amounts of biomass than wild-type plants. Conclusions: PdWND3A affects lignin biosynthesis and composition and negatively impacts sugar release and biomass production. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - A novel approach for sustainability enhancement of jet biofuel production from palm oil and soybean oil is proposed. A comparative Well-to-Wake analysis was performed assuming a supply chain in two strategic regions of Brazil, according to each raw material. The functional unit was 1.0 MJ of energy, and impacts were quantified using Impact 2002 + and Cumulative Energy Demand methods. Two different situations, referred to as scenarios, for each vegetable oil were proposed. First conversion scenario (baseline case) included conventional jet biofuel production characteristics, regarding the use of fossil hydrogen. Second conversion scenario (enhanced case) explored renewable alternatives for hydrogen production, such as residual biomass gasification, in palm oil case, and water electrolysis, for soybean oil scenario. Results indicate significant reductions, ranging from 57% to 94%, in the global warming impact category of all scenarios as compared with conventional jet fuel. Moreover, palm oil and soybean oil improved scenarios reached the lowest carbon footprint of 4.8 and 33.9 g CO2 eq/MJ, respectively. Additionally, when considering Life Cycle Energy Efficiency an increase of about 65% and 63% for palm oil and soybean oil enhanced scenarios was observed, compared to baseline cases. In the case of Fossil Energy Ratio, an increase of 4.4% and 29.6% was determined in the same vein. Besides, in all scenarios, palm oil showed lower consumption of fossil and renewable energy than soybean oil. Some limitations of the present work can be described as: economic and logistic feasibility, due to immature technologies; geographic conditions which could affect agricultural performance; and technical aspects regarding hydrogen production technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production can have an adverse environmental impact, mainly in the crop production stage. This study compared the impact of camelina and crambe cultivation under conventional and reduced tillage management using a life cycle assessment (LCA). The study presents the impact of these non-edible crops for various purposes. The LCA was determined by the IPCC 2007 and ReCiPe Endpoint methods and the emission of greenhouse gases for both crops per hectare was similar (1,732–1,772 kg ha−1 CO2 eq.), although when calculated per 1 Mg of dry seeds, this value was more variable (1,152–1,528 kg Mg−1 CO2 eq.). When converted to the oil content, it was 3,368–3,999 kg Mg−1 CO2 eq., whereas when calculated for energy content it was 23.74–27.15 kg GJ−1 CO2 eq. The highest normalised score for all crops and cultivation technologies was determined for fossil depletion, followed by climate change and particulate matter formation, which resulted in a high level of damage in the human health category. The study found that reduced tillage results in lower environmental impact compared with traditional tillage due to lower consumption of production means, although the results do not account for soil carbon change, which should be considered in further detailed analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ever increasing energy demands of modern civilization and rapidly dwindling fossil fuels point towards a renewable substitute like biofuels. However, higher costs associated with biofuel productions is the major bottleneck for its commercialization. The present study demonstrates the use of a statistical approach called response surface methodology (RSM) to investigate the optimum parameters for maximum production of cellulase by Bacillus tequilensis G9. The Plackett–Burman design (PB) of the RSM analysis indicated grass straw (GS) concentration, pH, FeSO4, inoculum, MgSO4, incubation period and NH4Cl as significant variables that influence the cellulase production. Further, to propose the best medium for the maximum production of cellulase by B. tequilensis G9, the most influential parameters, namely concentrations of GS as substrate, FeSO4, pH, inoculum size, etc. were fine-tuned by central composite design (CCD) involving four factors and five levels. The CCD analysis demonstrated 8% substrate concentration, 1.5% of inoculum along with 10 ppm FeSO4 and a pH of 5.5 in media as optimum conditions for highest enzyme production. The field emission scanning electron microscopic analysis of the treated GS showed structural alterations depicting significant deconstruction caused by B. tequilensis G9. The yield of the partially purified cellulase proteins were found to be 21% revealing molecular mass between 30 and 97 kDa. The enhanced cellulase production by B. tequilensis G9 demonstrated in our study brands its applications in many industrial processes like biorefinery, biofuels, etc. © 2019, Zhejiang University Press.

AB  - Abstract: The production of energy and chemicals from waste biomass is an attractive alternative by comparison with first-generation biofuels and fossil feedstocks. This paper investigates oil extraction from spent coffee grounds (SCG) by means of an advanced microwave process and compares this with a conventional Soxhlet extraction (SE) method. Microwave-assisted oil extraction (MAE) from SCG was performed over different durations, varying solvent volumes and extraction temperatures. It was found that each of these parameters had an effect on the process, with the largest yield being over 11.54 wt%, oil extracted in 10 min using 160 mL of hexane at 95 °C. In 10 min, MAE was successful in extracting more oil than SE. MAE achieved a 24-fold decrease in duration for the extraction compared with SE and used less solvent per gram of oil produced. It is proposed that a certain moisture content in the SCG would be beneficial to the extraction process and might it also play a role in the heating process. The extracted oil can be converted into biodiesel and biochemicals leaving the remaining solids suitable for processing into bioethanol, fertiliser, adsorptive material and fuel pellets.

AB  - Optimizing N fertilizer inputs is imperative for improving sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] yields and biofuel feedstock system efficiency. A 2-yr study was conducted to determine the physiological N-use efficiency (NUE) response in sweet sorghum’s ethanol yield of stem juice, bagasse, and total ethanol yield (TEY). Two sweet sorghum cultivars (‘Dale’ and ‘Top 76–6’) were fertilized at five N fertilizer rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg ha–1). At harvest, the stem juice and bagasse yields were measured then analyzed for the corresponding N concentrations and N contents. Whole-plant N recovery efficiency ranged from –1.5 to 57.6% across both years, with a significant N rate effect only in one study year. The NUE of juice ethanol yield only demonstrated an N response in the second year, whereas the NUE of lignocellulosic ethanol yield was greatest at the 56 kg ha–1 fertilizer rate each year. The NUE of total theoretical ethanol yield, determined as the sum of juice and bagasse conversion to ethanol, averaged 169 L EtOH kg–1 N across both years and was greatest at the 56 kg N ha–1 fertilizer rate in both years, and decreased at N rates exceeding 56 kg ha–1 in only one of the years. This study revealed that although sweet sorghum ethanol yields increased with N fertilizer application, NUE was greatest with low N fertilizer rates, consistent with previous research indicating that sweet sorghum is an appropriate biofuel feedstock for production in low-input systems or on marginal lands. © 2019 The author(s).

AB  - Biofuels and electrification are potential ways to reduce CO2 emissions from the transport sector, although not without limitations or associated problems. This paper describes a life-cycle analysis (LCA) of the Brazilian urban passenger transport system. The LCA considers various scenarios of a wholesale conversion of car and urban bus fleets to 100% electric or biofuel (bioethanol and biodiesel) use by 2050 compared to a business as usual (BAU) scenario. The LCA includes the following phases of vehicles and their life: fuel use and manufacturing (including electricity generation and land-use emissions), vehicle and battery manufacturing and end of life. The results are presented in terms of CO2, nitrous oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, electricity consumption and the land required to grow the requisite biofuel feedstocks. Biofuels result in similar or higher CO2 and air pollutant emissions than BAU, while electrification resulted in significantly lower emissions of all types. Possible limitations found include the amount of electricity consumed by electric vehicles in the electrification scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Ethanol production has rapidly expanded over the past few years. The opening of an ethanol plant can increase local demand for corn, pressuring increases in local corn basis. But how does this affect corn contract prices and revenues? At the farm level, the impact of an ethanol plant on local corn contract revenues is still unknown. Data from the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey suggests that corn contract revenues in counties with ethanol plants are higher than corn contract revenues in counties without ethanol plants at similar prices. We estimate the impact of ethanol plants on local corn contract revenues by running non-spatial and spatial difference-in-difference models. A statistically significant effect of ethanol plant location on corn contract revenues within the same county was not found, but rather a statistically significant effect of ethanol plants on corn contract revenues for farmers located in adjacent counties. Local competitive advantage, not the presence of an ethanol plant, may be the reason for observed higher revenues in counties with an ethanol plant. Therefore, policymakers should focus their resources in promoting greater efficiency in corn production to boost farmers' revenues. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The research on the environmental impacts of corn-derived products has been mainly on cultivation techniques and the production of biofuels, so there is limited information on the impacts produced by the transformation of corn for human consumption. The tortilla is a millennial product derived from corn of which consumption is increasing in North America. The aim of this study is to identify the environmental hotspots of the tortilla using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The process studied included only the corn-nixtamalisation-dough-tortillas production. The functional unit is one kg of tortillas packed in kraft paper. The impacts of the tortilla production process were evaluated using SimaPro 8.5.0 software, considering ReCiPe Midpoint. The production has the greatest impact in 15 of the 18 impact categories. The normalisation reveals that the most significant impacts concentrate in the categories terrestrial acidification (TA), particulate matter formation (PMF), marine ecotoxicity (MET) and fossil fuel depletion (FD). Improvements in the cultivation could mean more environmentally friendly tortilla production. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A bioenergy summit was organized by Advanced Hardwood Biofuels Northwest (AHB) to debate the barriers to the commercialization of a hybrid poplar biofuels industry for the alternative jet fuels market from the perspective of five years of AHB research and development and two recent surveys of the North American cellulosic biofuels industry. The summit showed that: (1) Growing and converting poplar feedstock to aviation fuels is technically sound, (2) an adequate land base encompassing 6.03 and 12.86 million respective hectares of croplands and rangelands is potentially available for poplar feedstock production, (3) biofuel production is accompanied by a global warming potential that meets the threshold 60% reduction mandated for advanced renewable fuels but (4) the main obstruction to achieving a workable poplar aviation fuels market is making the price competitive with conventional jet fuels. Returns on investment into biomass farms and biorefineries are therefore insuffcient to attract private-sector capital the fact notwithstanding that the demand for a reliable and sustainable supply of environmentally well-graded biofuels for civilian and military aviation is clear. Eleven key findings and recommendations are presented as a guide to a strategic plan for a renewed pathway to poplar alternative jet fuels production based upon co-products, refinery co-location with existing industries, monetization of ecosystem services, public-private financing, and researching more effcient and lower-costs conversion methods such as consolidated bioprocessing. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The use of land resources has a strong influence on the sustainability of biofuel production. An assessment of both direct and indirect changes in land use is necessary if an accurate assessment of sustainability is to be made. An increasing number of studies have developed approaches to estimate the Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) impacts of biofuels at global, national or regional level, but assessing ILUC remains a challenging task and estimates vary widely. In this study, we suggest that a socially motivated, project level approach can provide robust insight into the conditions affecting land use change dynamics. We developed a causal-descriptive approach named ILUC Project ASsessment Tool (ILUC PAST) for project level assessment of ILUC. It uses a tiered multitool analysis—from local to global—combined with extensive stakeholder engagement. A real-world project for the production of cellulosic ethanol in Sardinia (Italy) was used to evaluate the tool and benchmark the results against two alternatives for project level assessment: the ‘Low Indirect Impact Biofuel’ methodology and the ‘iLUC Club’ method. The results of the case study of advanced biofuels suggest that the quantitative estimates of ILUC combined with the in-depth understanding of the cause-and-effect dynamics provided by ILUC PAST are sufficiently credible, salient and legitimate to support project level and local decision-making. © 2019 The Authors.

The results showed that the addition of Fe and Ni into the Cd-containing fermentation system induced higher cumulative biogas yields and NH4+–N concentrations compared with the only Cd-added group. Ni together with Cd improved and brought forward the peak daily biogas yields, and increased the CH4 contents to 80.76%. Taking the whole fermentation process into consideration, the promoting impact of the Cd + Ni group was mainly attributed to better process stability, a higher average NH4+–N concentration, and increased utilization of acetate. Adding Fe into the Cd-containing fermentation system increased the absolute abundance of Methanobrevibacter on the 13th day, and Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were found to be positively correlated with the daily biogas yield. This research was expected to provide a basis for the reuse of biological wastes contaminated by heavy metals and a reference for further studies on the influence of compound heavy metals on anaerobic fermentation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A large number of potential technological alternatives exist for the development of microalgal biorefinery to produce a variety of end-products from microalgal biomass and their residues. The design of the promising biorefinery configurations considering preliminary and uncertain nature of technologies is one of the major biorefinery challenges, and it must be addressed systematically. This article presents key issues, challenges and opportunities for the modeling and optimization of microalgae-based biorefinery configurations. It reviews the processing pathways/networks for producing biofuels and various platform chemicals from microalgae with an emphasis on the development of the systematic modeling framework. Superstructure-based modeling and optimization can be a useful tool to identify the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations. Key components of the superstructure-based modeling framework are described, along with a comprehensive review of the existing studies on the superstructure-based optimization of biofuels/bioenergy production from microalgae. This paper also identifies potential perspectives for future research focusing on the application of the superstructure-based approach for the systematic design of sustainable microalgal biorefineries. Perspectives on the future integrated biorefineries considering carbon mitigation as well as heat and power integration are presented. Issues on sustainability and uncertainties modeling in the biorefinery design phase are also discussed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the juice of the fescue grain sorghum, since it is a low-cost agricultural waste, for the production of bioethanol to be used as a gasoline additive. In addition, the octane number has been investigated by varying the ethanol-gasoline mixture 2, 6 and 10%. RESULTS: The wort fermentation was carried out with commercial bread yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The liquor obtained was characterized and quantified through gas chromatography. Bioethanol–gasoline mixtures were prepared as: 2, 6 and 10% v/v to determine their octane index. Bioethanol was purified in a fractional distillation tower, attaining thereby a 93.5% purity: lastly, it was dehydrated through molecular sieves to obtain a 99.2% final purity bioethanol. Spectroscopy aided also to determine that the bioethanol–gasoline mixture containing 10% ethanol attained an octane index of 89, which is the value required for commercial gasoline in Mexico. CONCLUSION: The bioethanol obtained from the fermentation of juice of fescue grain sorghum is indeed viable to be used as additive in gasolines. The fermentation can be carried out with the bread yeast, at the natural pH of the juice and without the addition of nutrients, which leads to an attractive economic process. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - When considering the large-scale deployment of bioenergy crops, it is important to understand the implication for ecosystem hydrological processes and the influences of crop type and location. Based on the potential for future land use change (LUC), the 10,280 km2 West Wales Water Framework Directive River Basin District (UK) was selected as a typical grassland dominated district, and the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrology model with a geographic information systems interface was used to investigate implications for different bioenergy deployment scenarios. The study area was delineated into 855 sub-basins and 7,108 hydrological response units based on rivers, soil type, land use, and slope. Changes in hydrological components for two bioenergy crops (Miscanthus and short rotation coppice, SRC) planted on 50% (2,192 km2) or 25% (1,096 km2) of existing improved pasture are quantified. Across the study area as a whole, only surface run-off with SRC planted at the 50% level was significantly impacted, where it was reduced by up to 23% (during April). However, results varied spatially and a comparison of annual means for each sub-basin and scenario revealed surface run-off was significantly decreased and baseflow significantly increased (by a maximum of 40%) with both Miscanthus and SRC. Evapotranspiration was significantly increased with SRC (at both planting levels) and water yield was significantly reduced with SRC (at the 50% level) by up to 5%. Effects on streamflow were limited, varying between −5% and +5% change (compared to baseline) in the majority of sub-basins. The results suggest that for mesic temperate grasslands, adverse effects from the drying of soil and alterations to streamflow may not arise, and with surface run-off reduced and baseflow increased, there could, depending on crop location, be potential benefits for flood and erosion mitigation. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) plays an indispensable role in feed, starch-based industries and ethanol biofuel production. Few studies have investigated on how external amino acids affect the growth and production of sweetpotato. In the study, we evaluated morphological, physiological and molecular effects of external glycine (Gly) on the root growth and starch metabolism of sweetpotato, Xushu16. At morphological level, the Xushu16 with Gly stimuli had larger plant biomass than that under control condition. At physiological level, the photosynthesis strength of the Xushu16 with Gly treatments showed significant differences relative to those under control condition. The relative content of plant hormone and starch in storage roots was higher under Gly conditions than that under control condition. At molecular level, a total of 4836 differentially expression genes were identified in the storage roots with different Gly treatments by RNA-Seq. Among them, as many as 1830 genes were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, which held maximum proportion among all the DEGs. Further, a few genes involved in starch biosynthesis were proved to be Gly-induced significantly by RT-qPCR. All the results indicated extrinsic Gly promotes the growth of storage roots by strengthening photosynthesis and increasing plant hormone, and enhances starch biosynthesis of storage roots by accelerating carbohydrate metabolism and regulating the expression of starch-related genes. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Land-use change for bioenergy production can release greenhouse gases (GHG) through disturbance of soil carbon (C) pools, but use of native species with extensive root systems as bioenergy crops may help mitigate GHG emissions by enhancing soil C sequestration. Here, we investigated how (1) fertilization, (2) plant species and cultivars, and (3) inter- and intra-specific diversity affect soil C and N accumulation five growing seasons after conversion of an old-field dominated by C3 grasses to a grassland dominated by C4 perennial grasses managed for biofuel production. We manipulated diversity at both the species- and cultivar level, and applied nitrogen (N) at two levels (0 and 67 kg ha−1). Establishment of C4 grass treatments on soils that supported C3 pasture grasses for 36 years enabled us to use the natural abundance C isotope ratio technique to estimate the contribution of new C4 plant-derived C to soil organic matter pools. Our study yielded three main results: 1) annual fertilization did not significantly affect soil C and N concentrations after five growing seasons; 2) increasing inter- and intra-specific diversity did not significantly increase soil C and N concentrations; 3) cultivar- and species identity influenced C4-derived C and total soil C concentrations: big bluestem dominated stands exhibited greater soil C accrual relative to stands dominated by switchgrass and mixed-species treatments. Future research is needed to further assess how big bluestem can aid in the sustainable provisioning of second generation biofuel feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper illustrates a methodological strategy to address the first phases of the policy cycle – namely agenda setting, impact analysis, and policy formulation – with the aim of fostering the development of an innovation niche. Through a combination of fuzzy cognitive maps and social network analysis, our methodology allows firstly assessing the needs of the niche and then, the identification of the most effective instrument mix and policy brokers to overcome the niche's criticalities. We investigate the case of the Italian liquid biofuel niche, which offers a near-ideal laboratory for testing our methodological approach due to its recent slump. Our simulations show that the persistence of negative context conditions in the niche under investigation would be detrimental for all three niche development mechanisms – i.e., networking, learning, and convergence of expectations – and especially for the last one, thus providing a clear priority in setting the policy agenda. Additionally, the impact analysis highlights that the combination of different policy instruments better supports the niche mechanisms than the implementation of single instruments. Finally, our methodology enables identification of the most effective instrument mix by considering interactions and feedback effects among instruments. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Monitoring the above ground biomass (AGB) in winter oilseed rape is important for improving the agronomic management efficiency and predicting yield to ensure edible oil and biofuel supplies. The Yangtze River Basin in China accounts for one-fifth of the rapeseed yield in the world. However, the fragmented farming lands in the Yangtze River Basin make it difficult to accurately monitor winter oilseed rape growth at large scale using the medium-resolution satellite data. The low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides a feasible way to accurately and non-destructively estimate AGB in winter oilseed rape at the plot level. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of vegetation indices (VIs) and texture metrics, derived from multispectral images captured by the camera mounted on a UAV, to predict the AGB in winter oilseed rape. The AGB was estimated with (1) multiple VIs and (2) multiple VIs and texture metrics. The partial least square regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models were trained with datasets of the experiment in 2016–2017 and 2017–2018, and then applied to predict AGB of the 2018–2019 growth season. Results demonstrated that the incorporation of texture metrics to both PLSR and RF models provided more accurate estimations of AGB in winter oilseed rape than the models based solely on VIs. The accuracy of the AGB predicted by the RF regression model using VIs and texture metrics (RMSE = 274.18 kg/ha for the validation dataset) was slightly higher than the results of the PLSR model (RMSE = 284.09 kg/ha for the validation dataset). According to the evaluation of the important variables, the red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) were selected as the most important input features by PLSR and RF regression models. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) contrast was selected as an important texture metrics for the AGB prediction, indicating that NDVI contrast could be a sensitive indicator of the spatial distribution of shadow caused by the different amount of biomass. This study suggested the great potential of UAV in estimating the plot-level AGB by combining VIs and texture metrics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change and future depletion of resources are two of the most important environmental challenges that humankind have ever faced. This mini-review aims to give a second chance to contaminated water and recalcitrant carbon dioxide (CO2) streams by putting forward a resilience and sustainable technology based on electron-driven microbial reactions. A critical assessment of the current application of microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) in the field of electro bioremediation of contaminated water and bio-electro CO2 recycling in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is performed. Data from lab-scale and pilot-plant studies is shown to prove that MET is a highly promising and cost-effective technology for the sustainable remediation of contaminated sites while producing biofuels and/or commodity chemicals from recalcitrant CO2 streams emitted in WWTPs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, an “old weed”, pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has become an attractive non-food oilseed crop for Europe and the USA. Pennycress can be produced with existing farm equipment and infrastructure while being grown in the off-season between conventional commodity crops. The adaptation to marginal lands and the satisfactory seed yields make pennycress a viable alternative feedstock for biofuels. In the last decade, pennycress has been extensively studied as a potential oilseed crop in the USA, while receiving far less attention in Europe. Differences in climate and agricultural management between USA and Europe may not permit direct translation of pennycress agronomic knowledge across diverse environments. In the present study, sowing date and seeding rate of pennycress were evaluated in different European (Italy and Greece) and US (Minnesota and Illinois) locations to optimize site-specific production, and determine environmental influence on pennycress-derived biofuel. Pennycress productivity increased with seeding rate up to 1500 m−2 in Europe, but only to 672 m−2 in USA, while sowing in early autumn always improved yields. Seed yield of about 1 Mg ha-1 was achieved only in Greece, where adequate precipitation during the growing season was available. Seed yields were 250% and 140% higher in Greece and Italy, respectively, than Minnesota. Pennycress oil was suitable to convert into biofuel and its composition was influenced by growing environment. In Greece, polyunsaturated fatty acid content was 6% compared to Italy and Illinois. However, the oxidative stability of pennycress oil needs improvement to meet EU and US standards for biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion from arable cropping systems to perennial bioenergy crops is increasing across Europe to meet market energy demands, but our understanding of how this land use change is affecting below-ground diversity and C allocation remains limited. Here, we assessed the impact of conversion from arable cropland to Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow in UK bioenergy commercial plantations on earthworm community structure and abundance. At this same location we then conducted an in-situ 13CO2 pulse-chase labelling experiment in the two bioenergy plantations to trace the fate of recently photosynthetically assimilated carbon into roots, bulk soil, soil microbial (PLFA) and earthworm communities. Results showed that land conversion from annual arable crops to both Miscanthus and SRC willow perennial bioenergy crops led to severe reductions of soil earthworm abundance and biomass. SRC willow had higher microbial biomass relative to Miscanthus, whereas Miscanthus provided a better habitat for a more functionally diverse earthworm community. Transfer of labile C compounds to soil pools was faster under Miscanthus supporting activity of bacterial grazers in the soil food chain, whereas a fungal-driven detrital decomposition processes dominated under SRC willow plantations. Taken together, these findings indicate that plant identity in land conversions have a strong influence not only on the abundance and structure of soil communities but also on which basal resources (root exudates, dead organic matter or microbial derived compounds) are preferentially consumed, and ultimately on the rates of mobilisation of these different C pools. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the sensitivity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the minimum fuel selling price for a 2000 metric ton day−1 integrated pyrolysis-bioenergy-biochar platform with respect to the biorefinery location and biomass types. The regional techno-economic and life-cycle analysis is evaluated in three US counties using representative crops: rice in Glenn County (California), corn in Hamilton County (Iowa), and peanuts in Jackson County (Florida). We evaluate the biochar selling price considering crop yield increases of 0.6%, 2.9%, and 10% after biochar application over 20 years in Glenn County, Hamilton County, and Jackson County, respectively. The biochar prices are calculated under low and high commodity prices to determine upper and lower bounds. Jackson County has the most economically beneficial scenario with an average minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $1.55 gal−1 of biofuel produced whereas Hamilton County has the highest average MFSP of $3.82 gal−1. The life-cycle analysis shows that woody biomass has a strong potential to produce carbon-negative energy compared to grass and straw. Of the 304 cases scenarios considered for this platform, 64% could produce biofuel with negative GHG emissions, which would meet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) target for cellulosic biofuels. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Overuse of petroleum and ongoing carbon-di-oxide (CO2) rise in the air of Brunei Darussalam has been emerged as a major environmental concern in this country. To resolve this issue, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative biofuel, bioethanol production from microalgae was demanded for realistic implementation. Therefore, LCA of bioethanol production from microalgae in terms of CO2 emission and energy balance was investigated based on the scenario of industrial-scale in Brunei Darussalam. This study demonstrated that 220 tons microalgae biomass was cultivated on 6 ha offshore lands for commercial bioethanol generation. The annual outcome of this commercial bioethanol plant has revealed net CO2 balance 218.86 ton. From the energy perspective, this study manifested itself as favourable with net energy ratio, 0.45 and net energy balance, −2749.6 GJ y−1. Apart from CO2 balance and energy generation aspect, the project demanded low water and land footprints. For photobioreactor cultivation, water and land footprints were 2 m3 GJ−1 and 2 m2 GJ−1, respectively as well as for open pond approach, they were 87 m3 GJ−1 and 13 m2 GJ−1, respectively. The project also presented microalgae growth supplements (phosphorus and nitrogen) accumulation possibilities from wastewater of manure and industries which is another positive aspect for benign environment. Overall, the commercial plant presented low CO2 emission, low land and water demand for microalgae cultivation, alternative eco-friendly and cheaper nutrients sources, quite high energy generation with main product and by-products. Thus, this study projected positive impact on energy and environmental aspects of microalgae-to-bioethanol conversion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The newest endeavor by the Brazilian State for fostering bioenergy - the National Biofuel Policy, or simply RenovaBio - aims at establishing a mechanism for the commercialization of decarbonization credits linked to the carbon intensity of several biofuels. Under this horizon, this study evaluates the prospects for large-scale, integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries in terms of their techno-economic and environmental feasibility, as well as the possible benefits brought by the RenovaBio program. Process integration was based on different energy and material vectors obtained from the sugarcane mill, especially the use of fermentation-derived CO2, CO2 in biogas, and vinasse as carbon sources for microalgae growth. Results show that the co-location of microalgae production with sugarcane mills leads to verticalized biorefineries currently behind in economic performance in comparison to conventional sugarcane mills due to an increase in both fixed and operational expenses. Anhydrous ethanol production costs remain in the range of US$ 0.36–0.42/L, below the market price of US$ 0.51/L. Integrating a microalgae facility with a sugarcane mill also helps to further improve the sustainability of anhydrous ethanol production: cradle-to-grave emissions of greenhouse gases fluctuate around 18 g CO2eq/MJ, a reduction of 15% in comparison to conventional sugarcane-based ethanol. Depending on the scenario, a reasonably-sized integrated biorefinery would be able to mitigate around 500 thousand t CO2eq/year when displacing gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The analysis finally points out to integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries becoming economically feasible at carbon prices as low as US$ 10/t CO2eq under the RenovaBio scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the past four decades, the US has employed a range of policies to move the US energy mix towards more renewable and domestic resources. The purpose of this paper is to assess the employed policies using the following criteria: 1) Did the policy achieve the objective of increasing production and consumption of the targeted renewable energy? 2) Did the policy reduce US dependence on foreign energy? 3) What was the cost of the renewable energy increase, and how does it compare with the government estimated Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) around $40/ton ($0.04/kg) or with the implicit SSC often associated with achieving the aims of the Paris accord of $160/ton ($0.16/kg) or higher? 4) What were the unintended consequences of the policy? The important conclusions are: 1) Policy makers prefer regulation to pricing mechanisms; 2) The success in achieving quantitative targets is mixed; 3) The social cost of achieving the renewable penetration is generally higher than the SCC. With the renewable energy growth required to achieve the levels needed to achieve the Paris accord, the unintended consequence of costs rise significantly with scale. Most of the analysis done to date has only examined impacts and costs at low levels of penetration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photosynthetic microbes are considered promising biofactories for transforming inorganic carbon from the atmosphere into a renewable source of chemicals and precursors of industrial interest; however, there continues to be a need for strains that demonstrate high productivity, environmental robustness, and the potential to be genetically manipulated. Genome sequencing and biochemical characterization of promising culture collection microalgae strains, as well as the isolation of previously unidentified strains from the environment or mixed cultures, bring us closer to the goal of decreasing the cost-per-gallon of algal biofuels by identifying new and promising potential production strains. The halotolerant alga Picochlorum soloecismus was isolated from the culture collection strain, Nannochloropsis salina CCMP 1776. Here, we show that P. soloecismus accumulates moderate levels of fatty acids and high levels of total carbohydrates and that it can effectively grow in a range of salinities. In addition, we make use of its sequenced genome to compare it to other biofuel production platforms and to validate the capacity for engineering this strain's genome. Our work shows that Picochlorum soloecismus is a candidate production strain for the generation of renewable bioproducts. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a well-developed sustainable technology to convert organic waste streams and energy crops to produce renewable gaseous biofuels, while recycling nutrients and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the environmental and economic impacts of an integrated-state AD technology (i-AD) producing Compressed Natural Gas (noted as BioCNG) were investigated from dairy-manure, food-wastes, and miscanthus biomass feedstocks, and compared with that of stand-alone liquid-state (LS-AD) and solid-state (SS-AD) AD technologies. A coupled life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis (LCA‐TEA) approach was used to estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of BioCNG ‒ a renewable alternative to fossil-CNG. The results illustrated that the Fossil Energy Ratios (FERs) for BioCNG were between 2.3 and 3.3 in the increasing order as LS‐AD &lt; i‐AD &lt; SS‐AD. The life-cycle GWPs to produce BioCNG via LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD were −5.1, −15.1, and −12.0 kgCO2eq/GGE (Gasoline-Gallon-Equivalent) respectively. The MSP of BioCNG (without incentives) via LS‐AD ($2.9/GGE) was lower than that of both SS‐AD ($4.1/GGE) and i‐AD ($4.9/GGE). When the tipping-fee ($44/Mg), RIN(Renewable Index Number)-credit ($0.46/RIN), and carbon-credit($13.6/MgCO2eq) were considered, the MSP of BioCNG dropped by up to 70%, 45%, and 25% for LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD, respectively. Fungal-pretreatment of miscanthus had negligible impacts on the environmental and economic performances of BioCNG. Backhauling of solid-digestate for miscanthus cultivation may reduce the MSP, energy usage, and GWP by up-to 5%, 16%, and 7%, respectively. The commercial production of BioCNG from energy crops can potentially be competitive at a higher BioCNG market price or with favorable energy policies, financial support, and tax-benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change poses challenges across multiple sectors. Biofuels have been touted as a replacement for petroleum-based fuels, but policy guiding this sector must ensure that biomass is obtained in a sustainably. In this context, Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) tools have been identified as a means to conduct comprehensive impact evaluations of the biofuel sector. The objective of this work is to highlight key environmental, economic, and social indicators currently being assessed using LCSA, and to relate these back to the framework of Principles and Criteria (P&C) developed by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) to assess the ability of LCSA approaches to effectively inform all Principles within the RSB. 60 LCSA studies, published since 2007, were selected to include a range of biofuel production scenarios, including various technologies and geographic settings. System boundaries and functional units used in these studies were evaluated and compared. The ability of each study to provide quantitative indicators related to environmental, economic, and social sustainability was tabulated. It was found that some RSB Principles can be effectively evaluated using an LCSA approach, including Principle 3 (greenhouse gas emissions) and Principle 10 (air quality). Most other Principles within the RSB P&C framework, however, are only partially addressed, and Principle 11 (technology, inputs, and management of waste) is not informed in any way by existing LCSA. The results suggest that existing LCSA studies, while expanding to consider more economic and social sustainability considerations, are unlikely to cover all aspects of biofuel production systems and are not sufficient to completely inform the full range of RSB Criteria. In the future, LCSA should be further extended to help address critical aspects of sustainability, while the RSB framework should be strengthened to employ a life cycle approach across all Principles. © 2019

AB  - Ethanol biofuel demand in Brazil is highly dependent on macroeconomic and policy drivers, making it difficult to anticipate future production and associated environmental implications. Here we develop scenarios of ethanol demand in Brazil towards 2030, based on a thorough examination of key influencing drivers, i.e. GDP and population growth, fleet composition, blending policies, fuel prices and energy efficiency. We then estimate their land-use implications using a detailed partial equilibrium model, GLOBIOM-Brazil. We find that ethanol demand is highly sensitive to the drivers considered and could increase between 37.4 and 70.7 billion litres in 2030 depending on the scenario. Such increase is 13% and 114% above the 2018 production. This represents an expansion in sugarcane area between 1.2 and 5 million hectares (14%–58% above the land-use in 2018). Compared to the low demand scenario, a high demand for ethanol in 2030 would drive sugarcane expansion mostly into pastureland (72%) and natural vegetation mosaics (19%). Our results suggest that future ethanol demand in Brazil should not substantially affect food production nor native forest. This outcome will however depend on the compliance with the sugarcane agro-ecological zoning (AEZ) by the ethanol sector in Brazil, a key assumption of our projections. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents the first comprehensive assessment of ethanol dissolved in rainwater of São Paulo State's sugar cane belt, considering the period from 2012 to 2017. Ethanol concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 20.9 μmol L−1, with a volume-weighted mean (VWM) of 4.67 ± 0.13 μmol L−1 (n = 410). Despite the increasing use of ethanol fuel in Brazil, during the study period, the ethanol concentration in rainwater showed an average decrease of 0.54 μmol L−1 per year, attributed to technological improvements in vehicular fuel combustion and catalysts. Anthropogenic emissions appeared to overwhelm possible seasonal fluctuations of ethanol in rainwater due to biogenic sources or meteorological conditions such as temperature, solar radiation, rainfall amount, rainfall rate, and air mass origin. Higher VWM concentrations were generally observed in dry months, when the production of ethanol in the distilleries was highest and biomass burning increased. Consideration of ethanol oxidation in aqueous media by OH radicals indicated that secondary formation of highly toxic aldehydes is likely to increase with greater use of this biofuel. Dissolution of gaseous ethanol during cloud formation appeared to be a more important mechanism of atmospheric removal of this alcohol, compared to below-cloud processes. The wet flux of ethanol was ca. 3 kg ha−1 year−1 and there were evidences that atmospheric replenishment of this species was fast. Brazil has used ethanol fuel on a large scale since the 1980s, so better understanding of the behavior of this species in the lower troposphere of the study region can provide valuable information to assist in predicting future worldwide impacts of increasing use of this biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to assess the environmental impacts of end-of-life dairy products (EoL-DPs) management via their co-treatment with agro-industrial wastes (AgW) in a centralized biogas facility located in Cyprus using a gate-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Two different scenarios were examined under the framework of this project. In the first one, co-treatment of EoL-DPs with various AgW in a 20:80 (w/w) ratio was evaluated in a one-stage mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In the second scenario, the same amount of EoL-DPs were acidified before methanogenesis with AgW in order to improve biogas production. RESULTS: Prior acidification of EoL-DPs showed a better environmental performance compared with the results obtained upon direct co-digestion in a mesophilic digester, having a total impact of 52.44 Pt against 57.13 Pt respectively. Biogas production upon acidification, and therefore energy yield, was higher, reaching up to 22.88 m3 CH4 ton−1 feed (229.25 kWh ton−1 feed), compared with 17.45 m3 CH4 ton−1 feed (174.85 kWh ton−1 feed) for the case where no pretreatment was performed. CONCLUSION: The acidification of EoL-DPs enhanced the environmental performance of the process by reducing its impact by 8.2% (in Pt equivalents). The energy consumption of the biogas plant mixing equipment was identified as the process hotspot. However, further analysis of the environmental performance of the proposed process is required by extending the system's boundaries towards a cradle-to-grave approach. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Researchers have raised concerns that it is very essential to concentrate on sustainable and renewable energy resources to control the elevated level of global warming, which is a result of the enormous usage of fossil fuels. Biofuel is considered as an alternative solution for non-renewable sources for energy production. The assurance of this supply relies on a sustainable and efficient supply chain. For this study, a multi-objective model is proposed to structure a sustainable supply chain for second-generation biofuel under a triple bottom line approach. The proposed model captures a trade-off among conflicting objectives. The multiple agricultural regions, multiple biorefineries, transportation, and multiple markets are considered. The yield of residual biomass, the expense at agricultural regions, and the demand of markets are assumed uncertain and denoted by fuzzy numbers. The carbon tax and cap are incorporated into the supply chain model. The improved augmented ε-constraint approach is employed to solve the proposed multi-objective optimization model. The objective of developed research is to design a sustainable supply chain framework which minimizes the total carbon emissions and total cost and maximizes the amount of new jobs opportunities in a second-generation biofuel. A numerical experiment is conducted, and the finding shows that the production cost of biofuel in the biorefineries contains a major proportion of the total cost. The transportation section is the predominant source for carbon emissions and a maximum number of jobs is accrued in rural areas. In-depth sensitivity analysis of this study is also performed to examine its actual application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of biofuels such as butanol is usually limited by the availability of inexpensive raw materials and high substrate cost. Using food crops as feedstock in the biorefinery industry has been criticized for its competition with food supply, causing food shortage and increased food prices. In this study, cassava bagasse as an abundant, renewable, and inexpensive byproduct from the cassava starch industry was used for n-butanol production. Cassava bagasse hydrolysate containing mainly glucose was obtained after treatments with dilute acid and enzymes (glucoamylases and cellulases) and then supplemented with corn steep liquor for use as substrate in repeated-batch fermentation with engineered Clostridium tyrobutyricum CtΔack-adhE2 in a fibrous-bed bioreactor. Stable butanol production with high titer (>15.0 g/L), yield (>0.30 g/g), and productivity (~0.3 g/L∙h) was achieved, demonstrating the feasibility of an economically competitive process for n-butanol production from cassava bagasse for industrial application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of manure is a common practice; however, the low biogas yield of manure can hamper the profitability of systems in small to medium farms. An increase in biogas yield could be achieved by co-digesting animal manure with co-substrates such as cheese whey. A Techno-economic assessment of anaerobic co-digestion of animal manure and cheese whey (cow, goat and sheep), has been carried out. The results obtained showed that for a farm with 250 adult cattle heads, the revenues generated in an anaerobic mono-digestion process are not able to offset the initial required investment. However, the co-digestion of manure with 30% of cheese whey showed a good economic performance and positive returns (Net Present values >0, Internal Rate of Return >11% and a Return of the investment in <10 years). Electricity selling price and biogas production are the key parameters to determine the profitability of the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Monitoring schemes and indicators are currently under development to enable the assessment of the economic, social, political, and environmental impacts of bioeconomic transitions and better inform bioeconomic policy-making. Such transitions generally mean reduction in fossil resource use through innovative, clean technologies that can enable substitution of biogenic resources for fossil resources. The concept of bioeconomy transition is not yet well embedded in current monitoring schemes. Proper framing and a quantitative indicator for measuring the advancement and status of bioeconomy transitions has been missing up to now. This research aims to lay some groundwork for monitoring transitions from fossil-based to bio-based economies by adapting an existing bioeconomic framework and applying a newly developed indicator: the Substitution Share Indicator (SSI). This indicator relates bio-based substitute products to their fossil-based counterparts and accounts for indirect fossil resource flows, which are estimated using a bottom-up approach, based on life-cycle inventory data, and a top-down approach, based on input–output data. The innovative indicator is tested and validated for the first time in the case of transport fuels and plastics sector in Germany. The SSI in the German transport fuels sector is currently relatively low, at 3.1% (bottom-up approach) to 3.4% (top-down approach). It is even lower in the plastics sector, at 0.09% (bottom-up approach) to 0.6% (top-down approach). Major policy efforts need to be undertaken in Germany, focused not only on the growing bioeconomy but on substitution effects as well. Future policies should provide incentives for increasing production of innovative bio-based substitute goods, improving the fossil resource use efficiency of existing fossil- and bio-based products, and lowering consumption of fossil-based products. Such efforts should be reflected in the SSI and signal bioeconomy transition. Before the widespread use of the indicator for policy formulation and analysis, further advancement is recommended. A hybrid approach integrating process data into input–output data would be expedient for improving the SSI in terms of credibility, measurability and robustness. Linkage to relevant indicators for sustainability assessment of transitions is equally important for effectively monitoring sustainable bioeconomy transitions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intense utilization of natural fuel resources is threatening the global environment and societal sustainability. It triggers up the need for finding environmental-friendly and sustainable sources of energy. In this perspective, microalgae have emerged as a potential alternative. Microalgae are featured with distinct ability to provide ecological services and respond to the sustainability challenges simultaneously. Microalgae can fix atmospheric CO2, valorize waste resources and can produce a wide variety of bio-products. The promising features of microalgae pitch the idea of establishing a sustainable bio-refinery to draw multifaceted benefits and reinforce the objectives of resource efficient bio-economy. Unfortunately, in the last few years, preferential studies have been carried out to assess the potential of microalgae-based integrated bio-refinery. This review critically discussed the recent developments, opportunities, and barriers in the microalgae bio-industry and wastewater treatment. Particularly, microalgae potentials for biofuels and resources recovery are addressed towards sustainable biorefinery. Moreover, techno-economic and commercial viability of microalgae-led bio-refinery is reviewed to drive this technology towards practicality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Substitution of fossil diesel fuel by biodiesel is a realistic alternative due to its compatibility with commercial diesel engines. However, detractors consider that traditional raw materials used for biodiesel production may compete with human feeding (edible vegetables oils), land and water. So, new raw materials are needed. Annually, around 1.3 billion ton of food are discarded or wasted. This huge figure has led researchers to seek for new applications to this carbon source. The main goal of this work is biodiesel production optimization (with and without auxiliary energy assistance), and further characterization, by using the lipid fraction included in solid food waste, collected from local restaurants. Solid food waste oil (SFWO) characterization showed a fatty acid profile rich in oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0) and linolenic (C18:2) acids, a remarkable fatty acid composition suitable for biodiesel production. Due to high free fatty acid content, acid esterification pre-treatment was conducted, followed by a basic transesterification optimization, by both conventional and ultrasound (US) assisted reactions. Response surface methodology was selected to perform the experimental design; optimal conditions for conventional transesterification were achieved at 6.08:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 1.28% w/w catalyst and 52.5 °C reaction temperature, providing 93.23% w/w fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion. Biodiesel quality was also analyzed with excellent results considering cold properties (cold filter plugging point below −3 °C), although oxidation stability did not fulfill European standard limit. US-assisted reaction was also compared with conventional transesterification in terms of energy consumption and reaction time, providing significant savings in both energy and reaction time (40 min reduction). As a conclusion, US-assisted SFWO biodiesel meets most European standard limits, following circular economy. To extend its use, blends with diesel fuel and antioxidant addition are recommended, besides long-term engine tests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Classifying biofuel feedstock crops on the basis of their inorganic constituents is needed to evaluate the critical role these components play during combustion and, later, when the ashes are used as fertilizer or as secondary raw material. Fluorescent and white-light microscopy, in combination with environmental scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, was used to characterize phytoliths in Miscanthus sinensis, its dry extracts, and in the cyclone ash produced by the semi-industrial (400 kW) burning of this energy crop. The results show that the phytoliths are made of opal, SiO2•n(H2O). X-ray powder diffraction data document that the SiO2-rich (31.7 wt%) cyclone ash consists of nearly 83 wt% amorphous material, which reflects the abundance of phytoliths in the studied materials. The cyclone ash also contains high amounts of some heavy metals, which suggests that Miscanthus sinensis is suitable for bioremediation of contaminated soils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tailings are one of the major categories of industrial waste, the disposal of which is problematic from an environmental viewpoint. The weathering of sulfide bearing waste materials commonly generates acidity and dissolved metals in the environment creating acid mine drainage (AMD). Typically, the chosen reclamation solutions emphasize low construction costs over environmental and technical sustainability challenging decision making. The aim of this work was to develop a framework for analysis of alternative cover scenarios with multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) applied for the purpose. The case study comprised totally 10 criteria and five different cover structure options: moraine-based cover, biofuel fly ash/steel slag cover, stabilization with ordinary Portland cement or with composite binder, and use of an advanced hardpan cover liner (AHCL) system. The proposed methodological approach provides the structural steps of MCDA process to compare and contextually evaluate the economic, technical and social-ecological implications of cover alternatives. Modified Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied as a MCDA approach for structuring complex problems and assisting decision makers to choose the best alternative among a discrete set of scenarios. Differing preferences of the stakeholders were resolved by synthetizing the conflicting weightings in the beginning of the analysis. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the social-ecological impacts of emissions, energy demand and impact to human health. Overall, the results from this study show that when considering total sustainability, the AHCL was preferred over the other alternatives when the weighting of the main technical, social-ecological and economic criteria was equal (33%). The weighting of main criteria and consequently sub-criteria impacts the ranking order of compared solutions. Decision making comprising viewpoints of different stakeholders is important when evaluating sustainability criteria. Higher weighting of social-ecological and technical criteria (50%) favored stabilization with composite binder while higher weighting (50%) of costs favored moraine cover. The proposed framework can process competing and conflicting objectives in addition to quantitative and qualitative criteria, hence providing a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to complex problems. The results from this project can help to develop sustainable remediation strategies to reduce the environmental risks associated with mine wastes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Market creation as such is a relevant policy instrument in sustainability transformations that merits further examination. The regulatory creation of the European Union (EU) biofuels market has been a highly contested policy instrument, largely because of its atypical nature, as biofuels became one of the most controversial renewable energies. This paper combines the literature of market organization and meta-organizations as conceptual lenses to analyse the dynamics and challenges of market creation through policy-making with sustainability goals. A longitudinal qualitative analysis of the EU biofuels market in 2003–2015 is conducted to examine contested policy-making and heterogeneous implementation as two key elements shaping the dynamics and outcomes of market organization. The analysis shows that market organization developed as three organizing schemes—favouring a product group, specifying acceptability for the product group, and establishing preferences within the product group—that redefined market boundaries and signalled innovation incentives but potentially undermined the policy goals of market growth. The findings show that this reorganization produced intertemporal discrepancies and tensions between conflicting policy aims, which partly explain the previously observed inconsistencies within transnational market-creation policies. Accordingly, the market organization and meta-organization literature are proposed as useful conceptual tools to analyse sustainability-driven market creation policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water consumption and pollution in wheat production, which are worth paying attention in agricultural countries and arid regions, need to be assessed systematically and comprehensively. China, one of the largest wheat-producing country in the world, should be concerned about this issue. Thus, an impact-oriented water footprint assessment of wheat production in China was conducted based on the ISO 14046 standard to quantify water-related environmental impacts. We quantified the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality categories of wheat production from 2009 to 2016 and evaluated the spatial variation of these categories in 2016. Results showed that the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality categories in 2016 were 5.15 × 10−4 DALY/t and 37.17 PDF·m2·yr/t, respectively. Key factor analysis showed that the overall environmental impacts were primarily derived from fertilizer production, diesel production, and direct water consumption and emission. The dynamic analysis results revealed that the temporal variations in impacts were associated with water and fertilizer consumption. Areas with high potential impacts were mainly congregated in the North China Plain and Xinjiang Province due to their high wheat yields. Ecosystem quality was negatively correlated with wheat yield, and human health was positively correlated with crop water requirement. Therefore, on the basis of ensuring grain production, improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and reducing fertilizer and diesel consumption are the priorities for the management of agricultural water resources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excessive application of phosphorus (P) fertilizer to the agriculture soil can lead to the P loss to the aquatic ecosystem. Three soils from different land use (tea, paddy, and vegetable soils) were treated with biogas slurry (BS) at rate of 79.8 kg ha−1, anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) at rate of 12.5, 25 and 50 kg ha−1, Gypsum (Gy) at rate of 5t ha−1, and the control (Ck) without treatment, to control P losses in a laboratory batch experiment. The soil solution was analyzed for total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total dissolved P (TDP). Particulate P (PP) and dissolved unreactive P (DURP) were calculated by subtracting DRP from TP and TDP, respectively. The DRP was within a range of 68–98% of TP whereas PP varied in a range of 2–32% of TP and DURP was within a range of 0.1–19% of TP, depending on soil types and different treatments. The addition of PAM at a high rate and Gy together on the soil after BS application reduced the release of TP by 54, 46, and 51% and that of DRP by 61, 49, and 53% for tea, paddy and vegetable soils, respectively. However, the application of BS with PAM alone promoted the release of DRP by 77, 86, 70% for tea, paddy, and vegetable soils, respectively. This study suggests that the synergic application of PAM and Gy on soils after BS addition can be a good strategy to reduce P losses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experiment using spent coffee grounds (SCGs) was performed with moisture (6.2, 22.5, 23.2, and 33.4% w.b.) and die height (42, 52, 62, 72, 82, and 92 mm) as influencing parameters at a stable temperature of 93 °C and speed of 100 mm min−1, and the monitoring curves of pressure-displacements were studied. Both pelletization factors were significant parameters for the maximum pressure and corresponding piston displacements, pellet movement, specific work, pellet density, and breaking strength. An interaction was found between these factors, but the moisture had a greater and nonlinear effect on the agglomeration parameters than the die height, which influenced linearly the change of these parameters. The agglomeration parameters values increased with decreasing moisture and increasing the die height. The results suggest that high-strength fuel pellets (&gt;1.0 MPa) could be produced from SCG at a suitable moisture (&lt;20% w.b.) and die height (60–70 mm). A regressive model linking compressive stress with the fuel pellets’ density and the maximum pressure was developed, which revealed that pressure had a greater influence on the pellet's compressive strength than the pellet density did. A novelty of this work was the application of an adjustable orifice length of the die in which the SCGs were compacted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy crops can provide a reliable and adequate supply of biomass feedstocks to support the bioenergy industry. However, promoting bioenergy crops would require major change in land use and management practices that can have long term socio-economic and environmental impacts. Therefore, it is important to evaluate potential opportunities and challenges presented by bioenergy crop production. We developed a multi-objective optimization model to analyze trade-offs among various components of bioenergy crop production to help make better production decisions. Our model integrated sustainability dimensions including social, economic and environmental factors for bioenergy crop production. As bioenergy crop production may incorporate various objectives, we ran the model by optimizing one objective at a time to measure the magnitude of change in one objective with respect to change in other objectives given a set of constraints. In addition, our model had the ability to assess how trade-offs would be affected by chancing preferences for different factors in the production decisions. The model was applied for a four-county study area in northern Kentucky and it provided a regional examination for the potential of bioenergy crops for energy production. The model can serve as an effective tool for making bioenergy production planning and management decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The implementation of midpoint, endpoint, and single score assessments to support decision-making remains a major challenge for developing a coherent social impact assessment methodology. The simple weighted sum approach and normalization technique for single score assessments have been problematic and the final results do not realistically represent stakeholder perspectives due to mis/over-interpretations. The focus of this study is to develop a weighting scheme for social impact assessment. The developed scheme is then evaluated using a case study on social impact assessment of the sugarcane sector in Thailand. Methods: A weighted aggregation method has been developed for assessing different categories and sub-categories of social dimensions. The performance indicators for each sub-category determine the accuracy of the impact results by establishing the rating weight of the importance of social aspects and satisfaction. The developed method is then applied to a case study on sugarcane-based ethanol production in Thailand. The stakeholders involved in the sugarcane sector comprising sugarcane, sugar, and ethanol production include cane growers, cane workers, sugar factory, and ethanol factory workers. The social issues related to stakeholders in sugarcane, sugar, and ethanol production must fit the cause-effect chain, which can help not only in defining the specific social aspects to meet the appropriate sub-categories and performance indicators but also in facilitating the data collection. Results and discussion: The characterized/inventory result can be improved by using the weighting factor of importance of social aspects and satisfaction. The results of the social impact performance score reveal that including the weighting of the importance of social aspects and satisfaction affects the result of the impact sub-categories and social categories. The case study revealed that the relevant impact categories of cane growers are (1) land tenure; (2) access to knowledge, facility, and natural resources; (3) employment, wages, and labor conditions; (4) equity; and (5) human health and safety. On the other hand, the impact categories of cane workers, sugar factory workers, and ethanol factory workers are (1) decent livelihood, (2) labor rights, (3) equity, and (4) human health and safety. Conclusions: The social impact assessment method with developed weighting scheme can help the government and private sectors prioritize their efforts in minimizing negative social impacts throughout the life cycle of biofuel systems. However, the data on the importance of social aspects and satisfaction is subjective; uncertainty analysis or sensitivity analysis must therefore be applied to further observe the variation of different options to facilitate decision-making. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste liquid streams from distillery were a hurdle in conventional wastewater treatment due to extreme high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and fluctuating feed conditions. A recently commissioned full-scale external circulation sludge bed (ECSB) was applied at a malt whiskey distillery in northeast Taiwan. Start-up of the new ECSB system, which has a total volume of 490 m3 with diameter of 6.55 m (ø) and height of 15.9 m (H), was performed by gradual increasing influent flow rates from zero to the design value of 300 m3 day−1 in the first 90 days. In the subsequent 204 days, both influent flow rates (0–389 m3 day−1) and COD concentrations (2.8–18.1 kg L−1) were highly fluctuated due to diverse batches from the distillery. However, effective bioremediation (COD removal 95.1 ± 2.4%) and biogas production (1195 ± 724 L day−1) were achieved in this system. Intensively, the Imhoff tests were carried out and shown the settled solids concentration by 0.5 ± 0.4 mL L−1, while size distributions of granular sludge were analyzed and observed by SEM-EDS. In addition, developments of the anaerobic systems (including lab, pilot, and full scale from the simplest reactor to the latest ECSB) applied in whiskey wastewater treatment were reviewed with their operational parameters for comparing performances of various anaerobic systems. In general, real-time monitoring and feasible operation strategies were critical to successfully run the system by producing clean energy simultaneously. It provides more economically attractive and sustainable-to-adopt ECSB not only an end-of-pipe process but also a bioresource technology. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Among different biofuel feedstocks, algal biodiesel is seen as a promising feedstock. Different research papers have assessed the sustainability of algal biofuel production, but it is always difficult to have a better sense of the results since comparing them with all the differences in data sources, life cycle assumptions, functional units and environmental metrics measured is difficult. The present study develops a comparative life cycle assessment of algal biofuel production under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions with different inputs. SimaPro 8 was used considering five different scenarios for microalgae cultivation to compare environmental impacts, energy demand and damage analysis associated with water scarcity methodology. Open ponds with three different assumptions of using fresh water, recycled water and waste water, and photobioreactor and heterotrophic technologies are considered. Results were analyzed per energy basis—the functional unit of 1 MJ of energy produced. Results of total GHG emissions show that algae cultivated in pond with wastewater and heterotrophic culture are competitive with tradition fossil fuels. Also the use of algae as the source of energy might increase the energy demand, whereas it does not have adverse impact on the environment, health and climate. The results of the water scarcity indicator show the competiveness of algae oil. This study presents an overview of environmental impacts throughout the full life cycle of a product through different pathways in cultivation stage which demonstrates the importance of decision-making process for further investment. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Diffusion of the biofuels (BF) using is justified by opening up the opportunities for obtaining fuel and energy from previously inaccessible sources and by the existence of energy-deficient regions, in particular in Russia. Works of different scientists on the problems of creating and using BF were the methodological basis of this study. Information on the state and prospects of the development of renewable energy sources in Russian regions was collected from regulatory documents and was obtained by employing a questionnaire survey. For the study of the collected materials, the different methods of comparative analysis, and the methods of expert assessments were used. The results of the Status-Quo analysis of BF production in Russia have shown that the creation of BF performed relatively successfully. However, there are many more perspectives, connected with expanding the utilization of the different raw materials. Also, the analysis of organizational and economic mechanisms applied for production of BF and the obtained data on several organizations-producers allowed for proposing six indexes for the assessment of the BF production effectiveness. It is suggested that BF production in Russia will contribute to the sustainable development of a number of the country's regions in the near future. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Biomass fuel has been used to supply heat or crude materials in industry to replace the traditional fossil fuel which was one of the chief causes of climate warming. However, the large-scale utilization of biomass fuel was restricted due to the low density and high hydrophilicity of biomass, which causes the problem of transportation and storage. Therefore, pelletization of biomass was used to improve its fuel density. At present, the biomass pellet was widely used to supply heat, gas or electricity generation via gasification, which supplied clean and sustainable energy for industry. However, the energy consumption during pelletization and high hydrophilicity of pellets were still the problem for the large-scale application of biomass pellet. In this study, hydrothermal carbonization and surfactant played the role of permeation, adsorption and wetting in the solution, which was expected to improve the fuel properties and pelletization effectivity of corn stover. Results: In the article, surfactant (PEG400, Span80, SDBS) was chosen to be combined with wet torrefaction to overcome the drawbacks and improve the pelletization and combustion properties of Corn stover (CS). Especially, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) combined with surfactant improves the yield of solid products and reduces the ash content of solid product, which was beneficial for reducing the ashes of furnace during gasification. Meanwhile, surfactant promotes the formation of pseudo-lignin and the absorption for oil with low O and high C during HTC, which improves the energy density of solid product. Furthermore, the oil in solid product plays the role of lubricant and binder, which reduces the negative effect of high energy consumption, low bulk density and weak pellets strength caused by HTC during pelletization. HTC combined with surfactant improved the hydrophobicity of pellet as well as grindability due to the modification of solid product. Moreover, surfactant combined with HTC improved the combustion characteristic of solid product such as ignition and burning temperature as well as kinetic parameters due to the bio-oil absorbed and the improvement of surface and porosity. Conclusions: The study supplied a new, less-energy intensive and effective method to improve the pelletization and combustion properties of corn stover via hydrothermal carbonization combined with surfactant, and provided a promising alternative fuel from corn stover [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - We develop a framework for comparing carbon-neutral synthetic fuels (CNSFs) with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as alternatives to reducing CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. CNSFs can be divided into fuels produced from biomass via gasification and electrofuels produced from CO2 and water using electricity. We develop CNSF cost estimates for first-of-a-kind plants operating at commercial scale. Although already competitive over short distances, we find that longer-range BEVs are likely to remain more expensive than CNSFs even if low (∼$125/kWh) battery costs are achieved, and all three options would require carbon prices in excess of $130/tCO2 or oil prices in excess of $100/bbl to become commercially viable relative to petroleum. The viability of electrofuels ultimately depends on access to low-cost, ultra-low-carbon power systems or sources of zero-carbon electricity with high annual availability. Priorities should include deploying a portfolio of CNSF technologies to help appraise decarbonization pathways, economies of scale, and learning by doing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Global energy demand for transport more than doubled from 45 EJ in 1973 to 110 EJ in 2014, increasing its share of total final consumption from 23% to 28%. As a result, sectoral CO2 emissions have more than doubled since petroleum products dominate (96% of transportation sector energy consumption in 2016). To be consistent with Paris Agreement targets, under the International Energy Agency (IEA) baseline projection, demand would need to fall from 160 EJ in 2050 to 102 EJ, or roughly current levels, but would need to be substantially less carbon-intensive. Decarbonizing transport will require a combination of sustainable fuels (advanced biofuels and electrofuels produced from electricity and CO2) and new powertrains (battery electric vehicles or BEVs). The greatest reductions will need to come from decarbonizing road transport, which is seen as the easiest sector for BEVs and the most challenging for synthetic fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are often seen as best suited to reduce emissions from light-duty vehicles, whereas synthetic fuels (whether advanced biofuels or so-called electrofuels) are touted as drop-in substitutes for more costly end uses such as aviation or heavy-goods vehicles. We provide a side-by-side comparison of biofuels, electrofuels, and BEVs using the data from recent projects to explore the conditions needed for these different options to become viable in decarbonizing passenger transport. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Energy security for theEU is a priority of the European Commission. Although both blue and green water resources are increasingly scarce, the EUcurrently does not explicitly account for water resource use in its energy related policies. Here we quantify the freshwater resources required to produce the different energy sources in the EU, by means of the water footprint (WF) concept.Weconduct the most geographically detailed consumptiveWFassessment for the EUto date, based on the newest spatial databases of energy sources.Wecalculate that fossil fuels and nuclear energy are moderate water users (136-627m3/terajoules (m3 TJ-1)).Of the renewable energy sources, wood, reservoir hydropower and first generation biofuels require large water amounts (9114-137 624m3 TJ-1). The most water efficient are solar, wind, geothermal and run-of-river hydropower (1-117m3 TJ-1). For theEU territory for the year 2015, our geographically detailed assessment results in aWF of energy production from domestic water resources of 198km3, or 1068 litres per person per day. TheWFof energy consumption is larger as the EU is to a high level dependent on imports for its energy supply, amounting to 242km3 per year, or 1301 litres per person per day. TheWFof energy production within the 281 EU statistical NUTS-2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regions shows spatially heterogeneous values. Different energy sources produced and consumed in theEUcontribute to and are produced under average annual and monthly blue water stress and green water scarcity. The amount of production underWSis especially high during summer months. Imported energy sources are also partly produced under WS, revealing risks to EU energy security due to externalisation. For the EU, to decarbonise and increase the share of renewables of its energy supply, it needs to formulate policies that take the water use of energy sources into account. In doing so, the spatial and temporal characteristics of water use and water stress should particularly be considered. ©2019 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Of fundamental importance for the functioning of a community is the flow of energy and elements through its components. However, the question of how (if at all) the edge effect of habitats can drive elemental traits of organisms has hitherto been largely neglected issue in ecosystem ecology at the community level. We quantified the abundance of invertebrates and measured the elemental composition (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Co and Pb) of 15 different organisms within the plant-invertebrate food web (plant – oilseed rape pests/herbivores – pollinators = wild bees – saprovores – predators – parasitoids) sampled in 34 fields of a key bioenergy crop that is an exceptionally strong biodiversity driver, the oilseed rape. Then these were related to the individual field edge habitat features (including typically anthropogenic ones like dirt and tarred roads) measured within a 100 m radius around the invertebrate sampling sites. Our study showed that elemental traits of the plant-invertebrate food web components in oilseed rape crops varied owing to the habitat specificity determined at the relatively small spatial scale of an individual field, and that the elemental traits of these organisms differed from both an inter- and an intra-guild perspective. The major mechanistic explanation for most of these relationships seems to derive from the secondary gut content effect. Determining one single state for the homeostatic/stoichiometric regulation of chemical elements in invertebrates based on the application of whole-body metal concentrations is in principle impossible, because of the unknown noise caused by the inclusion of extracellular portions of metals in the analysis. It is thus imperative to develop consistent principles for assessing elemental traits of organisms that are based on highly sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods for the ionomic profiling of microsamples at the organ, tissue, cellular or even sub-cellular levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water, energy, and food are the most basic and essential sectors for human welfare. However, an inextricable nexus and competition exists among these sectors. Production of molasses-based bioethanol is an interesting case resulting in the production of different food and energy materials while consuming water, energy, land, and other raw materials, throughout its life cycle. This paper briefly describes the nexus among water, energy, and food for bioethanol in Pakistan and its environmental implications. A life cycle approach has been used for evaluating four footprint categories including the carbon, ecological, water scarcity, and energy footprints along with an energy analysis of bioethanol. In comparison to conventional gasoline, bioethanol would have benefits in terms of lesser greenhouse gas emissions, better use of productive land, and superior energy performance, but, this will be at the expense of higher impacts in terms of water scarcity. Therefore, considering only a single aspect could result in inadvertent trade-offs that may go unnoticed. The quantified values would help accomplish integrated resource management along with their utilization within limits so as to be available for other uses. This study could help in developing strategies for optimal management of resources to maximize the synergies and minimize the possible trade-offs. © 2019

AB  - The increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration has caused a transformative shift in global energy systems, which is contributing to an increased use of renewables. Sweden is among the countries trying to shift to a fossil-fuel-free system in all energy sectors. This paper addresses the fuel demand and supply in the transportation sector in the county of Västmanland in Sweden. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming optimization model is developed to minimize cost in the studied system. The model is further used to investigate the influence of three different scenarios on production planning of regional Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants: (1) straw-based biofuel production integrated with existing CHP plants to fuel combustion engine vehicles, (2) use of electric vehicles, and (3) use of hybrid vehicles fueled by both electricity and bioethanol. Potential solar power generation from rooftop solar cells is also included in the model. The energy system in scenario 2 is found to have the highest overall system efficiency; however, a large amount of power needs to be imported to the system. Hybrid vehicles can potentially reduce the electricity import and CO2 emissions compared to the current situation. Electricity production from rooftop solar collectors could provide the energy needs of the vehicles during summer, while regionally produced straw-based bioethanol integrated with CHP plants can satisfy the fuel needs of the vehicles in winter. This approach could affect the production planning of CHP plants, result in less fuel use and increase the share of renewable resources in the regional transportation system. © 2019

AB  - The application of anaerobically digested cattle manure on agricultural land for both improving its quality and recycling a farm waste is an increasingly frequent practice in line with the circular economy. However, knowledge on the potential risk of spreading antibiotic resistance through this specific practice is quite scarce. The antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is one of the most heavily prescribed in veterinary medicine. In this study, SMX dissipation and the possible effects on natural microorganisms were investigated in a soil amended with an anaerobically digested cattle manure produced from a biogas plant inside a livestock farm. Microcosm experiments were performed using amended soil treated with SMX (20 mg/kg soil). During the experimental time (61 days), soil samples were analysed for SMX and N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, microbial abundance, activity and structure. Furthermore, the prevalence of the intI1 gene was also determined. The overall results showed that, although there was an initial negative effect on microbial abundance, SMX halved in about 7 days in the digestate-amended soil. The intI1 gene found in both the digestate and amended soil suggested that the use of anaerobically digested cattle manure as fertilizer can be a source of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) and genes (ARGs) in agroecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogas production from anaerobic digestion of grass was evaluated in this study taking into account two harvesting machines, a Disc-mower and an Excoriator, under diverse operating conditions. In addition, the application of generated biogas either in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant for thermal and electrical energy production or as transportation fuel after upgrading (BGU) process was evaluated. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) with long term marginal data was employed. Lab-scale data as well as those obtained from the ecoinvent database were used to compile life cycle inventory data. The system boundary of the present study covered harvesting operation of grass, baling, transportation of bales, anaerobic digestion, use of digestate on farmlands, and downstream processes for biogas usage. Additionally, the system boundary was expanded to take into account the effect of substituting grass with straw in animal feeds. The results demonstrated that the environmental performance of grass-based biogas plants were highly dependent on selected downstream strategies. Furthermore, it was evident that mono-digestion of grass would not guarantee a long-term sustainable renewable energy system. Based on the results obtained, Excoriator at driving speed of 7.5 km/ha had the best environmental performance in all damage categories, i.e., “Human health”, “Ecosystem quality”, “Climate change”, and “Resources”. CHP had a greater environmental performance than water scrubbing BGU for the downstream strategies taken into account. The results from the sensitivity analysis proved that a specific methane yield lower than 329 mLCH4/gVS cannot ensure the achievement of an eco-friendly energy system from grass-based biogas plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the innovation strategies of the sugar–energy industry in Central-Southern Brazil with regard to its resource structure and results. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through a questionnaire covering the three-year period from 2015 through 2017. The results were extracted based on a combination of factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings: The innovation strategies of Brazilian sugar–energy companies are characterized as defensive and imitative based on the resources dedicated to innovation and the implementation of innovation with respect to products, processes, eco-innovation and cost reductions. Research limitations/implications: The sample is representative, but it does not cover all companies in the Brazilian sugar–energy industry. The data were acquired using a survey, and the results could not be compared to the financial results of the companies. Practical implications: Sugar–energy companies need to define their innovation strategies, as these strategies lead to different results that can be achieved only through the management of resources dedicated to the generation and implementation of innovations. Managers and analysts need to know the profile of these innovation strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of the results based on the resources that were invested. Originality/value: This study presents an exploratory model that identified two factors related to innovation efforts and three results. It is possible to define the innovation strategies of companies in the Brazilian sugar–energy industry, which is one of the most competitive in Brazil. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuels produced from energy crops offer significant advantages over first generation biofuels. In order to understand and predict the sustainability performance of cellulosic biofuel development, this study builds a system dynamics model for a biofuel system producing cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass under different scenarios. The model can simulate the dynamic behaviors of the cellulosic biofuel system and quantify its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The projected results indicate that cellulosic ethanol production is economically viable based on advanced bioconversion technologies and can provide significant benefits to the environment, such as greenhouse gas reductions and water use savings. The cellulosic ethanol industry also can make significant contributions to the bioeconomy and social benefits. This study finds that the target of cellulosic biofuels (16 billion gallons by 2022) mandated by the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program cannot be achieved within land-use change constraints, but may be achieved if there is no limitation on the conversion of pasture or cropland to energy crop land. Moreover, nitrate leaching and biodiversity change should be considered when expanding energy crops on marginal land, pasture, and cropland. This model is applicable for other complex bioenergy systems as a sustainability assessment tool and can provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders and policy makers to establish and implement favorable strategies for stimulating cellulosic biofuel development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental sustainability of biofuel production is still a debated issue in the world bio-economy development. Therefore, different researches are undergoing to evaluate the sustainability of ethanol production in different countries. This study aimed at analyzing the environmental performance of ethanol production in Ethiopia, considering energy balance and emission reduction using a life cycle assessment approach. It is also intended to identify the environmental hotspots so that possible improvement option can be devised. The life cycle assessment methodology was applied considering three alternative scenarios: 1) Base Case, which is the current situation, 2) Alternative 1, which considers the utilization of biogas from vinasse and bioslurry, and 3) Alternative 2, which includes mechanical harvesting and avoids pre-harvest cane trash burning. The results show that agricultural stage is greatly contributing to the pollutant emissions. The contribution of cane trash burning was significant to all the impact categories considered and avoiding pre-harvest cane trash burning significantly reduced the emissions contributing to global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, ozone formation, particulate matter and eutrophication. On the other hand, the introduction of mechanical harvesting to avoid pre-harvest cane trash burning increased ecotoxicity, human toxicity and resource consumption (land, water and mineral) impacts. The net energy balance is positive for all the alternatives considered. In addition to using by-products, proper management of fuel utilization at the agricultural stage can further enhance benefits from the sector. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the price of molasses highly influences both energy ratio and greenhouse gas emissions since it completely shifts the allocation of upstream emissions from sugar to molasses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa, Cs) is an emerging crop for the production of biodiesel and biofeedstock. This study aims to develop transgenic plants that have the advantage of two traits: improved drought resistance and oil content. Three genes, CsMYB96A, CsMYB96B, and CsMYB96C, were isolated from camelina stem. The deduced amino acid sequence of the three CsMYB96s showed at least 93% identity with Arabidopsis MYB96. CsMYB96A, B, and C transcripts were detected in various camelina tissues. Fluorescence signal from the fusion of CsMYB96A: enhanced yellow fluorescent protein was confined to the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells. Transactivation analysis of tobacco protoplasts revealed that CsMYB96A was a transcription activator. Wax biosynthesis genes such as camelina β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 2, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6, β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase 1-1, β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase 1-2, enoyl-CoA reductase, ECERIFERUM 1 and ECERIFERUM 3 were upregulated approximately 2 to 120 times by CsMYB96A, indicating that CsMYB96A was involved in the activating of cuticular wax synthesis on plant epidemics. Camelina diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1C (CsDGAT1C) has been shown to increased oil synthesis genes in Arabidopsis. When CsDGAT1C and CsMYB96A were co-overexpressed in camelina, total fatty acid levels in transgenic seeds increased by approximately 21%. In addition, the transgenic camelina plants showed improved resistance to drought stress. This result suggests that the transgenic camelina can be grown to produce biodiesel and biofeedstock in arid or semi-arid lands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the limitation of resource, non-edible feedstock has been gaining more attraction as the future feedstock for bio-based industries. Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are the waste from coffee process which contained various high value products. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of utilizing wet SCGs completely through three processes, antioxidant extraction, biodiesel production, and bio-char production. A semi-continuous process, with four extraction column reactors and peristaltic pumps, was used for extracting antioxidants from wet SCGs with methanol as solvent. Subsequently, potassium methoxide was fed into the reactors containing SCGs residue remaining after antioxidant extraction to produce biodiesel via in-situ transesterification. The defatted SCGs obtained after biodiesel production was further transformed to bio-char via slow pyrolysis. Antioxidant compounds with phenolic content of 10.3 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dried SCGs and antioxidant activity of 48.8 mg butylated hydroxyanisole equivalents/g dried SCGs could be extracted. Moreover, free fatty acid and moisture contents were reduced to levels suitable for in-situ transesterification. A biodiesel yield of 131.1 mg biodiesel/g dried SCGs was achieved, which was exceeded the maximum yield based on calculation. The bio-char produced from defatted SCGs had a heating value of 26.0 kJ/g and was smokeless, which satisfies the Thai community product standard (Per 238/2547). According to inventory analysis, the heat energy from bio-char product was far sufficient to support the whole processes. © 2019

AB  - Advanced biofuel production requires feedstock with specific composition in terms of quantity and quality. Decisions about the harvest time of perennial energy grasses have important implications for bioconversion process as well as for the life-span of the plant stand. Four-year data from long term-field trials were used to identify the optimal crop-specific harvest date (autumn vs. winter), in relation to advanced biofuel production. Three different perennial energy grasses (i.e., switchgrass, giant reed and miscanthus) were grown at Bologna and Catania (Italy), under northern and southern Mediterranean climate, respectively, adopting a low input management. In addition to the biomass yield and composition, the net energy value (NEV) from agricultural activities, and the energy return on investment (EROI) at the biorefinery gate was also evaluated. At Bologna, switchgrass biomass yield and quality (hemicellulose, cellulose and acid detergent lignin – ADL) were significantly enhanced when harvested in winter. At Catania, giant reed productivity, cellulose and ADL content were unaffected by harvest date, while hemicellulose and ash content decreased in winter. Biomass composition of miscanthus was more stable in Catania than Bologna, however, yield and components resulted significantly higher in Bologna than Catania, due mainly to the more even precipitation distribution throughout the vegetative crop development. The NEV was positive for all energy crops, treatments and locations, with the highest value for miscanthus grown at Bologna. The EROI of lignocellulosic bioethanol ranged from 4.16 for switchgrass in the autumn harvest at Bologna to 4.37 for miscanthus grown at Catania, which showed also the highest theoretical bioethanol production (169.2 kg h−1) at a feeding rate of 300 kg h−1 of raw material. Nonetheless, miscanthus grown at Bologna attained the highest bioethanol yield (12,254 L ha−1). This study proved that investigated perennial grasses are worth to be grown as lignocellulosic feedstock under low input for at least one decade, upon which Mediterranean region biorefineries may gain fourfold the energy invested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for energy in the world. With an energy system still based on fossil fuels, a paradigm shifts towards clean energy production based on available renewable resources is necessary. Hydrogen is a high-quality energy carrier that can be used with great efficiency and is expected to acquire a great importance in the next generation of fuels. This study aims to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the steam reforming of alcoholic waste from distilleries to produce clean electricity by using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The main findings from this study reported that the global environmental profile is better than other alternatives more common as sanitary landfill or incineration. In terms of some impact categories as Abiotic and Ozone Depletion, Acidification and Eutrophication, steam reforming of alcoholic waste performed better profiles than other processes that produce hydrogen from diverse feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As an alternative option to conventional fuels, biofuels based on light alcohols are receiving great attention. In this context, we investigate the adsorption mechanism of light alcohols in the hydrophobic metal-organic framework MAF-6. To study the effect of the conformation of molecules in the adsorption process, we evaluate the effect of the length of the alkyl chain of linear alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol) and branched alcohols (2-propanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol). We perform Monte Carlo simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble to study the adsorption and energetic properties of the systems. We analyze the structural organization and the nucleation mechanism of the molecules of alcohol and the dynamics of the adsorbed molecules within the big cavities of MAF-6. We found that the initial step of adsorption is governed by the interaction of the adsorbates with the structure, while in saturation, the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions gain importance.

AB  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements. Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Land-based mitigation, particularly through afforestation, reforestation and avoided deforestation, is an important component of the Paris Agreement to limit average global temperature increases to between 1.5 °C and 2 °C. However, the specific actions that would ensure sufficient carbon sequestration in forests remain unclear, as do their trade-offs against other land-based objectives. We use a regional integrated assessment model to identify the conditions under which European forests reach the extent required by mitigation targets. We compare stylised scenarios of changes in meat demand, bioenergy crop production, irrigation efficiency, and crop yield improvement. Only 42 out of 972 model simulations achieved minimum levels of food provision and forest extent without the need to change dietary preferences, but relied on crop yield improvements within Europe of at least 30%. Maintaining food imports at today's levels to avoid the potential displacement of food production and deforestation required at least a 15% yield improvement, or a drastic reduction in meat consumption (avg. 57%). The results suggest that the large-scale afforestation/reforestation planned in European targets is virtually impossible to achieve without transformation of the food system, making it unlikely that Europe will play its required role in global efforts to limit climate change without utilising land beyond its borders. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The effectiveness of policies and management actions in reducing the release of excess nitrogen (N) to the environment is best assessed if N fluxes across air, land, and water are regularly quantified at relevant scales. Here we compiled 2002, 2007, and 2012 inventories of inputs and nonhydrologic N outputs along with fossil fuel emissions, food demand, and terrestrial N surpluses for all subbasins of the contiguous United States using peer-reviewed, publicly available data sets. We found that at the national scale, total inputs, outputs, and surpluses changed little (±6%) between 2002 and 2012 and remained dominated by agricultural processes, despite efforts to curb N losses. This consistency at the national scale, however, obscured large counteracting shifts at regional levels driven by variable fluxes across regions. Throughout the eastern United States, declines in deposition and fertilizer inputs combined with increased crop yields resulted in a decrease in terrestrial N surpluses, which may explain recent water quality improvements in the region. On the other hand, fertilizer N inputs in the Midwest increased at a greater rate than crop harvest N increased, leading to a larger terrestrial surplus N. A large relative increase (~320%) in N emissions in the West due to an unusual wildfire season in 2012 was also observed. These changes coincided with national policies that decreased N emissions and increased demand for domestic biofuels, potentially highlighting the capacity to change the source and magnitude of N inputs and fluxes across the landscape through market and regulatory actions.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify Mexican nontoxic ecotypes of Jatropha curcas with potential for a sustainable agriculture practice to produce biodiesel and food products through a methodology and criteria of sustainability. In a rural region of Morelos state in central México, nine Mexican ecotypes of Jatropha curcas were evaluated in an experimental plantation with minimal water resources and fertilization. The experimental trial was assessed in terms of (1) toxicity, (2) growth and survival of the plants, (3) yield of seed, (4) residual biomass production, (5) oil characteristics for biodiesel production, (6) nutrimental properties of the seeds, and (7) changes in the chemical properties of the soil. Finally, two outstanding nontoxic ecotypes were identified as the most suitable for the establishment of Jatropha curcas crops to produce biodiesel and, at the same time, for food products using the de-oiled endosperm cake, for energy production from the residual biomass and for improvement of soil properties in marginal lands of rural regions of Morelos state. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Productivity throughout the North American Great Plains grasslands is generally considered to be water limited, with the strength of this limitation increasing as precipitation decreases. We hypothesize that cumulative actual evapotranspiration water loss (AET) from April to July is the precipitation-related variable most correlated to aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the U.S. Great Plains (GP). We tested this by evaluating the relationship of ANPP to AET, precipitation, and plant transpiration (Tr). We used multi-year ANPP data from five sites ranging from semiarid grasslands in Colorado and Wyoming to mesic grasslands in Nebraska and Kansas, mean annual NRCS ANPP, and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Results from the five sites showed that cumulative April-to-July AET, precipitation, and Tr were well correlated (R2: 0.54–0.70) to annual changes in ANPP for all but the wettest site. AET and Tr were better correlated to annual changes in ANPP compared to precipitation for the drier sites, and precipitation in August and September had little impact on productivity in drier sites. April-to-July cumulative precipitation was best correlated (R2 = 0.63) with interannual variability in ANPP in the most mesic site, while AET and Tr were poorly correlated with ANPP at this site. Cumulative growing season (May-to-September) NDVI (iNDVI) was strongly correlated with annual ANPP at the five sites (R2 = 0.90). Using iNDVI as a surrogate for ANPP, we found that county-level cumulative April–July AET was more strongly correlated to ANPP than precipitation for more than 80% of the GP counties, with precipitation tending to perform better in the eastern more mesic portion of the GP. Including the ratio of AET to potential evapotranspiration (PET) improved the correlation of AET to both iNDVI and mean county-level NRCS ANPP. Accounting for how different precipitation-related variables control ANPP (AET in drier portion, precipitation in wetter portion) provides opportunity to develop spatially explicit forecasting of ANPP across the GP for enhancing decision-making by land managers and use of grassland ANPP for biofuels. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The number of agricultural biogas plants has been increasing in the past decades in some European countries. Digestates obtained after anaerobic digestion (AD) of manure are usually spread on agricultural land; however, their hygiene status regarding pathogens posing public health and/or animal health challenges has been poorly characterized up to now in France. In this study, three replicates of manure and digestate were collected from five farm biogas plants receiving animal manure in order to assess the occurrence and concentrations of sporulating (Clostridium botulinum, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens) and nonsporulating (Listeria monocytogenes, thermotolerant Campylobacter spp., Salmonella, Escherichia coli, enterococci) bacteria. Concentrations of E. coli, enterococci, and C. perfringens in digestates ranged from 102 to 104, 104 to 105, and &lt;103 to 7 × 105 CFU/g, respectively. Salmonella and C. difficile were detected in manure and digestate from the five biogas plants at concentrations ranging from &lt;1.3 to &gt;7 × 102 MPN/g and from 1.3 to 3 × 102 MPN/g, respectively. Thermotolerant Campylobacter, detected in all the manures, was only found in two digestates at a concentration of cells ranging from &lt;10 to 2.6 × 102 CFU/g. Listeria monocytogenes and C. botulinum were detected in three manures and four digestates. The bacterial counts of L. monocytogenes and C. botulinum did not exceed 3 × 102 and 14 MPN/g, respectively. C. botulinum type B was detected at very low level in both the manure and digestate of farm biogas plants with no botulism history. The levels of pathogenic bacteria in both manure and digestate suggested that some bacteria can persist throughout AD. © 2019 The Authors. MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Macroalgae (seaweed)-derived fuels are gaining increasing attention due to the high rate of seaweed growth, its lack of lignocellulose (which makes for energy-efficient processing), its lack of need for land or freshwater, and its potential suitability for commercial applications in the UK. However, while technological issues are progressively being solved, wider issues of stakeholder and public perception have largely been ignored, potentially hindering the development of this technology. This research fills this gap by conducting 19 interviews with stakeholders and 7 focus groups with members of the public to gain a deeper and broader understanding of perceptions of macroalgae-derived fuels. The results highlight the technological promise and confidence in the potential of macroalgae-derived fuels. However, they also emphasise conflicts and uncertainties among stakeholders (e.g. competition with other high-value products derived from macroalgae) and the general public (e.g. conflict with marine users). This paper provides insight into potential social resistance and key issues in the macroalgae-to-fuels supply chain. This information will enable two-way communication between everyone involved and increase the likelihood of successfully developing this supply chain. Key policy issues are discussed to facilitate this communication and encourage investment in the process. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important carbon pool susceptible to land-use change (LUC). There are concerns that converting grasslands into the C4 bioenergy crop Miscanthus (to meet demands for renewable energy) could negatively impact SOC, resulting in reductions of greenhouse gas mitigation benefits gained from using Miscanthus as a fuel. This work addresses these concerns by sampling soils (0–30 cm) from a site 12 years (T12) after conversion from marginal agricultural grassland into Miscanthus x giganteus and four other novel Miscanthus hybrids. Soil samples were analysed for changes in below-ground biomass, SOC and Miscanthus contribution to SOC (using a 13C natural abundance approach). Findings are compared to ECOSSE soil carbon model results (run for a LUC from grassland to Miscanthus scenario and continued grassland counterfactual), and wider implications are considered in the context of life cycle assessments based on the heating value of the dry matter (DM) feedstock. The mean T12 SOC stock at the site was 8 (±1 standard error) Mg C/ha lower than baseline time zero stocks (T0), with assessment of the five individual hybrids showing that while all had lower SOC stock than at T0 the difference was only significant for a single hybrid. Over the longer term, new Miscanthus C4 carbon replaces pre-existing C3 carbon, though not at a high enough rate to completely offset losses by the end of year 12. At the end of simulated crop lifetime (15 years), the difference in SOC stocks between the two scenarios was 4 Mg C/ha (5 g CO2-eq/MJ). Including modelled LUC-induced SOC loss, along with carbon costs relating to soil nitrous oxide emissions, doubled the greenhouse gas intensity of Miscanthus to give a total global warming potential of 10 g CO2-eq/MJ (180 kg CO2-eq/Mg DM). © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - New contingency policy plans are expected to be published by the United Kingdom government to set out urgent actions, such as carbon capture and storage, greenhouse gas removal and the use of sustainable bioenergy to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets of the 4th and 5th Carbon Budgets. In this study, we identify two plausible bioenergy production pathways for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) based on centralized and distributed energy systems to show what BECCS could look like if deployed by 2050 in Great Britain. The extent of agricultural land available to sustainably produce biomass feedstock in the centralized and distributed energy systems is about 0.39 and 0.5 Mha, providing approximately 5.7 and 7.3 MtDM/year of biomass respectively. If this land-use change occurred, bioenergy crops would contribute to reduced agricultural soil GHG emission by 9 and 11 MtCO2eq/year in the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. In addition, bioenergy crops can contribute to reduce agricultural soil ammonia emissions and water pollution from soil nitrate leaching, and to increase soil organic carbon stocks. The technical mitigation potentials from BECCS lead to projected CO2 reductions of approximately 18 and 23 MtCO2/year from the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. This suggests that the domestic supply of sustainable biomass would not allow the emission reduction target of 50 MtCO2/year from BECCS to be met. To meet that target, it would be necessary to produce solid biomass from forest systems on 0.59 or 0.49 Mha, or alternatively to import 8 or 6.6 MtDM/year of biomass for the centralized and distributed energy system respectively. The spatially explicit results of this study can serve to identify the regional differences in the potential capture of CO2 from BECCS, providing the basis for the development of onshore CO2 transport infrastructures. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Lignocellulose composed of complex carbohydrates and aromatic heteropolymers is one of the principal materials for the production of renewable biofuels. Lignocellulose-degrading genes from cold-adapted bacteria have a potential to increase the productivity of biological treatment of lignocellulose biomass by providing a broad range of treatment temperatures. Antarctic soil metagenomes allow to access novel genes encoding for the cold-active lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, for biotechnological and industrial applications. Here, we investigated the metagenome targeting cold-adapted microbes in Antarctic organic matter-rich soil (KS 2-1) to mine lignolytic and celluloytic enzymes by performing single molecule, real-time metagenomic (SMRT) sequencing. In the assembled Antarctic metagenomic contigs with relative long reads, we found that 162 (1.42%) of total 11,436 genes were annotated as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy). Actinobacteria, the dominant phylum in this soil’s metagenome, possessed most of candidates of lignocellulose catabolic genes like glycoside hydrolase families (GH13, GH26, and GH5) and auxiliary activity families (AA7 and AA3). The predicted lignocellulose degradation pathways in Antarctic soil metagenome showed synergistic role of various CAZyme harboring bacterial genera including Streptomyces, Streptosporangium, and Amycolatopsis. From phylogenetic relationships with cellular and environmental enzymes, several genes having potential for participating in overall lignocellulose degradation were also found. The results indicated the presence of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria in Antarctic tundra soil and the potential benefits of the lignocelluolytic enzymes as candidates for cold-active enzymes which will be used for the future biofuel-production industry. © 2019, The Microbiological Society of Korea.

AB  - This study investigated the energy outputs from methane and ethanol production from sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Different methods of sorghum biomass management were compared. The effect of bio-based waste products – sewage sludge and digestate replacing urea – on the energy output of biofuels produced from two different hybrids of sweet sorghum was evaluated. Conversion of fresh sorghum biomass into methane generated 76.6–179.5 GJ ha−1, while the gross energy output from ethanol was only 22.6–70.5 GJ ha−1. Application of digestate allowed the highest energy efficiency ratio to be obtained in terms of ethanol production for both tested hybrids and in terms of methane for Rona 1. Sorghum should be used as biogas feedstock in the temperate climate of Central Europe. The application of waste – sewage sludge and digestate – in feedstock management increased the energy efficiency of biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Woody biomass has a considerable potential for energy purposes specially after densification processes which convert these materials into solid biofuels with higher energy density. This study focuses on the energy and environmental assessment of pellet production system from vine and olive grove woody biomass. The life cycle assessment (LCA) from grape and olive cultivation up to packed pellet production, ready for delivery to final users was conducted to quantify the eco-profile of agro-pellet production. The results of comparative analysis revealed that pellet production from both biomasses is dominated by cultivation phase. Vine pellet production was more dependent on chemical fertilizers specially potassium sulfate, but olive pellet production was more dependent on copper oxide pesticide. Primary energy use per MJ energy of vine pellet was greater than that of olive pellet (0.6 vs. 0.19). On the other hand, energy return ratio of olive pellet was three times of that of vine pellet (5.22 vs. 1.7). Nevertheless, olive pellet had higher environmental impacts in the forms of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity. Consequently, sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of variation in input parameters of fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, diesel fuel, transport and pelletizing process on LCA results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, use of microalgae as a cheap feedstock and heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production has gained considerable interest as they mitigate environmental problems induced by the conventional process of biodiesel production using homogeneous alkali catalysts. However, separation of heterogeneous catalysts from tissues and carcass of microalgae is an important task. For this reason, a magnetic Fe2O3–Al2O3 nanocatalyst promoted by potassium groups was synthesized using a modified impregnation method and was profoundly studied and compared with nanocatalysts without ferric oxide using X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses. The results revealed that the magnetic nanocatalyst with a core-shell structure had suitable surface area, pore size, and particle size and also had no impurity on its structure. The nanocatalyst was used for biodiesel production from microalgae cultivated in a wastewater medium via in-situ transesterification reaction. The nanocatalyst converted 95.6% of microalgae lipids to esters at optimum conditions of 65 °C, 12 mL g−1 of methanol-to-dry biomass, 4 wt% of magnetic catalyst and 6 h of reaction time. The magnetic K/Fe2O3–Al2O3 core-shell nanocatalyst was reused for several times and presented high stability with less reduction in its activity until six runs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Smallholder famers in West Africa use multiple ecosystem services (ES) in their day-to-day lives. The contribution that these services make to human well-being (HWB), and therefore to development outcomes, is not well understood. We analyse smallholder farmer perceptions of ES, ecosystem disservices (ED), and their HWB importance around community-managed reservoirs in four semi-arid landscapes in West Africa, using participatory mapping, focus groups and face-to-face surveys. Farmers identified what nature-based benefits (ES) and problems (ED) they perceived across each landscape and rated the importance of each service and disservice for their HWB. Our results indicate that ES make an important contribution to HWB in our study sites. More than 80% of farmers rated benefits from plant-based foods, domestic and agricultural water supplies, biofuel, medicinal plants, and fertile soil, and problems associated with human disease vectors, as of high or very high importance for HWB. Multiple ES were identified as contributing to each dimension of HWB, and ED as detracting from health and material well-being. Perceptions of the importance of several ES and ED varied significantly with socio-economic group, highlighting the need for careful consideration of trade-offs between HWB outcomes and stakeholders in ecosystem management decisions to support sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Coupling algal cultivation with wastewater treatment due to their potentials to alleviate energy crisis and reduce environmental burden has attracted the increased attention in recent years. However, these microalgal-based processes are challenging since daily and seasonal temperature fluctuation may affect microalgal growth in wastewater, and the effects of the temperature regimes on microalgal biomass production and wastewater nutrient removal remain unclear. In this study, Chlorella vulgaris was continuously cultured for 15 days in municipal wastewater to investigate the effects on the algal biomass and wastewater nutrient removal in three temperature regimes: (1) low temperature (4 °C), (2) high temperature (35 °C), and (3) alternating high-low temperature (35 °C in the day: 4 °C at night). Compared with the other two temperature regimes, the high-low temperature conditions generated the most biomass (1.62 g L-1), the highest biomass production rate (99.21 mg L-1 day-1), and most efficient removal of COD, TN, NH3-N, and TP (83.0%, 96.5%, 97.8%, and 99.2%, respectively). In addition, the polysaccharides, proteins, lipid content, and fatty acid methyl ester composition analysis indicates that in alternating high-low temperature condition, biomass production increased the potential for biofuel production, and there was the highest lipid content (26.4% of total dry biomass). The results showed that the nutrients except COD were all efficiently removed in these temperature conditions, and the alternating high-low temperature condition showed great potential to generate algal biomass and alleviate the wastewater nutrients. This study provides some valuable information for large-scale algal cultivation in wastewater and microalgal-based wastewater treatments. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the energy recovery through biodiesel and bioethanol production from Scenedesmus obliquus in a sequential route of lipid extraction followed by fermentation, with recycling of waste glycerol (WG) as a nutrient supplement into the culture. Low WG concentrations significantly enhanced the cellular dry weight over the control, recording the maximum significant value of 3.63 g L−1 using 2.5 g L−1 of WG (WG2.5). In addition, the maximum carbohydrate and lipid contents were recorded in WG2.5, which represented 16.4% and 21.7%, respectively, over the corresponding control, with simultaneous reduction in protein content. Moreover, total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) recovery from biomass increased after WG2.5 supplementation, recording an increase of 24.6% over the control. Fermentation of lipid-free biomass increased the rate of bioethanol production, reaching its peak of 4.82 g L−1 at the 27th day. However, using of WG2.5 for microalgal growth and the residual lipid-free biomass for fermentation showed the highest bioethanol production peak of 5.58 g L−1 at day 27. Due to the accumulation of carbohydrates under WG, the biomass treated with WG2.5 showed increase in maximum bioethanol productivity up to 0.185 g L−1 h−1. However, sequential fermentation after lipid extraction enhanced the maximum bioethanol productivity by 32.3% and 15.1% over the whole cells from synthetic wastewater (WW) and lipid-free biomass from WW, respectively. The highest gross energy output of 21.4 GJ ton−1 dry microalgae was estimated from the integrated route where S. obliquus was grown in WG-enriched medium and sequential fermentation was applied for the residual biomass after lipid extraction, with the highest recorded energy conversion efficiency of 62.9%. These findings provide an innovative practical integrated approach for waste recycling and high conversion efficiency of microalgal biomass for liquid biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the ethanol production from pomegranate peels (PPs). Therefore, the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis and different pretreatments on ethanol production by yeasts was examined. There were three different enzyme concentrations (3.6, 7.2, 14.4 FPU/g substrate) tested for enzymatic hydrolysis, and four different PP media, such as WSPP (whole slurry of PP), LFPP (liquid fraction of PP), WSFPP (washed solid fraction of PP) and N-WSFPP (non-washed solid fraction of PP), were prepared. Bioethanol production was monitored for 96 h. Maximum ethanol concentrations were obtained at WSPP medium as 12.69 g/L, 14.35 g/L and 4.23 g/L in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Pichia stipitis, respectively. On the other hand, the washing step of biomass increased the kinetic parameters dramatically and the highest theoretical ethanol yields and YP/S values were obtained from WSFPP medium in all tested yeasts. Theoretical ethanol yields were 97.8%, 98.7% and 35.5% for S. cerevisiae, K. marxianus and P. stipitis, respectively. Qp values were observed as 0.98 g/L h, 0.99 g/L h and 0.04 g/L h for the same yeasts. The highest YP/S values were detected as 0.50 g/g for S. cerevisiae, 0.50 g/g for K. marxianus and 0.30 g/g for P. stipitis in the washed pomegranate peel biomass. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To seek a way to valorize sewage sludge (SS), it was chosen as a raw material for biodiesel production. As such, non-catalytic transesterification of dried SS was carried out, to enhance its value. Note that picking a waste material such as SS as an inexpensive lipid feedstock for biodiesel production, without lipid extraction, greatly increases the economic viability of biodiesel. Also, to enhance biodiesel sustainability, ethanol (EtOH) was employed as the acyl acceptor, in this study, and this was experimentally justified by results showing that employing EtOH as an acyl acceptor provided an effective means for compensating for the lower heating value arising from the large amount of palmitic (C16) acid in SS. This study experimentally proved that the fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yield at 380 °C reached up to 13.33 wt% of dried SS. Given that the lipid content of dried SS is 14.01 ± 0.64 wt%, the FAEE yield of 13.33 wt% implied that 95.14 wt% of lipid in dried SS had been converted into FAEEs. The introduced SS valorization in this study offered an excellent opportunity to address diverse environmental hazards arising from SS and associated emerging contaminants. Given that the optimal temperature for the non-catalytic conversion for biodiesel production from SS was found to be 380 °C, emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobials, were simultaneously degraded, due to their inferior thermal stabilities. Lastly, considering that the introduced biodiesel conversion process is thermally induced, the SS reside after the biodiesel conversion process can be further used in thermo-chemical processes as raw materials for gasification and pyrolysis (future work). © 2019

AB  - On December 31, 2002, the Shatabdi Express, one of the top trains in India, ran from Amritsar to New Delhi using fuel blended with Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) seed oil. After this, very ambitious goals were set by India in 2003 to blend 20% Jatropha seed oil and ethanol in diesel and petrol by 2017, respectively, and this was expected to reach 30% by the end of 2020. During the last decade, India has undertaken various programs like Ethanol Blended Petrol Program, National Biodiesel Mission, Biodiesel Blending Program, etc., to promote the use of biofuels. Currently, the blending of ethanol in petrol and biodiesel in diesel is only about 2 and 0.1%, respectively. On June 4, 2018, India has revamped its National Policy on Biofuels, with few modifications in earlier bioenergy policies and almost same target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% biodiesel oil in diesel by 2030. Within 3 months of release of this policy, Jatropha biodiesel has energized Indian aviation to fly its first biofuel-based flight to cover about 126 miles of air distance on August 27, 2018. Here, I am briefly sharing my views about the journey of bioenergy globally and mindset of Indian policy makers regarding potential developments of bioenergy in India. © 2019, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the potential of palm oil production as a pathway to achieve the objectives of the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) of Thailand. The current and anticipated demands for domestic edible cooking palm oil consumption in Thailand, along with the demand for other marginal usages, are analyzed using a population-based model, while the palm oil needed to achieve the palm oil-based biodiesel production targets are set in the AEDP. Three scenarios are studied, i.e. base case, and with 10% variations. The anticipated demand for palm oil is transposed to surface areas needed to satisfy the total demand of palm oil. The three major characteristics for the selection of sites consist of topography (slope; elevation above mean sea level), climate (annual mean temperature, rainfall and sunshine hours; orientation), and soil characteristics (presence of clay loam and clay; depth of soil layer). The maps of suitable sites for new potential palm tree plantations are overlaid with the maps of current land use, on which prohibited and constrained zones are specifically excluded. Assuming average yields of 17%, results show that a total area of 17,800 km2 would be necessary for the production of the palm oil to achieve the 2036 AEDP energy objectives, while continuing to supply the necessary edible cooking palm oil and supplying the marginal usages. © 2019

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising technology to convert CO2 and electricity into the biofuel methane using methanogens. Until now, most investigations on electro-methanogenesis are “proof-of-principle” studies. In this paper, different strains were quantitatively compared in regard to final methane concentration, yields based on CO2-conversion, productivities as well as Coulombic efficiencies in order to identify suitable organisms for MES. Methanococcus vannielii, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanolacinia petrolearia, Methanobacterium congolense, and Methanoculleus submarinus were able to produce methane via MES at −700 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Beside methane also biological H2 production was detected during MES, which might be due to the involvement of hydrogenases. A direct electron transfer pathway is most likely. Obviously, M. maripaludis is the most resource efficient methane producer in microbial electrosynthesis regarding the methane productivity (8.81 ± 0.51 mmol m−2 d−1) and the Coulombic efficiency (58.9 ± 0.8%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper builds on the disconnection between scientific evidence and policy assumptions about the temporal profile of land use change (LUC) emissions. Whereas natural scientists find evidence of a decreasing time profile of LUC emissions, European energy policy relies on a steady time profile. We investigate the consequences of using such a uniform (constant) time profile when assessing biofuel projects with cost-benefit analysis, a widespread economic tool for public project assessment. We show that the use of the uniform time profile distorts LUC emissions costs downwards (upwards) when carbon prices grow slower (faster) than the discount rate. We illustrate our results with the conversion of grassland to wheat cultivation for bioethanol production in France. Under current assumptions in public project assessment, we find a 70% overestimation of costs related to direct LUC emissions. We propose two tools to aid in decision-making and address the decision error. Finally, we provide contextual policy recommendations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There are few studies on the use of wheat husk for anaerobic digestion until now. In this study, the BMP (biochemical methane potential) of wheat husk without pretreatment and with liquid digestate (LD) soaking pretreatment was investigated. It was demonstrated that wheat husk could be potentially used as a single feeding substrate for anaerobic digestion with a methane yield of 68 mL/g VS and this yield could be enhanced to a maximum of 130.0 mL/g VS using LD soaking pretreatment, which increased the methane production by 91%. Although the particle size (8, 5, 2 mm) and soaking pretreatment time (1, 3, 5 d) affected the biogas production, the influence of particle size was negligible when the pretreatment time was 5 days. Further analysis of the microbial community showed that the LD soaking pretreatment did not change the predominant microbial communities in the digestion. Therefore, LD pretreatment was effective in enhancing the performance of wheat husk anaerobic digestion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biowaste is a prominent source for second generation biofuels and other biobased products since it constitutes an abundant feedstock, the current treatment of which poses challenges to the environment. In the current paper, the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery system producing ethanol from biowaste is assessed by means of Life Cycle Assessment. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good environmental performance, as the net emissions are quite low for all the impact categories examined, while in many of the cases the emissions are negative. The total net global warming impact is estimated to be -15 kg CO2eq/ton biowaste. Following, the environmental impacts from biowaste treatment with the biorefinery system are compared to those from biowaste treatment with the conventional municipal waste management methods. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good performance compared to the current waste management methods. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for investigating the impact of increased enzyme dosage to the overall environmental performance of the system. It is found that, the increase in ethanol production due to increased enzyme dosage has a smaller impact to the system performance compared to the effect of increased enzyme dosage. Furthermore, it was shown that the range of enzyme contribution in the global warming impact of ethanol biorefineries is wide (11–62%) which is attributed to a number of parameters, such as the high variation of the reported global warming impact of enzymes, the different enzyme loadings and ethanol yields. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aiming to investigate the synergistic effect of K+ and anions on the primary products of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) pyrolysis. MCC was impregnated with KHCO3, KCl, K2CO3 and KOH. The GC/MS and TG-FTIR were used to investigate the volatiles during pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, as well as the product distribution of pyrolytic bio-oil obtained from fixed bed reactor, respectively. It was found that the synergistic effect of K+ and anions could catalyze the pyrolytic decomposition of MCC through ring cleavage, catalytic cracking, cyclization and dehydration reactions, thus enhancing the liquid product yield and upgrading pyrolysis bio-oil. KHCO3 was the most effective in producing and upgrading bio-oil, the liquid yield increased from 44.29% (MCC) to 59.27% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), and the yield of furanic compounds (5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural) and other O-containing compounds increased from 9.88% (MCC) to 19.84% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), 18.54% (MCC) to 46.47% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC), respectively. The yield of levoglucosan decreased from 66.21% (MCC) to 22.95% (0.10 KHCO3-MCC). The formation of levoglucosan was inhibited through ring scission of pyran directly, leading to the cleavage of 1,4-glycosidic linkage, and low molecular weight compounds were produced as platform chemical for the production of a wide spectrum of sustainable bioproducts and biofuels. © 2019

AB  - Alternative and Renewable Transport Fuels, grouping both Advanced Biofuels and Recycled Carbon fuels, are key routes for the decarbonisation of European Union (EU)and global transports: being sustainable transports a policy-driven area, the development and deployment of advanced biofuels and recycled carbon fuels will depend on well-designed regulatory frameworks. EU just ended the elaboration of the new Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), which includes specific provisions for sustainable fuels. In this context, air transport is among the most critical sectors to decarbonize, given the limited number of other options that can be adopted, such as optimization of flight routes, increase of jet engine energy efficiency, and few others. Overall, EU transports increased GreenHouse Gas (GHG)Emissions since 1990, while all other energy sectors succeeded in achieving a constant reduction over the same period. Aviation is steadily growing worldwide as well as in the EU, representing one of the most critical areas. This article investigates REDII and its implications on the different fuel production and utilisations sectors: opportunities and barriers from the new EU policy framework for these areas are identified and discussed. The large-scale deployment of these fuels will require large investments in new production facilities, to achieve considerable reductions in production costs (over the entire value chain, i.e. from feedstock production, collection and delivery, to conversion and supply). Moreover, in the specific case of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), significant investments in applying to and completing the ASTM certification for new jet fuels. In this respect, proper coordination between the REDII and the UN ICAO CORSIA programme will be essential to ensure large scale SAF market penetration. © 2019

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of multiple waste vegetables collected from an organic farm in Central Illinois was carried out using a new cartridge design anaerobic digestion system. Waste vegetables, including carrot, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, lettuce, and potato, were chopped and then mixed together to be used as the digestion feedstock. Three cartridges in the digestion chamber were rotated every week. Results showed that the system was stable, in terms of biogas and methane yields, ammonium-nitrogen concentration, and pH value, throughout the 90-day operation. On average, the daily and accumulative methane yield were 23.38 L/day/kg-VS and 490.98 L/kg-VS (21-day retention time), respectively. Rotation of cartridge significantly affected methane yield, methane concentration in biogas, and hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas. Especially, the average hydrogen sulfide concentration decreased from 1145 ppm, to 695 ppm, and then to 539 ppm, in biogas samples taken on 2 days, 4 days, and 7 days after rotation. No liquid waste was generated throughout the test. A rough estimate of the potential biogas yield shows that if all the waste vegetables and crop residues collected from this farm were used in this new anaerobic digestion system, US$4711 in energy can be saved in a year. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Global warming concerns have driven developments in carbon neutral energy, pulling initiatives on biofuels production. However, the low bulk density and low specific energy of biomass refrain its widespread use due to logistic costs comprising harvesting and collection, storage, pretreatments and transportation. This work approaches increasing land energy productivity by thermochemical conversion of residual biomass to energy products, identifying the best options in terms of energy efficiency and economic indicators. Techno-economic performance of three corncob-to-energy pathways is investigated: gasification to methanol, fast pyrolysis to bio-oil and combustion to electricity. Fast pyrolysis allows higher energy recovery in its products (79%) than biomass gasification to methanol (53%), with biomass densification (volume reduction) of 72.7% and 86.2%, respectively. The combustion route presents net efficiency of 30.2% of biomass low heating value (LHV). All alternatives are economically feasible provided biomass cost is lower than US$75.5/t. The minimum allowable product prices for economic attractiveness of gasification, combustion and pyrolysis routes are US$305/t methanol, US$80.1/MWh electricity and US$1.47/gasoline-gallon-equivalent bio-oil. Despite its vulnerability to price volatility, gasification presents the highest net present value, seconded by the combustion route, which has lower medium-term payback and investment than gasification due to its process simplicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tung tree (Vernicia fordii Hemsl.)is a potential commercial source of biodiesel which is widely planted in China and many other countries. Investigation of the regulatory mechanism of lipid biosynthesis is an essential prerequisite to improve tung tree varieties by genetic engineering. In this study, the transfer RNA (tRNA)genes were identified in four genome-sequenced species (tung tree, rubber tree, castor bean and physic nut)in Euphorbiaceae. Gene clusters were observed for the four species tRNAs. Though tRNAs were highly conserved, contrasting patterns of nucleotide diversity were observed among the tRNA family. A total of 86 differentially expressed tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs)were identified of which the target genes were enriched in lipid biosynthesis by Gene Ontology (GO)enrichment analysis. Interestingly, 11 lipid genes previously reported were identified and found to be regulated by 17 tRFs. A tRF-mRNA regulatory network was constructed, which provides a new insight into the genetic mechanism of lipid biosynthesis in tung tree. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents the quantitative bomb calorimetric high heat values (HHV) for residue samples collected from the Anaerobic Pump (®TAP) and a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CFSTR) anaerobically digesting a 50:50 wastewater sludge substrate. TAP, an advanced anaerobic digestion (AD) process, features biogas plasticization that greatly increases gas production and leaves a mineralized residual. Measured residue HHVs are compared to HHV estimates from literature empirical relationships. Two empirical formulations, the Meraz thermodynamic formulation (with 7.4% moisture) (Meraz et al. The Chemical Educator, 7(2), 66–70, (2002) and the Channiwala Universal formulation (Channiwala et al. Fuel, 81(8), 1051–1063, (2002), compared favorably (within ± 3% mean value) with the bomb measured HHV values. A stoichiometric ICC description for Ucells is derived. The thermodynamic formation potentials of all measured residues are derived including Ucells. An empirical method was used to calculate the entropy of formation (∆fS) for all residues and Ucells. Krevelen plots show residue molar ratios of oxygen and hydrogen to carbon (H/C, O/C) are linearly correlated with HHV and formation potentials (∆fG’, ∆fH’, ∆fS’) with strong statistical coefficients of determination (R2). Residue H/C and O/C ratios fell across the peat classification on the biomass coalification diagram. A wide AD methane fermentation zone ≤ 18.6 MJ/kg is identified. The methods and correlation relationships presented enable the computation of accurate HHV and thermodynamic formation potentials without the necessity of direct thermal measurement. These quantitative results confirm that steady state AD of a well-known heterogeneous solid substrate (WWTP sludge) is a linear thermodynamic process. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Balanites aegyptiaca is a drought-tolerant tree naturally distributed in Africa and has a high potential for biofuel production and livelihood. To understand the plant tolerance to drought stress, B. aegyptiaca plants collected from five provenances were subjected for 4 weeks to drought stress through different regimes of soil volumetric water content (VWC, i.e. 25% control, 15% as moderate and 5% as a severe drought stress) followed by 2-week recovery. Morpho-physiological responses as well as the changes in antioxidant defences under water stress and recovery were investigated. Drought stress significantly reduced plant biomass-related parameters, stomatal conductance, quantum efficiency and increased leaf temperature. Each provenance showed specific patterns of stress response reactions that were detected in a cluster analysis. The large leaf area and a high level of lipid peroxidation in Cairo provenance increased its sensitivity to severe drought. For provenances El-Kharga and Yemen, the highest tocopherol contents and the highest catalytic activities of ascorbate peroxidase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) were recorded. These traits contributed to the high drought tolerance of these two provenances in comparison with the other provenances. All plants recovered from stress and showed specifically increased activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a repair mechanism. Results showed that the drought tolerance level in B. aegyptiaca is provenance-dependent. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - An efficient solid base catalyst derived from waste borosilicate glass, by its reaction with sodium hydroxide, is used here for the production of biodiesel from used cooking oil. The active phase of the catalyst is found to be Na2SiO3 and the material is highly effective in the production of fuel grade biodiesel till 4 numbers of repeated cycles. The catalyst is found to be tolerant to free fatty acid and water content in the oil feedstock. The procedure is up-graded in pilot scale with the aid of a set up made of polypropylene vessels where the formation of high pressure is avoided in the reactors by the continuous condensation of methanol, making the process a safer one. We report the use of a solid catalyst derived from waste materials in a pilot-scale biodiesel production unit for the first time, which has the potential to have an easy and cost-effective industrial scale up. The performance of the prepared biodiesel and its blends with petrodiesel in diesel engine is investigated and it is found that the biodiesel blend (B10)showed the best performance at all engine loads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Renewable gasoline and diesel can be produced through integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion (IH2) using renewable feedstocks such as woody biomass from logging residues. This study assesses the potential environmental impacts of IH2 process fuels manufactured in Ontonagon, Michigan, to determine their environmental impacts and if these manufactured fuels will meet Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) requirements. The energy return on investment (EROI) is also calculated for comparison to other renewable fuels. Methods: A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment was conducted using regional forestry, timber harvest, and transportation data from the region. Regional geographic data was used to determine service areas that may provide woody biomass. The service areas were then developed into inventory data based upon the type and distribution of potential woody biomass feedstocks. Survey data from loggers in the region were used to ensure that harvest types were allocated in accordance with regional activity. Remaining inventory items were derived from existing data in the literature or existing life cycle inventory databases. This study uses a functional unit of one megajoule of gasoline or diesel produced using the IH2 process and assessed several environmental indicators as well as EROI. Results and discussion: Fuels produced generate approximately 88% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum fuels given RFS assumptions. Manufacturing and transportation of feedstocks accounts for 92.19% of energy used in production giving a calculated EROI of 4.19 and 4.31 per kilogram of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Pessimistic estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss result in GHG emissions that are approximately 83% lower. If a 1:0.5 displacement ratio of IH2 fuels is considered, the GHG emissions are about 76% lower without SOC loss and 66% lower with. This study demonstrates that while environmental impacts and EROI are sensitive to site selection and SOC estimates, there is a sufficient GHG emission reduction such that IH2 fuels are capable of meeting regulatory requirements. Conclusions: Fuels produced at the facility result in a reduction in GHG emissions, but better site selection may result in less fuel being used in transportation. Reducing the quantity of electricity needed in n-th–generation facilities would also reduce environmental impacts while improving the EROI. The energy mix used to supply IH2 facilities should also be considered during the planning process. Finally, future research may be needed to ensure feedstocks recovered from logging operations match expectations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We examine the dynamic relationships between per capita carbon dioxide emissions, real gross domestic product (GDP), non-hydroelectric renewable energy (NHRE) consumption, agricultural value added (AVA), and agricultural land (AGRL) use for the case of Argentina over the period 1980–2013 by employing the autoregressive distributed lag bound approach to cointegration and Granger causality tests. The Fisher statistics of the Wald test are examined, and the existence of a long-run cointegration between variables is proved. There are long-run bidirectional causalities between all considered variables. The short-run Granger causality suggests bidirectional causality between AVA and agricultural land use, unidirectional causalities running from AGRL to NHRE and from NHRE to AVA. Long-run elasticity estimates suggest that increasing AGRL reduces carbon emissions; increasing AVA increases GDP and reduces pollution, AGRL, and NHRE; and increasing NHRE reduces AVA and AGRL. Thus, it seems that agriculture and renewable energy are substitute activities and compete for land use. We recommend that Argentina should continue to encourage agricultural production. The substitutability between agricultural and non-hydroelectric renewable energy productions, and their competition for agricultural land use, should be at least reduced or even stopped by encouraging research and development in second-generation (or even in third-generation) biofuel production and in new technologies for renewable energy and for agriculture more efficient in land use. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: One of the European Union directives indicates that 10% of all fuels must be bio-synthesized by 2020. In this regard, biobutanol - natively produced by clostridial strains - poses as a promising alternative biofuel. One possible approach to overcome the difficulties of the industrial exploration of the native producers is the expression of more suitable pathways in robust microorganisms such as Escherichia coli. The enumeration of novel pathways is a powerful tool, allowing to identify non-obvious combinations of enzymes to produce a target compound. Results: This work describes the in silico driven design of E. coli strains able to produce butanol via 2-oxoglutarate by a novel pathway. This butanol pathway was generated by a hypergraph algorithm and selected from an initial set of 105,954 different routes by successively applying different filters, such as stoichiometric feasibility, size and novelty. The implementation of this pathway involved seven catalytic steps and required the insertion of nine heterologous genes from various sources in E. coli distributed in three plasmids. Expressing butanol genes in E. coli K12 and cultivation in High-Density Medium formulation seem to favor butanol accumulation via the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. The maximum butanol titer obtained was 85 ± 1 mg L-1 by cultivating the cells in bioreactors. Conclusions: In this work, we were able to successfully translate the computational analysis into in vivo applications, designing novel strains of E. coli able to produce n-butanol via an innovative pathway. Our results demonstrate that enumeration algorithms can broad the spectrum of butanol producing pathways. This validation encourages further research to other target compounds. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Consortium-based approaches are a promising avenue toward efficient bioprocessing. However, many complex microbial interactions dictate community dynamics and stability that must be replicated in synthetic systems. The rumen and/or hindguts of large mammalian herbivores harbor complex communities of biomass-degrading fungi and bacteria, as well as archaea and protozoa that work collectively to degrade lignocellulose, yet the microbial interactions responsible for stability, resilience, and activity of the community remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we demonstrate a "top-down" enrichment-based methodology for selecting a minimal but effective lignocellulose-degrading community that produces methane-rich fermentation gas (biogas). The resulting enrichment consortium produced 0.75-1.9-fold more fermentation gas at 1.4-2.1 times the rate compared to a monoculture of fungi from the enrichment. Metagenomic sequencing of the top-down enriched consortium revealed genomes encoding for functional compartmentalization of the community, spread across an anaerobic fungus (Piromyces), a bacterium (Sphaerochaeta), and two methanogenic archaea (Methanosphaera and Methanocorpusculum). Guided by the composition of the top-down enrichment, several synthetic cocultures were formed from the "bottom-up" using previously isolated fungi, Neocallimastix californiae and Anaeromyces robustus paired with the methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii. While cross-feeding occurred in synthetic co-cultures, removal of fungal metabolites by methanogens did not increase the rate of gas production or the rate of substrate deconstruction by the synthetic community relative to fungal monocultures. Metabolomic characterization verified that syntrophy was established within synthetic co-cultures, which generated methane at similar concentrations compared to the enriched consortium but lacked the temporal stability (resilience) seen in the native system. Taken together, deciphering the membership and metabolic potential of an enriched gut consortium enables the design of methanogenic synthetic co-cultures. However, differences in the growth rate and stability of enriched versus synthetic consortia underscore the difficulties in mimicking naturally occurring syntrophy in synthetic systems.

AB  - This experimental study aims to mitigate harmful emissions from a CI engine using bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) approach. The engine used for this experimental work is a single cylinder CI engine with a rated power of 5.2 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The BECCS approach is a combination of plant-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. The whole investigation was done in four phases: (1) Substituting diesel with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) (2) Equal volume blending of Orange oil (ORG) with KOME (3) 20% blending of n-butanol (B) with KOME-ORG blend (4) CCS system with zeolite based non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and mono ethanolamine (MEA) based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system with KOME-ORG + B20 blend. The experimental results show that substitution of diesel with KOME reduces smoke emission, but increases NO and CO2 emission. KOME-ORG blend reduces CO2 and smoke emissions with high NO emission due to combustion improvement. In comparison with the sole combustion of KOME at full load condition, the combination of KOME-ORG + B20 as bio-fuel with zeolite based post-combustion treatment system resulted in a maximum reduction of NO, smoke and CO2 emission by 41%, 19% and 15% respectively. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The nutrient flows and the economic viability of a farm-scale grass biorefinery concept for a pig farm were assessed. Grass silage was separated into liquid and solid fractions, where the liquid fraction was used as pig feed and the solid fraction was directed to biogas production together with pig slurry. The addition of grass to the farm’s crop rotation and its use in feed and biogas production slightly increased the share of nitrogen (N) circulating within the farm by 2%, thus decreasing phosphorus circulation by 3%. Despite the positive effect on N balance, the economy of the farm-scale concept had challenges. However, upgrading biogas to vehicle fuel and selling it on farm was more economically viable than combined heat and power production. The proposed concept could be economically viable with a slight increase in the price of vehicle fuel, a slight increase in the price of the grass liquid fraction, or better optimization of the system, starting with grass cultivation and processing. Moreover, profitable production could also be reached by increasing the scale of production by increasing farm size or by two or more farms working together.

AB  - Perennial grasses offer potential for high lignocellulosic biomass yields on marginal land that can be used for conversion to biofuels. However, fertilizer nutrient inputs are often required to maintain high yields. This study evaluated biochar and fermentation residuals as alternative supplemental nutrient sources for elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.) feedstock production. Treatments were (1) 50 kg N ha−1 (E50); (2) 50 kg N ha−1 + fermentation residual (E50FR); (3) 50 kg N ha−1 + biochar (E50BC); and (4) 250 kg N ha−1 (E250). The E50 treatment was not enough to sustain elephantgrass yields over time, as E250 biomass yields were greater in years 3 and 4 compared with E50. Residual amendments had little effect on yield. Plant N concentration in E250 (7.5 g kg−1) was twofold greater compared with all other treatments along with generally greater N removal. Residuals were largely unable to supply additional N, as they did not increase tissue N concentrations or N removal compared with E50. Across years, soil P and Ca levels were 59 and 46% lower, respectively, for E50 and E250 than for E50FR and E50BC, which maintained nearly constant levels throughout the study. Application of biochar (E50BC) increased soil concentrations of Mg, B, Zn, and Mn. Supplemental nutrients are needed to sustain long-term elephantgrass productivity on marginal land of the southeastern U.S. Bioenergy residuals may fill this role when combined with low fertilizer N and possibly K inputs. Identifying optimal amendment application rates will be important to prevent excess accumulation of some elements. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Much field research on perennial bioenergy crops confounds effects of plant age with those of the growing season, which increases uncertainty and the potential for erroneous conclusions, particularly in maturing stands. Most studies rely on stands planted in a single year and measured across multiple subsequent seasons. These “single-start” designs lack statistical power to separate temporal from environment effects. We used a staggered start experimental design to learn if increased statistical power clarified understanding of Miscanthus × giganteus nitrogen (N) needs. We conducted a staggered start experiment with three planting years and five N rates during the M. × giganteus yield-building phase at three sites across IA, USA. Third-year yields were 21.0, 25.0, and 27.1 Mg dry matter (DM) ha−1 at the northwest (NW), central, and southeast (SE) sites, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization effects changed with establishment conditions, but not with plant age. At the most N responsive site, N fertilizer changed yields at all stand ages, but not in every year. Yield increases of 150%, 36%, and 40% were observed in 1-, 2-, and 3-year-old stands, respectively, with N addition. Nitrogen effects on 1-year-old stands were positive in SE IA (2.7 kg DM kg−1 N added), negative (− 2.3 kg DM kg−1 N) in NW IA, and variable in central IA (− 2.2–9.6 kg DM kg−1 N), suggesting a site–year-specific response. Yield increases between the first and second years varied by &gt; 100% depending on establishment conditions, highlighting the need for repeated planting before determining economic and agronomic crop viability. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and carinata (Brassica carinata) are nonfood oilseeds known for their potential as a promising biofuel feedstock; however, their associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has not been well studied. This study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of N fertilization rates on selected soil properties and soil surface GHG fluxes from camelina and carinata fields in South Dakota, USA. The experimental design comprised of four N rates (0, 28, 56, 84 kg N ha−1) in 2014, 2015 and 2016, replicated four times. At harvesting, soil samples were collected in all years at both fields to measure pH, electric conductivity, total nitrogen, and soil organic carbon. The GHG fluxes were taken biweekly from 2014 to 2016 using a static chamber. Our results demonstrated that increasing N fertilization rates resulted in decreased soil pH in the carinata field in 2015 and increased soil organic carbon and electrical conductivity in the camelina field in 2014. Total nitrogen was not affected by N fertilization rates in all years. For the GHG gases, the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly influenced by the application of N fertilization rates in all years. However, the N2O flux significantly increased with the increasing of N fertilization rates at both fields in 2014 and 2015. In general, the effect of N fertilization rates on soil properties and GHG fluxes in both oilseed crops were similar. Data from this study showed minimal responses of soil properties to N fertilization rates. Increasing N fertilizer application in camelina and carinata crops resulted in higher N2O emissions. Therefore, improved application strategies for N fertilizer management in camelina and carinata crops need to be explored to avoid any negative environmental impacts. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Perennial systems, such as switchgrass have been shown to improve soil hydraulic properties on degraded soils relative to annual cropping systems; however, studies of the effects on thermal properties are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of topsoil thickness on soil thermal properties under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and row crop production systems. The experiment was carried out at the University of Missouri South Farm Research Center (38°54′ N, 92°16′ W). Research plots were re-established in 2009 with selected topsoil thickness categorized into two treatments (shallow [4 cm] and deep [36 cm]) on a Mexico silt loam (Vertic Epiaqualfs). Plots were planted to either switchgrass or a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation with four replicates. Undisturbed soil cores (7.6 by 7.6 cm) and bulk soil were collected from two depths (10 cm increments) to determine thermal properties. Thermal conductivity (λ), volumetric heat capacity (Cv), and thermal diffusivity (D) were measured at 0, −33, −100 and − 300 kPa soil water pressures. In addition, soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density (Db) and water content (θ) were also determined. The results showed that the switchgrass treatment had 23% higher SOC, 5–8% greater θ, and 11% lower Db than the row crop treatment. In turn, switchgrass plot exhibited a 5–7% reduction in λ, an 8–9% reduction in D, and a 2–3% increase in Cv. Shallow topsoil thickness demonstrated increased thermal properties (λ, D and Cv) relative to the deep topsoil thickness, likely due to higher clay content in the surface soil horizon and associated higher θ. This study contributes to a better understanding of the impact of topsoil loss and perennial vegetation on the thermal properties of soils in degraded landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The long-lived dependence on fossil fuels has led to a slow pace in the transition to renewable energy sources in the heavy-duty sectors of the energy system. While bioenergy might represent a possible alternative, biomass is a limited resource, whose use is restricted by potential technical, environmental and social impliations. Because residual biomass inherently minimises these negative impacts, when its sustainable use is ensured, it could lend itself to multiple options, including production of back-up power, heating and alternative transport fuels. This study investigates different pathways for the optimal use of the most abundant residual biomass in Denmark, i.e. straw, from a technical, economic and environmental perspective. We harness the strengths of two bottom-up model typologies by means of soft-linkage to reveal insights from both perspectives: the multi-sectoral model, TIMES-DK, provides a system assessment of the whole energy sector, while the geographically detailed optimization model, Balmorel-OptiFlow, supports the analysis of biorefinery plant size, location and area-specific recovery of excess heat. Modelling results of carbon- and resource-constrained energy scenarios reveal the increased value of straw in a future decarbonised energy system and the attractiveness of the gasification route with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for the production of biofuels to supply the heavy segments of the transport sector. Moreover, relying on current domestic biomass resources would not attain the energy self-sufficiency targets in a carbon-constrained case. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biochar is widely used for various environmental remediation strategies such as soil amendment because of its intrinsic carbon negativity and porosity. Biochar is a charcoal-like material produced via pyrolysis of biomass. To determine an effective method for modification of the porosity and morphology of biochar and establishment of a more sustainable pyrolysis platform for biomass valorization, this study used CO2 as a reactive gas medium in the biomass pyrolysis process. This study placed emphasis on elucidating the role of CO2 in the production of biochar from different types of biomass, such as cellulose, xylan, lignin, grass, and oak wood. The surface area and porosity of biochar were strongly related to the type of biomass. Under comparable pyrolysis conditions, the surface area of biochar decreased in the following order: cellulose &gt; xylan &gt; lignin ∼ oak wood &gt; grass. The use of CO2 as the gas medium in biomass pyrolysis affected the surface area and porosity of biochar samples derived from biomass feedstock. For instance, the surface area and total pore volume of the oak-wood-derived biochar produced in the CO2 environment were twice those produced in the N2 environment. Given that the increases in the biochar surface area and porosity were attributed to the enhanced release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)from biomass, CO2 may have enhanced VOC release (removal)during pyrolysis. Therefore, the use of CO2 in a pyrolysis platform is expected to be a strategic approach for biomass valorization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Open-air burning of wastes from tree pruning is a common practice in many regions worldwide. However, this practice degrades air quality and contributes to the greenhouse effect. Aiming at characterizing particle (PM10) and gaseous emissions, the smoke from the open burning of vine, olive, willow and acacia branches was sampled and then analyzed by multiple techniques. Emission factors of gaseous compounds were as follows (g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis): 1564–1663 CO2, 40.6–87.7 CO, 2.06–5.82 CH4, 0.91–3.73 ethane, &lt;0.99 ethylene, and &lt;1.80 formaldehyde. PM10, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) emissions were in the ranges 8.76–20.1, 2.70–7.44, and 0.32–1.18 g kg−1 biofuel, dry basis, respectively. From the PM10 emitted, water soluble ions represented from 5.3% (vines) to 13.6% (acacia). Potassium was the dominant ionic species, accounting for a PM10 content from 1.4 to 4.7% wt. While in smoke from vines and olive combustion the NaCl mass fractions were lower than 0.9%, higher weight percentages were obtained for willow (3.6) and acacia (6.7). On average, OC accounted for PM10 mass fractions of 33.4, 19.3, 32.3 and 36.5%, while EC represented 5.04, 2.34, 3.53 and 7.32% for willow, acacia, vines and olive combustion, respectively. Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the combustion of vines and olive branches were one order of magnitude higher than those from acacia and willow. Mean levoglucosan mass fractions of 18.1, 13.2, 17.1 and 12.4 mg g−1 PM10 were obtained in samples from the combustion of vines, olive, willow and acacia, respectively. Smoke particles also encompassed several other polar constituents, such as various types of acids, phenolic compounds, sterols, and polyols, whose contribution to the PM10 mass varied with the biofuel burned. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article contributes to scholarly understanding of how policy ideas and institutions interact to affect policy change by investigating why legislation mandating the use of biofuels in transport vehicles has been upheld in the USA but scaled back in the European Union. To explain this puzzle, the article advances propositions regarding the role of multidimensional policy ideas, policy anomalies and institutional gatekeepers in legislative agenda-setting. Using structural topic modelling and qualitative methods, the analyses demonstrate that differences in action frames follow from agenda-setting institutions. The corporate structure of the European Commission ensures that EU agenda-setters are reasonably attentive to policy anomalies. By contrast, individuals with agenda-setting authority in the US Congress are liable to discount anomalies by limiting their focus to certain aspects of multidimensional policy issues. Moreover, individuals with gatekeeping authority may prevent repeal bills from accessing the legislative agenda. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel mixed with fossil jet fuels has a lot of potential in applications of jet fuel extenders. To understand the fundamental properties of this typical mixture, measurements on densities and viscosities for the ternary model system of exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (1) + isopropylcyclohexane (2) + methyl laurate (3) and three corresponding binary mixtures have been implemented over the entire composition range at eleven different temperatures from 293.15 to 343.15 K. The excess molar volumes (VmE) and viscosity deviations (δη) of binary mixtures were calculated and correlated by the Redlich-Kister equation, while the corresponding data of ternary mixtures were fitted to Nagata-Tamura, Cibulka, Singh, and Redlich-Kister equations. Furthermore, the variations of VmE and δη were represented and discussed based on molecular interactions and structural effects in detail. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: As a renewable and clean energy carrier, the production of biohydrogen from low-value feedstock such as lignocellulose has increasingly garnered interest. The NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (NfnAB) complex catalyzes electron transfer between reduced ferredoxin and NAD(P)+, which is critical for production of NAD(P)H-dependent products such as hydrogen and ethanol. In this study, the effects on end-product formation of deletion of nfnAB from Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27 were investigated. Results: Compared with the parental strain, the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the δnfnAB mutant was increased. The concentration of hydrogen and ethanol produced increased by (41.1 ± 2.37)% (p &lt; 0.01) and (13.24 ± 1.12)% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively, while the lactic acid concentration decreased by (11.88 ± 0.96)% (p &lt; 0.01) when the δnfnAB mutant used glucose as sole carbon source. No obvious inhibition effect was observed for either SCUT27 or SCUT27/δnfnAB when six types of lignocellulose hydrolysate pretreated with dilute acid were used for hydrogen production. Notably, the SCUT27/δnfnAB mutant produced 190.63-209.31 mmol/L hydrogen, with a yield of 1.66-1.77 mol/mol and productivity of 12.71-13.95 mmol/L h from nonsterilized rice straw and corn cob hydrolysates pretreated with dilute acid. Conclusions: The T. aotearoense SCUT27/δnfnAB mutant showed higher hydrogen yield and productivity compared with those of the parental strain. Hence, we demonstrate that deletion of nfnAB from T. aotearoense SCUT27 is an effective approach to improve hydrogen production by redirecting the electron flux, and SCUT27/δnfnAB is a promising candidate strain for efficient biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Indian biofuel policy targets large scale utilization of lignocellulosic feedstock. Efficient utilization of the available feedstocks without increasing the pressure on the agricultural land, water and other inputs is essential for overall sustainability. This work focuses on recommending the optimal selection of lignocellulosic feedstock for the Indian biofuel sector considering several sustainability indicators. Six different feedstocks, namely, cotton stalk, rice husk, wheat stalk, sorghum stalk, sugarcane bagasse, and sugarcane molasses, are considered for the production of ethanol using a standardized process. The criteria for selection include life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy return on investment (EROI), life cycle water use, and land use for ethanol production. Since the decision making criteria show trade-offs, multi-objective linear programming problem was formulated. The model targeted a specific amount of ethanol production without exceeding the feedstock availability, and was solved for different ethanol blending targets. The results recommended complete utilization of sugarcane molasses followed by use of feedstocks such as sugarcane bagasse and sorghum stalk. A strong trade-off was observed between GHG footprint and the other two objectives for EROI 5.08 for base case of 20% blending. Optimal feedstock combination included sugarcane molasses (26.8%), sugarcane bagasse (67%), and sorghum stalk (6.2%) for lowest EROI of 5.08. But for highest EROI of 5.6 the optimal feedstock combination included sugarcane molasses (10.2%), sugarcane bagasse (68.3%), sorghum stalk (6.2%) and cotton stalk (15.3%). The scenarios such as reduced availability of sugarcane bagasse, increase in gasoline demand, effect of data variation gives the additional insights for optimal selection of feedstocks for different blending percentages. The work concluded that sugarcane based feedstock were very critical. Moreover, the proposed approach needs to be systematically used by the decision makers for sustainable biofuel development in India. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ocean resources have been exploited at unprecedented rates, leading to marine biodiversity loss, food web changes, and other alterations of ocean ecosystem functions and structures. The capture of wild fish for human consumption and fishmeal are the primary drivers. Microalgae oil has long been investigated for biofuel production. Its co-product, defatted microalgal biomass, has potential to replace fishmeal from wild fish catch and thus mitigate ocean resource depletion. This study develops a new indicator for assessing consequential impacts on ocean resources in life cycle assessment. The indicator is based on primary production required, a concept previously used in ecological assessments and life cycle assessments to evaluate ecological impacts of fisheries and aquaculture. We estimate the primary production required for fishmeal production from the ocean (166 kg carbon/kg fishmeal), and the potential of defatted microalgae biomass displacing fishmeal. Results show that defatted microalgae biomass can lead to highly variable, but potentially significant, reductions in ocean resource demand. The variability is a function of the potential for replacement, which depends on the cultured fish species considered. As an example of this significance, based on available data for estimating the potential for defatted microalgal biomass to displace fishmeal for cultured tilapia, salmon, shrimp, carp, flounder, yellowtail and cod, by 2020 net primary production demand from the ocean could be reduced by approximately one billion tons of carbon. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae cells have been recognized as a promising sustainable resource to meet worldwide growing demands for renewable energy, food, livestock feed, water, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and materials. In order to ensure high-efficiency and high-quality production of biomass, biofuel, or bio-based products, purification procedures prior to the storage and cultivation of the microalgae from contaminated bacteria are of great importance. The present work proposed and developed a simple, sheathless, and efficient method to separate microalgae Chlorella from bacteria Bacillus Subtilis in a straight channel using the viscoelasticity of the medium. Microalgae and bacteria migrate to different lateral positions closer to the channel centre and channel walls respectively. Fluorescent microparticles with 1 μm and 5 μm diameters were first used to mimic the behaviours of bacteria and microalgae to optimize the separating conditions. Subsequently, size-based separation in Newtonian fluid and in viscoelastic fluid in straight channels with different aspect ratios was compared and demonstrated. Under the optimal condition, the removal ratio for 1 μm microparticles and separation efficiency for 5 μm particles can reach up to 98.28% and 93.85% respectively. For bacteria and microalgae cells separation, the removal ratio for bacteria and separation efficiency for microalgae cells is 92.69% and 100% respectively. This work demonstrated the continuous and sheathless separation of microalgae from bacteria for the first time by viscoelastic microfluidics. This technique can also be applied as an efficient and user-friendly method to separate mammalian cells or other kinds of cells. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biomass has become an important approach to meet the current requirements of energy and oil alternatives. In recent years, extensive research has been carried out on the transformation of biological wastes into biofuels and biorefineries through pyrolysis, which may gradually be replacing the crude-oil resources. One promising pyrolysis route is intermediate pyrolysis, which opens the field to the valorization of a high variety of biological residues into biofuels including gases, liquid chemicals, and carbonizate. In the present work, the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) technology based on intermediate pyrolysis with integrated catalytic reforming is discussed, showing high productivity and higher quality biofuels compared to traditional pyrolysis systems. This paper illustrates the data from the upscaling of the TCR system from laboratory scale to pilot scale using sewage sludge as feedstock. The effects of the design differences are studied from the point of view of the qualities of products, mass, and energy balances of the laboratory unit upon the pilot unit. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Residual biomass is a renewable resource with attractive characteristics to produce energy and biofuels. Diverse studies have stated that residual biomass used for biofuels and energy production can contribute partially to solve the energy demand problem, decreasing fossil fuels carbon emissions. Most works have focused on developing new technologies, processes, and processing systems based on biomass. Other works have addressed the supply chain-planning problem to determine optimal locations considering diverse objectives. A third group of works have proposed schemes based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to determine suitable locations in different types of systems. Nevertheless, works capable to combine the advantage of GIS, mathematical programming, and process design have not been properly conducted. Therefore, this paper presents a sequential approach for the optimal planning of a residual biomass processing system. The methodology considers selecting potential locations through a multicriteria methodology based on GIS. Also, this paper proposes a mathematical programming approach for the optimal planning of a residual biomass processing system, which considers as input the locations predefined by GIS methodology, as well as six potential products, six processing routes, and eight raw materials. The mathematical programming approach consists of mass balances to obtain the interconnections between the different supply chain nodes, as well as constraints to model the considered technologies involving capital investment and production costs. The GIS approach was applied to a case study in Mexico, which produced 764 harvesting sites and 334 processing plants for all considered residual biomass types. The optimization approach conducted used 33 processing plants, 467 harvesting sites, and 2 products from 3 biomass types in order to determine the final supply chain topology. Results show that the proposed methodology is a useful tool to determine the optimal supply chain topology during the decision process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Seaweed aquaculture is a relatively young industry in the United States compared to Asian countries. Early attempts at seaweed aquaculture in California, Washington State, New York and the Gulf of Maine in the 1980s and 1990s did not result in commercial production but provided important lessons. Since 2010, commercial cultivation of kelp (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, and Alaria esculenta) and other seaweeds (Palmaria palmata and Porphyra umbilicalis) began in the Gulf of Maine and Long Island Sound. Seaweed aquaculture is now a fast-growing maritime industry, especially in New England. If seaweed aquaculture is to maintain its momentum, it is important to (1) emphasise the environmental benefits; (2) domesticate a variety of local species; and (3) diversify seaweed products for food, animal feed, phycocolloids, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and ultimately biofuels if it becomes economically viable due to the cost of production. The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the United States offers opportunities for expansion of seaweed aquaculture in an area greater than the entire land mass of the United States and with limited user conflicts. This study reviews the past and current status of seaweed aquaculture in the United States and discusses potential opportunities and challenges of open-water seaweed aquaculture. © 2019, © 2019 International Phycological Society.

AB  - Plant biomasses enriched in crystalline cellulose allomorphs, such as native cellulose I (CI), can be structurally altered using anhydrous liquid ammonia to form an enzymatically less recalcitrant cellulose III (CIII) allomorph. Here, we designed and implemented an advanced ammonia pretreatment reactor/sampler setup that allowed us to systematically study the impact of several process parameters on ammonia-cellulose complex and ultimately CIII formation, including ammonia-to-cellulose concentration, ammonia/cosolvent concentration, pretreatment time, and temperature. Pretreated cellulose ultrastructural characterization was performed using complementary X-ray diffraction-, FTIR-, and FT-Raman spectroscopy-based techniques. We found that the amorphous content of cellulose increased initially when the intermediate ammonia-cellulose complex was formed within the first 30 s of pretreatment. However, a reduction in the amorphous content was observed if the complex was annealed for longer periods of time and/or at high temperatures, resulting in a highly crystalline and well-ordered CIII allomorph. However, depending on the exact pretreatment conditions tested, CIII-"like" cellulosic substrates with varying allomorphic ultrastructures and crystalline order were formed. Interestingly, CIII-like allomorphs with higher crystallinity were more easily hydrolyzed by cellulase enzymes compared to native CI and lower crystallinity CIII-like substrates. This work highlights the challenges associated with systematically conducting ammonia treatments, interpretation of the CIII ultrastructure using appropriate analytical techniques, and the influence of cellulose ultrastructure on enzymatic digestibility in light of previous work. Finally, we explored reduced severity and more cost-effective pretreatment conditions that could lower recalcitrance of cellulose by producing crystalline CIII and enable adoption of more advanced ammonia-based pretreatments in cellulosic biorefineries.

AB  - This paper deals with a performance evaluation of locally made 20L batch type reactor and JP and AM biodiesels produced by using this reactor. The inputs for transesterification process were Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oils, with an alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1% NaOH catalyst, 55 °C reaction temperature, an hour settling time and 600 rpm agitation speed. The conversion ability of the reactor for Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oil seeds has shown a 94% and 94.5%, respectively. The property of these biodiesels has analyzed and its result was within the limit of ASTM D6751. Performance and emission behavior of different blends of these oils such as B10, B20, B30 and pure diesel were evaluated in a single cylinder, four stroke CI engine with rated speed of 1500 rpm and rated power of 4 kW. The B10 blend has shown closer characteristics in terms of specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature at different loads to diesel. On the other hand, B10 has resulted with higher CO2 and CO and lower NOx emission potential compared to the two blends. The lower NO2 emission is due to its lowest exhaust gas temperature. The biodiesels finally pass standard tests of EPE by fulfilling the standard parameters that made them competitive and substitute options to diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Abstract: The article presents the results of a study of black carbon concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer over the Baltic and North seas, the North Atlantic, and Norwegian, Barents, Kara, and Laptev seas from June 30 to September 29, 2017, on cruises 68 and 69 of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. Black carbon has a significant impact on climate change and pollution in the Arctic. It forms as a result of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal and oil) and biomass or biofuels. It consists of submicron particles and their aggregates and can be transported long distances from their source. Samples were taken by pumping air for 4–6 h through Hahnemule quartz filters at a height of 10 m above sea level in a headwind to prevent exhaust from the smokestack from entering the filters. The black carbon content was subsequently determined in a laboratory with an aethalometer. The backward trajectories of air mass transfer and the transported black carbon particles to the sampling points were calculated by the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model on the NOAA website at http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ready.html. Studies show low black carbon concentrations (&lt;50 ng/m3) along the expedition’s route when the air masses came from background regions of the North Atlantic and Arctic. High black carbon concentrations (100–200 ng/m3 or more) are characteristic of active shipping areas (southwestern Baltic, North Sea) and near ports (e.g., Reykjavik), as well as the arrival of air masses from industrialized areas of Europe in the southeastern Baltic and from oil and gas field areas where gas flaring is carried out (North, Norwegian, and Kara seas). © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - In the effort to control global warming and fossil carbon emissions, many countries are proposing new policies to make their energy matrix more renewable. The increase share of bioethanol as a transportation fuel emerges as a short-term solution because its production technology is mature and it can be blended to gasoline. Ethanol production reached 108 billion liters in 2018 and is predicted to increase in the next years. In this work the global CO2-eq emission, which is avoided by the use of 1G and 2G ethanol in the transportation sector, was estimated based on specific cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessments for corn, sugarcane and beet ethanol, and on the volume consumed by top global players. Considering the period 2008–2018, the use of ethanol (mainly 1G) contributed to the reduction of approx. 0.5 billion ton CO2-eq emissions, and will contribute with another 160 billion ton CO2-eq till 2030 (99% from 1G ethanol). © 2019

AB  - High resolution computer imaging was developed to evaluate the root dynamics of a biofuel plant—castor bean in a plastic container. Root growth dynamics of the plant was evaluated to determine root and root hair morphology and responses to a particular soil at various time intervals with soil depth. High resolution (2400 picture elements (pixels) cm−1) desktop scanners were buried in containers filled with soil to characterize root and root hair development in every day and after every 7 days. Length from the root tip to the root hair initiation zone, the root hair length (RHL) and root hair diameter (RHD) increased with time and depth. Root development of castor was rapid and extensive compared with shoot growth. Thirty-three days after sowing (DAS) roots of the plant were at least three times as long as the corresponding plant’s shoots. After harvest, roots were washed in water for visualizing actual length. The root hair length (mm) and root hair density (mm−1) was determined for primary axial and lateral roots. The diameter of primary root was higher than the lateral roots and lateral root elongation rate was slower than the primary. This novel approach to in situ rhizosphere imaging allowed observation of an important biofuel plant in root development in response to different soil levels over time and should be useful in future studies of rhizosphere interactions with other biofuel crop establishment and management. This paper therefore describes an automatic method to trace castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) seedling roots grown on soil in a container with high resolution computer imaging technique. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study analyzed the perceptions of four stakeholder groups (forest landowners, private forest consultants, forest management researchers or educators, and federal or state agency foresters), regarding their management practices and preferred geographic growing conditions of loblolly pine in Virginia by combining AHP (analytical hierarchy process) and regression modeling. By ranking the importance of different geographical conditions for managing loblolly pine, we aimed to identify ways to support loblolly growth as a potential feedstock for biofuel generation. We achieved this through collecting survey responses from 43 stakeholders during the 2019 Virginia Forestry Summit. The results showed that the landowner, researcher/educator, and federal/state agency stakeholder groups all indicated that proximity to a mill was the most important criteria, whereas the consultant stakeholder group indicated that proximity to a road was the most important criteria. All the stakeholder groups indicated that distance from protected land was the least important criteria, followed by proximity to a water body and flat land. The regression model revealed that acres of land managed and loblolly rotation age were correlated to the weight given to the distance to a mill criterion, where increased acreage and increased rotation age were associated with an increased prioritization of proximity to a mill. Distance from protected land, the lowest-ranking criteria, was shown to have an association with the level of experience with loblolly, where more experience was associated with a lower prioritization of proximity from protected land. A contingency analysis of the self-identified level of experience with loblolly in each stakeholder group revealed that federal/state agency foresters had the most experience, followed by consultants, landowners, and researchers/educators. The research supports the importance of understanding the variation of perceptions between and within stakeholder groups in order to develop the necessary infrastructural and policy support for the sustainable development of bioenergy. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy has resulted in the exploitation of fossil fuels, which led to its depletion; therefore, this has focused our attention on the development of alternative energy sources in the advanced biofuels production. Lignocellulosic biomass is available abundantly on this earth, which is renewable and a better choice for bioethanol production as well as in terms of biorefinery concept. For bioethanol production using enzyme and the biochemical platform is considered to be a better approach as it is eco-friendly and more feasible. Around 15% to 20% of the total cost of biofuel production is of the enzyme; therefore, it has become today's requirement to produce enzyme and develop other methods or processes to enhance enzyme production. This review discusses the development in fermentation and culturing technique to improve enzyme production and the pretreated solid after of hydrothermal process as the inducer in the enzyme production for advances in biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Influenced by feedstock type and microbial inoculum, different microbial groups must precisely interact for high-quality biogas yields. As a first approach for optimization, this study aimed to identify through time the biogas-producing microbial community in a 10-ton dry anaerobic digester treating cattle manure by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and metagenomics. Moreover, the associated bovine residues or feedstocks (leachate, manure, oxidation lagoon water, rumen) were also characterized to determine their contribution. A diverse and dynamic community characterized by Bacteria (82%–88%) and a considerable amount of Archaea (8%–15%) presented profiles particular to each stage of biogas production. Eukaryotes (2.6%–3.6%), mainly fungi, were a minor but stable component. Proteobacteria represented 47% of the community at the start of the run but only 18% at the end, opposite to the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group (8% and 20%, respectively), while Firmicutes (12%–18%) and Actinobacteria (12%–32%) remained relatively constant. Methanogens of the order Methanomicrobiales represented by several species of Methanoculleus were abundant at the end of the run (77%) contrary to Methanosarcinales (11%) and Methanobacteriales (0.7%). Therefore, methanogenesis mainly occurred by the hydrogenotrophic pathway. Manure and oxidation lagoon water seemed to contribute key microorganisms, while rumen dominated by Methanobrevibacter (72%) did not proliferate in the digester. Manure particularly possessed Methanoculleus (24%) and uncultured methanogens identified by DGGE, whereas oxidation lagoon was exclusively abundant in Methanolinea (18%) and Methanosaeta (19%). Leachate, as the microbial inoculum from a previous run, adequately preserved the biogas-producing community. These results could lead to higher biogas yields through bioaugmentation strategies by incorporating higher proportions or an enriched inoculum from the relevant feedstocks. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Methanogenesis occurs in many natural environments and is used in biotechnology for biogas production. The efficiency of methane production depends on the microbiome structure that determines interspecies electron transfer. In this research, the microbial community retrieved from mining subsidence reservoir sediment was used to establish enrichment cultures on media containing different carbon sources (tryptone, yeast extract, acetate, CO2/H2). The microbiome composition and methane production rate of the cultures were screened as a function of the substrate and transition stage. The relationships between the microorganisms involved in methane formation were the major focus of this study. Methanogenic consortia were identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and functional genes connected with organic matter transformation were predicted using the PICRUSt approach and annotated in the KEGG. The methane production rate (exceeding 12.8 mg CH4 L-1 d-1) was highest in the culture grown with tryptone, yeast extract, and CO2/H2. The analysis of communities that developed on various carbon sources casts new light on the ecophysiology of the recently described bacterial phylum Caldiserica and methanogenic Archaea representing the genera Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanothrix. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that representatives of Caldiserica may support hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas. Emissions of this gas are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, mainly in the transportation sector worldwide. Biofuel is a promising alternative instead of diesel considering that it allows a reduction on the emissions of polluting gases. In Brazil, there is a large program on the use of biofuels, which according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This work shows the N2O emissions resulting from combustions of diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends of B7, B15, B20, B25, B35, and B50. In parallel, another experiment was done with fuel sample adopted by a bus fleet from São Paulo using blends comprising 10% of sugarcane diesel in diesel (CD10) and blends with beef tallow biodiesel of CD10: CD-B15, CD-B20, CD-B25, CD-B35, and CD-B50. The photoacoustic spectroscopy technique coupled to a quantum cascade laser (QCL) was used to detect N2O. Concentrations of the emissions were detected in the range of 5.3 to 7.4 ppmv for diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends combustion and in the range of 4.3 to 11.0 ppmv for diesel/sugar cane diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends combustion. The technique used was very sensitive and selective to identify and determine the emission concentrations of N2O. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Expansins are cell wall-loosening proteins found in all land plants and many microbial species. Despite homologous structures, bacterial expansins have much weaker cellulose binding and wall-loosening activity than plant expansins. We hypothesized stronger cellulose binding would result in greater wall-loosening activity and used in vitro evolution of Bacillus subtilis BsEXLX1 to test this hypothesis. Mutants with stronger binding generally had greater wall-loosening activity, but the relationship was nonlinear and plateaued at ~ 40% higher than wild-type. Mutant E191K exhibited stronger cellulose binding but failed to induce creep, evidently due to protein mistargeting. These results reveal the complexity of interactions between plant cell walls and wall-modifying proteins, an important consideration when engineering proteins for applications in biofuel production and plant pathogen resistance.

AB  - CO2 is main contributor of global warming crisis. Among various existing carbon-capture technologies, microalgae based biological carbon-capture is one of the promising less energy consuming technology. Microalgae are gaining attention for bridging carbon mitigation and bioenergy production. Microalgae biomass is considered as CO2-neutral substitute for fossil fuel which results through net transfer of atmospheric CO2 into biomass. Traditionally, biofuel production process utilized lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock. Recently, microalgae rise as 3rd generation bioenergy feedstock due to its attractive higher CO2 fixation efficiency, higher biomass productivity and relatively easy pretreatment processes for various biofuel extractions. Although commercial microalgae CCS process is still at pilot scale and microalgae derived biofuels are nonviable. Further technological development in microalgae cultivation and bioenergy conversion enable the effective CO2 reduction and sustainable energy development simultaneously, and this review will update the progress in microalgae cultivation, biomass conversion to biofuel technology which can be utilized under BECCS technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper was to determine the potential of bioethanol production using two rangeland communities dominated by Spartina argentinensis Parodi or Panicum prionitis Ness. and its environmental sustainability, considering soil organic carbon and biodiversity measured in two taxa: flowering plants and epigeal soil arthropods. S. argentinensis and P. prionitis biomass production with two different harvest frequencies (every 6 or 12 months) was estimated and compared with control areas. Biomass production did not differ with harvest frequency. Although cell wall fibers composition varied with species and treatment, potential bioethanol production per hectare was not affected and yields were similar to those obtained from other lignocellulosic materials reported in the literature. According to our results, one annual harvest is recommended for both plant communities in order to minimize economic and energy costs. Soil organic carbon showed no statistically significant differences due to treatments in the S. argentinensis community, though differences were found in the middle layer (7.5–15 cm) of the P. prionitis rangeland. The vegetation and arthropods biodiversity indices analyzed (richness, evenness, abundance, and diversity) were not affected by treatments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Globally, biofuel and oleochemical production based on plant oils negatively affects biodiversity. As an alternative triglyceride source, lipid production from oleaginous yeasts faces numerous challenges in feedstock availability, lipid productivity, downstream processing, and waste treatment, prohibiting the design of a cost-competitive process with regard to plant equivalents. In this study, we present a fully integrated operation for microbial oil production, which consolidates upstream and downstream processing with side-stream recycling. Co-fermentation of sugar and acetic acid was successfully implemented in fed-batch, semi-continuous, and continuous fermentation modes. Process validation was conducted at a 25 L scale with a lipid productivity of 1.2 g L-1 h-1. Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus cell debris was used as an inducer in Trichoderma reesei fermentation for on-site generation of yeast-specific cell-wall hydrolases. In situ hydrolase application allowed for efficient C. oleaginosus cell lysis (85% w/w) and simultaneous lipid release. A subsequent centrifugation step yielded 90% (w/w) recovery of intracellular lipids without the need for any organic solvent. The nutrient-rich water phase was applied as an internal sugar source for subsequent yeast fermentation cycles. With this yeast hydrolysate, the lipid productivity was considerably increased to 2.4 g L-1 h-1. A techno-economic analysis of the current lipid production processes estimated costs at $1.6 per kg lipid. Moreover, life cycle assessment analysis indicated an emission of 3.56 kg CO2 equivalents for every 1 kg produced yeast oil. Accordingly, we established an integrated operation for bioconversion of acetic acid and sugar to sustainable lipids at maximum productivity coupled with minimal waste generation and energy consumption. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Trade liberalization and globalization processes are resulting in an increased spatial integration of agricultural commodity markets. According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, land-abundant countries like Ukraine should export land-intensive goods. Therefore, the international integration of commodity markets should lead to the integration of factor markets, land markets among them. Biofuel expansion in the European Union constitutes a chance for a stronger integration of the Ukrainian agricultural market with the European Union market. However, trade policy and biofuel policy modifications create both chances for and threats to strengthening such market integration. In this framework, the present paper aims at assessing—for the first time—to what degree the Ukrainian and European Union rapeseed markets are horizontally integrated. Considering that rapeseed imported to the EU is processed to fulfil the mandatory blending of biofuels with diesel, the Ukrainian rapeseed prices are expected to follow the EU prices. To answer our research question, we employ linear vector error correction models (VECMs) and threshold autoregressive models (TAR) based on weekly prices for rapeseed from 2008–2018. The results confirm direct and indirect integration of both markets via physical trade flows of rapeseeds, rape cake, and rape oil, providing evidence that the prices of rapeseed in Ukraine and European Union are cointegrated and that adjustments to the long-run equilibrium relationship are asymmetric and seasonal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New methods of fiber pre-processing and cellulosic fermentation may allow production of isoparaffinic kerosene, a bio-based jet fuel, from abundant post-logging biomass residues in western Oregon and Washington, USA. Since production of these residues is characterized by complex spatial patterns that can shift markedly over time, and since residues may comprise roughly one-fifth of annual refinery operating costs, careful evaluation of residue supply (quantity/price) behavior is warranted. We examine potential residue supply characteristics at two likely refinery sites (Longview, WA and Springfield, OR) using a projection model of the regional log market that explicitly recognizes: (i) spatial locations of harvesting activities, (ii) the transportation network and residue haul costs, and (iii) the underlying conditions of the forest resource that determine harvesting methods and residue collection costs. We find that delivered residue prices in the range of $US64–75/bone dry metric tonne (BDMT) would be required to provide the 771,100 BDMT per year needed by a minimum commercial-sized refinery operation. Timber ownership and spatial harvesting patterns could give the Longview location nearly a $US12/BDMT wood cost advantage over Springfield at this minimum supply level, and operation of the Longview site would limit Springfield's ability to meet the minimum supply volume. Scenario analyses of lower residue collection costs indicate that a 1% reduction in costs could yield 0.6–0.9% increases in delivered supply at both refinery sites in the neighborhood of the minimum scale of commercial operation. Simulations of tripled residue output from federal lands, assuming RIN eligibility, suggest 15–30% increases in delivered residue supply at Springfield but only 0–10% increases at Longview, reflecting greater area and closer proximity of federal lands at Springfield. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increased bioeconomy targets for the biomass share of renewable energy production across Europe should be met using land unsuitable for food production. Miscanthus breeding programs targeted the production of plants with a diverse range of traits allowing a wider utilization of land resources for biofuel production without competing with arable crops. These traits include increasing tolerances to drought, chilling, and to metal(loid)s excess. Two novel Miscanthus hybrids, GNT41 and GNT34, were compared against Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) on metal-contaminated arable land in Poland. This study aimed at evaluating their yield, biomass quality and quantifying seasonal differences in photosynthetic and transpiration parameters. A secondary objective was to identify key physiological mechanisms underlying differences in metal accumulation between the investigated plants. The new hybrids produced a similar yield to Mxg (13–15 t ha−1 yr−1), had shorter shoots, higher Leaf Area Index and stem number. Based on gas exchange measurements, GNT34 exhibited isohydric (water-conserving) behavior. The stomatal response to light of the new hybrids was at least twice as fast as that of Mxg, a trait that is often associated with increased seasonal water use efficiency. This contributed to the almost 40% reduction in shoot Pb and Cd concentrations for the new hybrids as compared to Mxg. This suggested that promoting stomatal regulation in conjunction with improved water conservation may be a target for improving plants for wider use on metals contaminated land. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Excess carbon footprint is one of the major environmental issues of this decade. Microalgae have emerged as promising biomass feedstock for carbon-neutral fuels as a replacement of fossil-based fuels. Algal biofuels could overcome the shortcomings of first- and second-generation biofuels, mainly completion with food/cash crops and high cost of raw materials. Since the selection of microalgae strain is crucial for product quality, this review provides comprehensive information about the general characteristics of microalgae based on their taxonomic classification. Recent advances in the development of algae biofuels from upstream cultivation to downstream processing are presented. Downstream processing of algae is analysed by providing a deep insight into the techniques applied for biomass pre-treatment, cell disruption, lipid extraction, and product fractionation. The integration of waste bioremediation and biofuels production is also discussed. © 2019

AB  - Industrialised agriculture is heavily reliant upon synthetic nitrogen fertilisers and imported protein feeds, posing environmental and food security challenges. Increasing the cultivation of leguminous crops that biologically fix nitrogen and provide high protein feed and food could help to address these challenges. We report on the innovative use of an important leguminous crop, pea (Pisum sativum L.), as a source of starch for alcohol (gin) production, yielding protein-rich animal feed as a co-product. We undertook life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental footprint of 1 L of packaged gin produced from either 1.43 kg of wheat grain or 2.42 kg of peas via fermentation and distillation into neutral spirit. Allocated environmental footprints for pea-gin were smaller than for wheat-gin across 12 of 14 environmental impact categories considered. Global warming, resource depletion, human toxicity, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication footprints were, respectively, 12%, 15%, 15%, 48% and 68% smaller, but direct land occupation was 112% greater, for pea-gin versus wheat-gin. Expansion of LCA boundaries indicated that co-products arising from the production of 1 L of wheat- or pea-gin could substitute up to 0.33 or 0.66 kg soybean animal feed, respectively, mitigating considerable greenhouse gas emissions associated with land clearing, cultivation, processing and transport of such feed. For pea-gin, this mitigation effect exceeds emissions from gin production and packaging, so that each L of bottled pea gin avoids 2.2 kg CO2 eq. There is great potential to scale the use of legume starches in production of alcoholic beverages and biofuels, reducing dependence on Latin American soybean associated with deforestation and offering considerable global mitigation potential in terms of climate change and nutrient leakage — estimated at circa 439 Tg CO2 eq. and 8.45 Tg N eq. annually. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Early thinning of loblolly pine plantations can potentially deliver sustainable feedstocks for biofuel/bioenergy. However, the management intensification for increased productivity and the removal of additional biomass from these plantations could reduce carbon (C)inputs belowground and therefore reduce overall ecosystem C storage. Increased fertilization could also affect C stocks, and their relative distribution between soil organic matter (SOM)fractions. We analyzed soil C stocks as a function of soil type and different pine plantation management systems across the Western Gulf region of the United States. Additionally, we analyzed SOM fractions with inherently different stabilization mechanisms and potential C persistence. We found no significant differences in bulk soil C stocks across management intensities or soil types. The early thinning treatment had no effect on the C distribution across each soil organic matter fraction. However, proportionally more C was found in mineral-associated organic matter and less in particulate organic matter in the more intensive management regime treatment, possibly due to higher below ground nutrient inputs and enhanced microbial activity. Our results suggest that management intensification to support biofuel production from loblolly pine plantations will not affect soil C stocks, but may increase their persistence. This study demonstrates that, from a soil C perspective, early thinning of intensively managed loblolly pine plantations has potential as a sustainable biofuel feedstock. © 2019

AB  - Derived from renewable feedstocks, aviation biofuel is generally perceived as inherently sustainable. However, its production involves a wide range of sectors and interacts with different actors in society. It is therefore important to understand and evaluate not only the environmental impacts of that process, but also its socioeconomic effects. At present, empirical studies assessing socioeconomic aspects of aviation biofuel are rare in scientific literature. The aim of this study, therefore, is to assess key effects of aviation biofuel production on employment, GDP, and trade balance. A scenarios-based Input-Output (IO) analysis was used to evaluate these socioeconomic effects, taking Brazilian aviation biofuel production to 2050 as an example. To address the uncertainty of IO analysis, we have proposed a stochastic simulation approach for the technical coefficients in the IO model. Four distinct scenarios were developed. In each, three potential combinations of technologies and feedstocks for producing aviation biofuel were evaluated: sugarcane via alcohol to jet (ATJ), macauba via hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), and eucalyptus via Fischer-Tropsch (FT). Among other things, we found that the production of aviation biofuel would create around 12,000–65,000 jobs, while contributing US$200-1100 million to Brazil's GDP under different scenarios with different supply chains. The socioeconomic effects calculated deterministically were generally higher than the stochastic outcomes, which can be explained by factors such as technological learning and economic growth. Aviation biofuel production showed large positive net socioeconomic effects on employment and GDP, although some of the fossil sectors would be negatively affected. Overall, the macauba-HEFA chain (with the highest effects on employment and GDP, and the lowest effects on imports) seemed to be the most favorable of the scenarios studied, despite the relatively high level of uncertainty associated with it. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of monochromatic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth and biodiesel yield of the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus. Different LEDs were applied individually or in combination during the night period. Among different individual treatments, red and blue illumination showed the highest biomass and lipid productivity due to stimulation of pigmentation and photosystem II, respectively. Microalgal growth, lipid production and biodiesel recovery significantly increased under combined blue-red illumination. In addition, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids proportions increased in favor of polyunsaturated ones. Moreover, blue-red LEDs enhanced the net biodiesel energy output over the control. The total increase in net energy output represented 5.1, 3.8 and 10.8 MJ using red, blue and blue-red light, respectively. In conclusion, application of blue-red LEDs during the night period is an economical technology for microalgae cultivation, which might have a potential impact on the future of commercial biodiesel production from microalgae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy sources can help combat climate change but knowing the land, water and carbon implications of different renewable energy production mixes becomes a key. This paper systematically applies land, water and carbon footprint accounting methods to calculate resource appropriation and CO2eq GHG emissions of two energy scenarios. The ‘100% scenario’ is meant as a thinking exercise and assumes a complete transition towards bioenergy, mostly as bioelectricity and some first-generation biofuel. The ‘SDS-bio scenario’ is inspired by IEA's sustainable development scenario and assumes a 9.8% share of bioenergy in the final mix, with a high share of first-generation biofuel. Energy inputs into production are calculated by differentiating inputs into fuel versus electricity and exclude fossil fuels used for non-energy purposes. Results suggest that both scenarios can lead to emission savings, but at a high cost of land and water resources. A 100% shift to bioenergy is not possible from water and land perspectives. The SDS-bio scenario, when using the most efficient feedstocks (sugar beet and sugarcane), would still require 11–14% of the global arable land and a water flow equivalent to 18–25% of the current water footprint of humanity. In comparative terms, using sugar or starchy crops to produce bioenergy results in smaller footprints than using oil-bearing crops. Regardless of the choice of crop, converting the biomass to combined heat and power results in smaller land, water and carbon footprints per unit of energy than when converting to electricity alone or liquid biofuel. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Since the Kyoto protocol, the EU renewable energy policy has been the driving force in research and development of the production and use of biofuels. Therefore, the utilization of biofuels and the scientific research to widen the scope of their commercialization are being increasingly promoted. In this context, we present here an overview of the technological developments that have occurred in the production of different biofuels and their resources with a focus on the lignocellulosic biomass and biofuels derived from it. In the recent years, many technologies have evolved enabling the production of different liquid biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Bioethanol production using microbial fermentation, and production of bio-oil using fast pyrolysis process of biomass are some of the most widely researched and promising technologies. The first production plants based on these techniques are already operational. Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass promises a good fuel yield under laboratory scale. However, there are several challenges that need to be tackled before the production process can be commercialized. We provide here an overview of the various possibilities that can be exploited for biofuel production and make recommendations for increasing the production efficiency with a view to improving the overall yield and lowering the production costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research into the potential use of microalgae to produce biofuels is receiving significant attention. In the cold climates of countries like Canada, algae cultivation in open raceway pond (ORP) systems is limited to a short period of the year when pond surface water temperatures and ambient light conditions enable optimal culture growth. In this study we develop techno-economic assessment models to predict, evaluate, and compare the techno-economic results from three autotrophic algae cultivation scenarios to produce algae biomass. The first is a modeled ORP site located in the southern USA, which has a minimum biomass selling price (MBSP) for algae of $541 tonne−1 (T−1). The second scenario models an identical ORP system co-located at a site near Fort Saskatchewan, a northern city in the province of Alberta, Canada. The resulting MBSP is $1288 T−1. A third scenario models a photobioreactor (PBR) cultivation system co-located at the same northern Alberta site and shows algae production with an MBSP of $550 T−1. Each system is scaled to produce 2000 T day−1 ash-free dry weight (AFDE) algae biomass. The study concludes that PBR systems deployed at this scale have the potential to reduce production costs significantly ($ T−1) compared to similarly sited ORP systems in Canada, despite climatic factors and high initial capital costs associated with PBR construction. Furthermore, the modeled PBR system required 0.3% of the water required by the ORP cultivation platforms (153 × 103 versus 59 527 × 103 m3) and 0.04% of the land (32 versus. 82 038 ha). © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - This paper is primarily a case study on transesterification of avocado oil for the synthesis of biodiesel. Many operational parameters and components were studied in an attempt to identify the optimal process for non-catalytic transesterification, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), an acyl acceptor was identified as key to one very efficient methodology. Non-catalytic transesterification experiments using DMC and/or methanol (MeOH) were conducted under varied temperatures and varied amounts of silica loading. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of 92.96% was shown to be achievable at 380 °C. The miscibility of avocado oil and DMC was seen to be a key factor in providing a strategic means for delaying thermal cracking of FAMEs. Lastly, this study reported that the optimal mass ratio of silica to oil was over 8 at 380 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As history shows, the yield gap (the difference between actual and achievable yields) will not necessarily close automatically. Investments in agricultural technologies may be key. Price volatility is fundamental to investment. Price volatility has increased in agriculture in the past decade, leading to higher risks for potential investments. Some of these increased risks may be offset by the certainty offered by credible policies. The US experience indicates that ethanol policy may contribute to yield increases. Analysis suggests that corn use by ethanol plants in the USA may explain a significant part of the observed yield increase. A theoretical framework, centered on downside price-stabilization effects, is offered here, supported by some US, EU, and Hungarian empirical evidence. The research presented explores whether new ethanol plants resulting from effective biofuel policies could serve as a market mechanism to stimulate investments in farming technologies, triggering increased productivity. A survey of local stakeholders of an ethanol plant in Hungary, the only large-scale biofuel investment triggered in Europe by the EU's flagship bioenergy policy (the Renewable Energy Directive) suggests that relevant investments may have been stimulated. Over half of the respondent farmers said that the presence of the ethanol plant had stimulated investments in productivity. It is proposed that ethanol or biofuel policies may be effective in closing the yield gap, in effect resulting in additional biomass production and advancing the bioeconomy. With effective cross-sectoral policies, more biomass for food, feed, bio-based materials and / or bioenergy purposes can be produced. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In this review, the conversion (thermochemical, biological and hybrid) of chemical energy chiefly enclosed in biomass structures i.e. as 30–50% cellulose, 15–35% hemicellulose and 10–20% lignin into various forms of fuels/energy products is comparatively analyzed. Cellulose and hemicelluloses formulate almost ∼70% of the biomass and are definitely linked to the lignin structural units all the way through covalent and hydrogenic bonds; thereby, the structure formulated is tremendously rigid and resistive against processing. Hence, the vital confront towards the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into important bio-yields via biorefining is to overcome this obstacle. This article gives an outlook over the major conversion technologies to produce biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstock, by focusing on their typical performances. The core points outlined and argued will be the currently positioned pathways, utilizing the lignocellulosic materials to produce (bio) fuels, prospect on biomass supplies, and discussion on the impact of sustainability criteria, main influencing factors and uncertainties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study the starch from Solanum lycocarpum fruit was used for bioethanol production. S. lycocarpum starch was hydrolyzed in a serial reactor containing α-amylase and glucoamylase immobilized onto glutaraldehyde-derivative polyaniline, producing 91.6% of glucose for a 10% starch suspension and 86.3% of glucose for a 20% starch suspension after 60 min of reaction. Fermentation parameters for bioethanol production were evaluated by using a full factorial design (32) with fermentation time (h) and concentration of glucose equivalent (%) as independent variables. Results from factorial design showed that the highest ethanol production was found when 1% of glucose equivalent was fermented by 48 h. At these conditions the bioethanol conversion efficiency reached 92.13% and it was estimated a productivity of 596.96 L tonne−1. It can be concluded that the starch from S. lycocarpum fruit is a promising non-food and renewable energy source for bioethanol production. © 2019

AB  - Climate change is the most serious threat that the world is facing today. Transport sector in general and road transport in particular have a prominent contribution in intensifying the causes of climate change. Mitigating the vehicular greenhouse gas emission is one of the finest approaches to deal with climate change. Thus, the main aim of the study is to examine the vehicular greenhouse gas emission reduction measures being undertaken in the emerging cities of Ethiopia. The study has employed a descriptive research method with qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Data for the study were obtained from the emerging and second largest city of Ethiopia, Mekelle. Auxiliary facts are also obtained from the other two emerging regional capital cities (Bahir Dar and Adama) and one city council (Dire Dawa) of Ethiopia. This study has found that two measures of reducing vehicular greenhouse gas emissions are being undertaken in the urban road transport of Ethiopia: the technical and nontechnical measures. The technical measures of reducing vehicular emissions entertain mechanical measures taken by drivers. These include: use of biofuel, annual inspections of cars and complying with speed limits. Nontechnical measures, on the other hand, incorporate policy measures carried out to reduce the levels of emissions. These include: extending public transport services, promoting the use of non-motorized transport, taxing vehicles, integrating urban transport with the land use planning, improving and extending urban road infrastructures, regulation of transport-related legislation, and organizing civil society movements to mitigate vehicular emissions. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The efficiency of a gas turbine can be affected by the use of different biofuels usually with a relatively Lower Heating Value (LHV). The paper evaluates the impact of calorific value of fuel on turbine performance and analyzes the possibilities of optimizing turbine construction from the point of view of maximum efficiency for a particular fuel. The several variants of design of small power microturbines dedicated to various biofuels are analyzed. The calculations were carried out for: gas from biomass gasification (LHV = 4.4 MJ/kg), biogas (LHV = 17.5 MJ/kg) and methane (LHV = 50 MJ/kg). It is demonstrated that analyzed solution enables construction of several kW power microturbines that might be used on a local scale. Careful design of such devices allows for achieving high efficiency with appropriate choice of the turbine construction for specific fuel locally available. Such individually created generation systems might be applied in distributed generation systems assuring environmental profits. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article describes the design and field evaluation of a low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping robot for energy sorghum for use in biofuel production. High-throughput phenotyping approaches have been used in isolated growth chambers or greenhouses, but there is a growing need for field-based, precision agriculture techniques to measure large quantities of plants at high spatial and temporal resolutions throughout a growing season. A low-cost, tracked mobile robot was developed to collect phenotypic data for individual plants and tested on two separate energy sorghum fields in Central Illinois during summer 2016. Stereo imaging techniques determined plant height, and a depth sensor measured stem width near the base of the plant. A data capture rate of 0.4 ha, bi-weekly, was demonstrated for platform robustness consistent with various environmental conditions and crop yield modeling needs, and formative human–robot interaction observations were made during the field trials to address usability. This work is of interest to researchers and practitioners advancing the field of plant breeding because it demonstrates a new phenotyping platform that can measure individual plant architecture traits accurately (absolute measurement error at 15% for plant height and 13% for stem width) over large areas at a sub-daily frequency; furthermore, the design of this platform can be extended for phenotyping applications in maize or other agricultural row crops. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The EU decarbonization strategy foresees deep cuts in CO2 in the transport sector. Investment in infrastructure, manufacturing of new technology vehicles and production of alternative fuels induce macroeconomic changes in activity and employment for both national and regional economies. The objective of the paper is to present a newly built macroeconomic-regional model (GEM-E3-R general equilibrium model for economy, energy and environment for regions) for assessing impacts of transport sector restructuring on regional economies of the entire EU, segmented following NUTS-3 (nomenclature of territorial units of statistics). The model combines general economic equilibrium theory with location choice and New Economic Geography and implements a dynamic, fully endogenous agglomeration-dispersion mechanism for people and industries coupled with a gravity model for bilateral interregional flows. A novelty of the model is a two-layers structure: (i) the country-wide layer formulated as a global multi-sector, multi-country and multi-period computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; and (ii) the regional economy layer, which simulates impacts on regional economies, while considering country-wide economic trends as boundary conditions. The paper presents a use of the model in the assessment of regional economic effects of electrification of car mobility in Europe and wide use of domestically produced advanced biofuels. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present renewable energy market development with particular regard paid to biofuels in the EU. The analysis included data on the share of renewables in Gross Island energy consumption, changes of renewable energy in the years 2004–2016 and the amount of liquid biofuels. The authors of the paper used descriptive and statistical methods to describe the changes in bioenergy development in the European Union (EU). The biggest share of biofuels and renewable waste can be seen in Latvia (31.2%), Finland (26.7%) and Sweden (24.8%). The highest percentage of wind energy in 2015 was found in: Denmark (7.2%), Portugal (4.3%), Ireland (4.0%) and Spain (3.5%). The highest share of solar energy in 2015 was found in Cyprus (3.5%), Spain (2.6%) and Greece (2.2%). The highest contribution of geothermal energy was found in 2015 in Italy (3.5%), Portugal (0.8%) and Slovenia (0,7%). Hydropower was the biggest in 2015 in Sweden (14.2%), Austria (9.6%) and Slovenia (5.0%). The highest coefficients of variation of the share of electricity from renewable energy sources were found in the years 2004–2017 in Malta (140.3%), Cyprus (101.1%) and United Kingdom (71.9%). In addition, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling in the years 2004–2017 were found in Malta (72.4%), United Kingdom (69.81%) and Hungary (44.91%). Moreover, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in transport in the years 2004–2017 were found in Finland (113.78%), Malta (115.52%) and Belgium (96.53%). The biggest producers of ethanol and biodiesel in EU were Germany, France and Poland. Cluster analysis data show that Germany and France are of key importance in the production of biodiesel and ethanol. The biodiesel production increased in the years 2003–2017 from 719,32 million liters to 13323 million liters (increase 1852.2%). However, in the years 2014–2017 a stagnation in biofuel production was observed from 13673 million liters to 13323 million liters (−2,56%). The situation on the market and the increasing demand for green energy suggest that the production of ethanol and esters of vegetable oils will increase by 2030, which will contribute to the development of this sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent movements for the decarbonization of the electricity sector have become a priority for many countries around the world and will inevitably lead to the sharp decline of fossil-fuel-based energy. Energy from fossil fuels is to be replaced by renewable energy sources (RES), although the transition will neither be cheap nor smooth. One sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels and which will take a considerable share in the increasing supply of renewable energy resources is biofuels. There are various types of biofuels used in practice; however, biodiesels represent one of the most popular and widespread ones. This paper focuses as a case study on the byproducts of Jatropha curcas, a crop and a plant that is already used for biofuel production and which is subsequently employed in electricity generation in Jatropha curcas producing regions. This paper identifies the limitations and prospects of Jatropha curcas utilization. Also, Jatropha curcas is compared to other materials suitable for biomass generation. An economic analysis for a 2 MW biofuel powerplant was conducted incorporating various market-related risks. The study shows that at current prices, net profitability can be achieved using Jatropha curcas byproducts for producing electricity. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The diminishing reserves of fossil fuel, indecision in its availability and global warming issues has interested many researchers to look for the renewable source of fuel. The main source of renewable liquid fuel was oils of the seed crops. One of the oilseed crops that had been studied is Pongamia pinnata L. (further is called P. pinnata). Oil content and fatty acid composition are important attribute desirable in seed oil. Monounsaturated fatty acids are the best components for biodiesel (i.e. oxygenate fuel) when considering the low temperature fluidity and oxidative stability. However, biodiesel derived from vegetable oils always consists of significant amounts of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids alkyl esters, which hampers its practical applications. Therefore, in order to increase added value of vegetable oils, the oxygenate fuels (e.g. biodiesel) should be modified to biohydrocarbon fuel (e.g. green diesel) which has similar properties to diesel fuel from fossil. In addition, straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon molecules (n-paraffin) should be as well as modified to be branched hydrocarbons to lowering the freezing point and low temperature fluidity of the renewable fuel.Therefore, the renewable fuel applications become more widely. The objective of this work to evaluate the biohydrocarbon (renewable fuel) profile that resulting of decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap based on P. pinnata seed oil. It was found that oil content in P. pinnata seeds originate of Kupang was 36.01 weight%. The monoun saturated compounds contained in the oil approximately 30%. Decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap resulting high biohydrocarbon with main carbon chain length were 15 (C15). © 2019, EM International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thermal pre-flocculation to enable dispersed air flotation is an economical and ecofriendly technology for harvesting microalgae from water. However, the underlying mechanism and optimal conditions for this method remain unclear. Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) and Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus) were harvested using a thermal flotation process. The surface structure and characteristics (morphology, electricity, and hydrophobicity) of the microalgae were analyzed using FT-IR, SEM, zeta potential, and a hydrophobic test. The hydrophobicity of S. obliquus exceeded that of C. vulgaris. Under the thermal pre-flocculation, S. obliquus (88.16%) was harvested more efficiently than C. vulgaris (47.16%). Thermal pre-flocculation denatured the lipids, carbohydrate, and proteins of microalgal cell surfaces, resulting in a decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between the cells and air bubbles. The highest harvesting efficiency was 91.96% at 70°C, 1412 rpm, and 13.36 min. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for economic and ecofriendly harvesting of microalgae for biofuels and other bioproducts industries.

AB  - Microalgae was recognized as the sustainable energy feedstock for producing biofuels. Now bio-diesel produced from algal biomass is getting ready to address the energy crisis that the world would face tomorrow. This paper deals with the utilization of microalgae biodiesel at 30% blend, to investigate the influence of operating parameter such as injection pressure on the characteristics of a compression ignition engine. Microalgae crude oil was derived from chlorella vulgaries and it was converted into microalgae methyl ester (MME) using transesterification process. The desired test fuel was prepared by mixing of 30% MME with 70% pure diesel and designated as B30. The experiment was conducted on single cylinder four stroke diesel engine powered with B30 at various fuel injection pressures in the range of 180 bar, 200 bar and 220 bar. The experimental results showed that, no significant impact of modified injection pressures on BSFC, whereas BTE was increased maximum by 14.09% at 200 bar. The exhaust emissions such as CO, CO2, UHC and smoke opacity were improved mostly at 200 bar injection pressure, but NOX emission was increased, and increment in cylinder peak pressure was discovered only at 200 bar. © BEIESP.

AB  - Perennial energy crops like switchgrass that are used for biofuel production have the potential to generate various water quality benefits such as reduced nitrogen runoff. Yet the current expected returns to switchgrass are not profitable enough for these crops to be widely adopted by U.S. farmers due to relatively unstable yields, volatile revenues, and high costs of crop establishment. This study uses a dynamic economic model to investigate the uncertainties in the yields and costs of switchgrass production, in comparison with those of corn-soybeans in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed in Pennsylvania. Results indicate that farmers would be willing to convert corn-soybeans to switchgrass land use with the provision of payments for ecosystem services (PES). A targeted PES policy based on the environmental effectiveness of the crop land is found to be slightly more effective in providing nitrogen reductions than a uniform PES policy with cost savings of 8-19%. Moreover, switchgrass has the potential of providing energy supply while reducing greenhouse gases emissions. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the market drivers of corn monocropping in the U.S. Midwest by empirically analyzing crop rotation responses to market fluctuation from 2005 to 2014 and the price shock induced by the recent biofuel mandate. We find that the expected market returns for crops have a significant impact on farmers' decisions about monocropping. We also find that corn monocropping is loosely associated with the presence of nearby ethanol plants. This study illustrates the emerging use of high-resolution land cover data to tackle critical agribusiness and agro-environmental policy questions that remain elusive with aggregate data. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Global climate change policy enforcement has become the new driving force of resource grabbing in the context of the "scramble of resources" in Africa. Nevertheless, the environmental crisis should not be seen as an isolated phenomenon amid contemporary capitalism. On the contrary, a very distinct feature of the current wave of land grabs is the convergence of multiple crises, including food, energy/fuel, environmental, and financial. The Southern Mozambique District, Massingir, is an area with high potential regarding water sources and biodiversity. It recently became a host of a biofuel project, and also a huge block of land is being transformed into a conservation/tourism area; answering to many issues within capitalism's crisis, this area is an evidence of how synergetic resource grabbing can arise as a response to the convergence of multiple crises. Therefore, by analyzing the emerging politics of natural resources in Massingir District and the dynamics regarding the land-use change, changes in property relations, it is possible to understand how rural livelihoods are shaped. Risks related to food security and sovereignty, loss of control and access to resources, consistent narrowing down of the set of livelihood strategies, and inter-community conflicts over scarce resources are the main implications of such emerging climate-smart land politics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - According to the assumptions of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD, the share of biofuels in the global transport sector is estimated to reach 15–23% by 2050. The triticale can be used to produce bioethanol. The appropriate production process should generate as much renewable energy as possible per production unit. Plant production can be carried out in various tillage systems and using appropriate doses of nitrogen fertilization. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of traditional tillage system (TRD) and reduced (RED) tillage technology and nitrogen fertilizer (0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha−1) on grain and bioethanol yield of spring triticale. The field experiment was performed in the south east of Poland (50◦420 N, 23◦150 E) on medium dystrophic typical brown soil. Based on research and calculations, the TRD system and between 40 and 80 kg ha−1 of N fertilizer are recommended for use in the cultivation of triticale for bioethanol production purposes. Such a variant will ensure a sufficient yield of grain (5.190 and 5.803 t ha−1), starch (3.462 and 3.871 t ha−1) and bioethanol (2487.3 and 2780.7 L ha−1) and good agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer (16.96 and 12.15 L of bioethanol per 1 kg of nitrogen (N) applied). The best ratio of energy efficiency of bioethanol production (EROI—Energy Return on (Energy) Investment or “net energy”) was recorded for the TRD system (1.138:1) and for the N fertilizer at 40 kg N ha−1 (1.144:1). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that switchgrass has a wide range of genetic variation and that productivity is linked to local adaptation to the location of origin for many cultivars. In this meta-analysis, we compiled and analyzed 900 observations associated with 41 field trials for four switchgrass cultivars (two lowlands, Alamo and Kanlow, and two uplands, Cave-In-Rock and Shelter). This extensive dataset and machine learning were used to identify the most influential variables impacting switchgrass productivity, to search for evidence of local adaptation to each cultivar's location of origin, and to predict change in productivity under future climate for each cultivar. In general, variables associated with climate and management are more important predictors of productivity relative to soil variables. Three climatic variables, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation in the wettest month, are identified as key environmental variables for productivity of all cultivars. Productivity under future climate (2041–2060) is predicted to stay stable for all cultivars relative to the prediction under current climate (1986–2005) across all trial locations and over a 20-year simulation period. However, the productivity of each cultivar varies from location to location and from year to year, although productivity varies more between locations than between years. Additionally, we observe shifts in the most productive cultivar at the local field scale depending on the combination of management practice and climates. The shape of the relationship between productivity and the annual mean temperature relative to the cultivar's location of origin is a bell-shaped curve for Kanlow, Cave-in-Rock, and Shelter, indicative of local adaptation. Identifying influential environmental variables and their relationships to productivity with respect to cultivar's location of origin help predicting productivity on the local field scale, and will help with the biofuel production planning through the selection of suitable cultivars for different locations under climate changes. © 2019 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Miscanthus species, including M. sacchariflorus, are important bioenergy crops, used also as industry feedstocks and in environmental projects. M. sacchariflorus is also utilised as a donor in interspecific crossings to generate new forms of M. × giganteus. Research on Miscanthus species and their application potential may be considerably extended using methods of genetic modification. However, to date there are scare reports on miscanthus transformation. To improve transformation efficiency, new expression cassettes of a selectable marker gene were constructed and used for biolistic transformation of M. sacchariflorus. The sequence of the bacterial hpt gene encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase in the initial pCAMBIA vector was optimised according to codon usage characteristic of Zea mays, which is closely related to Miscanthus sp., and placed under control of 35S CaMV or the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter, resulting in the pCA35Sohpt and pCAUBQohpt vectors. Transformation rate using optimised vectors significantly increased in comparison to pCAMBIA, and reached 4.2–5.0% vs 2.5%. In respective transgenic plants, significantly higher transcription of optimised hpt was determined while the activity of the reporter GUS enzyme was similar. These results constitute basis for specific miscanthus transformation in a variety of research and practical applications. Vectors carrying optimised expression cassettes of the hpt marker gene significantly increased rates of Miscanthus sacchariflorus biolistic transformation and may be applied in research and practical projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dependence of rural population on traditional fuel sources namely biomass has increased because of easy accessibility and affordability. The use of biomass fuels results in many environmental and health-related hazards. Rural households have little awareness about the ill effects of using biomass energy sources. This study investigated the patterns of rural household energy use and identified the role of information on the effects of biomasses on human health, in addition to other factors influencing households’ choices of energy sources. For this purpose, primary data from 196 households were collected from four districts of the Punjab province in Pakistan. Results showed that use of clean energy sources was limited to basic appliances and 90% of the respondents depended on biomass fuels. Estimates of the multivariate probit model showed that awareness about adverse impacts of biomass fuels as energy sources were significantly related with the choice of energy sources. Further, household head’s education level, household income, landholding, children under the age of 5 years and higher number of adult females were significantly related with the cleaner energy source choices. Distance to market increased the probability of the use of biomass energy sources. The study concluded that awareness campaigns regarding the benefits of using clean energy sources should be launched through print and electronic media while targeting rural women. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels are urgently needed to avoid severe climate impacts and further environmental degradation. Microalgae are one of the most productive crops globally and do not need to compete for arable land or freshwater resources. Hence, they may become a promising, more sustainable cultivation alternative for the large-scale production of biofuels provided that substantial reductions are achieved in their production costs. In this study, we identify the most suitable areas globally for siting microalgal farms for biodiesel production that maximize profitability and minimize direct competition with food production and direct impacts on biodiversity, based on a spatially explicit multiple-criteria decision analysis. We further explore the relationships between microalgal production, agricultural value, and biodiversity, and propose several solutions for siting microalgal production farms, based on current and future targets in energy production using integer linear programming. If using seawater for microalgal cultivation, biodiesel production could reach 5.85 × 1011 L/year based on top suitable lands (i.e., between 13% and 16% of total transport energy demands in 2030) without directly competing with food production and areas of high biodiversity value. These areas are particularly abundant in the dry coasts of North and East Africa, the Middle East, and western South America. This is the first global analysis that incorporates economic and environmental feasibility for microalgal production sites. Our results can guide the selection of best locations for biofuel production using microalgae while minimizing conflicts with food production and biodiversity conservation. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Duckweed has been proposed as a potential raw material to produce renewable biofuels, signified by: its high productivity and low competition with agriculture; its high proportion of carbohydrate (cellulose and starch); a low lignin content, which avoids the likely recalcitrance of cellulose to saccharification. This study has investigated the effect of hydrothermal pre-treatment on structural and chemical changes in Brazilian duckweed (L. punctata) biomass as well as its conversion to bioethanol, focusing on the hydrolysis and fermentation of the cellulose fraction. The biomass was hydrothermally pre-treated over a range of severities (1.9–4.8) and then subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The best pre-treatment condition was at a severity factor of 3.9; this condition produced the highest ethanol yield (89 wt% of the theoretical potential yield). This represents a 63 wt% increase compared to untreated biomass. Hydrothermal pre-treatment has been shown to be a suitable technology for increasing ethanol yields from L. punctata biomass towards the theoretical maximum. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coproducts from bioenergy processing have potential as alternative products in the market, thereby reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus far, the environmental benefits from coproduct use have been overlooked in most studies because of the lack of knowledge on their effective use and the limited commercialization. The objective of this study is to investigate the energy and GHG emissions savings by using biofuel coproducts. The effects of coproduct use on the overall life cycle GHG emissions performance of biofuels were evaluated. Dry distiller grains in the wheat to ethanol pathway, and crude glycerine and canola meal from biodiesel, are assumed to replace animal feed, fossil fuel, fertilizer, synthetic glycerine. A system expansion approach was implemented to estimate GHG emissions savings. The results show that the overall life cycle GHG emissions from the wheat to ethanol pathway can be reduced by 2–34% when dry distiller grains displace fertilizer, fossil fuel, or animal feed. In the canola to biodiesel pathway, GHG emissions can be reduced by 5–26% and 8–41% when canola meal replaces animal feed and crude glycerine replaces synthetic glycerine. The study highlights the potential role of the coproducts from biofuel production in additional GHG emissions reduction over the life cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There has been a growing interest in biofuel production to reduce oil dependence in the transportation sector. However, this has also sparked a debate on how the introduction of biofuels may jeopardize food security. In this paper we evaluate the effects of biofuel production on food security using system dynamics. First, we developed a system dynamics model to understand the long-term interaction between food production, biofuel production and livestock farming. Then, we calibrated and applied the model to the Colombian case. The base scenario results show that the introduction of biofuels to Colombia reduces the country's agriculture-allocated land by 2030. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in food supply and an increase in food prices. Alternative scenarios suggest that policies focused on increasing land use efficiency, especially with livestock, could have a larger impact on food security and biofuel production in Colombia. This is due to the fact that said policies foster the co-existence of bioenergy and food production. Our simulation model could be relevant to other countries in order for them to assess their food policies and biofuel strategies. The model could especially be relevant in the developing world, where similar political and environmental conditions may be present. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The influence of three different fungal strains—namely, Pleurotus ostreatus (PO), Phanerochaete chrysosposrium (PC), and Ganoderma lucidum (GL)—on pretreatment of rice straw, followed by biochemical methane potential assay was evaluated on the basis of structural (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction etc.) and quantitative (soluble chemical oxygen demand, volatile fatty acids, etc.) analysis. Maximum lignocellulosic degradation was obtained with PC pretreated rice straw (36% more than an untreated sample), followed by PO. Enhancement in the methane yield after 5 weeks of inoculation time was obtained after pretreatment, which was 269.99, 295.91, and 339.31 mL/g VSadded, for PO, GL, and PC, respectively, 1.64–2.22-fold higher than the untreated one. Kinetic modelling of cumulative methane yield showed that modified gompertz model showed the best fit among all analysed models. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fungal species in enhancing the methane yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The global market based measure (MBM) for international flight emissions is poised for launch in 2020, creating additional pressure for improvements of aviation environmental performance. Due to high R&D costs and long lifecycle of aircrafts, drop-in biofuels stand as a promising solution for addressing aviation's environmental sustainability. The transition to commercial aviation biofuels remains stagnant, however, despite the continuing progress made in overcoming technological and economic challenges of aviation biofuels. This paper investigates the key barriers and opportunities for biofuels transition from a comprehensive socio-technical standpoint. A multi-level perspective (MLP) system dynamics model of aviation biofuel industry is developed to investigate the adoption process. We assess the interactive mechanisms between existing regimes, landscape pressures, and niche innovations, and propose four possible scenarios of aviation biofuel adoption. From this, we provide policy recommendations and industry level strategies for accelerating the transition to aviation biofuels that balance environmental sustainability and economic benefits. © 2019

AB  - Use of agroindustrial wastes helps productive processes to have a more sustainable development. In this work, the physical-chemical characteristics of alperujo and orujo residues were studied, demonstrating that both can be combined for pellet production. For this purpose, 12 types of pellets based on different combinations of alperujo, orujo, Pinus radiata and Populus spp. materials were manufactured in the laboratory. Their energetic and physical properties were analyzed using different ISO standards, resulting in eight suitable samples that complied with regulations. A comparative cost analysis was also carried out to evaluate the profitability of the pellets produced compared to the traditional pellets from Pinus radiata. It was concluded that profitability increased by 11.0% when producing pellets with a Pinus radiata mixture, mainly due to the decrease in acquisition, sawing and transportation costs. In addition, sustainable pellets production decreased emissions by 5.0% (78,780 tonnes CO2 year−1). The most profitable mixture was that of alperujo/Pinus radiata 90/10 w/w, due to both reduced costs and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Sustainable pellets showed as perfectly suitable to be used as a solid biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Third generation biofuels, also known as microalgal biofuels, are promising alternatives to fossil fuels. One attractive option is microalgal biodiesel as a replacement for diesel fuel. Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 was previously optimized for maximal lipid production for biodiesel generation, achieving biomass growth and productivity of 3.48 ± 0.04 g/L and 0.43 ± 0.01 g/L/d, with lipid content and productivity of 28.6 ± 1.41% and 124.1 ± 7.57 mg/L/d. In this study, further optimization using 5% CO2 concentration and semi-batch operation with 25% medium replacement ratio, enhanced the biomass growth and productivity to 4.15 ± 0.12 g/L and 1.23 ± 0.02 g/L/d, with lipid content and productivity of 19.4 ± 2.0% and 239.6 ± 24.8 mg/L/d. The major fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and linoleic acid (C18:2). These short-chain FAMEs combined with high growth make Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 a suitable candidate for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - State-level policies in the New England region of the United States require diversion of organic materials away from landfills. One management option for food waste is anaerobic co-digestion with dairy manure. In addition to biogas, anaerobic digestion produces separated solid and liquid digestates. Solid digestates in the region are typically recycled as animal bedding before returning to the digester and liquids are used to fertilize local soils. Repeated land application of nutrients can contribute to eutrophication risk over time and alternative models are needed to convert digestates into valuable export products. We tested solid digestates derived from dairy manure and food waste as substrate ingredients in the cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus. We show these materials can be used to offset non-local substrate ingredients while achieving mushroom yields comparable to commercial recipes. This strategy could help divert nutrients away from land adjacent to digesters and into safe, protein-rich food, while producing useful spent mushroom substrate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to renewable gasoline and diesel (RGD) fuels via integrated fast pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation. However, the low bulk density of biomass feedstocks produces relatively high transportation costs, driven by the large volumes needed to supply biorefineries. Densification can reduce transportation volumes, and therefore transportation costs for bioenergy production. However, the additional costs of biomass densification, along with decreases in overall mass and energy yields, influence the overall economic performance of RGD production. This study investigated the techno-economic impacts of pelletizing, torrefying, or pyrolyzing the biomass at distributed facilities prior to upgrading the intermediates to RGD at a centralized facility. Eight scenarios were considered. When there is no feedstock competition, biomass densification at the distributed facility was shown to reduce the transportation cost by 20%–50%. However, the capital and operating costs required for densifying biomass increased the total cost of RGD production by 3%–35% compared to RGD made from non-densified biomass. The cost of making RGD from densified biomass was only reduced below the cost of making RGD from non-densified biomass for the case when the fraction of land surrounding the biorefinery facility allocated to the biomass cultivation is less than 0.25. This finding is attributed to the high cost of transporting non-densified biomass from a larger procurement radius. Sensitivity analysis indicated that RGD fuel yield, densification costs, project investment, and the rate of return all have significant impacts on the overall economics of RGD production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - When aboveground materials are harvested for fuel production, such as with Sorghum bicolor, the sustainability of annual bioenergy feedstocks is influenced by the ability of root inputs to contribute to the formation and persistence of soil organic matter (SOM), and to soil fertility through nutrient recycling. Using 13C and 15N labeling, we traced sorghum root and leaf litter-derived C and N for 19 months in the field as they were mineralized or formed SOM. Our in situ litter incubation experiment confirms that sorghum roots and leaves significantly differ in their inherent chemical recalcitrance. This resulted in different contributions to C and N storage and recycling. Overall root residues had higher biochemical recalcitrance which led to more C retention in soil (27%) than leaf residues (19%). However, sorghum root residues resulted in higher particulate organic matter (POM) and lower mineral associated organic matter (MAOM), deemed to be the most persistent fraction in soil, than leaf residues. Additionally, the overall higher root-derived C retention in soil led to higher N retention, reducing the immediate recycling of fertility from root as compared to leaf decomposition. Our study, conducted in a highly aggregated clay-loam soil, emphasized the important role of aggregates in new SOM formation, particularly the efficient formation of MAOM in microaggregate structures occluded within macroaggregates. Given the known role of roots in promoting aggregation, efficient formation of MAOM within aggregates can be a major mechanism to increase persistent SOM storage belowground when aboveground residues are removed. We conclude that promoting root inputs in S. bicolor bioenergy production systems through plant breeding efforts may be an effective means to counterbalance the aboveground residue removal. However, management strategies need to consider the quantity of inputs involved and may need to support SOM storage and fertility with additional organic matter additions. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The authors report on the economic impacts of introducing woody biomass processing in an economically distressed, but heavily forested Central Appalachian U.S. region. Woody biomass is a readily available unconventional energy source that has the potential to boost the rural region’s economy. They use a static regional computable general equilibrium model to assess long-run economic impacts of two woody biomass processing production pathways of biomass to ethanol through fermentation and biomass to biofuel through fast pyrolysis. While the 232 to 370 jobs and $13 million to $21 million income might seem small relative to the multicounty region, the localized impact on the county in which the facility would be sited, even for the direct jobs and income impacts, would be much more substantial. The authors conclude that woody biomass processing is a viable economic development option for the study area and similar rural regions. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Duckweed has been considered as a renewable feedstock for bioethanol production due to its fast generation of biomass and high starch accumulation. The use of plant hormones is a common and efficient method to manipulate plant growth and yield. However, the effects of different plant hormones on the biomass and starch accumulation of duckweed have not been systematically studied. Here, we screened five classes of plant hormones, including auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins, and brassinosteroids. The results showed that the effect of 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA, cytokinin) on promoting the biomass production of duckweed was much higher than other plant hormones. Compared with the control group, biomass yield at 1.0 × 10−3 mM 6-BA treated group increased by 37.41% in 7 days. Moreover, the results suggested that ABA can dramatically promote starch accumulation. The total starch that accumulated in the ABA treated samples were 3.3 times higher than that in the control samples. Taken together, these findings indicated that 6-BA and ABA were the most effective plant hormones in terms of enhancing biomass and starch accumulation. These results will provide valuable information for further studies of large-scale application of plant hormones in duckweed-to-bioethanol production in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel demand is on the rise, yet there is limited information available about the likely implications of increased planting of cellulosic biofuel crops on water and nutrient fluxes. To help address this gap, this study quantifies subsurface water, nitrate, and dissolved phosphorus fluxes below feedstock crops managed for biofuel production on naturally well drained soils in southern Wisconsin. Automated equilibrium tension lysimeters were used to measure subsurface (below root zone) fluxes of water and nutrients below continuous corn (CC), monoculture switchgrass (SG), and hybrid poplar (HP) cropping systems for three years. Average water fluxes below SG were nearly double those below CC and HP. Most of this difference can be linked to seasonal events, particularly during late winter and early spring when subsurface water fluxes and increased soil moisture were observed below SG plots, likely due to enhanced macropore flow. Nitrate fluxes were approximately 14 times higher below CC than the 37.4 kg NO3-N/ha three year annual average observed for SG; the nitrate fluxes were negligible below HP despite similar nitrogen application rates. The high flux in one of the two CC plots is likely due to excessive manure applications prior to the study period; however, the nitrate loss potential from CC is much higher than the perennial crops. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were very low below all three cropping systems (average of 0.076, 0.083, 0.034 mg/L in SG, CC, and HP respectively). For the cropping systems evaluated, nitrate fluxes were driven by concentration differences in leachate and not influenced by nominal differences in N fertilizer inputs, whereas DRP fluxes were mainly driven by water fluxes and therefore independent of phosphorus inputs and soil test phosphorus. The data in this paper provide a foundation to better understand differences in fluxes below different biofuel cropping systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Measured field data were used to compare two allocation methods on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from corn (Zea mays L.)stover production in the Midwest U.S. We used publicly-available crop yield, nitrogen fertilizer, and direct soil nitrous oxide emissions data from the USDA-ARS Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices research program. Field data were aggregated from 9 locations across 26 site-years for 3 stover harvest rates (no removal; moderate removal – 3.1 Mg ha−1; high removal – 7.2 Mg ha−1)and 2 tillage practices (conventional; reduced/no-till). Net carbon uptake by crops was computed from measured plant carbon content. Monte Carlo simulations sampled input distributions to assess variability in farm-to-gate GHG emissions. The base analysis assumed no change in soil organic carbon stocks. In all cases, net CO2 uptake during crop growth and soil-respired CO2 dominated system emissions. Emissions were most sensitive to co-product accounting method, with system expansion emissions ∼15% lower than mass allocation. Regardless of accounting method, lowest emissions occurred for a moderate removal rate under reduced/no-till management. The absence of correlations between N fertilization rate and stover removal rate or soil N2O emissions in this study challenges the use of such assumptions typically employed in life cycle assessments Storage of all carbon retained on the field as SOC could reduce emissions by an additional 15%. Our results highlight how variability in GHG emissions due to location and weather can overshadow the impact of farm management practices on field-to-farm gate emissions. © 2019

AB  - In this study, we used a multifaceted approach to select robust bioaugmentation candidates for enhancing biogas production and to demonstrate the usefulness of a genome-centric approach for strain selection for specific bioaugmentation purposes. We also investigated the influence of the isolation source of bacterial strains on their metabolic potential and their efficiency in enhancing anaerobic digestion. Whole genome sequencing, metabolic pathway reconstruction, and physiological analyses, including phenomics, of phylogenetically diverse strains, Rummeliibacillus sp. POC4, Ochrobactrum sp. POC9 (both isolated from sewage sludge) and Brevundimonas sp. LPMIX5 (isolated from an agricultural biogas plant) showed their diverse enzymatic activities, metabolic versatility and ability to survive under varied growth conditions. All tested strains display proteolytic, lipolytic, cellulolytic, amylolytic, and xylanolytic activities and are able to utilize a wide array of single carbon and energy sources, as well as more complex industrial by-products, such as dairy waste and molasses. The specific enzymatic activity expressed by the three strains studied was related to the type of substrate present in the original isolation source. Bioaugmentation with sewage sludge isolates–POC4 and POC9–was more effective for enhancing biogas production from sewage sludge (22% and 28%, respectively) than an approach based on LPMIX5 strain (biogas production boosted by 7%) that had been isolated from an agricultural biogas plant, where other type of substrate is used. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Efficient biotechnological conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to valuable products, such as transportation biofuels, is ecologically attractive, yet requires substantially improved mechanistic understanding and optimization to become economically feasible. Cellulolytic clostridia, such as Ruminiclostridium papyrosolvens (previously Clostridium papyrosolvens), produce a wide variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) including extracellular multienzyme complexes-cellulosomes with different specificities for enhanced cellulosic biomass degradation. Identification of the secretory components, especially CAZymes, during bacterial growth on lignocellulose and their influence on bacterial catalytic capabilities provide insight into construction of potent cellulase systems of cell factories tuned or optimized for the targeted substrate by matching the type and abundance of enzymes and corresponding transporters. Results: In this study, we firstly predicted a total of 174 putative CAZymes from the genome of R. papyrosolvens, including 74 cellulosomal components. To explore profile of secreted proteins involved in lignocellulose degradation, we compared the secretomes of R. papyrosolvens grown on different substrates using label-free quantitative proteomics. CAZymes, extracellular solute-binding proteins (SBPs) of transport systems and proteins involved in spore formation were enriched in the secretome of corn stover for lignocellulose degradation. Furthermore, compared with free CAZymes, complex CAZymes (cellulosomal components) had larger fluctuations in variety and abundance of enzymes among four carbon sources. In particular, cellulosomal proteins encoded by the cip-cel operon and the xyl-doc gene cluster had the highest abundance with corn stover as substrate. Analysis of differential expression of CAZymes revealed a substrate-dependent secretion pattern of CAZymes, which was consistent with their catalytic activity from each secretome determined on different cellulosic substrates. The results suggest that the expression of CAZymes is regulated by the type of substrate in the growth medium. Conclusions: In the present study, our results demonstrated the complexity of the lignocellulose degradation systems of R. papyrosolvens and showed the potency of its biomass degradation activity. Differential proteomic analyses and activity assays of CAZymes secreted by R. papyrosolvens suggested a distinct environment-sensing strategy for cellulose utilization in which R. papyrosolvens modulated the composition of the CAZymes, especially cellulosome, according to the degradation state of its natural substrate. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The utilization of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), an efficient thermochemical conversion technology, can produce biofuels from biomass, but also a large amount of processing wastewater. In the present paper, the aqueous phase from the HTL of Spirulina Platensis was recycled as the intermediate reactant and its effects on the bio-oil yield from the HTL of Spirulina Platensis, α-Cellulose, and Lignin were investigated. The results revealed that the best bio-oil yields obtained from HTL of Spirulina Platensis and α-Cellulose in pure water were 30 and 7.03 wt% at the optimized operation conditions. Aqueous phase obtained from HTL of Spirulina Platensis could be introduced return into HTL system and result in an obvious increase in the bio-oil yield by 10 wt% and 6 wt% from HTL of Spirulina Platensis and α-Cellulose, respectively. Energy recovery rates from bio-oil were improved greatly by applying aqueous phase recycling during HTL. However, aqueous phase recycling inhibited generation of bio-oil, suggesting the presence of the antagonistic reaction between protein aqueous and Lignin. Based on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the aqueous phase and bio-oil, the possible reaction pathways were deduced. © 2019

AB  - Microalgae is one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuel production because it yields the high content of sugar and oil. In order to help to develop this nascent industry, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for planning and designing a microalgae-based biobutanol supply chain network. The goal of this study is minimizing the fixed cost of constructing required facilities, transportation costs, and operational costs (harvesting, pretreatment, treatment, and energy conversion). This paper considers supply, production, distribution, and addresses a multi-period model. Since the volume of harvested and dried algae cannot be determined accurately, a fuzzy programming approach is employed to address uncertainties. Additionally, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is used to reduce the complexity of solving the proposed model. The applicability of the model is evaluated through a real case study of Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates that CO2 enhances the production of a syngas component and also hinders the formation of benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. A thermogravimetric analysis and two lab-scale pyrolysis setups (single-stage and two-stage) were used to understand the role of CO2 in the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The use of CO2 enhanced the thermal cracking of volatile species formed during the pyrolysis, resulting in the enhanced production of carbon monoxide (CO) at temperatures higher than 550 °C. In addition, less tar (e.g., 20% in N2; 17% in CO2) and more gas product (39% in N2; 44% in CO2) were formed in the presence of CO2 after the pyrolysis of sewage sludge, indicating that the use of CO2 shifts pyrolytic carbon distribution from tar to pyrolysis gas. In addition to the decrease in tar, the PAH content in the tar was also decreased, meaning that CO2 suppresses the formation of benzene derivatives and PAHs during pyrolysis. Solid residues formed following the pyrolysis (in the presence of N2 and CO2) were also characterized, which showed that Ca, K, and Mg are effectively immobilized in the solid product. These residues can potentially be used for soil amendment. This study suggests that utilizing CO2 increases the thermal efficiency of sewage sludge pyrolysis and suppresses the formation of harmful chemical species such as PAHs. A pyrolysis process operated using CO2 would be an effective treatment method for byproducts of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment processing (e.g., sewage sludge). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from water hyacinth in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel in diesel engine. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Test results projected that, the characteristics of 20% WHB +80% diesel fuel blend was in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB blends were closer to the diesel fuel. Thus, the present work identifies the novel water hyacinth biodiesel as a viable biofuel for diesel engine applications towards sustainable environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present here the first long-term (2001–2017) record of aerosol optical depth (AOD; interchangeably, AOT) and contributions of aerosol chemical components to light extinction over Kolkata, the second-most polluted metropolis in India. For this purpose, we use daily gridded MODIS AOD measurements coupled with modeled AOT for 5 major aerosol constituents – sulfate, sea-salt, dust, organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC), from the MERRA-2 reanalysis system. We find that AOD over Kolkata has increased significantly (32% overall, 0.010 y−1; Mann-Kendall test with Thiel-Sen slope estimation; p &lt; 0.01) over the past 17 y to a mean of 0.74 ± 0.10 in 2017, and an overwhelming majority of this increase is driven by a concurrent rise (70% overall, 0.007 y−1, p &lt; 0.01) in sulfate AOT. This is followed by smaller but significant enhancements in OC (40% overall, 0.002 y−1, p &lt; 0.01) and BC (20% overall, 0.0004 y−1, p &lt; 0.01) AOT. Although a non-trivial fraction (24%) of AOT is associated with natural emissions (sea-salt and dust), these do not exhibit significant trends over time and therefore are not instrumental in driving the observed AOD rise. A concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis shows that sulfate aerosol over Kolkata is mostly regional (within ∼250 km) during winter and post-monsoon with significant footprints over thermal power plant clusters in neighboring states and areas with considerable residential biofuel use (eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin). In comparison, BC and OC AOT show a significant long-range component (∼1800 km) originating from northwestern and central IGP, especially during post-monsoon, when open agricultural residue burning is rampant. Overall, these results provide a preliminary indication that a considerable fraction of aerosol light extinction over Kolkata might be related to non-local, atmospherically transported aerosol. Once validated by ground-based measurements, these results would reinforce the need to bring regional and long-range emissions, in addition to within-the-city emissions, under the purview of air quality management policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., WOSR) is the main oilseed crop in Europe, and it is mainly grown for biofuel and edible oil. The crop is grown widespread in Europe with most of the production area located in Germany, Poland, Czech Republic and France. How current and future WOSR production is influenced by climatic risk factors was explored by integrating a phenology model with climatic indices relating to crop yield. The phenology model based on the BRASNAP-PH model performed well when tested against data from variety trials across Europe. The phenology model was integrated into the Agriclim model. To quantify non-optimal agroclimatic growing conditions with respect to physical and biological stressors, a total of nine agroclimatic indices were calculated, of which one reflects a major disease (Phoma stem canker). Agriclim simulations across Europe show that current cropping area agree well with the area with least calculated stress factors. Projections under climate change were based on climate scenarios generated by the LARS-WG weather generator for GISS and HadGEM models RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate projections (2081–2100), which predicted that the crop will most likely suffer from low temperatures (early and late frost) in areas where the crop is currently grown. In the southern regions of Europe, the crops will suffer from droughts. Based on the model runs with climate scenarios, the North European regions (Boreal environmental zone) will become more favourable for growing WOSR. The type of adverse conditions for European WOSR growing areas is likely to change under climate change, underpinning the need for developing adaptive management strategies and future breeding strategies for crop cultivars to guarantee a well-established and healthy crop under climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Preventing harmful algal blooms (HAB) in water bodies is an urgent environmental challenge across the world. This is a side effect from the supply chain of products from agricultural biomass, and renders many bio-based products environmentally unsustainable. Most existing efforts for designing sustainable supply chains aim to reduce the life cycle environmental impact, while ignoring nature's role in absorbing the emissions. Using the framework of techno-ecological synergy (TES), this work explicitly accounts for the role of wetlands in absorbing farm runoff to design environmentally sustainable biofuel supply chains. Application to a twenty-one county region of Northwest Ohio, which is largely responsible for HABs in Lake Erie, indicates opportunities for designing techno-ecological supply networks that are economically and ecologically superior to conventional techno-centric networks. Using the TES framework also provides counterintuitive solutions that encourage intensive agriculture with higher phosphorus runoff if there is enough land available for conversion into wetland ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal lipid production by Chlorella protothecoides using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate was investigated in this study. First, maximum glucose and reducing sugar concentrations of 15.2 and 27.0 g/L were obtained in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (SCBH), and the effects of different percentages of glucose and xylose on algal cultivation were investigated. Afterwards, SCBH was used as a carbon source for the cultivation of C. protothecoides and higher biomass concentration of 10.7 g/L was achieved. Additionally, a large amount of fatty acids, accounting up to 16.8% of dry weight, were accumulated in C. protothecoides in the nitrogen-limited (0.1–1 mmol/L) culture. Although SCBH inhibited fatty acid accumulation to a certain degree and the inhibition was aggravated by nitrogen starvation, SCBH favored microalgal cell growth and fatty acid production. The present study is of significance for the integration of cost-effective feedstocks production for biodiesel with low-cost SCBH as well as environmentally friendly disposal of lignocellulosic wastes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Salinization is one of the major causes of agricultural soil degradation worldwide. In arid and semi-arid regions with calcareous soils, phosphorus (P) deficiency further worsens the quality of salinized soils. Nonetheless, nutrient poor soils could be suitable of producing second-generation energy crops. Due to its high biomass production, Arundo donax L. (giant reed) is one of the most promising species for energy and second-generation biofuel production. A. donax can be propagated by micropropagation, an in vitro technique that produces high number of homogeneous plantlets. However, crop establishment is often compromised due to poor plantlet acclimatization to the soil environment. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) are components of soil-plant systems able to increase root phosphorus uptake and to confer the plant an increase tolerance to salinity with a consequent enhancement effect of plant growth and yield. In the present study, the relative importance of the early symbiosis establishment between AM fungi and A. donax micropropagated plantlets in the response to salt stress under low phosphorus availability was determined. A commercial inoculum which contained two different AM fungi species: Rhizophagus intraradices and Funneliformis mosseae was used. AM-symbionts (AM) and non-symbionts plants were grown at two phosphorus [2.5 μM (C) and 0.5 mM (P)] and three NaCl (1, 75 and 150 mM) concentrations in a room chamber under controlled conditions. After 5 weeks, AM root colonization was 60, 26 and 15% in 1, 75 and 150 mM NaCl-treated plants, respectively. At 1 and 75 mM NaCl, AM plants showed increased growth. In all saline treatments, AM plants had decreased Na+ uptake, Na+ root-to-shoot translocation, Na+/K+ ratio and increased P and K use efficiencies with respect to C and P plants. AM improved the nutritional status of A. donax plants by enhancing nutrient use efficiency rather than nutrient uptake. Increased phosphorus use efficiency in AM plants could have benefited ion (Na+ and K+) uptake and/or allocation and ultimately ameliorate the plant’s response to saline conditions. © 2019 Romero-Munar, Baraza, Gulías and Cabot.

AB  - Selective capture and separation of solution-borne planktonic cells is a ubiquitous challenge in diverse fields ranging from biofilm mitigation, cancer diagnostics, and water treatment to microalgae biofuels. Microalgae are promising feedstocks for carbon-neutral biofuels that will alleviate our repentant dependency on fossil fuels, but current technologies for dewatering microalgae add a prohibitive cost to the final products. We report here a nanoparticle-pinched polymer brush (NPPB) design that transforms ordinary polymer flocculants into supercoagulants by mimicking bacterial outer membrane vesicles in promoting bacteria coaggregation. Importantly, the NPPBs are retrievable via cost-effective magnetophoretic separation, recyclable after algae oil extraction and residual biomass removal, and reusable for repeated cycles of operations that significantly reduces the endless material cost of flocculants and their potential contamination of downstream processes and the environment. Using DLVO and self-consistent field theory to model the colloidal stability of microalgae and the dynamic response of polymer brushes, respectively, we reveal a fundamental transition from conventional chain-like polymer flocculants to NPPBs in modulating the interalgae pair potentials. Unlike the chain-like polymer flocculants that only induce slow microalgae dewatering with dose-sensitive flocculation-dissociation equilibria, NPPBs direct rapid and irreversible microalgae coagulation. Although a minimum brush size on the NPPBs is predicted to initiate the coagulation, the benefit of increasing brush size quickly wanes and there is an optimal brush size beyond which the coagulation efficiency plateaus, which is consistent with our experimental observations. We anticipate that the concept of retrievable, recyclable, and reusable NPPBs is adaptable for capturing a broad range of live cells in solution. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Many studies have been carried out on the growth-modulating efficiency of plants by the colonization of an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica. However, studies involving the co-culture of alga with endophytic fungal strains for enhanced biodiesel production are rare. In this study, the interaction between P. indica and Parachlorella kessleri-I, a marine algal strain, was assessed at metabolic level. Results: In association with an endophytic fungus, the algal biomass enhanced from 471.6 to 704 mg/L, and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile of P. kessleri-I increased substantially. In case of FAME profile of co-cultured P. kessleri-I, two essential components of biodiesel, i.e. elaidic acid and oleic acid, increased by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. To ascertain changes in the metabolic profile of P. kessleri-I by P. indica co-culture, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics study was performed to identify the metabolites involved; and differential nature of the essential metabolites was also confirmed using HPLC and LC-MS. Significant modulation of the bioactive metabolites such as succinate, oxo-propanoate, l-alanine, glutamate, acetate and 1,2 propanediol, hydroxy butane was observed. Conclusion: The metabolites like glutamate and succinate that usually belong to the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be upregulated. The pathway links nitrogen metabolism and carbon metabolism, thus influencing the growth and lipid profile of the algae. These differential metabolites thus indicated the important commensal association between the endophytic fungus and autotrophic marine alga, and established that endophytic fungus can be handy for the sustainability of algal biofuel industries. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the interfuel substitution effects of biofuel use on carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. transportation sector. First, the dynamic linear logit model is used to examine substitution possibilities between biofuels and non-biofuels. The results reveal that petroleum demand is the most inelastic with respect to changes in petroleum prices since the transportation sector depends heavily on the use of petroleum. In addition, ethanol serves as a substitute for petroleum, showing that the use of ethanol can reduce the dependence on petroleum when petroleum prices increase. The results also indicate that ethanol is a complement for natural gas, while natural gas is a substitute for petroleum. Second, the coefficients for carbon dioxide emissions are used to compute the potential amount of carbon dioxide associated with interfuel substitution. The results represent that price-induced interfuel substitution is a critical factor to predict biofuel-related carbon dioxide emissions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Farmland in the Upper Midwest, USA, planted to corn has increased significantly in the past decade due to a rush toward ethanol production for fuel. Much of this increase came from fields that were previously protected under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a Federal land retirement incentive. This Geographic Information Systems (GIS) study quantifies these land changes in Minnesota, a northern state in the U.S. Corn Belt, prior to the past decade using 1997 and 2008 CRP GIS data layers for individual fields. Currently available CRP enrollment data by county masks significant changes occurring on a field-level scale, data which is no longer publicly available. Results suggest that marginal lands better suited for riparian wildlife habitat and surface water protection were plowed under in favor of industrial corn production. This was especially notable with fields in close proximity to refineries or those in drinking water supply management or groundwater contamination susceptibility areas. Federal ethanol mandates, farm bill policies, and high corn prices contribute to the pressure to farm these sensitive lands. Currently, CRP enrollments are capped at 9.7 million hectares, reduced from a long-standing 13-million-hectare cap by the 2014 farm bill. Discussions are now underway in the U.S. Congress to craft the 2018 farm bill and farming and conservation interests are strongly urging the Federal government to restore the 13-million-hectare enrollment cap. Ecosystem functions and benefits are optimized when conservation efforts are maintained over long periods and not interrupted by short-Term political or economic trends. © 2019 All rights reserved.

AB  - Use of agricultural wastes as substrate for the production of bioethanol can help to solve environmental problems caused by inadequate discharge of waste. The production of bioethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using pea hull aqueous extract as a substrate was evaluated in this work. Response surface methodology was employed to study the effect of different parameters such as inoculum concentration (3-7%), fermentation time (24-71 h) and pH (4.4, 4.8 and 5.2) on the production of bioethanol. Results revealed that highest bioethanol yield of 1.65% occurred at 6.8% inoculum concentration; 71 h of fermentation time in the medium with initial pH 5.2. The study highlights that pea hull aqueous extract can be utilized for bioethanol production with extended fermentation times. © 2019 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - This paper shows how system design determines sustainability outcomes of cassava bioethanol production in Colombia. The recovery of the energy contained in by-products is recommended as compared to single product production. In particular, this study assesses the energy, greenhouse gases, water, and land use performance of alternative cassava cascades working at different scales, highlighting the implications of including anaerobic digestion technology in the chain. The centralized systems showed a poorer energy and greenhouse gases performance as compared to decentralized ones in part due to the artificial drying of cassava chips in the centralized facility. Under solar drying of cassava chips, systems with anaerobic digestion produced three to five times more energy than demanded and produced greenhouse gas savings of 0.3 kgCO2eq L EtOH-1. The water balance output depends upon the water reuse within the ethanol industry, which demands 21-23 L EtOH-1. In the anaerobic digestion scenarios, assuming liquid flows are treated separately, complete water recovery is feasible. Land use for cassava cultivation was calculated to be 0.27-0.35 ha tEtOH-1. The energy and water content of the material to digest, the options for digestate reuse, and the recovery of the methane produced are major considerations substantially influencing the role of anaerobic digestion within cassava cascade configurations. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Efficient irrigation technologies, which seem to promise reduced production costs and water consumption in heavily irrigated areas, may instead be driving increased irrigation use in areas that were not traditionally irrigated. As a result, the total dependence on supplemental irrigation for crop production and revenue is steadily increasing across the contiguous United States. Quantifying this dependence has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive irrigated and dryland yield and harvested area data outside of major irrigated regions, despite the importance and long history of irrigation applications in agriculture. This study used a linear regression model to disaggregate lumped agricultural statistics and estimate average irrigated and dryland yields at the state level for five major row crops: corn, cotton, hay, soybeans, and wheat. For 1945-2015, we quantified crop production, irrigation enhancement revenue, and irrigated and dryland areas in both intensively irrigated and marginally-dependent states, where both irrigated and dryland farming practices are implemented. In 2015, we found that irrigating just the five commodity crops enhanced revenue by ~$7 billion across all states with irrigation. In states with both irrigated and dryland practices, 23% of total produced area relied on irrigation, resulting in 7% more production than from dryland practices. There was a clear response to increasing biofuel demand, with the addition of more than 3.6 million ha of irrigated corn and soybeans in the last decade in marginally-dependent states. Since 1945, we estimate that yield enhancement due to irrigation has resulted in over $465 billion in increased revenue across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Example applications of this dataset include estimating historical water use, evaluating the effects of environmental policies, developing new resource management strategies, economic risk analyses, and developing tools for farmer decision making. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Individual species within microbial communities can combine their attributes to produce services that benefit society, such as the transformation of renewable resources into valuable chemicals. Under defined genetic and environmental conditions, fermentative Escherichia coli and phototrophic Rhodopseudomonas palustris exchange essential carbon and nitrogen, respectively, to establish a mutualistic relationship. In this relationship, each species produces H2 biofuel as a byproduct of its metabolism. However, the extent to which each species contributes to H2 production and the factors that influence their relative contributions were previously unknown. By comparing H2 yields in cocultures pairing R. palustris with either wild-type E. coli or a formate hydrogenlyase mutant that is incapable of H2 production, we determined the relative contribution of each species to total H2 production. Our results indicate that E. coli contributes between 32 and 86% of the H2 produced in coculture depending on the level of ammonium excreted by the R. palustris partner. The level of ammonium excretion influenced the time over which E. coliwas exposed to formate, the types of E. colifermentation products available to R. palustris, and the pH of the medium, all of which affected the contribution of each species to H2 production. © 2019 FEMS 2019.

AB  - Interest is growing in camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) as a biofuel feedstock. However, there has been little camelina research in irrigated arid systems. A 2-yr field study in Maricopa, AZ, under an overhead sprinkler irrigation system determined the effects of 10 water levels (irrigation fraction 0.5–1.1) and five N fertilizer rates (38–150 kg N ha–1) on seed yield, seed oil content, and N use efficiency. Cultivar Robinson was planted in December 2012 and 2013. Nitrogen fertilizer (urea ammonium nitrate) was applied in three split applications. Irrigation amounts were from 125 to 380 mm, and in-season rain was 70 and 50 mm, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Camelina seed yields were maximum at water level 7 (irrigation fraction 0.93) in 2013 at 1800 kg ha–1. Maximum seed yields were 1600 kg ha–1 at water level 6 (irrigation fraction 0.83) in 2014. These highest seed yields were achieved with 150 kg N ha–1 in both years. Oil content (maximum 41%) decreased with N rate but increased with water level. Seed N increased with N rate but decreased with irrigation level. Recovery efficiency of N fertilizer by camelina ranged from 12 to 72%. The results indicate that good high-oil camelina yields can be produced in the southwestern United States with 320 to 380 mm irrigation plus rain and N fertilizer rates of 150 kg N ha–1. © 2019 The author(s).

AB  - Napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) has attracted much attention as an efficient feedstock for biofuel production in sub-tropical climate such as the southern United States because of its perennial nature and high biomass yield, with low inputs on marginal lands. In this study, we examined if napiergrass can be harvested advantageously both for biofuel feedstock as well as fodder usage. Three harvest treatments, i.e., T1, double harvest per year, first in July (T1H1) and second in November (T1H2); T2, double harvest per year, first in October (T2H1) and second in November (T2H2); and T3, single regular harvest in November (T3), were tested for biomass yield. Plant samples from all five harvests were analyzed for quality parameters to ascertain fodder suitability. Averaged across the study period, highest dry matter annual biomass yield was recorded for T3 (41.6 Mg DM ha–1) followed by T2 (37.2 Mg DM ha–1) and T1 (35.3 Mg DM ha–1). The regrowth after October harvest (T2H2) was found suitable for fodder usage and resulted in a fresh biomass yield of 7.9 Mg ha–1 that contained 213 g kg–1 crude protein (CP), 155 g kg–1 ash, 509 g kg–1 neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and 290 g kg–1 acid detergent fiber (ADF). This study showed that napiergrass can be grown for producing biomass for biofuel production as well as a quality fodder during the late fall season in the southern United States. The results would be of special significance to farmers who follow mixed crop and animal farming. © 2019 The author(s).

AB  - In the global South, a rush of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) is occurring by governments and transnational and domestic investors seeking to secure access to land in developing countries to produce food, biofuels, and other agricultural commodities. Complex interactions between regional and global market dynamics and local institutional, socioeconomic, and agro-ecological conditions can lead to widely varying causal processes, land-use change (LUC), and socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. Systematic understanding of how characteristics of LSLAs across multiple social and environmental contexts produce spillover effects on local communities, ranging from employment opportunities to displacement and indirect land-use change (iLUC), is lacking. We conceptualize agricultural commodity production and land-acquisition processes associated with LSLAs as catalyzing causal pathways of direct and indirect land-use changes. Using the case of economic land concessions (ELCs) in Cambodia, we employed a novel synthesis research approach combining remote sensing, spatio-temporal statistics, and case study meta-analysis to construct archetypical pathways of the causes, timing, and consequences of ELC-driven land change. Archetypical pathways generally diverged based on specialized or flex commodity crops and rates of direct LUC, and rapid rates of direct LUC tended to cause displacement and iLUC. In contrast, ELCs producing commodity crops associated with more gradual land-use change and/or organized local resistance lead to less iLUC. Systematic knowledge generated through synthesis of local causes and consequences of LSLA-driven land change is now possible and needed to better address the direct and indirect consequences of LSLAs for commodity crop production. © 2019 by the author(s).

AB  - Mutualistic interactions between free-living algae and fungi are widespread in nature and are hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of land plants and lichens. In all known algal- fungal mutualisms, including lichens, algal cells remain external to fungal cells. Here, we report on an algal–fungal interaction in which Nannochloropsis oceanica algal cells become internalized within the hyphae of the fungus Mortierella elongata. This apparent symbiosis begins with close physical contact and nutrient exchange, including carbon and nitrogen transfer between fungal and algal cells as demonstrated by isotope tracer experiments. This mutualism appears to be stable, as both partners remain physiologically active over months of co-cultivation, leading to the eventual internalization of photosynthetic algal cells, which persist to function, grow and divide within fungal hyphae. Nannochloropsis and Mortierella are biotechnologically important species for lipids and biofuel production, with available genomes and molecular tool kits. Based on the current observations, they provide unique opportunities for studying fungal-algal mutualisms including mechanisms leading to endosymbiosis. © Du et al.

AB  - More than 40% of US grain is used for energy due to the Renewable Fuel Mandate (RFS). There are no studies of the global distributional consequences of this purely domestic policy. Using micro-level survey data, we trace the effect of the RFS on world food prices and their impact on household level consumption and wage incomes in India. We first develop a partial equilibrium model to estimate the effect of the RFS on the price of selected food commodities—rice, wheat, corn, sugar, and meat and dairy, which together provide almost 70% of Indian food calories. Our model predicts that world prices for these commodities rise by 8– 8–16% due to the RFS. We estimate the price pass-through to domestic Indian prices and the effect of the price shock on household welfare through consumption and wage incomes. Poor rural households suffer significant welfare losses due to higher prices of consumption goods, which are regressive. However, they benefit from a rise in wage incomes, mainly because most of them are employed in agriculture. Urban households also bear the higher cost of food, but do not see a concomitant rise in wages because only a small fraction of them work in food-related industries. Welfare losses are greater among urban households. However, more poor people in India live in villages, so rural poverty impacts are larger in magnitude. We estimate that the mandate leads to about 25 million new poor: 21 million in rural and 4 million in the urban population. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Cyclopropane fatty acids (CPAs) are useful feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts such as lubricants and biodiesel. Our goal is to identify factors that can facilitate the accumulation of CPA in seed triacylglycerol (TAG) storage oil. We hypothesized that the poor metabolism of CPA through the TAG biosynthetic network could be overcome by the addition of enzymes from species that naturally accumulate CPA in their seed oil, such as lychee (Litchi chinensis), which contains approximately 40% CPA in TAG. Our previous work on engineering CPA accumulation in crop and model plants identified a metabolic bottleneck between phosphatidylcholine (PC), the site of CPA biosynthesis, diacylglycerol (DAG), and TAG. Here, we report the cloning and heterologous expression in camelina (Camelina sativa) of a lychee PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE:DIACYLGLYCEROL CHOLINEPHOSPHOTRANSFERASE (PDCT), which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the phosphocholine headgroup from PC to DAG. Camelina lines coexpressing LcPDCT and Escherichia coli CYCLOPROPANE SYNTHASE (EcCPS) showed up to a 50% increase of CPA in mature seed, relative to the EcCPS background. Stereospecific lipid compositional analysis showed that the expression of LcPDCT strongly reduced the level of C18:1 substrate at PC-sn-1 and PC-sn-2 (i.e. the sites of CPA synthesis), while the levels of CPA increased in PC-sn-2, DAG-sn-1 and DAG-sn-2, and both sn-1/3 and sn-2 positions in TAG. Taken together, these data suggest that the addition of PDCT facilitates more efficient movement of CPA from PC to DAG and establishes LcPDCT as a useful factor to combine with others to enhance CPA accumulation in plant seed oil. © 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - This study investigated the acid-catalyzed esterification of two brands of crude rice bran oil (CRBO) with free fatty acids (FFAs) content of about 8 and 10%, respectively. Experimental variables included reaction time, methanol-to-FFA molar ratio and sulfuric acid content with temperature and stirring speed fixed at 60 °C and 600 RPM, respectively. A central composite design was used initially for sequential experimentation and followed by a Box-Behnken design to refine the optimum process conditions. Results showed that final FFA in CRBO could be reduced to less than 1% FFA in a single-step. The methanol-to-FFA molar ratio had the maximum influence on the esterification process and was followed by the reaction time and amount of catalyst. The optimum conditions for FFA conversion in CRBO were: reaction time 90 and 48 min, 62:1 and 70:1 methanol-to-FFA molar ratio, 22.5 and 20% (w/w) sulfuric acid based on FFA for Brand I and II, respectively. Under these pretreatment conditions, initial FFA was reduced to 0.61 and 0.70%, respectively making the CRBO suitable for biodiesel production. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

AB  - Metal-contaminated soil could be sustainably used for biofuel feedstock production if the harvested biomass is amenable to bioethanol production. A 60-day greenhouse experiment was performed to evaluate (1) the potential of vetiver grass to phytostabilize soil contaminated with copper (Cu), and (2) the impact of Cu exposure on its lignocellulosic composition and downstream bioethanol production. Dilute acid pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation parameters were optimized sequentially for vetiver grass using response surface methodology (RSM). Results indicate that the lignocellulosic composition of vetiver grown on Cu-rich soil was favorably altered with a significant decrease in lignin and increase in hemicellulose and cellulose content. Hydrolysates produced from Cu exposed biomass achieved a significantly greater ethanol yield and volumetric productivity compared to those of the control biomass. Upon pretreatment, the hemicellulosic hydrolysate showed an increase in total sugars per liter by 204.7% of the predicted yield. After fermentation, 110% of the predicted ethanol yield was obtained for the vetiver grown on Cu-contaminated soil. By contrast, for vetiver grown on uncontaminated soil a 62.3% of theoretical ethanol yield was achieved, indicating that vetiver has the potential to serve the dual purpose of phytoremediation and biofuel feedstock generation on contaminated sites. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - International air transport is one of the fast-growing sources of CO2 emissions. However, it has always been omitted from the international emission mitigation pledges. The delayed mitigation process in this area may slow down the process of global CO2 emission control. In this article, we evaluated the potential to realize the emission mitigation targets in air transport through biofuel and estimated the corresponding cost. The emission from international air transport of Palau and Seychelles was taken as the example. Then, the emission caused by each airline to these two islands was calculated by the distance-based method, with information of the travelers' arrival data, fuel consumption of different aircraft types, routes, and aircraft seat data. Future scenarios with and without commitment to CO2 mitigation targets were predicted to evaluate the emission difference. Then, we estimated the amount of biofuel required to fill the emission gap, and the corresponding cost based on the future biofuel price prediction. The results show that distance is the determining factor of international air transport emission per capita. The component of origin can decrease the aggregated emission per capita to small island destinations by 0.5-2%. The accumulated emission gaps are 3.15 Mt and 9 Mt for Palau and Seychelles, which indicates that 7.64 and 19.34 Mb of biofuel are needed for emission mitigation, respectively. The corresponding costs are $27-163 million and $72-424 million per year. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biorefineries intends to utilize algal biomass and their by-products at industrial scale. The macroalgae Kappa-phycus alvarezii has high content of carrageenan, which is a polysaccharide hydrocolloid, serving as a raw material for the production of third generation biofuels, food and pharma-ceuticals. The aim of this study is to show that besides these products, there is the potential for the production of a fourth generation biofuel. Two strains, brown and red, were selected based on their high growth rates and productivity and were treated with 6% KOH for extraction carrageenan extraction. The results of the chemical composition of this residue show that there is considerable amount of fermentable sugar in the carrageenan extraction residue. The glucan conversion was 100% for both strains, and the concentrations of glucose from the brown and red strains were 13.7 and 11.5 g L−1, respectively. The results highlight the efficiency of generating a key bioproduct from carrageenan residue. This would save the carrageenan that can be used for as a food thickener as it has been used for centuries. Thus, the biorefinery of K. alvarezii can be exploited not only to produce carrageenan, but also to generate glucose for future use in biofuel production. © 2019, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is usually grown on marginal land for biofuel system, in which nitrogen (N) is an essential management practice, and landscape position is a key topographical factor in impacting the production. However, limited information is available regarding how the N application and landscape positions affect soil microbial communities and enzyme activities under switchgrass. Thus, the specific objective of this study was to evaluate the responses of N rate (high, 112 kg N/ha; medium, 56 kg N/ha; and low, 0 kg N/ha) and landscape positions (shoulder and footslope) on soil biological health under switchgrass field. Data showed that N addition significantly influenced carbon and N fractions. The hot water-soluble organic carbon (HWC) and nitrogen (HWN) fractions were significantly higher at footslope position than the shoulder position. The amount of total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), total bacterial, actinomycetes, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, total fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and saprophytes PLFAs were highest with medium and high N rates and footslope position. The N addition increased total PLFAs in N fertilizer treatments, viz. medium (5,946 ng PLFA-C/g soil) and high N rates (5,871 ng PLFA-C/g soil). Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and enzyme activities (urease, β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) were significantly enhanced by N fertilization (medium and high N rates) compared to control (low N rates) under footslope position. The urease activity under medium (36.3 µmol N-NH4+ g−1 soil hr−1) and high N rates (31.4 µmol N-NH4+ g−1 soil hr−1) was 42.9% and 23.6% higher than low N rates, respectively. This study suggests that the application of medium N rate in footslope position to switchgrass can enhance the soil biological properties and hence can protect the environment from the excessive use of N fertilizer. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Growing demand for biomass-derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate how forest-based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale. Specifically, this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow-dominated watershed in northern Wisconsin, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles, is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios. The biofuel scenarios follow physically-based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay, pasture, and forested lands; along with a suite of alternative management practices, including rotation time, planting density, fertilizer application and irrigation. Trade-offs between biomass production, fertilizer use, and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system. The highest density (1111 trees/100 m2) and shortest rotation (5-year) treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass. The high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index, biomass production, and N uptake. At annual or greater time scales, the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on ET and streamflows. However, in summer months, the ET from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use, so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50%. Irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production, but only by 4% on average, which is not surprising for a temperate, humid watershed. © 2019

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate economic support measures based on current EU policies affecting the profitability of large-scale deployment of biochar for sunflower cultivation in dry marginal lands in Italy, paving the way to large scale carbon sequestration in the EU Mediterranean region. Two cases were considered: i) straight biochar use and ii) biochar in combination with compost (COMBI: 20% biochar and 80% compost mass fraction), at application rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha−1 respectively. Based on realistic estimations of achievable crop-yield performances by biochar and COMBI addition to dry soils, the effect of current policies on the economic viability of biochar deployment and farmers’ income has been investigated. Using a cost-model we identified the required levels of support, in the form of (i) area subsidies for crop cultivation, (ii) tradable carbon certificates (credits), and (iii) REDII-compliant biofuel support for Aviation and Maritime, so to make biochar and sunflower cultivation in EU MED dry marginal lands competitive for sustainable crop-based biofuels. Results show that, by employing existing policy instruments, sufficient income can be generated for famers to recover marginal land, sequester large amount of carbon by BECCS at costs (∼82 € Mg−1 of CO2) falling at or below the typical range of CCS measures, as well as offer additional environmental and socio-economic positive benefits. The combination of currently operational economic mechanisms from the Common Agricultural Policy, the Climate Policy, and the Renewable Energy Directive II can: i) maintain domestic farming activities, ii) support the implementation of biochar projects at local level, iii) contribute to achieve EU and national biofuel targets without generating ILUC impacts and iv) achieve unprecedent potential for carbon sequestration. However, prior to large-scale deployment, targeted on-site R&amp;D actions aimed at validating biochar effects under local conditions (soil, climate, crops) are recommended, together with training and capacity building activities for local farmers. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Microbial electrochemical technology (MET) that can harvest electricity/valuable materials and enhance the efficiency of conventional biological processes through the redox reaction of organic/inorganic compounds has attracted considerable attention. MET-based anaerobic digestion (AD) systems treating swine manure were operated at different applied voltages (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 V) and temperatures (25, 35, and 45 °C). Among the MET-based AD systems with different applied voltages at 35 °C, M4 at 0.7 V showed the highest methane production (2.96 m3-CH4/m3) and methane yield (0.64 m3-CH4/kg-VS). The methane production and yield increased with increasing temperature at an applied voltage of 0.7 V. Nevertheless, the MET-based AD systems (LM at 25 °C and 0.7V) showed competitive AD performance (2.33 m3-CH4/m3 and 0.53 m3-CH4/VS) compared with the conventional AD system (35 °C). The microbial community was affected by the applied voltage and temperature, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as M. flavescens, M. hungatei, and M. thermautotrophicus were mainly responsible for methane production in MET-based AD systems. Therefore, the methane production can be enhanced by an applied voltage or by direct interspecies electron transfer because M. flavescens and M. thermautotrophicus were especially predominant in cathode of MET-based AD systems. The MET-based AD systems can help enhance biogas production from swine manure with no significant change in methane content. Furthermore, MET-based AD systems will be a promising AD system through low material development and the optimal operation. © 2019, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Biomass feedstock can be used for the production of biofuels or biobased chemicals to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Earlier studies about the techno-economic performance of biofuel or biobased chemical production varied in biomass feedstock, conversion process, and other techno-economic assumptions. This made a fair comparison between different industrial processing pathways difficult. The aim of this study is to quantify uniformly the factory-gate production costs and the GHG emission intensity of biobased ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-propanediol (PDO), and succinic acid, and to compare them with each other and their respective fossil equivalent products. Brazilian sugarcane and eucalyptus are used as biomass feedstock in this study. A uniform approach is applied to determine the production costs and GHG emission intensity of biobased products, taking into account feedstock supply, biobased product yield, capital investment, energy, labor, maintenance, and processing inputs. Economic performance and net avoided GHG emissions of biobased chemicals depend on various uncertain factors, so this study pays particular attention to uncertainty by means of a Monte Carlo analysis. A sensitivity analysis is also performed. As there is uncertainty associated with the parameters used for biobased product yield, feedstock cost, fixed capital investment, industrial scale, and energy costs, the results are presented in ranges. The 60% confidence interval ranges of the biobased product production costs are 0.64–1.10 US$ kg−1 ethanol, 1.18–2.05 US$ kg−1 ethylene, 1.37–2.40 US$ kg−1 1,3-PDO, and 1.91–2.57 US$ kg−1 succinic acid. The cost ranges of all biobased products partly or completely overlap with the ranges of the production costs of the fossil equivalent products. The results show that sugarcane-based 1,3-PDO and to a lesser extent succinic acid have the highest potential benefit. The ranges of GHG emission reduction are 1.29–2.16, 3.37–4.12, 2.54–5.91, and 0.47–5.22 CO2eq kg−1 biobased product for ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-PDO, and succinic acid respectively. Considering the potential GHG emission reduction and profit per hectare, the pathways using sugarcane score are generally better than eucalyptus feedstock due to the high yield of sugarcane in Brazil. Overall, it was not possible to choose a clear winner, (a) because the best performing biobased product strongly depends on the chosen metric, and (b) because of the large ranges found, especially for PDO and succinic acid, independent of the chosen metric. To quantify the performance better, more data are required regarding the biobased product yield, equipment costs, and energy consumption of biobased industrial pathways, but also about the production costs and GHG emission intensity of fossil-equivalent products. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of reusing Zarrouk's medium on a Spirulina sp. LEB 18 culture by determining kinetic parameters, chemical composition, biofuels, and thermal characterization. Cultivation was performed in a raceway bioreactor for 7 days, the supernatant was reused for four cycles. Culturing the microalga in the reused medium resulted in a cellular yield of 2.30 g L−1 (control) and 2.04, 1.89, 1.73, and 1.15 g L−1 for four cycles with no influence on cell growth and productivity. Biomass with high contents of carbohydrates (58.00%, 3rd cycle), phycocyanin (2.47 mg mL−1, 1st cycle), and saturated fatty acids (60.13%, 4th cycle) were obtained with an increase in the profiles of C16:0 (45.85%) and C18:2n6 (47.40%) in the 1st cycle. The reuse of Zarrouk's medium allowed obtaining biomass with reduced cost and differentiated characteristics, allowing the exploration of commercially important biomolecules by the completion of up to four cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photoperiod is a key environmental cue affecting flowering and biomass traits in plants. Key components of the photoperiodic flowering pathway have been identified in many species, but surprisingly few studies have globally examined the diurnal rhythm of gene expression with changes in day length. Using a cost-effective 3′-Tag RNA sequencing strategy, we characterize 9,010 photoperiod responsive genes with strict statistical testing across a diurnal time series in the C4 perennial grass, Panicum hallii. We show that the vast majority of photoperiod responses are driven by complex interactions between day length and sampling periods. A fine-scale contrast analysis at each sampling time revealed a detailed picture of the temporal reprogramming of cis-regulatory elements and biological processes under short- and long-day conditions. Phase shift analysis reveals quantitative variation among genes with photoperiod-dependent diurnal patterns. In addition, we identify three photoperiod enriched transcription factor families with key genes involved in photoperiod flowering regulatory networks. Finally, coexpression networks analysis of GIGANTEA homolog predicted 1,668 potential coincidence partners, including five well-known GI-interacting proteins. Our results not only provide a resource for understanding the mechanisms of photoperiod regulation in perennial grasses but also lay a foundation to increase biomass yield in biofuel crops.

AB  - Evaluating the impacts on biodiversity by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) is a task researchers are currently facing. One impact assessment method that aims to do so is the recently developed biodiversity impact assessment BIA+. The aim of the present paper is to test this method and to show its applicability and feasibility. Additionally opportunities and challenges of this method shall be revealed. For this purpose, a case study for assessing the impacts of biodiesel production on freshwater biodiversity is introduced. Two substances, namely phosphorus and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which are used for the biodiesel production for fertilization and the usage of pesticides, are being considered. The inventory data needed for the case study is gathered through the grey water footprint of the crop production that forms the basis of the European biodiesel consumption. Further, the BIA+ method is applied in order to assess the impacts of the biodiesel consumption in Europe for the year 2010 on freshwater biodiversity. The results reveal that even though assumptions have to be made and the results are highly uncertain, this method helps to identify hotspots within production processes. By including the BIA+ as an impact assessment method into LCA, impacts of products can be assessed with regard to biodiversity including genetic, species and ecosystem diversity. The main impact hotspot occurs in France with a potential loss of the biodiversity of 0.5 points. The lowest loss of the biodiversity occurs in Brazil (loss of 8.05*10–06 points). The results are mainly influenced by the impact of the toxic substance 1,4-DCB. By means of the case study, it is shown that the BIA+ method is applicable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed at investigating fast pyrolysis behavior and products distribution of two typical coastal zone biomass fuels (Jerusalem artichoke stalk (JAS) and reeds (Re) by TGA and a homemade down tube reactor. The kinetic analysis with different ramping rates was conducted by FWO and DAEM models. The liquid, gaseous and solid products are characterized to study the influence of temperature. Results indicate that high heating rates may be overcome some resistances to mass or heat transfer inside the particles of biomass, and lead to a higher conversion rates and Re species is preferable to JAs in terms of thermochemical conversion because of the lower apparent activation energy for total conversion. Moreover, the pyrolysis conditions - temperature under fast pyrolysis in a down tube pyrolysis unit will make the covalent bonds in the biomass degradation more rapidly, gave significant influence on the yields and properties of liquid, gaseous and solid products. © 2019

AB  - Biofuel production from oilseed trees in small-scale agroforestry systems is considered as a strategy for energy security, rural development and ecosystem services provision in low-income countries. However, the economic potential of these systems remains unclear, as profitability studies commonly ignore key methodological issues such as quantitative uncertainty analysis, full accounting for opportunity costs, and inclusion of all value chain actors. This study addresses these methodological shortcomings and develops a framework for quantifying the long-term financial performance of agroforestry-based biofuel value chains. The framework is applied to a case in South India, to calculate profitability of pongamia (Millettia pinnata) cultivation and processing. The results show that pongamia cultivation has limited financial potential, and is only profitable in small-scale settings, in the middle to long term and for a subset of farmers. If biodiesel is envisaged as the end product, the value chain requires substantial fiscal and marketing support to be economically viable. For current prices, financial performance is much higher if the seed oil is marketed instead of processed to biodiesel. Increased mechanization, increased yields and optimized agroforestry set-ups might improve financial outcomes and reduce risks for both farmers and processors. These findings are case-specific, while the developed framework opens the door to comprehensive investigation of the financial performance of other oilseed tree species and in other regions. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Production of biomass crops is competing with food production in terms of arable land, therefore, attention is being given to the establishment of dedicated energy crops on marginal lands. While more attention has been given to C 4 plants like Miscanthus and Switchgrass due to their high productivity and ability to withstand unfavorable soil conditions, Arundo donax (a C 3 plant) has also been proven to thrive well on marginal lands and has high productivity. In this study, pyrolysis of Arundo donax harvested on a reclaimed mine land in West Virginia was carried out in a batch reactor at a temperature of 500 °C for 30 min and the pyrolysis products were collected and characterized. Pyrolysis products distribution was 30.12%, 45.62% and 24.26% for the biochar, bio-oil and non-condensable gases, respectively. Calorific values of the biomass and the biochar were found to be 18.96 and 29.51 MJ/kg, respectively. The pH of the biochar showed that it is alkaline in nature while the pH of the bio-oil showed that it is acidic in nature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid consumption of fossil fuels has led to the search for alternative energy sources. Bio-fuels as an alternative energy source require cheap and abundantly available substrates to keep the economics of the production process low. The present study was therefore focused on utilizing raw refinery wastewater by the oleaginous bacterium Rhodococcus opacus for converting it into bio-oil via hydrothermal liquefaction of the lipid rich biomass produced during the treatment process. For treating the wastewater, different operating modes using a bioreactor were evaluated including batch, fed-batch, sequential batch, continuous and continuous with cell recycle using low cost tubular ceramic membrane. Among the different strategies, the continuous cell recycle system proved efficient in terms of complete removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (99%) and high lipid production (86%, w/w) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 16 h (dilution rate of 0.06 h−1). Furthermore, the residual bacterial biomass from the bioreactor was treated by HTL to produce bio-oil which showed excellent bio-fuel properties. This study demonstrated the application of R. opacus for simultaneous wastewater treatment and production of bio-oil for energy application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing growth in biofuel consumption induces further demand for different biomass feedstock. Competition for farmland use became an obstacle in producing biofuel since food products would be destined for energy rather than for human or animals. Nowadays, governments lay down regulations to encourage producing nonfood biomass which brought them huge costs. In this article, the long-term behavior of parties is analyzed in a three player supply chain including farmers, biorefineries, and governments. The dynamic behavior of parties is modeled by using evolutionary game theory and the stable strategy of each party is derived by solving replicator dynamic equations. Finally, a numerical study is presented based on a real case in Iran to give a better understanding of the features of the game model. Sensitivity analyses on some key parameters such as price and governments' penalties leads to interesting managerial insights into long-term strategies in the proposed supply chain. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13122, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - There is a potential opportunity to convert almost any type of biomass into biofuel and bio- nanomaterials, if the appropriate biotechnological and chemical processing methods are used. The preference for this or that bioresource is due to the stability of the raw material base and the prospect of its use. Jerusalem artichoke stem (Helianthus tuberosus L.) (JA) is widely known as a potential nonfood raw material for biofuels due to high biomass extraction (36–49 t/ha (tons per hectare)) and limited cultivation requirements. But little attention is given to study the possibility of using the stems to produce various kinds of cellulose. This article presents samples of cellulose that were obtained from the Jerusalem artichoke stem using mechanical and chemical methods. Cellulose yield from the stem was: Cortex 51.1%, pith 65.2% with the α-cellulose content 96–98%. Methods of electron microscopy, atomic absorption, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, BET for nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetry were used to study the cortex and the pith of the Jerusalem artichoke stem. Analysis of the cellulose samples confirmed the possibility of obtaining high-quality cellulose. © 2019 Eurasian Chemico-Technological Journal.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (WOSR) is the main crop for biodiesel in the EU, where legislation demands at least 50% savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to fossil diesel. Thus industrial sectors search for optimized management systems to lower GHG emissions from oilseed rape cultivation. Recently, pyrolysis of biomass with subsequent soil amendment of biochar has shown potentials for GHG mitigation in terms of carbon (C) sequestration, avoidance of fossil based electricity, and mitigation of soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Here we analyzed three WOSR scenarios in terms of their global warming impact using a life cycle assessment approach. The first was a reference scenario with average Danish WOSR cultivation where straw residues were incorporated to the soil. The others were biochar scenarios in which the oilseed rape straw was pyrolysed to biochar at two process temperatures (400 and 800 °C) and returned to the field. The concept of avoided atmospheric CO 2 load was applied for calculation of C sequestration factors for biochar, which resulted in larger mitigation effects than derived from calculations of just the remaining C in soil. In total, GHG emissions were reduced by 73 to 83% in the two biochar scenarios as compared to the reference scenario, mainly due to increased C sequestration. The climate benefits were higher for pyrolysis of oilseed rape straw at 800 than at 400 °C. The results demonstrated that biochar has a potential to improve the life cycle GHG emissions of oilseed rape biodiesel, and highlighted the importance of consolidated key assumptions, such as biochar stability in soil and the CO 2 load of marginal grid electricity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing demand for wood pellets on the market, which is caused by their excellent combustion properties, inspires the production as well as the utilization of alternative biomass pellets as fuel. However, the emission of volatile organic compounds gives pellet materials a distinct odor or off-odor, which is directly perceived by the end user. Thus, there is an urgent need for knowledge about the emitted volatile organic compounds and their potential formation pathways as well as their contributions to odor properties of the pellets. In this study, pellets made of biomass energy crops (i.e., straw or miscanthus), byproducts from the food industry (i.e., rapeseed, grapevine, or DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles from beer production)), or eucalyptus, as well as torrefied pinewood and torrefied sprucewood were investigated with respect to the emitted volatile compounds and their possible impact on the pellet odor. Headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to enrich, separate, and identify the compounds. Techniques used in sensory science were applied to obtain information about the odor properties of the samples. A total of 59 volatile compounds (acids, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, terpenes, heterocyclic compounds, and phenolic compounds) were identified with different compound ratios in the investigated materials. The use of multivariate statistical data analysis provided deep insight into product-compound interrelation. For pellets produced from bioenergy crops, as well as from byproducts from the food industry, the sensory properties of the pellets reflected the odor properties of the raw material. With respect to the volatiles from torrefied pellets, those volatiles that are formed during the torrefaction procedure dominate the odor of the torrefied pellets covering the genuine odor of the utilized wood. The results of this work serve as a substantiated basis for future production of pellets from alternative raw materials. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present article assesses the environmental profile of a real-scale anaerobic-digestion plant that has been developed in France. The system utilises 13652 t of different types of feedstock related to food industry, agriculture, etc. The study is based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) according to Global Warming Potential (GWP), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), ReCiPe midpoint/endpoint and USEtox. The life-cycle inventory includes real data from various sources of waste as well as the transportation distances. By considering the impact of both anaerobic digestion and transportation for the whole system, the following findings have been found: 6430 t CO 2.eq (GWP 100a); 67194 GJ prim (CED); 231100 Pts (ReCiPe endpoint single-score: Human health), 146932 Pts (ReCiPe endpoint single-score: Ecosystems), 171568 Pts (ReCiPe endpoint single-score: Resources). Furthermore, USEtox results, for the whole system and by taking into account both anaerobic digestion and transportation, show that based on: 1) Human toxicity/cancer, anaerobic-digestion phase has around 21 times higher value comparing to transportation, 2) Ecotoxicity, anaerobic-digestion phase presents about 77 times higher value than transportation. Regarding the impact of both phases (anaerobic digestion; transportation) per t of waste or per MWh of electricity, the findings show values of 0.5–0.6 t CO 2.eq per t of feedstock (or digestate) or per MWh of electricity produced (not net). A separate subsection with comparisons of the present findings with literature studies about LCA of anaerobic-digestion plants has been included. In general, a good agreement has been observed. Moreover, comparisons of the impact of the electricity produced by means of the present biogas system with the impact of conventional electricity mixes of several countries are presented and discussed, proving the environmental benefits of the proposed anaerobic-digestion plant. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Southeast Asian countries stand at a crossroads concerning their shared energy future and heavily rely on fossil fuels for transport and electricity. Within Asia, especially India and China lead the world renewable energy generation undergoing a period of energy transition and economic transformation. Southeast Asian countries have huge potentials for sustainable energy sources. However they are yet to perform globally in renewable energy deployment due to various challenges. The primary objective of the study is to examine the renewable energy growth and analyse the government policies to scale up the deployment of renewables for power generation substantially. The study also offers policy recommendations to accelerate renewable energy exploitation sustainably across the region. To achieve the ambitious target of 23% renewables in the primary energy mix by 2025, ASEAN Governments should take proactive measures like removal of subsidies of fossil fuels, regional market integration and rapid implementation of the existing project. Eventually, each of this strategy will necessitate sustained leadership, political determination, and concrete actions from stakeholders, in particular, increased cooperation across the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As manufacturing processes are developed through the early stages of technology readiness, various assessments can be used to evaluate their performance. Performance indicators describe processes by transforming attributes into scores that represent desirable objectives. One type of assessment is obtained by determining the life cycle inventories of inputs and outputs for processes. For a functional unit of product, the user finds the resources used and the releases to the environment, which can be compared to results for similar processes and/or combined with other processes in the life cycle. In this work, an expanded range of process inputs and releases is modeled, including forklift/loader, fugitive, storage, boiler, and cooling tower emissions. A generic scenario approach for the cooling tower releases provides a first approximation of emission and wastewater flows. These inventory values are used in performance indicators that can be placed on a scale between fixed best- A nd worst-case limits with the GREENSCOPE methodology, thus allowing comparisons across various technologies. The processes of interest are two conversion pathways for producing cellulosic ethanol from biomass via thermochemical and biochemical routes. The results can be used in risk assessments, decision making, evaluation of research, and in spurring future technology development. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass resources offer a very promising alternative to fossil fuels for the sustainable production of electricity, fuels, and chemicals. Nevertheless, the problem of deciding on the best use of biomass is highly complex, as many potential feedstocks and conversion pathways exist, each one displaying different economic and environmental performances. In this context, here we propose a network approach that combines economic and several environmental criteria together with resource availability and demand constraints to identify optimal biomass feedstocks and their conversion pathways into fuels, chemicals, and electricity. We apply this methodology to the European Union (EU) considering the biomass resources currently available and the main technologies for their conversion into valuable products. Our results show that annual savings of as much as 1.81 Gt CO2eq could be attained by exploiting biomass resources, although biomass cannot fully cover the total EU demand of ethylene, transport fuel, and electricity. The optimal environmental plan makes use of various biomass resources for power generation and biofuel production producing ethylene exclusively from naphtha. The approach presented generates valuable insight to aid policy-makers on how to sustainably use biomass resources. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Heavy metals (HMs), which accumulate in digestion substrates, such as plant residues and livestock manure, can affect biogas yields during anaerobic digestion (AD). Low concentration of Cu 2+ (0–100 mg/L), Fe 2+ (50–4000 mg/L), Ni 2+ (0.8–50 mg/L), Cd 2+ (0.1–0.3 mg/L), and Zn 2+ (0–5 mg/kg) promote biogas production, while high concentrations inhibit AD. Trace amounts of HMs are necessary for the activity of some enzymes. For example, Cu 2+ and Cd 2+ serve as cofactors in the catalytic center of cellulase and stimulate enzyme activity. High contents of Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ inhibit enzyme activity by disrupting protein structures. Trace amounts of HMs stimulate the growth and activity of methanogens, while high levels have toxic effects on methanogens. HMs affect the hydrolysis, acidification, and other biochemical reactions of organics in AD by changing the enzyme structure and they also impact methanogen growth. A better understanding of the impact of HMs on AD can provide valuable insights for improving the digestion of poultry manure and plant residues contaminated with HMs, as well as help mitigate HMs pollution. Although several studies have been conducted in this field, few comprehensive reviews have examined the effect of many common HMs on AD. This review summarizes the effects of HMs on the biogas production efficiency of AD and also discusses the effects of HMs on the activities of enzymes and microbial communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ultrasonic harvesting could reduce the energy consumption and costs associated with separating microalgae from growth media. The responsiveness of microalgae cells to an ultrasonic standing wave depends on the cell radius and acoustic contrast factor (ACF). The ACF can vary as cell composition (e.g. lipid, protein, carbohydrate content) varies depending on the algae strain, cultivation conditions, and growth stage. Two independent experimental methods were used to characterize the ACF of three algae ;strains—Nannochloropsis salina, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Tetraselmis chuii—as a function of dynamic cellular composition over 9- to 14-day growth periods. For N. salina, lipid content increased from 25 ± 1% to 33 ± 1% ash-free dry weight (AFDW) and ACF decreased by 46% (from 0.041 ± 0.002 to 0.022 ± 0.002) between growth days 3 and 10. For C. reinhardtii, lipid content increased from 26 ± 1% to 40 ± 1% AFDW and ACF decreased by 33% (from 0.051 ± 0.013 to 0.034 ± 0.006) between growth days 3 and 9. For T. chuii, lipid content and ACF remained stable (~ 10% AFDW and ~ 0.3) over the growth period. ACF decreased as lipid content increased because lipids have a negative ACF in the growth media; however, cell size had a greater impact on cell responsiveness because the ratio of the acoustic radiation force to the drag force is proportional to cell radius squared. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced by the extraction of natural gas are an important contributor to lifecycle emissions and account for a significant fraction of anthropogenic methane emissions in the USA. The timing as well as the magnitude of these emissions matters, as the short term climate warming impact of methane is up to 120 times that of CO 2 . This study uses estimates of CO 2 and methane emissions associated with different upstream operations to build a deterministic model of GHG emissions from conventional and unconventional gas fields as a function of time. By combining these emissions with a dynamic, techno-economic model of gas supply we assess their potential impact on the value of different types of project and identify stranded resources in various carbon price scenarios. We focus in particular on the effects of different emission metrics for methane, using the global warming potential (GWP) and the global temperature potential (GTP), with both fixed 20-year and 100-year CO 2 -equivalent values and in a time-dependent way based on a target year for climate stabilisation. We report a strong time dependence of emissions over the lifecycle of a typical field, and find that bringing forward the stabilisation year dramatically increases the importance of the methane contribution to these emissions. Using a commercial database of the remaining reserves of individual projects, we use our model to quantify future emissions resulting from the extraction of current US non-associated reserves. A carbon price of at least 400 USD/tonne CO 2 is effective in reducing cumulative GHGs by 30–60%, indicating that decarbonising the upstream component of the natural gas supply chain is achievable using carbon prices similar to those needed to decarbonise the energy system as a whole. Surprisingly, for large carbon prices, the choice of emission metric does not have a significant impact on cumulative emissions. © 2019

AB  - This research evaluates the possibility of using straight oils such as castor oil, which is not suitable for food use, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oils, in blends with gasoline as second-generation biofuels. To this end, a study of the rheological properties of biofuels obtained from these double blends has been carried out. The aim is to take advantage of the different properties of gasoline, i.e., its low viscosity and its high energy density to obtain blends whose rheological properties allow the substitution of fossil diesel in high extent. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these gasoline/oil mixtures produces diesel/gasoline/oil triple blends, which exhibited the suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. Therefore, the behavior of these blends has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The triple blends allow the substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% with sunflower oil, and up to 25% with castor oil, with excellent power results achieved for blends in which diesel is substituted up to 40%, and also in fuel consumption at high demand in comparison to conventional fossil diesel. Besides, a significant reduction in the emission of pollutants has also been obtained with these triple blends. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The valorization of organic waste through biodiesel synthesis was investigated to explore the concept of hazardous waste-to-energy. Fish waste (mackerel waste) was chosen as a case study because of the growing concern regarding the treatment of food waste, which is potentially hazardous to the environment. This study focused on the thermally-induced transesterification of fish waste for the production of biodiesel (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)). This process requires a porous material that allows for the collision between reactants (fish waste and methanol) to increase inside its pores at high temperatures. Therefore, commercial clay (montmorillonite) was used as the porous material in this study. The optimal temperature for the thermally-induced transesterification of unpurified mackerel oil was 380 °C, and the FAME recovery reached up to ˜72 wt.%. This study also proved that thermal cracking of polyunsaturated FAME species was initiated at temperatures ≥390 °C, and that fish waste is a promising feedstock for biodiesel when it is produced via thermally-induced transesterification over clay as a porous material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growing ecological concerns has led governments to utilize mechanisms such as Renewable Identification Number (RIN) in promoting biofuels as an alternative for fossil fuels. In this paper, a pricing model in a decentralized three-player biofuel supply chain with RIN mechanism is proposed and the interaction among members is analyzed using Stackelberg game. The optimal selling price of biomass, bioethanol, and RIN are obtained by solving the proposed discrete mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPEC) problem which is transformed into a solvable mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) model. Finally, a real case study in Iran is presented to show the features of the model. Sensitivity analyses are performed which lead to some managerial insights into the effect of price elasticity and government policies on profits. Moreover, an evolutionary game theory approach is applied on the case study to show the long-term behavior of the members in the proposed RIN-based pricing model. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Full feedstock potential needs to be tapped to make lignocellulosic ethanol an economically viable reality. This work focuses on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ethanol fermentation of fresh sorghum carbohydrates extracted through a mild steam-treatment process, and the subsequent Chlorella vulgaris cultivation using the generated liquid and gaseous fermentation effluents. The first section of the manuscript focuses on the effect of nutrient addition (fermentation effluent, yeast extract and urea) on the conversion efficiency of the sorghum carbohydrates to ethanol. Overall, the fermentation time was reduced to half when yeast extract and urea were supplemented to the free and hemicellulosic carbohydrate stream, accelerating the total sugar consumption time from 24 h to under 12 h. However, regarding the cellulosic carbohydrate hydrolysate, the sole addition of urea resulted in a slight improvement of the fermentation kinetics. The second half of the manuscript presents the impact of these different fermentation effluents and various process parameters (addition of yeast extract, antibiotic and CO2) on the microalgal cultivation and composition. The cellulosic hydrolysate yielded the highest concentrations of microalgal carbohydrates (507 mg/L) under a CO2-rich environment. Further cultivation scale-up assays confirmed these observations in the presence of 10% CO2 using the mixed fermentation effluents of the free and constitutive sorghum carbohydrates. Thus, an integrated sorghum-based first- (free carbohydrates), second- (constitutive carbohydrates) and third-generation (microalgal carbohydrates) ethanol production process was thoroughly investigated. This work could represent a step towards bridging the gap leading to full-scale commercialization of these advanced-biofuel technologies. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - In African nations, national and regional development targets for water and energy sectors seldom consider the nexus between the two, risking imbalances and inefficiencies in resource allocation and utilization. A typical example is the development and expansion of biofuel in theWami Ruvu River Basin, Tanzania (WRB).Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model was applied to the WRB to investigate the Water Energy Nexus (WEN), specifically, whether the development plan calling for biofuel expansion is a sound approach. Results show that WEN is much stronger in the biofuel irrigation consuming 69.3% and 61% of total biofuel's water and energy requirement, respectively. By 2035, the nexus continues to be stronger, consuming 54.5% and 49% of total biofuel's water and energy requirement, respectively, and thus first generation biofuels use much more resources in the growing than the refining process. An additional 768.2 million meter cubic of water and 413.4 million kWh of energy are needed for planned biofuel expansion, reallocating water to biofuels in water-scarce regions inherit related problems to other sectors such as increasing water use for the industry, agriculture, and energy sector by 67%, 45%, and 9%, respectively, which could further exacerbate stresses on water and energy supplies in the basin. Biofuel generation rely heavily on energy imports, as it consumes substantially more energy than it produces. Policies should promote the coordinated development of sustainable biofuel programs that are less water intensive with very low inputs of fossil fuels. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The agricultural and energy industries are closely related, both biologically and financially. The paper discusses the relationship and the interactions on price and volatility, and on the covolatility spillover effects for these two industries. The interaction and covolatility spillovers, or the delayed effect of a returns shock in one asset on the subsequent volatility or covolatility in another asset, between the energy and agricultural industries is the primary emphasis of the paper. Although there has already been significant research on biofuel and biofuel-related crops, only a few published papers have been concerned with volatility spillovers. It must be emphasized that there have been numerous technical errors in the theoretical and empirical research, which need to be addressed. The paper considers futures prices as a widely-used hedging instrument, and also considers an interesting new hedging instrument, ETF, which is regarded as index futures when investors manage their portfolios. In the empirical analysis, multivariate conditional volatility diagonal BEKK models are estimated for comparing patterns of covolatility spillovers. The paper provides a new way of analyzing and describing the patterns of covolatility spillovers, which should be useful for the future empirical analysis of estimating and testing covolatility spillover effects. © 2019

AB  - Alternative sources of energy are greatly needed to ensure the availability of fuels in the long run. Microalgae-derived fuels are among the viable options due to their potential to produce sustainable fuels. However, the costs related to the production of microalgal and alternative fuels are still higher compared to conventional fuels. To deal with costs and environmental issues, the blending of microalgal fuels with conventional fuels can be considered as one of the feasible options. Blending has a positive impact on many fuel characteristics including reduction of carbon footprint, costs, freezing point, viscosity, flow, heating and combustion. In this study, jet fuel from Nannochloropsis sp crude bio-oil was blended with Jet A1 in 50/50 volume ratio. The data generated from the 50/50 blend jet fuel were analysed according to the ASTM standards. Samples were tested after 30, 60, 90 and 120 days from the production day. It was reported that majority of parameters including Net heat of combustion, flash point, kinematic viscosity, conductivity and freezing point were compliant with ASTM standards. However, parameters such as density and total acidity were found not complying with ASTM standards. This study can have an implication on carbon footprint reduction because of the blending of fossil-based jet fuel and renewable-based jet fuel known as low carbon footprint fuel. The blending ratio can be beneficial for the green energy world in terms of costs and environmental impacts. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - A consortium of highly degrading microorganisms was used in an integrated bioaugmentation/electrocoagulation process for treating olive mill wastewater. The system was investigated for treating 1 m3 day−1, at a pilot scale, for 2 years; hydraulic loading rate and organic loading rate were 2880 l m−2 day−1 and 37,930 g COD m−2 day−1, respectively. Average removal efficiency for COD, oils, and total phenols was 63.9%, 85.2%, and 43.6%, respectively. The olive mill consortium, OMC, consisted of seven actinomycete strains. The strains were confirmed, by 16S rDNA analysis, to belong to five Streptomyces, one Kitasatospora, and one Micromonospora strains, at 100–99.06% similarities. Hydrolytic enzyme activities of OMC strains were remarkably higher for degrading cellulosic and lipid constituents (enzyme-cumulative indices, 14–16.1), than the phenolic constituents (indices, 4.1–6.5). The establishment of actinomycetes in the treatment system was indicated by their increased counts in the biofilm at the end of the biofilter, reaching 13-fold higher than that in the control bed. The treated effluent was toxic to the seedlings of Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) and Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba). Though its application in irrigation of 3-year-old Jatropha shrubs, significantly, enhanced the fruit yield up to 1.85-fold higher than the control, without affecting the seed oil content, after 3-month application, the irrigated soil showed insignificant changes in its biochemical properties. This developed bioaugmentation/electrocoagulation process can treat wastewater with extremely high organic strength, while its approximate construction and operational costs are limited to 0.03 and 0.51 US$ m−3, respectively. It produces a treated effluent that can be reused in irrigation of specific plants. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Renewable energies can play an important role reversing the current fossil fuels dependence. Among these, biomass is finding more uses consolidating itself as the energy of the future. Current trend is focused on the manufacture of new blends able to achieve a better use of this biomass. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential as fuel of a series of blends consisting of wheat straw and poplar wood fertilized in organic way. Different poplar clones were fertilized with two organic amendments derived from sewage plants. Thus, the effect of clones and fertilization on the thermal behavior of the blends was studied. For this purpose, fuel and thermogravimetric analysis as well as combustion characteristic indexes were used. Results denoted acceptable fuel analysis values. Thermogravimetric profiles showed three mass losses related to volatiles (550 K and 650 K) and char (700 K) liberation. The greatest mass release for blends occurred for the first stage. In particular, the blend consisting of AF8 poplar clone without fertilizer together with straw was the one that experienced this greater release. In the same way, thermal indexes warned of better thermal behavior when fertilizer was not applied; being, again, the blend mentioned above, the one that achieved the best indexes values. Thus, fertilization decreased the thermal performance of wheat straw–poplar wood blends. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Olive mill wastewater sludge (OMWS) and waste tires (WTs), abundant wastes in Tunisia, were used as feedstock in a slow co-pyrolysis pilot reactor to produce upgraded pyrolytic oil as an alternative fuel. Despite the improvement of some properties of the pyrolytic oil when waste tires were added in the feed blend, a negative synergy was observed in the yield of the oil compared with that of char. The characterization of oil samples showed synergetic interaction between OMWS and WTs during co-pyrolysis which led to a partial deoxygenation and resulted in reduction of viscosity and increase in the calorific value of the co-pyrolytic oils. However, the co-pyrolytic oil properties did not meet the requirements of commercial diesel and will need further improvement by effective standardization to meet marketable specifications. Compared with catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), OMWS/WTs slow co-pyrolysis showed some limitations but it can be considered as a simple, clean and cheap process upgrading technique for bio-oil production (∼40% lower in fixed capital investment and ∼30% lower in fuel selling price). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assesses crop residues in the EU from major crops using empirical models to predict crop residues from yield statistics; furthermore it analyses the inter-annual variability of those estimates over the period 1998-2015, identifying its main drivers across Europe. The models were constructed based on an exhaustive collection of experimental data from scientific papers for the crops: wheat, barley, rye, oats, triticale, rice, maize, sorghum, rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, potato and sugarbeet. We discuss the assumptions on the relationship between yield and the harvest index, adopted by previous studies, to interpret the experimental data, quantify the uncertainties of these models, and establish the premises to implement them at regional scale –i.e., NUTS level 3– within the EU. To cope this, we created a consolidated sub-national statistical data along with an algorithm able to aggregate (figures are provided at country level) and disaggregate (production at 25 km grid is provided assupplementary material) estimates. The total lignocellulosic biomass production in the EU28 over the review period, according to our models, is 419 Mt, from which wheat is the major contributor (155 Mt). Our results show that maize and rapeseed are the two crops with the highest residue yield, respectively 8.9 and 8.6 t ha-1. The spatial analysis revealed that these three crops, which, according to our results, are feedstocks highly suitable a priori for second generation biofuels in the EU and are unevenly distributed across Europe. Weather fluctuation was identified as the major driver in residue production from cereals, while, in the case of starch crops and oilseeds – which are predominant in northern Europe – corresponded to the marked production trend likely influenced by the agricultural policies and agro-management over the review period. Our results, among others, could help to understand and quantify the ecological boundaries of the bioeconomy from agriculture. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The aviation industry accounts for more than 2% of global CO2 emissions. Biojet fuel is expected to make an essential contribution to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. Brazil is seen as a key player in developing sustainable aviation biofuels owing to its long-standing experience with biofuels. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of what policies may be conducive to the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain is lacking. We extended a spatially explicit agent-based model to explore the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain from the existing sugarcane–ethanol supply chain. The model accounts for new policies (feed-in tariff and capital investment subsidy) and new considerations into the decision making about production and investment in processing capacity. We found that in a tax-free gasoline regime, a feed-in tariff above 3 R$/L stimulates the production of biojet fuel. At higher levels of gasoline taxation (i.e., 2.46 R$/L), however, any feed-in tariff is insufficient to ensure the production of biojet fuel. Thus, at these levels of gasoline taxation, it is needed to introduce regulations on the production of biojet fuel to ensure its production. Given the current debate about the future direction of the biofuel policy in Brazil, we recommend further research into the effect of market mechanisms based on greenhouse gas emissions on the emergence of a Brazilian biojet fuel supply chain. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - There is a growing interest in converting marginal lands to bioenergy crop production instead of using high quality croplands which could jeopardize food security and soil quality. Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef &amp; Deuter ex Hodkinson &amp; Renvoize)is a promising feedstock due to its high biomass production under temperate climate and a wide range of soil properties. Appalachian region contains about 1.1 million hectares (Mha)of reclaimed minesoils (RMS)that can be used to produce bioenergy crops and spare arable lands for food production. This study was conducted on 27 years old RMS which was converted to corn and miscanthus land uses in 2013. We assessed the growth performance (plant populations, height, tillers), and aboveground dry biomass (AB)yields of miscanthus and corn (Zea mays L.)compared to antecedent meadow under reclaimed mined land (RML)as affected by different fertilization practices during the first three years of establishment of corn and miscanthus. Results show that the growth and AB yields did not significantly vary between source (synthetic and organic)and rate of nitrogen applications (0, 75, 150, 225 kg N h−1)within each land-use. For the first three years meadow and corn on average had a 30% higher cumulative potential AB harvest compared to miscanthus (12.2 Mg ha−1). Miscanthus generally takes about three years to establish good stand. However, miscanthus had the highest AB yields in the third year (19.6 Mg ha−1)and is expected to maintain higher yields than the meadow (8.0 Mg ha−1)and corn (8.3 Mg ha−1)land-uses, resulting in a greater harvestable AB yield potential in the long-term. Continued monitoring of AB yields is critical to determining whether sustained yields can be maintained with little or no inputs in RML. © 2019

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from Eichhornia crassipes in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine, and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single-cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion, and emission characteristics. Test results projected that the characteristics of 20% WHB + 80% diesel fuel blend were in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO, and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB were comparatively lower than diesel fuel. Ignition delay is lowest for B100 blend and therefore the diffusion burning phase of biodiesel phase is found to be dominant in comparison with diesel fuel. For biodiesel blends, the combustion starts earlier due to higher cetane number, lessened delay period, and lowered calorific value followed by lowered HRR.

AB  - Cell disruption and lipid extraction methods for macroalgae are not well reported. Therefore, we compared various lipid extraction methods and extraction efficiency of various solvents to improve lipid yields from Oedogonium fresh water macroalgae. Lipid extraction was done by 2 methods viz., modified Bligh and Dyer method and soxhlet extraction using either single solvents or mixtures. In soxhlet extraction method five solvents were used (1) Hexane commonly used solvent for lipid extractions, (2) chloroform: methanol (2:1), (3) Chloroform: hexane (1:1), (4) Chloroform: hexane (1:2), (5) Dichloromethane + methanol (2:1). To improve lipid extraction yields, various cell disruption methods were also compared during the present study. Impurities of chlorophyll and protein were also detected in the extracted lipids. Hydrothermal liquefaction of algal biomass with TiO2 was also conducted at 300 °C. HTL was more effective by which 23.3 wt% of bio-crude oil was obtained. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Unplowed native grasslands are among the most endangered ecosystems in the world, due in large part to their agricultural suitability and widespread conversion to cropland. Despite this, remaining locations of these species- and carbon-rich landscapes are neither well monitored nor effectively protected. A recent spike in US prices for corn (Zea mays) and soybeans (Glycine max) intensified incentives to bring new land into production, potentially hastening the conversion of grasslands to crops. We combined satellite-based land cover data with aerial photographs and a field-based inventory of remaining native grassland (hereafter prairie) in Minnesota to assess the areas, rates, and locations of prairie conversion since 2008. Our results reveal that during 2008-2012, prairie was converted at average annual rates more than four times greater than the previous decade and a half. Corn and soybeans were the initial crops planted on 73% of converted prairie, and more than 80% of conversion occurred in recently established conservation priority zones, thereby magnifying the urgency to protect these sites. Broader land-use trends in Minnesota suggest that expansion of both croplands and developed lands continues to threaten all grasslands, including the subset that is prairie, and that the growth of developed or built-up land may be amplifying the conversion pressure exerted by agriculture, though further research is needed. Despite the small total area of prairie lost, the multi-fold increase in conversion rates and the confirmation of native habitat clearing may have substantial conservation implications, especially given the very limited prairie that remains in the region. The overall results reveal challenges for federal policies, including a loophole in the crop insurance Sodsaver provision surrounding alfalfa hay and limitations in the current enforcement of the Renewable Fuel Standard. © 2018 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - An integrated manure treatment system, including a mixed algal-bacterial bioreactor (MABB) and hydrothermal processing of biomass solids, was found to remove 76.4–97.0% of the total estrogenic hormones (estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3)) from the liquid portion of animal manure (LPAM). The mixed biomass was converted into either biocrude oil with a yield up to 40% via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or syngas with a yield up to 54% yield via catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG). Adding granular activated carbon (GAC) in the MABB enhanced the removal of estrogenic hormones (+ 7.2%), cytotoxicity (+ 58%), and heavy metals (+ 10.5%). After the integrated system with the MABB, HTL, and CHG processes, the overall percent removal of heavy metals from the LPAM ranged from 27.1 to 40.3%. The concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals (lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr)) in the aqueous phase after HTL and CHG tests ranged from 0.01 to 25.3 mg/L. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies provide opportunities to use waste materials beneficially in producing power, transportation fuels, and chemicals. Using a suite of economic models, this study estimates prices of four WTE resources: food waste; fats, oils, and greases (FOG); animal manure; and sewage sludge. Some of these materials are commoditized (e.g. FOG) thus their price is determined by market demand. For the materials regarded as waste, the study relates price to the avoided cost of disposal through waste management alternatives such as landfilling. This study finds that significant amounts of these feedstocks could be available at negative prices, meaning that a potential bioenergy facility could receive these materials for free or be paid to accept them in some locations. It is estimated that about 61% of sewage sludge, 27% of manure, and 7% of food waste may be available at negative prices. These negative price feedstocks are not uniformly distributed and are most likely to occur in areas with organic waste disposal bans, high population densities, and high landfill tipping fees. This study intends to open an initial discussion into how stakeholders view and value these materials, and how this view is evolving as their potential as WTE feedstocks is realized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Soil contamination with petroleum has long been a major environmental problem. Many methods have been developed for its remediation, including bioremediation, one of the most applied procedures. The biodegradation rate of bioremediation depends on the soil environment and can be enhanced by microorganism immobilization. Here, a modified biofuel ash was proposed as a new highly efficient and inexpensive immobilization carrier and tested experimentally in soil systems. Results: The degradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil by inoculated microorganisms immobilized on humic acid-modified biofuel ash reached up to 47.8% during 60 days, which was twice as high as that by free microorganisms. In treatments with immobilized microbes, n-alkanes with C28 and C31–34 were not detected and the degradation rates of C17–19 were 70.6% (unsterilized soil) and 54.2% (sterilized soil). The change in enzymatic activity reflected the basic respiration rate: it gradually increased in the pre-remediation stage, then decreased, and finally stabilized. Microorganism immobilization carriers had no significant contribution to microbial diversity in unsterilized soil, but they increased in sterilized soil. Conclusions: Humic acid-modified biofuel ash inoculated with microorganisms improves the degradability of petroleum and biodiversity in soil without microbes and, through the application of biofuel ash, reuses power plant waste. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Phragmites karka is gaining increasing attention as a biofuel crop due to high ligno-cellulosic biomass. In this study we investigated plant growth, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, and soluble sugar after 7, 15, and 30 days exposure to saline conditions [0 (control), 100 mM (moderate) and 300 mM (high) NaCl treatments]. Growth rate and net photosynthesis (A NET ) were unchanged during short term (0–7 days) exposure to moderate salinity but decreased at 300 mM NaCl due to reduction in net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance (gs), and intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci). However, growth rate decreased under long term (15–30 days) exposure to moderate salinity, while an increase in water use efficiency (WUE) and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (COE) helped to maintain A NET. Higher photosynthetic pigments, respiration, sugar content and efficiency of photosystem II (YII) appear to work together to reduce the risk of oxidative stress at 100 mM NaCl. Long term exposure at 300 mM NaCl decreased the A NET , gs, COE, and YII. Stomatal closure improved WUE but resulted in increased ROS production (ETR/A gross ). Photosynthesis was reduced by stomatal limitation under short-term exposure to high salinity and by both stomatal and biochemical limitation during long term exposure. These results indicate that P. karka can survive in moderate salinity for long durations by photosynthetic adaptations (photochemistry and gas exchange) that are vital for growth and biomass production in natural ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cerato-platanin proteins (CPPs) are small non-catalytic, cysteine-rich hydrophobic proteins produced by filamentous fungi. The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-β-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs and similarly to expansins, FgCPPs are trapped by cellulose and not by chitin, thus suggesting that these proteins interact with cellulose. A double knock-out mutant deleted of both FgCPPs encoding genes produces much more cellulase activity than the corresponding wild type strain when grown on CMC, likely compensating the absence of FgCPPs. This result prompted us to investigate a possible synergistic effect of these proteins with fungal cellulases. The incubation of FgCPPs in the presence of a fungal cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) determines an increased enzymatic activity on CMC, filter paper and wheat cell walls. The observation that FgCPPs act with a non-hydrolytic mechanism indicates that these proteins favor fungal cellulase activity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Rwandan dependence on imported petroleum products led to the exploration of the possibility of using biodiesel. To obtain feedstock, local farmers across the country were encouraged to grow Jatropha curcas L for biodiesel production project. This study investigated the economic feasibility of small-scale Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Kirehe district, Eastern Province. In assessing the economic feasibility, both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected from a total of 73 small-scale Jatropha farmers in five selected sectors in Kirehe district as well as from interviews with key players of biodiesel project. By using Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) as cost-benefit indicators, it was found that currently Jatropha cultivation is not economically feasible. This is due to very low seed yields, low Jatropha seed price, high discount rate and high production cost. Sensitivity analysis indicated that Jatropha cultivation is economically viable when seed yield is greater than 7000 kg/ha/year (with NPV greater than 1,184,414 Rwf/ha) and seed market price is greater than 240 Rwf/kg (with NPV greater than 88,172 Rwf/ha). In addition, it was found that if Jatropha is grown as fences (which require less inputs and labour), the venture is profitable with NPV of 821,500 Rwf/ha. However, substantial amount of revenue (2,081,924 Rwf/ha) is generated when hired labour is replaced by family labour. Based on the findings from this study, it is recommended that currently small-scale farmers should grow Jatropha as fences around their farms or alongside roads due to significantly low investment risks and opportunity costs for land. However, higher profit will be realized from Jatropha grown as fences if alternative uses of seeds will be developed by various actors along the value chain. © 2019 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Four accessions of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) were cultivated simultaneously under controlled conditions in quadruplicate. In the present experiment, technology equivalent to the production system utilized by the sunflower producers in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil was used. The biomass was collected separately: seeds, stalk, and capitulum (head). Thereafter, each fraction of each accession was quantitated separately with respect to its production and oil yield per hectare. Furthermore, the lignocellulosic chemical characteristics of each stalk and head were studied, adopting the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) methodology. Among the studied sunflower accessions, characterization of the whole residues showed that Aguará 4 had the highest cellulose content in the stalks (40.7%), followed by Hélio 360 (39.0%). However, the projection of the potential of biomass yield points to accession M734 as having the highest potential to provide total sugars (1557 kg⋅ha −1 ) and oil (663 kg⋅ha −1 ) for large-scale production. These results allow both the estimation of the potential of biofuel production using residues from different sunflower accessions and the performance of an economic essay regarding the production of sunflower as a raw material for the development of biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to summarize results on potential phytomanagement of two metal(loid)-polluted military soils using Miscanthus x giganteus. Such an option was tested during 2-year pot experiments with soils taken from former military sites in Sliač Slovakia and Kamenetz-Podilsky, Ukraine. The following elements were considered: As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr, Ti, Zn and Zr. M. x giganteus showed good growth at both military soils with slightly higher maximum shoot lengths in the second year of vegetation. Based on Principal Component Analysis similarities of metal(loid) uptake by roots, stems and leaves were summarized. Major part of the elements remained in M. x giganteus roots and rather limited amounts moved to the aerial parts. Levels taken up decreased in the second vegetation year. Dynamics of foliar metal(loid) concentrations divided the elements in two groups: essential elements required for metabolism (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) and non-essential elements without any known metabolic need (As, Sr, Ti, and Zr). Fe, Mn, Ti and Sr showed similar S-shaped uptake curve in terms of foliar concentrations (likely due to dilution in growing biomass), while Cu exhibited a clear peak mid-season. Behavior of Zn was in between. Foliar Zr and As concentrations were below detection limit. The results illustrated a good potential of M. x giganteus for safely growing on metal-polluted soils taken from both military localities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of microalgal biomass as a potential biofuel source is limited by expensive harvesting costs. However, air flotation has been applied as an effective method for harvesting microalgal cells from diluted liquid suspensions. In this study, Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus harvesting experiments were performed with thermal pretreatment prior to air flotation. RESULTS: An orthogonal test showed that the harvesting efficiency was affected by the heating temperature and pH but not by the microalgal concentration or stirring rate. Under a heating temperature of 90 °C and pH 3, the optimal heat-aided air flotation efficiency achieved for harvesting C. vulgaris was 26.5%, with a concentration factor of 5.5. For harvesting S. obliquus, the optimal harvesting efficiency was 93.6% and the concentration factor was 25.0 under a heating temperature of 70 °C and pH 3. CONCLUSION: High temperature and low pH increased the zeta potential value of the microalgal cell surface, and high temperature promoted the secretion of extracellular organic matter, causing microalgal cells to gather and form flocs. The smaller flocs and higher zeta potential value of S. obliquus led to its higher harvesting efficiency. These conditions provided the possibility of waste acidic gas and thermal energy from industries replacing flocculants for the harvesting process. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the potential of energy crops for biomethane production by examining the influence of abattoir and municipal wastewater irrigation on biomass production and the Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP). The experiments covered seven energy crops including sugar beet, alfalfa, maize, giant reed, napier grass, sunflower and canola. The biomass was harvested at three months of planting and BMP of each energy crops was assessed using anaerobic digestion. Giant reed yielded the highest biomass (22.3 t ha −1 ) from A800 treatment compared to the other species. The best performance for BMP (793.56 Nml CH 4 g VS −1 ) was recorded for maize biomass irrigated with abattoir wastewater which is equivalent to gross energy yield 1041 GJ ha −1 yr −1 or electricity yield 284.8 MW h ha −1 yr −1 . The digestate samples collected after anaerobic digestion of biomass from plants were analysed for their nutrient value. Nutrient content of digestates varied between energy crops, waste water sources and irrigation levels. The highest nitrate content was measured for giant reed (A800) and phosphate and sulphate contents for sugar beet leaf (A800). The results indicated that wastewater sources can be used to grow energy crops, thereby producing biomethane for energy and digestate for plant nutrition through anaerobic digestion process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Size-resolved elemental measurements were conducted for the water-soluble fraction of particulate matter at a central California coastal city, Marina, during two separate summertime field campaigns: the Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) in 2013 and the Fog and Stratocumulus Evolution (FASE) campaign in 2016. Two Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactors (MOUDIs) were used to quantify mass size distributions of 29 elements and a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed six characteristic sources during the measurement periods: (i) Crustal Emissions (3.9% of total mass), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (24.4%), (iii) Biomass Burning (13.1%), (iv) Waste Facilities (8.7%), (v) Vehicular Emissions (4.4%), and (vi) Marine Emissions (45.4%). Characteristic elements from each of these sources included the following: (i) Crustal Emissions (Fe, Al, Ti, Pt), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (Zn, As, Rb, K, Cu, V), (iii) Biomass Burning (Rb, K, Cu, Pt), (iv) Waste Facilities (Ag, Cd, Ni, Al), (v) Vehicular Emissions (Zn, Zr, V, Mn), and (vi) Marine Emissions (Na, Sr, V, Mn). Temporally-resolved results revealed higher PM levels associated with Vehicular Emissions (day/night mass concentration ratio = 31.3), Crustal Emissions (day/night = 20.0), and Secondary Aerosol (day/night = 27.2) during the day compared to night due to some combination of more daytime anthropogenic activity, wind speed/directional factors, and photochemistry. The Marine Emissions factor exhibited a day/night concentration ratio of exactly 1.0. Mass size distributions revealed characteristic peaks in four diameter ranges: 0.1–0.18 μm, 0.32–0.56 μm, 1.0–1.8 μm, and 3.2–5.6 μm. The number of modes varied depending on the species and degree of wildfire influence, with additional differences observed between the NiCE and FASE wildfire periods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural land in the Midwest is a source of food and fuel, as well as biodiversity. It is also a cause of excess nutrients that make their way to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. To address unsustainable changes to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions, a multidisciplinary approach involving social science, natural science, and engineering is often effective. Given the potential of second-generation biofuels, and capitalizing on the deep-rooted perennial bioenergy crops capable of thriving in poor soils, we demonstrated an integrated socio-environmental analysis of the impacts of growing switchgrass within row-crop landscapes in Illinois. In this study, we model land use scenarios that incorporate switchgrass as a biofuel crop in a Midwest corn-belt watershed using the Soil Water Assessment Tool coupled with an economic analysis for the Vermilion Basin in Illinois. We estimated the values of ecosystem services under an alternative bioenergy landscape, including commodity and bioenergy crops, changes in biogeochemistry, and recreational services. The estimated annual values of nitrate and sediment reduction attributed to bioenergy crops range from $38 million to $97 million and $16,000 to $197,000, respectively. The annual value of carbon dioxide emission reduction ranges from $1.8 million to $6.1 million based on the initial crop rotation pattern. Estimated average annual values for wildlife viewing, water-based recreation, and pheasant hunting are $1.24 million, $0.17 million, and $0.3 million, respectively. To our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to comprehensively quantify ecosystem services using a process-based model, and estimate their value in an alternative bioenergy landscape. The information we generate could aid in understanding the potential for biomass production from marginal land and the total economic value of the landscape at various spatial scales. The framework is useful in fostering alternative bioenergy landscapes with synergies in a food, energy, and conservation nexus. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The global demand for biofuels in the transport sector may lead to significant biodiversity impacts via multiple human pressures. Biodiversity assessments of biofuels, however, seldom simultaneously address several impact pathways, which can lead to biased comparisons with fossil fuels. The goal of the present study was to quantify the direct influence of habitat loss, water consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on potential global species richness loss due to the current production of first-generation biodiesel from soybean and rapeseed and bioethanol from sugarcane and corn. We found that the global relative species loss due to biofuel production exceeded that of fossil petrol and diesel production in more than 90% of the locations considered. Habitat loss was the dominating stressor with Chinese corn, Brazilian soybean and Brazilian sugarcane having a particularly large biodiversity impact. Spatial variation within countries was high, with 90th percentiles differing by a factor of 9 to 22 between locations. We conclude that displacing fossil fuels with first-generation biofuels will likely negatively affect global biodiversity, no matter which feedstock is used or where it is produced. Environmental policy may therefore focus on the introduction of other renewable options in the transport sector. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Mechanization of agriculture drastically increases labour productivity in crop production, playing a major role in industrialization by freeing up workforce for industry and services. These historical processes are well studied, but there is much less knowledge on their environmental implications, particularly the carbon footprint. In this work, we aimed to reconstruct the complete historical process of mechanization in Spanish agriculture at the national scale, estimating the carbon footprint of traction through a life cycle assessment approach. The assessment includes greenhouse gas emissions from working animals and feed production, and accounts for the historical changes in the energy efficiency of the industrial production of machinery and fuels. The results reveal an increase in the carbon footprint of traction from 3.1 Pg CO2e yr−1 in 1900 to 11–12 Pg CO2e yr−1 in the 1970s and 1980s, decreasing to 7–8 Pg CO2e yr−1 in 2010–2014. Area-based emissions ranged 185–242 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 in 1900–1933, when the practical totality of traction was animal, and 503–540 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 in the 21st century, when animal traction had almost completely disappeared. Product-based emissions were similar at the beginning and at the end of the study period, as the productivity growth offset the area-based emissions growth. The results show a large peak in emissions during the main decades of the mechanization process. Thus, the large savings observed in the last three decades start from a very high emission level. The carbon footprint of traction could be reduced by mimicking the logic of traditional organic systems but still benefiting from modern technological efficiency, through the self-production of the fuel. Our analysis, however, shows that a simple shift to biofuels may actually increase greenhouse gas emissions and consume a large share of the current agricultural output. Therefore, its combination with significant reductions in fuel and feed demand would be necessary to achieve its mitigation potential. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic upgrading of bio-oils derived from fast pyrolysis of sunflower stalk, cedar, knotweed and apple tree stem over H-ZSM-5, H-beta and H-USY zeolites with high alumina content was investigated at a reaction temperature of 500 °C. All catalysts showed high catalytic activity and selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons in the conversions of oxygenated compounds in the bio-oils, and 56.2–100% of aromatic hydrocarbons were found in the upgraded bio-oils which can be detected by GC/MS. Naphthalene was favored to be produced by using H-ZSM-5 while more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as p-xylene, toluene and alkylbenzene were generated by using H-beta as well as H-USY. Furthermore, all catalysts maintained high activity and selectivity with the maximum aromatic hydrocarbons amount of 70% in the upgraded bio-oils detected in the third cycle. In addition, the spent catalysts were easily regenerated by simple calcination at 650 °C for 30 min, and the regenerated catalysts showed almost the same activity as the fresh ones. It is expected that these high alumina zeolites can be widely used in practical bio-oil upgrading processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuels production from alternative and renewable raw materials is mandatory to achieve sustainable growth based on a bioeconomy. Eucalyptus bark is a waste generated during the chemical manufacturing of Eucalyptus pulp that can be used as an alternative source of biomass, suitable for the production of biofuels. In this work, Eucalyptus nitens bark (ENB) was fractionated by organosolv treatment for ethanol production. For that, a Doehlert experimental design was carried out to evaluate the dependent variables: temperature (170–200 °C), time (30–90 min) and ethanol-water percentage (50–80 %) on delignification of Eucalyptus bark. Organosolv process was suitable for the fractionation of E. nitens bark. After treatment, 74–93 % of glucan was recovered and 25–52 % of delignification was achieved. Delignified ENB was subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process for bioethanol production. The results showed that the variables temperature and time of organosolv process had significant influence on ethanol production. The organosolv pretreatment improved the ethanol yield from 32 to 99%. This work shows a suitable process for the valorization of Eucalyptus bark into bioethanol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study proposes a biofuel model in Taiwan that considers the government subsidy policy, market demand, biofuel production cost, and social cost attributes. Biofuel is a prospective alternative and renewable solution to energy and environmental challenges in the transportation sector. However, the development of biofuels is constrained by several factors including the amount of land available (the primary constraint), marketing of residual resources, and technological improvements. Economic feasibility and competition analysis and use of residual resources limited the actual amount of residual resources utilized to produce biofuel. Prior studies have examined the potential to commercialize biofuels where resources are limited. Despite insufficient land availability, biofuel commercialization has the potential to be mutually beneficial and risk-sharing in the supply chain. The contribution of this study is to develop a dynamic system model to explore the potential for biofuel commercialization in Taiwan despite its limited Biofuel resources. Through this model, this study considered E3 vehicles that use a fuel blend of 3% ethanol and 97% gasoline. Data were collected from institutional statistical reports. The results showed there is a large commercial opportunity; however, biofuel resources are insufficient. To deal with this resource insufficient, the Taiwanese government could use this model to develop an appropriate subsidy policy that adjusts prices based on market demand and technological improvements. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transition from coal-based electricity to ‘carbon neutral’ biofuels derived from forests has catalysed a debate largely centred upon whether woody-biofuels drive deforestation. Consequently, a crucial point is often missed. Most wood pellets used in electricity production are derived from waste-wood; a practice considered acceptable by many otherwise strongly opposed to the industry. We highlight that, precisely because waste-wood is a ‘waste’ its carbon-neutral credentials should be questioned. We then examine a parallel development occurring within the same industrial system; the recovery of electricity producers’ combustion-ash residues for concrete production. Contrasting how accounting practices allocate upstream carbon to these ‘wastes’ in the cases of wood pellets and coal-ash reveals how decisions are shaped by industry imperatives, rather than established lifecycle techniques. If the politics of emissions allocation continue to evolve in this way, it may become increasingly difficult to distinguish where progress towards a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and circular economy is real, from where it is an artefact of biased and inconsistent accounting practices. © 2019

AB  - More than 95% of biodiesel production feedstocks come from edible oils, however it may cause some problems such as the competition of land use between food production and biodiesel production. The waste cooking oils (WCO) are an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production; its usage reduces significantly the cost of biodiesel production and has environmental benefits, e.g., a waste recovery instead of its elimination. This work aims to produce a low-cost efficient solid catalyst for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production using mixtures of refined palm oil (RPO) and WCO. Four low cost catalysts were prepared (biomass fly ashes, natural dolomite rock, chicken eggshells and polyethylene terephthalate - PET), characterized (by SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, FT-IR and Hammett indicators) and tested regarding their performance in FAME production. The maximum yield of FAME achieved was around 96%wt. for biomass fly ashes catalyst at 60 °C, 9:1 (mol/mol) of methanol to oil mixture, 10%wt. catalyst to oil mixture, over 180 min in batch reactor. The results point out for promising bifunctional catalysts able to achieve also conversion of free fatty acids up to 100% using mixtures of RPO and WCO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study of the interactions among the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability in supply chain management research has received increased attention in recent years. However, for the specific case of the biodiesel supply chain, little attention has been given to the inclusion of social aspects in an integrated analysis of sustainability performance. This paper in turn proposes and develops a deterministic multi-objective linear programming model to analyze the relationship among the economic, environmental, and food security dimensions of the biodiesel supply chain (BSC) in Colombia. Considering four echelons from the supply chain (palm cultivation, oil extraction, biorefineries, and mixers), the model seeks to minimize total cost, impact on food security, and emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions from direct and indirect land use change. The Epsilon-constraint method is used to solve the multi-objective model for the BSC. A Pareto set of optimal solutions helped to assess the trade-offs involving the three objectives. The relationship between costs and emissions is contingent upon impact on food security; this is, the design of the supply chain network involving substitution of palm for agricultural crops exhibits lower total cost and lower CO2 emissions. The proposed generic mathematical model is applicable to any supply chain of agro-fuels and allows the calculation of production, inventory and distribution plans to better satisfy sustainability criteria. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study treats an important and imperious worldwide problem. It deals with the production of alternative biofuels from starchy restaurants’ bio-waste. The starchy wastes of the restaurants, especially in developing countries, are produced in huge quantities that represent a sustainable substrate for ethanol production. So, we aimed to study the feasibility of the conversion of the starchy wastes to biofuel (bioethanol) using different pretreatments and new yeast strains. Our results approved the feasibility of conversion of the starchy wastes into biofuel. Using of thermo-acidic hydrolysis, we obtained 360 g of free and fermentable sugars from each dry kg of the wasted materials. Pichia barkeri and Candida intermedia were introduced as new species for the field of biofuel production in addition to the classical Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among them, S. cerevisiae KKUY-0301 produced 11.5 g/L of ethanol from 27 g of sugars. Its transformation rate was 82% of the theoretical yield, i.e. 1 kg of the waste could produce 150 g of ethanol. Optimization of the cultural conditions approved that 4 days of incubation, pH 5, 35 °C and 5% of the yeast inoculum (108 cell/mL) were the most appropriate conditions that could induce the maximum production bioethanol. This study recommends the application of this technology on a commercial scale all over the world to benefit from all types of bio-wastes. In addition, our findings offer a crucial solution for the recycling the restaurant starchy waste materials into ecofriendly product “biofuel” that reduce the overall cost production of the bioenergy and make it a competitive to the oil-based energy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuels have been promoted as a likely avenue for the future transportation energy mix. Hence, production of biofuels using lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as forest-based biomass, is expected to increase globally. Forest biomass abundance and experience with applying biomass conversion technologies gives the Nordic countries an advantage in catering to biofuel production capacity investment. Yet, given uncertainties in the techno-economic variables of biofuel conversion technologies, as well as differences between the Nordic countries in terms of labor costs, bioheat market prices and electricity and forest biomass costs and prices, it is unclear which of the Nordic countries are comparatively attractive for future investment in forest-based biofuel production capacity. In this paper, we quantify how techno-economic cost components of a novel forest-based biofuel production technology affect optimal allocation of biofuel production capacity in the Nordic countries at a regional level. We apply a scenario analysis approach using an endogenous biofuel capacity investment module in the Nordic Forest Sector Model (NFSM). In each scenario, we alter the techno-economic features of the technology and quantify total biofuel production allocation volume in each region and at a national level. We find that optimal capacity allocation is affected by the type of feedstock used in the technology and will affect existing industries dependent on forest feedstocks. Electricity selling or purchasing will have little effect on allocation because it comprises a small revenue or cost proportion. Bioheat may affect allocation, but this will depend on local demand. Finally, labor costs may affect allocation, but this will depend on the labor intensity, which changes with scale. The results are relevant for policy incentives to proliferate future forest-based biofuel production in the Nordic countries. © 2017

AB  - Algae biomass is formed by an extremely complex set of metabolites, and its molecular characterization has been very challenging. We report the characterization of microalgae extracts via traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) by two different analysis strategies. First, the extracts were analyzed by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) with no previous chromatographic separation (DI-ESI-TWIM-MS). Second, the samples were screened for metabolites and lipids using an untargeted high-throughput method that employs ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using data-independent analysis (DIA) - MSE (UHPLC-HDMSE). Sixteen different microalgae biomasses were evaluated by both strategies. DI-ESI-TWIM-MS was able, via distinct drift times, to set apart different classes of metabolites, with the differences in the profiles of each microalga readily evident. With the UHPLC-HDMSE approach, 1251 different compounds were putatively annotated across 16 samples with 210 classified as lipids. From the normalized abundance for each annotated compound category, a detailed profiling in terms of metabolites, lipids, and lipid classes of each sample was performed. The reported workflow represents a powerful tool to determine the most suitable biotechnological applications for a given alga type and may allow for real-time monitoring of the algae composition distribution as a function of growth conditions, feedstocks, and the like. The determination of collision cross section results in improved confidence in the identification of triacylglycerols in samples, highly applicable to biofuels production. The two analysis strategies explored in this work offer powerful tools for the biomass industry by aiding in the identification of ideal strains and culture conditions for a specific application, saving analysis time and facilitating identification of a large number of constituents at once. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The environmental impacts of the palm oil industry are widely recognised. Unsurprisingly, many people, including many conservation pundits, consider oil palm a major evil. What is less widely recognized is the extent to which this industry has benefited people. Oil palm development, if well-planned and managed, can provide improved incomes and employment and generate investments in services and infrastructure. These alternative viewpoints fuel a polarised debate in which oil palm is alternatively seen as a gift from god or a crime against humanity. Stepping outside this rhetorical extremism is necessary if we seek resolution and pragmatic advances. An important question is how to plan, guide, and assess oil palm developments to foster the greatest benefits and least harm. Such questions are particularly relevant in a global context in which many voices call for constraining oil palm developments and boycotting palm oil, but also for adhering to sustainable development goals. What opportunities are available to people in tropical forest regions if oil palm developments are prohibited? Broader ethical questions also play out in the contexts of biofuels and food security and of competition among oil crops, especially the crops at higher latitudes (e.g., soy, maize, sunflower, rapeseed, olive), vs. the tropical oils (oil palm and coconut). We here explore some of the questions of ethics related to the production and use of palm oil and other vegetable oils. The goal of this article is not to answer these contested questions but rather to highlight some of the nuances that are often omitted in current debates. Judgements will reflect perspectives with, for example, tropical producers and temperate consumers often framing and assessing the issues differently. Addressing gaps in understanding on ethics of palm oil production will help find a shared framework for development involving oil palm and other oil crops. A commitment to ethical consistency, where double standards are recognised and avoided, offers a potential way forward. © Copyright © 2019 Meijaard and Sheil.

AB  - Aircraft engines are a unique source of carbonaceous aerosols in the upper troposphere. There, these particles can more efficiently interact with solar radiation than at ground. Due to the lack of measurement data, the radiative forcing from aircraft exhaust aerosol remains uncertain. To better estimate the global radiative effects of aircraft exhaust aerosol, its optical properties need to be comprehensively characterized. In this work we present the link between the chemical composition and the optical properties of the particulate matter (PM) measured at the engine exit plane of a CFM56-7B turbofan. The measurements covered a wide range of power settings (thrust), ranging from ground idle to take-off, using four different fuel blends of conventional Jet A-1 and hydro-processed ester and fatty acids (HEFA) biofuel. At the two measurement wavelengths (532 and 870 nm) and for all tested fuels, the absorption and scattering coefficients increased with thrust, as did the PM mass. The analysis of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) revealed a significant mass fraction of OC (up to 90 %) at low thrust levels, while EC mass dominated at medium and high thrust. The use of HEFA blends induced a significant decrease in the PM mass and the optical coefficients at all thrust levels. The HEFA effect was highest at low thrust levels, where the EC mass was reduced by up to 50 %-60 %. The variability in the chemical composition of the particles was the main reason for the strong thrust dependency of the single scattering albedo (SSA), which followed the same trend as the fraction of OC to total carbon (TC). Mass absorption coefficients (MACs) were determined from the correlations between aerosol light absorption and EC mass concentration. The obtained MAC values (MAC532 D 7:5±0:3 m2 g-1 and MAC870 D 5:2 ± 0:9 m2 g-1) are in excellent agreement with previous literature values of absorption cross section for freshly generated soot. While the MAC values were found to be independent of the thrust level and fuel type, the mass scattering coefficients (MSCs) significantly varied with thrust. For cruise conditions we obtained MSC532 D 4:5 ± 0:4 m2 g-1 and MSC870 D 0:54 ± 0:04 m2 g-1, which fall within the higher end of MSCs measured for fresh biomass smoke. However, the latter comparison is limited by the strong dependency of MSC on the particles' size, morphology and chemical composition. The use of the HEFA fuel blends significantly decreased PM emissions, but no changes were observed in terms of EC=OC composition and radiative properties. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Renewable fuels are necessary energy sources as bio-based combustible fuels can be utilized in existing infrastructure while lowering the dependence on petrochemical based fuels. Current bio-fuels are predominantly crop-based which require tillable land, fertilizer, chemicals, irrigation, and fuel to cultivate the biomass feedstock. This study investigated the hydrothermal conversion of underutilized waste streams for biomass feedstock. This work blended municipal sewage sludge solids, poultry dissolved air flotation solids, and used cooking oil to form a waste slurry that was thermally converted to renewable fuel products. Blended waste processing provides flexibility and robustness in the future of bio-based fuels, and the authors believe this is the first documented hydrothermal processing of this specific blended waste. The waste slurry was heated under subcritical hydrothermal conditions, where solids were separated, and then heated in a second pressurized reaction to complete the thermal conversion process of wastes to recoverable products. Prior to processing, the blended waste slurry contained 8,490 kJ/kg (3,650 BTU/lb). Following processing, the recovered gas products contained 38,747 kJ/kg (16,658 BTU/lb) and 42% methane. The recovered renewable oil contained 40,468 kJ/kg (17,398 BTU/lb) and 0.012% ash. The effluent produced water was appraised for nutrient content and was found to contain 1,689 mg/L of nitrogen, which has potential as a liquid fertilizer product. The produced gas fuel, produced liquid fuel, solid char, and produced nutrient laden water were determined to be potential marketable products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To provide sufficient quantities of food and feed, farming systems have to overcome limiting factors such as the nutrient depletion of arable soils. Nitrogen being the main mineral element required for plant growth, has led to the extensive use of chemical fertilizers causing nitrogen pollution of the ecosystems. This field study investigates the use of biogas residues (BRs) as biofertilizers and their contribution to the mitigation of nitrate leaching in agricultural soils, while also demonstrating the polluting nature of chemical fertilizers. Nine different fertilization treatments classified in three schemes and two nitrogen doses were tested for three consecutive years on a grassland in the Walloon Region of Belgium. Residual soil mineral nitrogen, percentage contribution of treatments in residual nitrate and agronomic performance were assessed for each fertilization treatment. The results obtained showed significant differences on treatment and scheme level regarding nitrate accumulation in the soil, with chemical fertilizers posing the highest nitrate leaching risk. BRs did not cause nitrate accumulation in the soil, and were N rate and rainfall independent, while the chemical treatments indicated a cumulative tendency under high N rate and low precipitation. Forage yield did not demonstrate statistical differences on treatment and scheme level but varied with changing precipitation, while the maximum application rate suggested a plateau. Aboveground nitrogen content was significantly higher after the application of chemical fertilizers only in the first year, while all the chemical treatments indicated a dilution effect under elevated annual rainfall. Finally, the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers by raw digestate reduced the concentration of NO 3 − in the soil without having a negative impact on the yield and N content of the biomass. These results strongly advocate for the environmental benefits of BRs over chemical fertilizers and underline their suitability as biofertilizers and substitutes for chemical fertilizers in similar agricultural systems. © 2019

AB  - Current investigation has for the first time utilized Trichocomaceae fungi i.e. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus and Pencillium i.e. Penicillium chrysogenum for augmenting the phytoremediation potential of bioenergy crops wheat (Zea mays) and ‎ sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Phytoremediation was done for mitigation of heavy metals i.e. Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soils of agricultural significance. Phytoremediant crops were inoculated with fungal cultures by three methods i.e. mixing method, seed inoculation method and layering spreading method. Maize and sunflower plants after fungal inoculation were harvested after 60 days of germination. The estimation of % biomass and bioenergy of maize and sunflower plants was done. Results were indicative of the good phytoremediation potential of roots and shoots for uptake of heavy metals i.e. Cr<Cu<Pb<Cd in the presence of Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus flavus by fungal inoculation methods. Sunflower and fungal inoculum of Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium chrysogenum extracted significant quantity of metals from the soil. By three fungal inoculation methods, range of % production of biomass was 84−87% and sunflower plants dry biomass 9.6 g yielded 0.16% of oil. Obtained results are have favored the use of fungal inoculation as an effective mode for phytoremediation augmentation of maize and sunflower. Furthermore, current work also signifies the sustainable conversion of bioenergy crops to biofuel production in a cost effective mode. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The energy sector is an important factor that influences life quality and economic prosperity. Differences in infrastructure, technology and even in culture of each country make it imperative to include their own characteristics into energy analyses, making it necessary to identify the different types of sources of CO2 emissions and their magnitudes. The aim of this paper is to present a foresight analysis of the productive and energy matrices dynamics in Ecuador for the period 2016–2030 and to propose public policy that contributes to sustainable development. In a first stage, the research has an explanatory character, referring to construction of a model, which uses an extended variation of the Kaya Identity where the volume of CO2 emissions may be examined quantifying contributions of productive sectors activity, sectorial energy intensity, energy matrix, and CO2 emission features. Subsequently, the research acquires a predictive-experimental nature, using exploratory scenarios. That allows linking historic and present events with hypothetical futures. In consequence, driving forces of the scenario can be explained and analysed using quantitative modelling based on the Kaya Identity and qualitative narratives. Within this study two scenarios were built. The Business as Usual scenario, without modifying the structure of productive and energy matrices, and the Alternative scenario that seeks to reduce the consumption of oil derivatives in land transport, which consumes 50% of the country’s energy demand. The Alternative scenario, which promotes the use of biofuels, projects to reduce the CO2 emissions from 45.58 to 43.41 Mt of CO2 equivalent for 2030. The policy on biofuels in Ecuador is at an early stage. So, biofuels offer important opportunities: i) diversification of the energy matrix, ii) contribution to energy security, iii) promotion of the growth of the industrial sector, and iv) substitution of fossil fuels and mitigation of the greenhouse gas effects. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2019.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is a critical component of the overall sustainability of bioenergy cropping systems. Predicting the influence of cropping systems on SOC under diverse scenarios requires a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes driving SOC accumulation and loss. We used a density fractionation technique to isolate three SOC fractions that are conceptualized to vary in SOC protection from decomposition. The free light fraction (FLF) is particulate SOC that is present in the inter-aggregate soil matrix, the occluded light fraction (OLF) is contained within aggregates, and the heavy fraction (HF) is associated with minerals. We evaluated surface (0 to 10 cm depth) SOC fraction changes from baseline conditions 5 years after biofuel cropping system establishment at two temperate sites with contrasting soil textures. The biofuel cropping systems included no-till maize, switchgrass, prairie, and hybrid poplar. The FLF concentration (g fraction C g bulk soil−1) did not change significantly from baseline levels under any of the cropping systems at either site after 5 years. Except for poplar, OLF concentrations were reduced in all systems at the site with coarse-textured soils and maintained at the site with fine-textured soils. In poplar systems, OLF concentrations were maintained on coarse-textured soils and increased on fine-textured soils. The HF concentrations also increased under poplar on the coarse-textured soil. A structural equation model indicated that OLF concentrations increased with lower litter C:N, and HF concentrations increased with greater litter quantity and lower litter C:N mass ratios. C:N increased over time within all SOC fractions, suggesting that all pools are sensitive to land-use change on sub-decadal timescales. In agreement with modern SOC theory, our empirical results indicate that increasing litter input quantity and promoting plant species with low C:N litter may improve SOC storage in aggregate and mineral-associated soil fractions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A life cycle thinking approach focusing on energy and greenhouse gas savings has been applied to study the potential for energy recovery and organic matter reclamation from Waste Activated Sludge produced in Waste Water Treatment Plants by means of a catalytic thermo-chemical process. A generic Basic Sludge Processing line has been modelled following common waste water and sludge treatment stages found in several European plants. This has served to identify and divide generic sludge treatment units in order to compare the performance of different industrial configurations where a specific thermo-chemical technology treatment unit and related cogeneration was substituted or added to reference units. The considered technology is an enhanced intermediate pyrolysis screw reactor combined with a reforming process known as Thermo-Catalytic Reforming allowing for conversion of sewage sludge into energy carriers and reclamation of organic substances in the form of charcoal (biochar). In order to study the greenhouse gas savings, a calculator tool complying with Directive 2009/28/EC has been adopted. Results show that substantial benefits in terms of energy production and greenhouse gas emissions reduction of a sludge-to-energy system are expected if the secondary sludge is directly treated with the Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process, without an intermediate anaerobic digestion step. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the major factors in the success of renewable energy is finding a proper location for production facilities. At a national level, different parts of a country (e.g. provinces) can be seen as alternatives that can be assessed based on a set of criteria, and ranking them to identify the best location. The focus in this paper is on identifying the best location for the production of bioethanol. After a comprehensive literature review, an evaluation framework is proposed based on the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental and social). Using data provided by a sample of experts in a developing country – Iran – and applying the best-worst method (BWM), a number of decision-making criteria are evaluated. Performance data involving the various provinces of Iran are collected from different sources. The performance data and the weights identified through BWM are used to calculate an overall score for each province, which is then used to rank the provinces, with the province of Khuzestan (closely followed by Tehran) being identified as the most suitable province for bioethanol production in Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Old world bluestem cultivar WW-B Dahl [Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz.), S. T. Blake] is a non-native perennial C4 bunch grass with biofuel production potential grown predominantly in the Southern U.S. Great Plains. Although this is a popular introduced grass cultivar, data on carbon fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET) from this warm-season grass is rare. In this study, the eddy covariance method was used to measure CO 2 and ET from an established stand of bluestem for three years (2013–2015). Year 2015 had the highest gross primary production (GPP; 1358 ± 143 g C m −2 ) followed by 2014 (1250 ± 31 g C m −2 ) and 2013 (1024 ± 91 g C m −2 ). The average loss of GPP as ecosystem respiration (R eco ) was 76%. Annual NEE sums were -302 ± 15 g C m −2 in 2013, -265 ± 41 g C m -2 in 2014, and -287 ± 32 g C m −2 in 2015. Results from this study show that the NEE in grasslands in years with normal precipitation that is well distributed may not vary from years with above-normal precipitation. This is because precipitation enhances R eco along with carbon uptake, which may result in lower net carbon uptake in perennial grasslands in higher precipitation years than normal precipitation years. Gross primary production showed a linear relationship with ET (R 2 = 0.90) and above ground biomass (R 2 = 0.74). Only 26% of the GPP was allocated to above ground biomass indicating a higher allocation of carbon to below ground biomass. The water use efficiency of bluestem (2.9 g C kg -1 of water) matched well with that of native prairies and other dedicated biomass crops grown in the Southern Great Plains. As the demand for cellulosic biofuels is increasing, results from field experiments quantifying seasonal changes in carbon fluxes and ET could be important in understanding the contributions of large-scale production of novel biomass crops to regional carbon and hydrologic cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global warming and increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) have prompted considerable interest in the potential role of energy plant biomass. Cassava-based fuel ethanol is one of the most important bioenergy and has attracted much attention in both developed and developing countries. However, the development of cassava-based fuel ethanol is still faced with many uncertainties, including raw material supply, net energy potential, and carbon emission mitigation potential. Thus, an accurate estimation of these issues is urgently needed. This study provides an approach to estimate energy saving and carbon emission mitigation potentials of cassava-based fuel ethanol through LCA (life cycle assessment) coupled with a biogeochemical process model—GEPIC (GIS-based environmental policy integrated climate) model. The results indicate that the total potential of cassava yield on marginal land in China is 52.51 million t; the energy ratio value varies from 0.07 to 1.44, and the net energy surplus of cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 92,920.58 million MJ. The total carbon emission mitigation from cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 4593.89 million kgC. Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian are identified as target regions for large-scale development of cassava-based fuel ethanol industry. These results can provide an operational approach and fundamental data for scientific research and energy planning. © 2017, ISB.

AB  - This article presents a study that identifies the variables with greatest impact on the biogas and methane production over a process with thermal pretreatment, to accelerate anaerobic digestion process in sewage sludge in a water treatment plant, for a poultry processing factory, by using fuzzy logic. The designed fuzzy logic model includes 688 inference rules, with a correlation of 99.3% between prediction data against experimental data, for the biogas variable; and 97% for the methane variable. The predictions of the fuzzy logic model were analyzed with response surface models, and it is concluded that the temperature and operating time variables are mutually determining in the biogas and methane production. Likewise, this research provides a methodology for the design of an expert decision support system that allows to evaluate and optimize a mesophilic anaerobic digestion process through a previous thermal treatment in order to improve the yields of biogas and methane in the treatment of effluent sludge from agroindustry. These results propose to diffuse logic as a reliable tool to make comparisons, and predictions for operation variables management on the treatment of residual sludge with thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Microalgae are attracting much attention as a promising feedstock for renewable energy production, while simultaneously providing environmental benefits. So far, comparison studies for microalgae selection for this purpose were mainly based on data obtained from batch cultures, where the lipid content and the growth rate were the main selection parameters. The present study evaluates the performance of native microalgae strains in semi-continuous mode, considering the suitability of the algal-derived fatty acid composition and the saponifiable lipid productivity as selection criteria for microalgal fuel production. Evaluation of the photosynthetic performance and the robustness of the selected strain under outdoor conditions was conducted to assess its capability to grow and tolerate harsh environmental growth conditions. Results: In this study, five native microalgae strains from Tunisia (one freshwater and four marine strains) were isolated and evaluated as potential raw material to produce biofuel. Firstly, molecular identification of the strains was performed. Then, experiments in semi-continuous mode at different dilution rates were carried out. The local microalgae strains were characterized in terms of biomass and lipid productivity, in addition to protein content, and fatty acid profile, content and productivity. The marine strain Chlorella sp. showed, at 0.20 1/day dilution rate, lipid and biomass productivities of 35.10 mg/L day and 0.2 g/L day, respectively. Moreover, data from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements demonstrated the robustness of this strain as it tolerated extreme outdoor conditions including high (38 °C) and low (10 °C) temperature, and high irradiance (1600 μmol/m2 s). Conclusions: Selection of native microalgae allows identifying potential strains suitable for use in the production of biofuels. The selected strain Chlorella sp. demonstrated adequate performance to be scaled up to outdoor conditions. Although experiments were performed at laboratory conditions, the methodology used in this paper allows a robust evaluation of microalgae strains for potential market applications. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Tall wetland graminoids with rapid growth, high productivity and wide tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses are potentially valuable bioenergy crops, especially when grown in rewetted peat soils for biomass (paludiculture). Using wetland plants as renewable bioenergy crops instead of fossil fuels has the ecological benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improving water quality and conserving peat soils. As these potential crops will grow in peat that differs in nutrient availability, not only will their biomass productivity be affected, but also the biomass quality for bioenergy may be altered. We set up five different nutrient availability treatments in waterlogged peat soil to simulate different nutrient environments for wetland plant cultivation. Seven wetland plants suitable for paludiculture (Typha latifolia, Arundo plinii, Arundo donax and four distinct genotypes of Phragmites australis from Denmark, The Netherlands, Romania and Italy) were selected to test responses of biomass production and tissue quality to different nutrient availability. Due to their high biomass productivity, T. latifolia, A. donax, Dutch (NL) and Romanian (RO) P. australis had the greatest potential to produce bioenergy feedstock. All taxa survived when cultivated with very low nutrient availability, especially NL and RO P. australis and T. latifolia. Moreover, biomass quality was both species-specific and element-specific, affected by increasing nutrient availability. Overall, T. latifolia had the lowest tissue concentrations of S and Si as well as high concentrations of Ca, and therefore the best tissue quality for combustion both at low and high nutrient availability. These results will provide crucial information for choosing appropriate crops and managements and promote the success of culturing wetland plants as bioenergy feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Production of microalgal biomass for feed and fuels demands unsustainable large amounts of fertilizers. The most broadly considered alternative sources of nutrients/fertilizer for microalgae are wastewater and internal recycling in closed-loop production platforms. However, these strategies largely disable co-production of feed and fuel in biomass biorefineries for an increased economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, we aimed at providing proof-of-concept for a semi-closed loop microalgal production-platform and biomass biorefinery for ethanol and feed from renewable resources of N and P. Atmospheric N 2 was assimilated into a N 2 -fixing cyanobacterial biomass, which sustained growth of a microalga that accumulated high levels of carbohydrates (up to 60% (w/w)) as a sole source of fertilizer. The microalgal biomass was efficiently saccharified with H 2 SO 4 , which was recycled to release soluble PO 4 3- from bone meal as a renewable source of P. Fermenting these P-enriched preparations with yeasts quantitatively produced ethanol at theoretical yields, a concentration of up to 50 g ethanol. L −1 and a yield of 0.25 g ethanol. g biomass −1 . Calculations suggested a potential yield from 7600 to 10,800 L ethanol. ha −1 . year −1 , under Buenos Aires environmental conditions, which would be higher than that currently obtained from maize feedstocks. The residual fermentation vinasse, supplemented with P and containing other downstream-process reagents, was recycled as a sole source of macronutrients for the cultivation of the N 2 -fixing cyanobacterium to close the production cycle. Water recycling and co-production of residual biomass enriched in fat and protein as potential feed are also shown. This semi-closed loop biomass production-platform reconciles the concepts of microalgal biomass biorefineries for the co-production of feedstocks for biofuels and feed and nutrients recycling in closed-loop systems that largely minimizes production of waste. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy crops are forecast to play a significant role if Ireland is to reach the 2020 and beyond targets set by the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The aim of this study is to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the cultivation of bioenergy crops in Ireland including land-use change (LUC) emissions by using geographical information systems (GIS) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In this study, GIS is used to identify, and measure LUC changes associated with cultivation of Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow. An LCA study was carried out to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the LUC caused by the cultivation of bioenergy crops. The results find that miscanthus caused 86% of all LUC with SRC Willow accounting for 14%. The LCA results identify two major processes that contribute to total GHG emissions; field operations and loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Land preparation, harvesting and the production of synthetic fertiliser are found to be the most significant contributors to field emissions. SOC emission for the conversion of pasture to SRC willow accounts for a large proportion of the overall GHG emissions. Conversion of arable land to miscanthus and SRC willow both cause a net reduction of GHG emissions. Sensitivity analysis on the type of fertilisers used and the inclusion of indirect land-use changes (iLUC), highlight the impacts that these have on the overall system performance. The replacement of synthetic fertiliser with biogenic fertiliser reduced overall GHG emissions. The inclusion of general iLUC data results in a large increase in total GHG emissions because of displaced food crops that must be grown elsewhere. The study shows that conversion of arable to miscanthus and SRC willow is preferable when cultivating bioenergy crops while conversion of pasture to SRC willow should be avoided. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane is one of the main crops used around the world as a feedstock for the production of sucrose and biofuel. Prior to harvesting, sugarcane dry leaves are burned to facilitate manual cutting and enhance productivity. This practice generates ashes from sugarcane straw (hereafter referred as SCA), which may be carried to aquatic ecosystems, where its impacts on organisms and ecosystem integrity remain unknown. Here, we experimentally tested the toxicity of five different concentrations of SCA (0, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 mg/L) on three native (Astyanax lacustris, Moenkhausia bonita and M. forestii) and two non-native (Oreochromis niloticus and Poecilia reticulata) fish from the Paraná River Basin, Brazil. The toxicity was estimated by calculating the median lethal concentration (LC 50-24h ) and the hepatosomatic index (HSI). We hypothesised that native fish are more sensitive to an increase in SCA than non-native fish. We verified that the mortality of native fish sharply increased with the increase in higher SCA concentration (LC 50-24h values: A. lacustris = 2525.71 mg/L, M. bonita = 2124.95 mg/L and M. forestii = 1981.74 mg/L). However, no deaths were recorded for non-native fish species in any SCA concentrations. Accordingly, the HSI index values statistically differed with the increase in SCA concentrations for native fish, while for non-native fish we did not observe any difference. Therefore, only native species died or suffered liver damage with an increase in SCA concentrations. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, we suggest that sugarcane burning, a widely used agricultural technique, has the potential to reduce the population size of native organisms and facilitate the dominance of non-native fish species in aquatic ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Living organisms need to allocate their limited resources in a manner that optimizes their overall fitness by simultaneously achieving several different biological objectives. Examination of these biological trade-offs can provide invaluable information regarding the biophysical and biochemical bases behind observed cellular phenotypes. A quantitative knowledge of a cell system's critical objectives is also needed for engineering of cellular metabolism, where there is interest in mitigating the fitness costs that may result from human manipulation. Results: To study metabolism in photoheterotrophs, we developed and validated a genome-scale model of metabolism in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile gram-negative purple non-sulfur bacterium capable of growing phototrophically on various carbon sources, including inorganic carbon and aromatic compounds. To quantitatively assess trade-offs among a set of important biological objectives during different metabolic growth modes, we used our new model to conduct an 8-dimensional multi-objective flux analysis of metabolism in R. palustris. Our results revealed that phototrophic metabolism in R. palustris is light-limited under anaerobic conditions, regardless of the available carbon source. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. palustris prioritizes the optimization of carbon efficiency, followed by ATP production and biomass production rate, in a Pareto-optimal manner. To achieve maximum carbon fixation, cells appear to divert limited energy resources away from growth and toward CO 2 fixation, even in the presence of excess reduced carbon. We also found that to achieve the theoretical maximum rate of biomass production, anaerobic metabolism requires import of additional compounds (such as protons) to serve as electron acceptors. Finally, we found that production of hydrogen gas, of potential interest as a candidate biofuel, lowers the cellular growth rates under all circumstances. Conclusions: Photoheterotrophic metabolism of R. palustris is primarily regulated by the amount of light it can absorb and not the availability of carbon. However, despite carbon's secondary role as a regulating factor, R. palustris' metabolism strives for maximum carbon efficiency, even when this increased efficiency leads to slightly lower growth rates. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper proposes a possibilistic programming model in order to design a second-generation biodiesel supply chain network under epistemic uncertainty of input data. The developed model minimizes the total cost of the supply chain from supply centers to the biodiesel and glycerin consumer centers. Waste cooking oil and Jatropha plants, as non-edible feedstocks, are considered for biodiesel production. To cope with the epistemic uncertainty of the parameters, a credibility-based possibilistic programming approach is employed to convert the original possibilistic programming model into a crisp counterpart. An accelerated benders decomposition algorithm using efficient acceleration mechanisms is devised to deal with the computational complexity of solving the proposed model in an efficient manner. The performance of the proposed possibilistic programming model and the efficiency of the developed accelerated benders decomposition algorithm are validated by performing a computational analysis using a real case study in Iran. © 2019

AB  - The rise of palm oil as the world's most consumed vegetable oil has coincided with exponential growth in palm oil research activity. Bibliometric analysis of research outputs reveals a distinct imbalance in the type of research being undertaken, notably a disproportionate focus on biofuel and engineering topics. Recognizing the expansion of oil palm agriculture across the tropics and the increasing awareness of environmental, social, and economic impacts, we seek to reorientate the existing research agenda toward one that addresses the most fundamental and urgent questions defined by the palm oil stakeholder community. Following consultation with 659 stakeholders from 38 countries, including palm oil growers, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and researchers, the highest priority research questions were identified within 13 themes. The resulting 279 questions, including 26 ranked as top priority, reveal a diversity of environmental and social research challenges facing the industry, ranging from the ecological and ecosystem impacts of production, to the livelihoods of plantation workers and smallholder communities. Analysis of the knowledge type produced from these questions underscores a clear need for fundamental science programmes, and studies that involve the consultation of non-academic stakeholders to develop “transformative” solutions to the oil palm sector. Stakeholders were most aligned in their choice of priority questions across the themes of policy and certification related themes, and differed the most in environmental feedback, technology and smallholder related themes. Our recommendations include improved regional academic leadership and coordination, greater engagement with private and public stakeholders in Africa, and Central and South America, and enhanced collaborative efforts with researchers in the major consuming countries of India and China. © Copyright © 2019 Padfield, Hansen, Davies, Ehrensperger, Slade, Evers, Papargyropoulou, Bessou, Abdullah, Page, Ancrenaz, Aplin, Dzulkafli, Barclay, Chellaiah, Choudhary, Conway, Cook, Copeland, Campos-Arceiz, Deere, Drew, Gilvear, Gray, Haller, Hood, Huat, Huynh, Kangayatkarasu, Koh, Kolandai, Lim, Yeong, Lucey, Luke, Mitchell, Montefrio, Mullin, Nainar, Nekaris, Nijman, Nunes, Nurhidayu, O'Reilly, Puan, Ruppert, Salim, Schouten, Tallontire, Smith, Tao, Tham, Varkkey, Wadey, Yule, Azhar, Sayok, Vairappan, Bicknell and Struebig.

AB  - Background: It is important to explore renewable alternatives (e.g. biofuels) that can produce energy sources to help reduce reliance on fossil oils, and reduce greenhouse gases and waste solids resulted from fossil oils consumption. Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop which has received increasing attention due to its short life cycle, broader adaptation regions, high oil content, high level of omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, and low-input requirements in agriculture practices. To expand its Camelina production areas into arid regions, there is a need to breed for new drought-tolerant cultivars. Leaf cuticular wax is known to facilitate plant development and growth under water-limited conditions. Dissecting the genetic loci underlying leaf cuticular waxes is important to breed for cultivars with improved drought tolerance. Results: Here we combined phenotypic data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a spring C. sativa diversity panel using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology, to perform a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) on leaf wax compositions. A total of 42 SNP markers were significantly associated with 15 leaf wax traits including major wax components such as total primary alcohols, total alkanes, and total wax esters as well as their constituents. The vast majority of significant SNPs were associated with long-chain carbon monomers (carbon chain length longer than C28), indicating the important effects of long-chain carbon monomers on leaf total wax biosynthesis. These SNP markers are located on genes directly or indirectly related to wax biosynthesis such as maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology and enabling normal wax secretion from ER to plasma membrane or Golgi network-mediated transport. Conclusions: These loci could potentially serve as candidates for the genetic control involved in intracellular wax transport that might directly or indirectly facilitate leaf wax accumulation in C. sativa and can be used in future marker-assisted selection (MAS) to breed for the cultivars with high wax content to improve drought tolerance. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) covers vast areas of land (around 25 million ha worldwide), and its processing is already linked into infrastructure for producing bioethanol in many countries. This makes it an ideal candidate for improving composition of its residues (mostly cell walls), making them more suitable for cellulosic ethanol production. In this paper, we report an approach to improving saccharification of sugarcane straw by RNAi silencing of the recently discovered BAHD01 gene responsible for feruloylation of grass cell walls. Results: We identified six BAHD genes in the sugarcane genome (SacBAHDs) and generated five lines with substantially decreased SacBAHD01 expression. To find optimal conditions for determining saccharification of sugarcane straw, we tried multiple combinations of solvent and temperature pretreatment conditions, devising a predictive model for finding their effects on glucose release. Under optimal conditions, demonstrated by Organosolv pretreatment using 30% ethanol for 240 min, transgenic lines showed increases in saccharification efficiency of up to 24%. The three lines with improved saccharification efficiency had lower cell-wall ferulate content but unchanged monosaccharide and lignin compositions. Conclusions: The silencing of SacBAHD01 gene and subsequent decrease of cell-wall ferulate contents indicate a promising novel biotechnological approach for improving the suitability of sugarcane residues for cellulosic ethanol production. In addition, the Organosolv pretreatment of the genetically modified biomass and the optimal conditions for the enzymatic hydrolysis presented here might be incorporated in the sugarcane industry for bioethanol production. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The accident at Fukushima 1 Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 caused contamination by radioactive cesium (134Cs and 137Cs) in surrounding areas. After this accident, concerns about Cs contamination, including food safety, have limited industrial activities and reconstruction in Fukushima. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an annual C4 crop that can be used as biofuel feedstock due to its high biomass. Use of Cs-contaminated fields to produce biofuel feedstock would be more acceptable than use for food or feed crops due to the lower risk of human internal exposure to radioactive Cs. In addition, high-biomass sorghum might be suitable for removal of Cs from fields (phytoremediation). For both applications, it is important to use accessions showing the appropriate level of accumulation of radioactive Cs (low for biofuel feedstock, high for phytoremediation). Here, we examined the accumulation of radioactive Cs in the aerial parts of 56 sorghum accessions grown in Fukushima. Accessions were cultivated in a low-level-contaminated field in 2011 and in a highly contaminated field in a planned evacuation zone in 2012. After cultivation, activity concentrations from 134Cs and 137Cs were measured in the aerial plant parts. In 2011, the activity concentrations of 134Cs and 137Cs were 58.2–350 and 58.6–450 Bq kg−1 dry weight, respectively. In 2012, the concentrations of 134Cs and 137Cs were 54.2–1320 and 57.1–1960 Bq kg−1 dry weight, respectively. Relative to the median values of the accessions grown each year, 3 showed lower activity concentrations and 2 showed higher activity concentrations of radioactive Cs under both cultivation conditions. In contrast to a previous report, there was no significant correlation between biomass and Cs activity concentration. Because both biomass and Cs concentration are important in classifying accessions for use in phytoremediation, we also calculated the Cs accumulation index (single-plant biomass × Cs activity concentration) for each accession. The accession AKLMOI WHITE showed the highest values in both years, suggesting that this accession has the high per-plant accumulation capacity for radioactive Cs. Our data collected from actual contaminated fields is irreplaceable for choosing sorghum accessions for cultivation in Cs-polluted sites such as Fukushima. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

AB  - Every year billions of tons of fish waste are produced by fish processing units. These wastes when dumped into the environment cause emissions which in turn degrade the land. An alternative solution for the problem involves their processing into biofuel, pharmacological components, fertilizer and fodder. Biofuel is a trending concept and an alternative for present day fuels. Biofuels are pollution free and thus are advantageous over current fuels. Biofuels are produced from organic waste, seaweed, and micro-algae. The current research on fish wastes for the production of biodiesel is mainly because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Biodiesel produces less air toxins, CO2, hydrocarbons and other particulates when compared to the standard fuel or diesel. The conversion process involves extraction of fish oil from the waste of the fishing industry. The oil is cleaned and purified. With the addition of a catalyst, biodiesel and bio-gas are produced by transesterification and anaerobic digestion respectively. Various results such as Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) analysis, and best management practices (BMP) assay show the efficient conversion and working of biofuels. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Downregulation of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and related biochemical pathways has been used as a strategy to improve biofuel production. Plant C1 metabolism provides the methyl units used for the methylation reactions carried out by two methyltransferases in the lignin biosynthetic pathway: caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT). Mutations in these genes resulted in lower lignin levels and altered lignin compositions. Reduced lignin levels can also be achieved by mutations in the C1 pathway gene, folylpolyglutamate synthetase1 (FPGS1), in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons, indicating a link between the C1 and lignin biosynthetic pathways. To test if lignin content can be further reduced by combining genetic mutations in C1 metabolism and the lignin biosynthetic pathway, fpgs1ccoaomt1 double mutants were generated and functionally characterized. Results: Double fpgs1ccoaomt1 mutants had lower thioacidolysis lignin monomer yield and acetyl bromide lignin content than the ccoaomt1 or fpgs1 mutants and the plants themselves displayed no obvious long-term negative growth phenotypes. Moreover, extracts from the double mutants had dramatically improved enzymatic polysaccharide hydrolysis efficiencies than the single mutants: 15.1% and 20.7% higher than ccoaomt1 and fpgs1, respectively. The reduced lignin and improved sugar release of fpgs1ccoaomt1 was coupled with changes in cell-wall composition, metabolite profiles, and changes in expression of genes involved in cell-wall and lignin biosynthesis. Conclusion: Our observations demonstrate that additional reduction in lignin content and improved sugar release can be achieved by simultaneous downregulation of a gene in the C1 (FPGS1) and lignin biosynthetic (CCOAOMT) pathways. These improvements in sugar accessibility were achieved without introducing unwanted long-term plant growth and developmental defects. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Poplar (Populus spp.) hybridization is key to advancing biomass yields and conversion efficiency. Once superior varieties are selected, there is a lag in commercial use while they are multiplied to scale. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of gains in biomass yield and quality on investment in rapid propagation techniques that speed the time to commercial deployment. Material and Methods: A factorial experiment of propagation method and hybrid variety was conducted to quantify the scale-up rate of in vitro and greenhouse clonal multiplication. These data were used in modeling the internal rate of return (IRR) on investment into rapid propagation as a function of genetic gains in biomass yield and quality and compared to a base case that assumed the standard method of supplying operational varieties in commercial quantities from nurseries as hardwood cuttings, capable of yields of 16.5 Mg ha-1 year-1. Results: Analysis of variance in macro-cutting yield showed that propagation method and varietal effects as well as their interaction were highly significant, with hedge propagation exceeding serial propagation in macro-cutting productivity by a factor of nearly 1.8. The Populus deltoides × P. maximowiczii and the Populus trichocarpa × P. maximowiczii varieties greatly exceeded the multiplication rate of the P. × generosa varieties due to their exceptional response to repeated hedging required to initiate multiple tracks of serial propagation. Analyses of investment into rapid propagation to introduce new material into plantation establishment followed by a 20-year rotation of six coppice harvests showed that gains in biomass yield and quality are warranted for a commitment to rapid propagation systems. The base case analysis was generally favored at yields up to 18 Mg-1 year-1 dependent on pricing. The rapid multiplication analysis proved superior to the base case analysis at the two highest yield levels (27.0 and 31.5 Mg ha-1 year-1,) at all price levels and at yields of 22.5 Mg-1 year-1, dependent on price and farm location. Conclusion: Rapid multiplication is a reliable method to move improved plant material directly into operations when valued appropriately in the marketplace. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used cell factory for the production of fuels and chemicals, in particular ethanol, a biofuel produced in large quantities. With a need for high-energy-density fuels for jets and heavy trucks, there is, however, much interest in the biobased production of hydrocarbons that can be derived from fatty acids. Fatty acids also serve as precursors to a number of oleochemicals and hence provide interesting platform chemicals. Here, we review the recent strategies applied to metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for the production of fatty acid-derived biofuels and for improvement of the titre, rate and yield (TRY). This includes, for instance, redirection of the flux towards fatty acids through engineering of the central carbon metabolism, balancing the redox power and varying the chain length of fatty acids by enzyme engineering. We also discuss the challenges that currently hinder further TRY improvements and the potential solutions in order to meet the requirements for commercial application. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris produces methane (CH4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) from protons (H+) when it expresses a variant form of molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase that has two amino acid substitutions near its active site. We examined the influence of light energy and electron availability on in vivo production of these biofuels. Nitrogenase activity requires large amounts of ATP, and cells exposed to increasing light intensities produced increasing amounts of CH4 and H2. As expected for a phototroph, intracellular ATP increased with increasing light intensity, but there was only a loose correlation between ATP content and CH4 and H2 production. There was a much stronger correlation between decreased intracellular ADP and increased gas production with increased light intensity, suggesting that the rate-limiting step for CH4 and H2 production by R. palustris is inhibition of nitrogenase by ADP. Increasing the amounts of electrons available to nitrogenase by providing cells with organic alcohols, using nongrowing cells, blocking electrons from entering the Calvin cycle, or blocking H2 uptake resulted in higher yields of H2 and, in some cases, CH4. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the constraints on nitrogenase-based production of biofuels. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Background: The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) gradually increased along with the rapid development of modern cities. A large amount of landfill leachate are generated with excessive chemical oxygen demand (COD), which create a great deal of pressure on the environment-friendly treatment process. Anaerobic digestion is an ideal technique to solve the above problem. Results: A thermophilic granular sludge was successfully adapted for anaerobic digestion of MSW leachate (from an aging large-scale landfill) for methane production. The COD degradation efficiency improved by 81.8%, while the methane production rate reached 117.3 mL CH4/(g VS d), which was 2.34-fold more than the control condition. The bacterial and archaeal communities involved in the process were revealed by 16S rRNA gene high-throughput pyrosequencing. The richness of the bacterial community decreased in the process of thermophilic granular sludge, while the archaeal community structure presented a reverse phenomenon. The bacterial genus, Methanosaeta was the most abundant during the mesophilic process, while Methanobacterium, Methanoculleus, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina were more evenly distributed. The more balanced community distribution between hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens implied a closer interaction between the microbes, which further contributed to higher methane productivity. The detailed relationship between the key functional communities and anaerobic digestion performances were demonstrated via the multivariate canonical correspondence analysis. Conclusions: With the assistance of adaptive thermophilic granular sludge, microbial community structure was more evenly distributed, while both of COD degradation rate and methane production was improved during anaerobic digestion of MSW landfill leachate.

AB  - Promising growing conditions and favorable renewable energy policies make the western U.S. a potentially suitable region for dedicated woody biomass (DWB) plantations for energy generation. To support the regional development of biomass and biofuels markets, the USDA awarded an AFRI grant to the Advanced Hardwood Biofuels (AHB) Northwest project. As part of the AHB project, GreenWood Resources (“GWR”) - a globally diversified timberland investment management company with over 20 years of specialized experience in high-yield, intensive plantation management - installed and managed hybrid poplar DWB plantations at four demonstration sites: Clarksburg, CA; Hayden, ID; Jefferson, OR; and Pilchuck, WA. GWR developed a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) investment model based on the AHB project results and plantation management experience across this range of growing and market conditions. The model estimates financial returns and tests the sensitivity of returns to changes in key variables. These results inform directions for future research and challenges for commercial production of DWB. Results indicate that current market pricing for forest biomass in the western U.S. - approximately USD 46/BDMT - produces negative financial returns from DWB plantation investment on all four sites. To produce positive returns at all four sites requires biomass assumptions that are well above the current market (USD 121/BDMT). With this price assumption, plantation investment returns average 8.62% in real, inflation-adjusted terms across all sites, but this biomass price level may make conversion into transportation fuels uneconomic under current fuel prices and policies. Financial returns to DWB investments are most sensitive to changes in price, yield, and land costs. Given current economic conditions and plantation technology, the development of a large-scale DWB plantation base in the western U.S. is unlikely to attract private sector capital without some combination of a material increase in the biomass price, strong policy support, or a dramatic improvement in plantation yields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) represents a promising alternative to silage maize as an energy crop for biogas production. This non-food plant possesses a highly ecological value due to its long blooming period, ability to grow in low-input agriculture and positive influence on soil structure. So far, there have been almost no breeding attempts for the cup plant, and all field experiments showing its high biomass yield were conducted by using only a few cultivated populations of unclear ancestry. Comprehensive assessment of five such populations for their biomass and methane yield parameters revealed substantial genetic variations indicating the possibility of improving these traits through selection and breeding. Higher biomass yield is likely to be achieved by breeding for secondary traits such as plant height, shoot diameter and internode number as well as photoperiod response. For increasing the methane production, reduced lignin or fibre content in the biomass seems to be important. Genetic relationships among the populations were estimated using tunable genotyping by sequencing (tGBS) technology. Genetic structure and phylogeny analyses revealed that all the plants belong to the same gene pool and share a common ancestry. Four out of five populations demonstrate a low genetic differentiation, whereas the fifth one represents a clear example of population stratification. To achieve a successful domestication and breeding of this new high-yielding perennial crop, a broader base of genetic diversity needs to be ensured and complemented by innovative breeding strategies driven by molecular genetic and modern genomics approaches. © 2019

AB  - This study was designed to identify the most potent N 2 -fixing and biofuel producing Bacillus species. Four isolates were selected as the most efficient N 2 -fixing organisms which confirmed by nifH gene expression. These isolates were identified genetically by 16S rRNA as Bacillus thuringensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus licheniformis. The highest biohydrogen production was 2450 and 2300 ml/L from 6% sugarcane molasses by B. thuringensis and B. subtilis respectively. Nitrogenase activity of B. thuringensis and B. subtilis were 1.4 and 1.3 μmol C 2 H 4 min −1 mg protein −1 at 6% molasses. Ethanol production was 1.55 and 1.03 g/L, while butyric acid was 10.39 and 5.9 g/L at 6% molasses by B. thuringensis and B. subtilis at 6% molasses, respectively. Acetic acid formation was 1.1 and 0.55, lactic acid was 0.07 and 0.05, while butyric acid was 10.39 and 5.9 g/L at 6% molasses by B. thuringensis and B. subtilis, respectively. Spent bacterial biomass of the two Bacillus species were reused as a biofertilizer for enhancing the growth of sunflower and corn plants. Inoculation of sunflower and corn seeds with B thuringensis and B subtilis significantly increased dry weight, total protein, total carbohydrates and pigment contents over control plants. This enhancement could be attributed to the efficiency of biological N 2 -fixation due to nitrogenase activity of the tested Bacillus species. These results suggest that the possibility of interlinking biofuel technology with biofertilizer production by reusing N 2 -fixing spent bacterial biomass of Bacillus could be increase the economic feasibility of the bioenergy production from molasses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology for the conversion of wet biomass into liquid fuels. In this study, the hydrothermal co-liquefaction (HTCL) of Spirulina platensis and α-Cellulose for bio-oil production was investigated. The bio-oil yield of HTCL was increased significantly by blending α-Cellulose with low-lipid content microalgae of Spirulina platensis in the absence of any catalysts supplementary which reduces the processing cost. The results showed that bio-oil productivity was increased drastically up to 40.33 wt % (28.53 wt % with pure Spirulina platensis and 14.47 wt % with pure α-Cellulose), with a positive synergistic effect (SE) of 16 wt % during the HTCL process. The composition of synthesized bio-oil was analyzed by GC-MS which revealed that HTCL of Spirulina platensis and α-Cellulose are to decrease of its heterocyclic compounds, increased esters and hydrocarbons contents than HTL of pure Spirulina platensis or α-Cellulose. The possible reaction pathways were derived by synthesized bio-oil composition. The maximum energy recovery rate 82% was obtained on HTCL process. The study concluded that, HTCL process is more favorable for the economic concern due to high convention of bio-oil efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research has focused on the production of biofuel from different bio-resources, especially non-edible and underutilized plants. In this study, total lipid contents and fatty acids composition were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for twelve abundant halophytes to ascertain their potential as feedstock for renewable energy. Non-succulent halophytes contained the highest total lipid content (about 5–7%, except Porteresia coarctata), followed by shrubby (about 2.6%) and succulent halophytes (1–1.8%). The FA profile shows that halophytes are a rich source of alpha-linolenic, linolenic and palmitic acids. Oleic and stearic acids were also detected in some halophytes. A low content of MUFA (except P. coarctata) was detected in all the halophytes, but the maximum content of SFA was estimated in Salicornia brachiata, Suaeda fruticosa, and P. coarctata. Halophyte Sporobolus virginicus contained more than 80% PUFA, followed by Heleochloa setulosa, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Atriplex griffithii and Salvadora persica. An important qualitative indicator density was found to be at par with recommended standards, but the cetane number of S. fruticosa and S. brachiata also matched the standards. The overall fatty acid profile of the selected halophytes makes them suitable for biofuel, and their potential could be enriched by improving agronomical practices and downstream processing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is one of the most common metal pollutants and has thus attracted considerable attention. In this study, we investigated the potential use of biogas solid residue (BSR) from anaerobic digestion as an effective amendment to decrease the bioavailability of Cr in Cr(VI)-polluted soil using pot experiments. Compared to the no-addition treatment, the addition of BSR (treatments—50, 100, and 150 g kg−1 soil) increased the soil nutrient levels, microbial diversity and activities, and decreased the redox potential (Eh). BSR treatment of Cr(VI)-contaminated soil caused a reduction in soil Cr(VI) concentration (16.6–52.1%) and the exchangeable Cr proportion (15.2–52.4%), thereby decreasing the available Cr for uptake by plants. BSR treatments resulted in a reduction in the Cr contents of the roots and aboveground biomass of pakchoi plants. The Cr(VI) content in treated soils decreased with increasing BSR addition, with 150 g kg−1 being the most efficient application. The relative abundance of Cr-reducing groups, such as Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, and Bacillus, increased with the increase in BSR application. The enhancement of soil Cr(VI) immobilization by the addition of the BSR was mostly attributed to the simultaneous effect of organic matter addition, stimulation of microorganisms, and reduced Eh value. Organic matter contributed more to the variation in Cr. The presence of BSR decreased the bioavailability of Cr in the soil and, therefore, lowered the potential mobilization of Cr(VI) from the soils. Our results demonstrated that BSR application may offer a potentially promising solution for enhancing agricultural production in Cr-contaminated soils. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.

AB  - Food price and land use data over an extended time period have been examined to identify possible correlations between biofuel production and food price or land use changes. We compared the food price index before and after the biofuel boom in the 2000s to evaluate biofuel's impact on the inflation rate. We found that the U.S. food price inflation rate since 1973 could be divided into three distinct regions. The inflation rate was lowest at 2.6% during 1991–2016, which encompasses the biofuel boom. Among many factors, continuously rising food production per capita was identified as the likely cause of low food price inflation during this period. The US exports of corn have not declined since the 1990s and soybean exports are rising at a steady rate. Among several variables tested as a cause of food price index increase, crude oil price had the highest correlation. We also manually verified the automated land use classification of satellite image covering 664 km2 in three selected areas in the US. We found that 10.90% of non-agricultural land was misclassified as agriculture, whereas only 2.23% of agricultural land was misclassified as non-agricultural. The automated classification showed an 8.53% increase in agricultural land from 2011 to 2015, while the manual classification showed only 0.31% (±1.92%) increase. This result was within the margin of error alluding to no significant land use change. We concluded that automated satellite image land use classification should be verified more rigorously to be used for land use change analysis. © 2019

AB  - Phytoremediation represents a solution for treating soils contaminated by heavy metals, provided that appropriate plant species are selected and the proper strategy chosen. When dealing with soil contaminated with arsenic and/or lead, which are non-essential elements for plants but also among the most toxic metals, this task is particularly difficult to achieve. In a previous contribution we showed that metals accumulation by Lupinus albus, Brassica juncea and Helianthus annuus can be improved by dosing suitable chemicals (i.e. phosphate and EDTA), leading to a quicker and cheaper intervention. This study discusses the assisted phytoremediation of a real site contaminated by several metals, presenting an environmental assessment realized by using the GaBi LCA software. The environmental sustainability of the reclamation technology was analyzed in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP-100 years), considering different destinations for the harvested biomass, and comparing its ecological footprint with the outcomes of a conventional treatment of excavation and landfill disposal. The comparison clearly shows the great advantage of the phytoremediation, in terms of environmental impact, highlighting the importance of correctly handling the disposal of contaminated biomass produced. In fact, its incineration (aimed at reducing the volumes to be disposed of) could be more onerous than a direct landfilling, but re-qualify as a more sustainable choice if combined with energy recovery. The same applies to fast pyrolysis, which seems to be the most sustainable approach to date, at least in terms of technological maturity, although this requires technical-economic considerations on the quality and use of biofuels produced. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is one of the most successful waste management strategies worldwide, wherein microorganisms play an essential role in reducing organic pollutants and producing renewable energy. However, variations of microbial community in full-scale anaerobic digesters, particularly functional groups relevant to biogas production, remain elusive. Here, we examined microbial community in a year-long monthly time series of 3 full-scale anaerobic digesters. We observed substantial diversification in community composition, with only a few abundant OTUs (e.g. Clostridiales, Anaerolineaceae and Methanosaeta) persistently present across different samples. Similarly, there were high variations in relative abundance of methanogenic archaea and methanogenic genes, which were positively correlated (r2 = 0.530, P &lt; 0.001). Variations of methanogens explained 55.7% of biogas producing rates, much higher than the explanatory percentage of environmental parameters (16.4%). Hydrogenotrophic methanogens, especially abundant Methanomicrobiales taxa, were correlated with biogas production performance (r = 0.665, P &lt; 0.001) and nearly all methanogenic genes (0.430 &lt; r &lt; 0.735, P &lt; 0.012). Given that methanogenic archaea or genes are well established for methanogenesis, we conclude that high variations in methanogenic traits (e.g. taxa or genes) are responsible for biogas production variations in full-scale anaerobic digesters. © 2019

AB  - A geographic information system model was built to identify the areas in Mexico with high potential for microalgae production. The input data was obtained from diverse national and international sources. The model was constructed using multiple criteria for facility siting, including the following land characteristics and resources: land use, topographic slope, temperature, evaporation, solar radiation, vegetation, water and CO 2 sources, wastewater treatment plants, rivers and lakes, cities and roads, natural protected areas, historical sites, Ramsar sites, airport locations and geological faults. Various models were constructed by assigning weights according to suitability to the data layers. Suitable areas for microalgae production were identified in up to 26.8% of the country, equivalent to 526,672 km 2 . Specifically, the states of Jalisco, Oaxaca and Veracruz had the largest areas suitable for microalgae cultivation, with a potential production of around 9 million Tonnes yr −1 of dry biomass, representing the feasibility of microalgae production in the country. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global palm oil production has greatly increased in recent years with the adoption of renewable energy policies by the E.U. and U.S.A. and growing demand for its use in food, biodiesel, and other commodities. Indonesia, the world's largest oil palm producer, has leased large tracts of forested and tribal lands as new concessions, thereby expanding oil palm plantations. While previous studies have focused on some of the important social and environmental consequences of this process, the full suite of potential environmental impacts from land conversion and cultivation remains poorly understood. Here we quantify these impacts in terms of forest loss and fragmentation, CO2 emissions from land use change, and freshwater pollution from fertilizer application. Within all concession types, forest cover decreased by 20% and forest fragmentation increased by 44%, both of which are significantly higher than in comparable non-concession areas. We also assess to what extent CO2 emissions and freshwater pollution are attributable to increasing palm oil demand abroad. We find that four-fifths of Indonesia's palm oil production is for export markets and that 66% of this is destined for just eight countries – India, China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Italy, Egypt, Bangladesh, and the United Kingdom. Examining these multiple impacts highlights the importance of remote policies and consumption patterns in dictating local production decisions in a telecoupled world. This work demonstrates that - in order to be truly sustainable - bioenergy initiatives must ensure that adverse environmental impacts (and the demands that drive them) are reduced globally and not simply displaced elsewhere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is responsible for 25% of the primary energy supply in Brazil. However, future biomass demand will be influenced by many factors. This study evaluates potential pathways for the utilization of biomass in Brazil until 2050, while considering novel biobased sectors (renewable jet fuel and biochemicals), resource competition, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Whereas other least-cost optimization models assess biobased options to meet energy and chemicals demand in Brazil to a limited extent, this study provides a detailed breakdown of biomass feedstock, including an extensive portfolio of biomass conversion technologies. A least-cost optimization model is used to assess the demand for energy and chemicals, and the competition between biomass and other climate-mitigation measures such as renewable power generation technologies, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy efficiency. Varied over the three scenarios, 86–96% of the sustainable biomass supply potential is used. Under more stringent mitigation targets, novel biomass conversion technologies start to play an important role: Biobased electricity production with CCS, jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass, and chemicals are partly produced from ethanol and bio-naphtha. The modeling framework provides a transparent view of which type of biomass can be used for which specific purpose. It is therefore an interesting tool for future research, for example to examine the dynamic interaction with demand for land. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its potential commercial value. Algae converts CO 2 , nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T biomass would require 17–20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45–56 ha at Medicine Hat, AB, 57–68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71–80 ha at Great Slave Lake, NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs), techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and can assist with algae production platform optimization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dedicated bioenergy crops, such as perennial grass and short rotation trees, qualify as cellulosic biofuel feedstocks to meet the requirements for advanced biofuel according to the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard. The utilization of dedicated energy crops for cellulosic biofuels is still in the early stage, at pilot scale, and the existing cellulosic biorefineries are yet to be commercialized. This study develops an agent-based model to simulate the spatial diffusion of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) adoption in Indiana cropland from 2015 to 2027 under various biofuel market scenarios. Results indicate that it would be economically viable to produce 1.1 billion gallons (4.2 billion liters) cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass annually in Indiana until 2023, given an average annual farm-gate price of $123.93 t −1 for the feedstock. This study also finds that the high productivity of switchgrass can increase the adoption rates of farmers and secure a stable feedstock supply. It also reveals that the high equipment costs required for scaling up production capacity and the high variable operating cost of cellulosic biofuel production will inhibit the viability of commercializing cellulosic biofuels with a stable supply of feedstock. Financial incentives for cellulosic biofuel production have a significant impact on promoting the adoption of dedicated energy crops in Indiana. This paper provides useful insights for biorefinery development and policy making to facilitate the commercialization of cellulosic biofuels by explaining the effects of the decisions of farmers on the adoption of dedicated energy crops. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In this study, mechanical pretreatment was applied to six different lignocelluloses in two different treatment phases and the prediction of their methane yield was done from biomass chemical composition. Physicochemical, proximate and microbial analyses were carried out on both pretreated and untreated biomass using standard methods. Mechanical pretreatments caused the breakdown of structural materials in all the used biomass which was characterized by reduction of the lagging time during anaerobic digestion and the subsequent increase in methane yield up to 22%. The different loading rate of biomass had no effect on the overall methane yield increase. Both single and multiple linear regressions models were used in order to correlate the chemical composition of the biomass with their methane potentials and a fairly high correlation (R2 = 0.63) was obtained. The study also showed that the pretreatments are economically feasible. Therefore, its further application to other biomass is encouraged. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the linkages between energy price and food prices over the period 2000–2016 by using a Panel-VAR model in the case of eight Asian economies. Our results confirm that energy price (oil price) has a significant impact on food prices. According to the results of impulse response functions, agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. Our results show that there is a linkage between energy and food security through price volatility. Since inflation in oil price is harmful for food security, it would be necessary to diversify the energy consumption in this sector, from too much reliance on fossil fuels to an optimal combination of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources that will be in favor of not only the energy security by also the food security. In addition, the paper found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2% of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) was integrated into conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) system (i.e. MEC-AD) to electrochemically regulate the co-fermentation of food waste (FW) and sewage sludge (SS). Two anaerobic systems (i.e. MEC-AD, and single AD) were operated in parallel to explore the potential stimulation of electrical regulation in metabolic behaviors of FW and SS and subsequent biomethane production. The highest accumulative methane yield was achieved at an applied voltage of 0.4 V and the FW and SS ratio of 0.2:0.8, increasing by 2.8-fold than those in AD. The combined MEC-AD system mitigated N2O emission and considerably improved ammonia removal and the dewaterability of digestate, in contrast to AD. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) visualized the presence of a large number of rod-like and cocci-like electroactive microbes on the electrode surface. Electrical regulation stimulated the self-growth and proliferation of typical Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta, accordingly contributing to biomethane production greatly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Organic compounds such as methanol are widely used for enhancing denitrification at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to meet effluent water quality permits. On the other hand, methane, which is the main feedstock for industrial methanol production, is also generated during anaerobic digestion in WWTPs, but is often flared to mitigate its greenhouse impacts. The overarching goal herein was to develop a novel continuous process for methanol production from methane using nitrifying activated sludge. The maximum AOB specific methanol production rate using hydroxylamine as electron donor was 1.61 ± 0.15 and 1.27 ± 0.15 mg-COD-CH3OH/(mg-COD-AOB*d), for hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 7.5 h and 2 h, respectively. The corresponding production rate using ammonia as electron donor was 0.31 ± 0.08 mg-COD-CH3OH/(mg-COD-AOB*d) at a HRT of 2 h. These results show that nitrifier-mediated methanol production in a continuous-flow system can enhance the efficiency of WWTPs through internal production of biomethanol for denitrification, while simultaneously minimizing wasteful biogas flaring. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Brazil, in its intended nationally determined contribution protocol on the Paris Agreement, set to enhancement the usage of energy from sugarcane. To sustainably meet this goal, the Brazilian government rely on the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning (SAZ). The SAZ, based on soil, climate, and land use conditions, defines as suitable 63 million hectares (Mha). Such an area would suffice the future demand for sugarcane. However, climate change impacts on the climate conditions necessary to grow sugarcane may promote a mismatch between the SAZ and future suitability. Our goal is to examine the effects of climate change on the SAZ policy. We developed ecological niche models to identify the suitability criteria and generate scenarios under 17 global climate models listed in the IPCC 5 for 2050. An ensemble of the 17 scenarios identifies areas of estimation congruence thus indicating smaller uncertainty regarding the suitability of these areas. Areas of high congruence (above 70% of prediction) encompass 1.53 Mha by 2050, a reduction of 97.5% compared to SAZ. Including areas of high congruence outside of the SAZ increases the suitable area to 7 Mha. The public and private sector in Brazil needs to develop large-scale adaptation strategies such as improving the research cycle of sugarcane varieties and reducing yield gaps by advancing the management of sugarcane fields to propel Brazil into fulfilling its Paris Agreement commitment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current biofuels for diesel engines are largely derived from food crops and there is significant concern, recognised by legislation, that such fuels do not result in net reductions of greenhouse gas emissions when considering the entirety of the production to usage lifecycle. A potential alternative approach is to utilise the lipid content of organic waste streams arising from food crop cultivation for the manufacture of sustainable diesel fuels. This paper therefore presents experimental studies carried out on a modern direct injection diesel engine supplied with a biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) produced from waste date pits to determine the combustion and emissions characteristics of an alternative fuel produced from a food residue. Date pit methyl esters were tested relative to both rapeseed and soybean methyl esters, unblended and as blends with a reference fossil diesel, alongside reference fossil diesel and a commercially available fossil diesel from Oman, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. Gas chromatograph analysis of the methyl esters fatty acid composition found a significantly shorter mean alkyl moiety chain length and lower number of double bonds in the case of the date pit esters than either the rapeseed or soybean biodiesel. All of the methyl esters exhibited a similar duration of ignition delay less than that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but with a higher premixed burn fraction and peak heat release rate in the case of date pit methyl esters relative to those of rapeseed and soybean. Exhaust emissions of NOx were found to be lowest for the unblended date pit methyl esters, suggesting a greater influence of adiabatic flame temperature on rates of thermal NOx production than global in-cylinder temperatures in the case of the unblended methyl esters. Relative to the reference fossil diesel and Oman diesel, all of the methyl esters tested resulted in low particulate matter emissions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) can be used as an energy source to reduce fossil fuel consumption; however, WCO has high viscosity which restricts direct use in diesel engines. Emulsification techniques can be employed for fuel preparation by selecting suitable surfactants and WCO, diesel and butanol or ethanol ratios using a pseudo-ternary phase diagram. Results indicated that a WCO-diesel fuel blend (WDF) with butanol required no surfactants for homogeneous phase blending compared to WDF with ethanol. Phase behavior of WDF-ethanol blends with hydrophobic surfactants was more suitable than WDF-ethanol blends with more hydrophilic surfactants. Kinematic viscosity of WDF blends depended on the amount of surfactant and its hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) value. WCO content was determined as a significant factor contributing to WDF viscosity (p < 0.05). Biofuel blends containing 70% v/v diesel fuel, 15–20% v/v WCO, and 15–20% v/v ethanol with Dehydol LS1 or Span 80 at ethanol:surfactant ratio of 9:1 were selected for further analysis of relevant fuel properties. All selected WDFs gave emulsion droplet size at 200 nm or less. Other properties such as water content, carbon residue and copper strip corrosion met values specified by diesel and biodiesel fuel standards. Acid value of WDFs exceeded the standard due to high acid content of WCO. WDFs with ethanol/surfactants showed higher oxidative stabilities than WDFs with butanol. In terms of safety, conditions for storage and transport should be applied for WDFs because of their low flash point. WDFs obtained by this technique may be used in unmodified diesel engines but engine performance should be monitored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The traditional method of biodiesel production is based on the transesterification of triglycerides using an alkaline catalyst dissolved in methanol. The aim of this study was to replace a homogeneous alkaline catalyst with a heterogeneous catalyst on the carbon support. The use of a carbon enables the catalyst to be reusable in the production process, eliminates the formation of soaps and increases the glycerol purity. Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from the transesterification of corn oil using KOH supported on activated carbon (KOH/AC). The effect of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction time and catalyst amount were used to optimize the transesterification reaction. The optimum condition for waste corn oil transesterification to methyl ester was obtained below 0.75 wt.% catalyst amount. The yield was up to 92 wt.% at 62.5 °C, 1 h reaction time and 3:1 methanol-to-oil ratio. This study demonstrated that the transesterification of the waste corn oil using methanol can be effectively catalyzed by the developed catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Palm oil is considered as the primary source of income for many farmers in Southeast Asia and become a very important agricultural commodity for the Malaysian economy in recent years. Besides its main usage as cooking oil, it is also exported to be used in many commercial foods and personal care products, as well as biofuels productions (Wong et al. Pertanika Journal of Scholarly Research Reviews 1:33–39, 2015). Over the years, the agricultural sector, especially the livestock and dairy sectors in particular, has been increasingly criticized for their environmental as well as social impacts (Revéret et al. 2015). However, while the products of the agricultural sector contributed significantly to the economic mainstay, the social aspects of it especially those associated with the workers, communities, and environment are equally important and often neglected. The purpose of this research is to identify potential social impacts (implications on workers and local community) throughout the whole life cycle of palm oil production using the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) methodology. Methods: The methodology of this study consisted of several steps in the framework of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study. The steps involved were goal and scope definition, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis, Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), and interpretation. Descriptive analyses that involved the social impact associated with the operation of palm oil mill, local community, and workers were used. In order to acquire information from these stakeholders, two sets of questionnaires were constructed based on the subcategories proposed by UNEP (2009). Results and discussion: The results on social aspects showed that the workers exhibited high value of satisfaction regarding social benefits conferred upon them such as annual leave, panel clinic, Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Social Security Organization (SOCSO) scheme, and public holidays. Meanwhile, the satisfaction level of the local community is different according to specific categories. For instance, a small percentage of satisfaction exists among the local community regarding the palm oil industry especially in heritage and cultural conservation. Conclusions: Findings from the S-LCA analysis are positive as palm oil production still met the required criteria in terms of social significance to those who are in direct contact with this operation especially the workers and local community. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Due to efforts to reduce dependence on limited fossil energy reserves and increasing GHG emissions related to fossil fuel extraction and use in transportation vehicles, renewable fuel use is growing rapidly. By adding renewable oxygenated fuel additives such as oxymethylene ether (OME) to conventional diesel, combustion GHG emissions can be reduced significantly without modifications to vehicle engines. However, life cycle sustainability assessments (LCSA) of OME production and its use with diesel are scarce. The objective of this paper is to develop an LCSA model of OME production from forest biomass to be used in vehicles as a diesel additive. Methods: This study conducts an LCSA of OME production from two types of forest biomass as feedstock, whole tree and forest residue. A framework was developed to assess environmental, economic, and social impacts of unit operations along the life cycle for a functional unit of 1 MJ of heat produced from OME. Then, PROMITHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluation) was used to rank and select the best sustainable pathway for OME production and the most sustainable OME-diesel blend based on a number of indicators. Results and discussion: Based on the sustainability assessments results, the forest residue pathway is found to be more sustainable than the whole tree pathway. In addition, the environmental, economic, and social impact results for different OME-diesel blends show that a blend of 10% OME in 90% diesel is the most sustainable fuel mix. Assuming that the GHG emissions from biofuel combustion are offset by CO2 sequestered during plant growth, the biomass production operation contributes the highest global GHG emissions in the OME life cycle; this is due to the high energy intensity of harvesting operations for both pathways (13 gCO2eq/MJ for whole tree and 7.13 gCO2eq/MJ for forest residue). OME production costs are higher for the whole tree (1.92 $/L) than the forest residue pathway (1.71 $/L). All the social indicators (i.e., employment potential and employee wages and benefits) are more favorable in the forest residue pathway. Conclusions: We conducted sensitivity analyses by varying parameters such as sustainability impact weights, threshold values, and indicator impact values. We then determined the parameters’ impacts on overall ranking to verify the robustness of the model. This model can be used to assess and rank other energy technologies that integrate environmental, economic, and social sustainability impacts and thereby contribute to policy-making for the energy industry. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Context: Land-use change is a key driver of pollinator declines worldwide. Plantation forests are a major land use worldwide and are likely to expand substantially in the near term, especially with projected cellulosic biofuel production. But little is known about the potential local and landscape-scale impacts of plantation forestry on bees, the most important group of pollinators worldwide. Objectives: We studied the effects of local management, landscape context, and their interaction on bee abundance and species richness in the southeastern US, in pine plantations and other nearby land uses. Methods: We sampled bee communities using aerial netting and pan trapping in 85 sites over 3 years. Results: We found that both landscape composition and configuration are important factors for bee diversity and abundance at the landscape scale, though interestingly many landscape factors showed contrasting directional responses for diversity versus abundance. Removing the four most common species, all in the genus Lasioglossum (and which comprised ~ 45% of all specimens) largely harmonized the results between diversity and abundance. In addition, we found several interactions between local management and landscape factors, all consistent with the idea that compositional heterogeneity and configurational complexity are more important for bee communities in poorer-quality local habitat. Conclusions: Our results underscore the importance of considering (1) both landscape configuration and composition in analyses, and (2) interactions between local management and landscape factors. The interactions in particular highlight the need to maintain landscape compositional heterogeneity and configurational complexity, particularly in heavily managed landscapes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In order to reach the national target in the use of renewable energy in the transport sector, about 55% of the biodiesel consumed in Italy is imported. However, imported biofuel is currently debated since large-scale production has entailed different environmental and socioeconomic problems. Sustainability in biofuel production is a priority for the European Union and with the new Common Agricultural Policy 2014–2020 (CAP) this priority could become an opportunity through access to aids for the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Considering the importance to promote small-scale biofuel production, this study aimed to assess the economic feasibility of rapeseed straight vegetable oil (SVO) use as a self-supply agricultural biofuel in Italian context, assuming that rapeseed is cultivated by using practices of conservation agriculture. The financial support of the new CAP was considered, and alternative hypotheses were assumed to promote the SVO supply chains. The economic analysis shows that EU aids can help to promote inland biofuel production, ensuring positive profits for farmers (with a net present value up to 181 thousand €), thereby reducing the risk connected to investments, mainly due to the fluctuation of some key variables, like diesel price. Moreover, results highlight the importance of establishing farmers’ associations: given the high cost of the initial investment, the absence of an agreement for the creation of an optimum-sized supply chains might make those investments non profitable. Agricultural policy is therefore helpful to promote sustainable biofuel production, making the supply chains independent and self-sufficient over time. In this context, to ensure a sustainable biofuel production, beside the provision of support to the initial investments, it is also important to consider in the future biofuel policy scenario the possibility to incentive energy crop cultivation by promoting conservation agricultural practices (e.g., crop diversification, crop rotation, minimum tillage). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current narrative on biofuels is backed up by a large number of studies published in the scientific literature that address second-generation bioethanol only through a single topic approach, nonetheless in the vast majority of cases transition to this energy carrier is evaluated as a generally ‘promising’ technology. This paper presents a first attempt in proposing an integrated evaluation of the actual benefits expected from bioethanol in the transport sector, by applying the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) to the prospective realization of a local system of bio-refinery in Campania Region (Southern Italy). MuSIASEM is a multi-criteria analysis enabling to deal with the complexity of a territorial energy system. Since the unavoidable intrinsic uncertainty, the study does not focus on predictions, but adopts a strategy of Quantitative Story-Telling about some relevant results underlying the limits and critical issues about the energy converter fabric, the economic profitability, environmental constraints and the questionable concept of marginal land. The findings suggest concluding toward falsification of key points in the current narrative: (i) the system is not an efficient solar energy converter; (ii) it fails to realize many of the expectations for a renewable energy carrier producer; (iii) the contribution to decarbonization strategies is not as high as desired and other environmental impacts could not be neglected; (iv) the very large land requirement is hardly compatible with conversion of truly marginal land in Campania region; (v) compared to alternate land uses it does not seem an actually promising strategy to regain value from rural economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three types of biofuels derived from land, coastal zone, and marine were pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer from room temperature to 1000 °C under different heating rates (50, 80, and 100 °C/min), and three isoconversional mathematical models were established to analyze the kinetic properties of biomass. The results show that the pyrolysis process of biomass derived from different distributions included three main stages: drying and preheating stage, volatile matter evaporation stage, and carbonization stage, whereas the pyrolysis behavior of the marine seawater Spirulina (Sp) biomass is somewhat different from that of land [corn stalks (Cs)] and coastal biomasses [reed (Re)], stemming from the inherent difference in their compositions. Cs and Re species have advantages over microalgae in terms of the difficulty of volatile matters releasing, whereas the pyrolysis process of Re and Sp is faster than Cs because of the catalysis of its high salt tolerance. The heating rate has a significant effect on the performance of devolatilization profiles and maximum weight loss rate, regardless of the biomass type from different regions. The dynamics analysis indicates that Sp species is preferable to Cs and Re in terms of thermochemical conversion because of the lower apparent activation energy for total conversion. From the verification test, we concluded that the simulations for Friedman models presented a good agreement with the experimental conversions calculated at three different heating rates for Cs, Re, and Sp pyrolysis, and that the kinetic simulation of the weight loss curve and kinetic parameters obtained by pyrolysis of three biomasses is reasonable and effective. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic biomass from dedicated energy crops such as Miscanthus spp. is an important tool to combat anthropogenic climate change. However, we still do not exactly understand the sources of cell wall recalcitrance to deconstruction, which hinders the efficient biorefining of plant biomass into biofuels and bioproducts. Results: We combined detailed phenotyping, correlation studies and discriminant analyses, to identify key significantly distinct variables between miscanthus organs, genotypes and most importantly, between saccharification performances. Furthermore, for the first time in an energy crop, normalised total quantification of specific cell wall glycan epitopes is reported and correlated with saccharification. Conclusions: In stems, lignin has the greatest impact on recalcitrance. However, in leaves, matrix glycans and their decorations have determinant effects, highlighting the importance of biomass fine structures, in addition to more commonly described cell wall compositional features. The results of our interrogation of the miscanthus cell wall promote the concept that desirable cell wall traits for increased biomass quality are highly dependent on the target biorefining products. Thus, for the development of biorefining ideotypes, instead of a generalist miscanthus variety, more realistic and valuable approaches may come from defining a collection of specialised cultivars, adapted to specific conditions and purposes. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - A blended feedstock containing food waste and coal was used to perform co-hydrothermal carbonization (Co-HTC) at different temperatures to observe the effect of temperature on the solid fuel properties of different hydrochars. Moreover, these hydrochars were mixed with molasses which act as a binder to prepare high mechanical strength pellets. A range of techniques was used to characterise the hydrochars and pellets. Food waste and coal hydrochars produced at 300 °C exhibited high heating value (HHV) of 31.1 and 31.4 MJ/kg respectively, however, high heating value of the Co-HTC 300 °C hydrochar decreased to 28.6 MJ/kg. The ash content of hydrochar obtained via the Co-HTC at 300 °C, was 53% less than the ash content of raw coal. Combustion results showed that the Co-HTC of food waste and coal is thermally more suitable than HTC of food waste and coal. During pelletization molasses played an important role in making solid bridge between the hydrochars. The tensile strength of all the hydrochars ranged between 2 and 4.5 MPa. The blend treated at 300 °C showed the highest tensile strength of 4.5 MPa. The mass density of food waste and blend increased as the temperature was increased, however, the mass density of the coal sample showed a decreasing trend. The energy densities of all the hydrochars ranged between 22.2 and 39 GJ/m 3 and the energy density of the blends were higher than the coal and food waste hydrochar. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of anaerobic digestion to increase revenues in rural areas and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates the economic and environmental feasibility of a farm-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) combined heat and power (CHP) plant co-located with a cattle feedlot. The study evaluates two different scenarios with six cases – Biomass Only (BO) scenario and Biomass and Glycerin (BG) scenario, targeting a power capacity of 950 kW e using combinations of manure, biomass, and crude glycerin. Beef cattle manure with approximately 10.15 wt% of biomass and 10 wt% of glycerin is added into the system. The internal rate of return (IRR) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) were calculated for six cases. The IRR ranges between 3.51% and 5.57%, and the GHG emissions range between −82.6 and 498.52 g CO 2 e/kWh. Glycerin reduces the operating cost by 32%. These results indicate that AD CHP could be profitable at the farm-scale depending on various parameters. Sensitivity analysis indicates that power efficiency, operating capacity and waste generation per cattle have the strongest impact on the IRR, affecting it by over 40%, while glycerin and manure emission factors are the most important for GHG emissions affecting it by over 15%. Uncertainty analysis describes the role of feedstock choice and process performance on minimizing commercialization risks. © 2019

AB  - Currently, the most important barrier in algal cultivation is growth nutrients cost. In the present study, the isolated alga Synechocystis PCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L−1 d−1 and it was estimated that the algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha−1 year−1. A low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery. The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the microalgae Synechocystis biomass production cost was approximately 2–3 US$ per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained. This is the first study to demonstrate the alga Synechocystis cultivation in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and produced two potential biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquefaction is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil and biochar products from sewage sludge (SS). Co-liquefaction of SS and agricultural/forestry biomass is likely a potential method for obtaining high yield/quality of bio-oil and biochar. In this work, rice straw (RS) and wood sawdust (WS) were selected as representatives of agricultural/forestry biomass and the effects of main process parameters during the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS on the yields/properties of bio-oil and biochar were explored in details. The proper reaction temperature, solid-liquid ratio and reaction time for the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS were suggested to be 280–300 °C, 0.1 g/mL and 10–30 min, respectively. Potassium/sodium salt (-OH and -CO3) catalysts could efficiently enhanced the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS. The introduction of RS/WS into the liquefaction of SS would reduce the contents of nitrogen and sulfur in bio-oil and enhance the formation of phenolic compounds. In addition, co-liquefaction of SS-RS could promote the percentage of lower-boil-point compounds in bio-oil. Although the thermal stability, surface area and pore volume of biochars slightly decreased, the contents of organic matters in biochars were obviously improved, suggesting higher potential in land application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial biofuel crop with a high production potential and suitable for growth on marginal land. This study investigates the long-term planting effect of switchgrass on the dynamics of soil moisture, pH, organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3–-N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) for soils to a depth of 90-cm in a sandy wasteland, Inner Mongolia, China. After crop harvesting in 2015, soil samples were collected from under switchgrass stands established in 2006, 2008, and 2009, native mixture, and a control that was virgin sand. Averaged across six layers, soil moisture and pH was significantly higher under the native mixture than switchgrass or virgin sand. However, SOC and TN were significantly higher under the 2006 switchgrass stand when compared with all other vegetation treatments and the control. The SOC and TN increased from 2.37 and 0.26 g kg−1, respectively, for 2009 switchgrass stand, and to 3.21 and 0.42 g kg−1, respectively, for 2006 switchgrass stand. Meanwhile, SOC and TN contents were 2.51 and 0.27 g kg−1, respectively, under the native mixture. The soil beneath switchgrass and native mixture showed the highest NO3–-N and NH4+-N, respectively. The soil moisture increased with depth while SOC, TN, and NO3–-N decreased. An obvious trend of increasing moisture, SOC, TN, and mineral N was observed with increasing switchgrass stand age. Thus, growing switchgrass on sandy soils can enhance SOC and TN, improve the availability of mineral N, and generate more appropriate pH conditions for this energy cropping system. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A rapidly growing share of global agricultural areas is devoted to the production of biomass for non-food purposes. The expanding non-food bioeconomy can have far-reaching social and ecological implications; yet, the non-food sector has attained little attention in land footprint studies. This paper provides the first assessment of the global cropland footprint of non-food products of the European Union (EU), a globally important region regarding its expanding bio-based economy. We apply a novel hybrid land flow accounting model, combining the biophysical trade model LANDFLOW with the multi-regional input-output model EXIOBASE. The developed hybrid approach improves the level of product and country detail, while comprehensively covering all global supply chains from agricultural production to final consumption, including highly processed products, such as many non-food products. The results highlight the EU's role as a major processing and the biggest consuming region of cropland-based non-food products, while at the same time relying heavily on imports. Two thirds of the cropland required to satisfy the EU's non-food biomass consumption are located in other world regions, particularly in China, the US and Indonesia, giving rise to potential impacts on distant ecosystems. With almost 39% in 2010, oilseeds used to produce for example biofuels, detergents and polymers represented the dominant share of the EU's non-food cropland demand. Traditional non-food biomass uses, such as fibre crops for textiles and animal hides and skins for leather products, also contributed notably (22%). Our findings suggest that if the EU Bioeconomy Strategy is to support global sustainable development, a detailed monitoring of land use displacement and spillover effects is decisive for targeted and effective EU policy making. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Second-generation biofuels are often seen as essential element in the future bioeconomy strategy. Countries with extensive forest resources such as Norway often view wood as preferred bio-feedstock, yet the effects of wood demand on assortments of harvested wood and other wood-based industries are unclear. Focusing on the importance of feedstock choice, we analyse the impacts of establishing a second-generation medium-scale biofuel plant in Norway. For the analysis, a dynamic forest sector model where the choice of tree species, wood assortments, production of bioenergy, and forest industry products are explicitly included, was applied. We find the optimal biofuel feedstock mix to be dominated by softwood chips from pulpwood comprising 48% of total biomass inputs in 2030 and increasing to 67% by 2055, followed by hardwood chips from birch, comprising initially 34% of total biomass inputs and 16% by 2055. The proportion of harvest residues remained constant at about 18% over time and roundwood was not used at all for biofuel production. Despite the additional demand for chips, the single medium-scale biofuel plant will have only minor effects on existing forest industries and harvests in Norway, as the domestic impact is dampened by changes in foreign trade flows, especially of chips. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The threats of climate change, food security, resource depletion and energy security are driving society towards a sustainable low-carbon future. Within this paradigm, biomass plays an invaluable role in meeting the food, feed, energy and material needs of future generations. Current EU thinking advocates biomass for high-value materials, which is not aligned with EU public policy support for ‘lower value’ bioenergy applications. ‘High-technology’ and ‘no bioenergy mandate’ pathways explore market conditions that generate a more equitable distribution between competing biomass conversion technologies and competing biomass and fossil technologies. In achieving greater equity, these pathways ease biomass market tensions; enhance EU food security; improve EU biobased trade balances; accelerate biomaterial sectors’ output performance and favour macroeconomic growth. Moreover, an additional 80% increase in the oil price signals a tipping point in favour of first generation biofuels, whilst simultaneously boosting output in advanced material conversion technologies even more than the high-technology pathway. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - After decades of decline, croplands are once again expanding across the United States. A recent spatially explicit analysis mapped nearly three million hectares of US cropland expansion that occurred between 2008 and 2012. Land use change (LUC) of this sort can be a major source of anthropogenic carbon (C) emissions, though the effects of this change have yet to be analyzed. We developed a data-driven model that combines these high-resolution maps of cropland expansion with published maps of biomass and soil organic carbon stocks (SOC) to map and quantify the resulting C emissions. Our model increases emphasis on non-forest - i.e. grassland, shrubland and wetland - above and belowground biomass C stocks and the response of SOC to LUC - emission sources that are frequently neglected in traditional C accounting. These sources represent major emission conduits in the US, where new croplands primarily replace grasslands. We find that expansion between 2008-12 caused, on average, a release of 55.0 MgC ha-1 (SDspatial = 39.9 MgC ha-1), which resulted in total emissions of 38.8 TgC yr-1 (95% CI = 21.6-55.8 TgC yr-1). We also find wide geographic variation in both the size and sensitivity of affected C stocks. Grassland conversion was the primary source of emissions, with more than 90% of these emissions originating from SOC stocks. Due to the long accumulation time of SOC, its dominance as a source suggests that emissions may be difficult to mitigate over human-relevant time scales. While methodological limitations regarding the effects of land use legacies and future management remain, our findings emphasize the importance of avoiding LUC emissions and suggest potential means by which natural C stocks can be conserved. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Large-scale agricultural investments in land and biofuel feedstock production have been found to lead to positive employment, growth and poverty reduction effects. However, these outcomes depend on the institutional context and the type of investment. This article aims to provide insights into the relationship between wage work for a large-scale Jatropha project and household food security, measured as dietary diversity and food provision during the lean season. After the initial hype and the subsequent downfall of Jatropha, new projects are still being undertaken. Yet there is little evidence quantifying the long-term impacts of large-scale Jatropha production on smallholders’ livelihoods. This article addresses the gap by using five rounds of panel data collected between 2008 and 2013 from 390 randomly selected households in the vicinity of a Jatropha project in Madagascar. Labour demand by the plantation declined substantially after the build-up phase, and incomes from wage work were mostly used for food and other necessities. Impacts were estimated with the help of fixed effects models. Jatropha wage work contributed significantly to dietary diversity but did not reduce the more subjective lack of food during the lean season. One reason might be that households stored significantly less rice over time. Moreover, food production and consumption were highly influenced by seasonality, drought and locust shocks, which implies that complementing income creation with agricultural development strategies might have further positive effects on livelihoods and food security. © International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V. 2019.

AB  - Land-use changes impact biodiversity, and biofuel crop production and its expansion pose as an important driver of negative effects in the tropics. Understanding the influence of land-use changes on suitable habitats for species is a worldwide conservation challenge, particularly on large-sized mammals. We modeled habitat suitability of the threatened giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Brazilian State of So Paulo. The region is the most populous and economically developed of the country and is the world's main sugarcane production area. We aimed to 1) map habitat suitability for the giant anteater population in the State; 2) assess the contributions of selected landscape and anthropogenic predictors to species habitat suitability; and 3) quantify suitable habitats in environmental protection areas and in areas threatened by the sugarcane expansion. We used a two-step analysis: First, we created a suitability map in the species' distributional range (Drange); from this map, we extracted the results for So Paulo State. Second, we built a regional model to predict the current scenario of So Paulo using the following environmental layers: 1) the resulting distributional range map for giant anteater (Drange); 2) landscape metrics; and 3) anthropogenic factors that might affect anteaters. The State of São Paulo presented, in general, very low values of habitat suitability. The following predictors made the greatest contribution: Drange, vegetation connectivity and distance to protected areas. Suitable habitats for anteaters within strictly protected areas are very scarce (1.6% of the total area), and 22% of the suitable areas are expected to be altered by future sugarcane expansion. Suitable habitats on private lands must play a role in conserving biodiversity. © 2019 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - Sustainable production of algae will depend on understanding trade-offs at the energy-water nexus. Algal biofuels promise to improve the environmental sustainability profile of renewable energy along most dimensions. In this assessment of potential US freshwater production, we assumed sustainable production along the carbon dimension by simulating placement of open ponds away from high-carbon-stock lands (forest, grassland, and wetland) and near sources of waste CO2. Along the water dimension, we quantified trade-offs between water scarcity and production for an 'upstream' indicator (measuring minimum water supply) and a 'downstream' indicator (measuring impacts on rivers). For the upstream indicator, we developed a visualization tool to evaluate algae production for different thresholds for water surplus. We hypothesized that maintaining a minimum seasonal water surplus would also protect river habitat for aquatic biota. Our study confirmed that ensuring surplus water also reduced the duration of low-flow events, but only above a threshold. We also observed a trade-offbetween algal production and the duration of low-flow events in streams. These results can help to guide the choice of basin-specific sustainability targets to avoid conflicts with competing water users at this energy-water nexus. Where conflicts emerge, alternative water sources or enclosed photobioreactors may be needed for algae cultivation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Continued economic growth is reliant on stable, affordable energy, requiring at present fossil fuel-derived energy production. Coal-fired power stations produce metal-rich but macro-nutrient-poor waste waters and emit flue gas, containing ∼10% CO 2 . Algae and cyanobacteria remediate metals and CO 2 , but use of N 2 -fixing (diazotrophic)cyanobacteria can reduce nitrogen-fertilization costs. The resulting biomass represents a promising source for biofuel and bio-product development. This study investigated the effect of CO 2 - and trace metals on growth performance, biochemical profiles and metal content of the freshwater diazotrophic cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. to assess bioproduct potential. Aerated 2 L batch cultures were grown in simulated ash-dam water (SADW)and BG11 without nitrogen (BG11(-N)controls). Supplied air was supplemented with either 15% CO 2 or not (non-CO 2 controls). CO 2 supplementation resulted in 2.4 and 3.3-fold higher biomass productivities and 1.3 and 1.2-fold higher phycocyanin and phycoerythrin contents, whilst metals (media)had no effect. Al, Cu, Ni and V were more efficiently removed (50–90%)with CO 2 -addition, while As, Mo, Se and Sr removal was higher (30–87%)for non-CO 2 controls. No significant effect on Zn and Fe removal was evident. Calculated biomass metal concentrations, at quantities required to meet N-requirements of wheat, suggests no metal toxicity when applied as a mineral-nitrogen biofertilizer. With a carbohydrate content of 50%, the biomass is also suitable for bioethanol production. In summary, Tolypothrix sp. raised in ash dam waste water supplemented with flue gas CO 2 could yield high-value phycobiliproteins, bioethanol or biogas, and mineral-rich nitrogen fertilizer which would offset remediation costs and improve agricultural productivity. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The growing demand for biofuel production increased agricultural activities in South Dakota, leading to the conversion of grassland to cropland. Although a few land change studies have been conducted in this area, they lacked spatial details and were based on the traditional bi-temporal change detection that may return incorrect rates of conversion. This study aimed to provide a more complete view of land conversion in South Dakota using a trajectory-based analysis that considers the entire satellite-based land cover/land use time series to improve change detection. We estimated cropland expansion of 5447 km 2 (equivalent to 14% of the existing cropland area) between 2007 and 2015, which matches much more closely the reports from the National Agriculture Statistics Service-NASS (5921 km 2 )-and the National Resources Inventory-NRI (5034 km 2 )-than an estimation from the bi-temporal approach (8018 km 2 ). Cropland gains were mostly concentrated in 10 counties in northern and central South Dakota. Urbanizing Lincoln County, part of the Sioux Falls metropolitan area, is the only county with a net loss in cropland area over the study period. An evaluation of land suitability for crops using the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) indicated a scarcity in high-quality arable land available for cropland expansion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Developing an optimum pretreatment condition to enhance glucose recovery assessed the potential of Chloris barbata, which is a common invasive weed in Thailand, as a feedstock for bioethanol production. Chloris barbata was exposed to autoclave-assisted alkaline pretreatment by using different sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentrations (1% to 4%) and heat intensities (110 °C to 130 °C) that were dissipated from autoclaving. The optimum condition for pretreatment was determined to be 2% NaOH at 110 °C for 60 min. At this condition, maximum hydrolysis efficiency (90.0%) and glucose recovery (30.7%), as compared to those of raw C. barbata (15.15% and 6.20%, respectively), were observed. Evaluation of glucose production from 1000 g of C. barbata based on material balance analysis revealed an estimated yield of 304 g after pretreatment at the optimum condition when compared to that of raw C. barbata (61 g), an increase of five-fold. Structural analysis by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the disruption of the intact structure of C. barbata and an increase in the cellulose crystallinity index (CrI), respectively. The results from this study demonstrate the efficiency of using C. barbata as a potential feedstock for bioethanol production. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of organic wastes for char preparation has been proved as an effective way for livestock manure management. Livestock manure chars were prepared by slow pyrolysis (400, 500, 600 °C) and hydrothermal carbonization (180, 210, 240 °C) at different reaction temperatures. The influences of manure type and reaction condition to element content, calorific value, char yield, energy yield, and combustion characteristic were investigated. The results illustrate that thermochemical process can strongly affect the properties of pyrolytic char and hydrochar. Compared to pyrolytic char, the hydrochar had higher heating value, higher energy yield, and lower ash content with respect to the same feedstock. The livestock manure type could also influence the properties of biochars/hydrochars. Hydrochars from swine manure, broiler litter, and layer chicken litter achieved the highest energy yield of 65.5%, 56.9%, and 64.4% at 210 °C. Dairy cattle manure and beef cattle manure displayed higher energy yield and higher comprehensive combustibility index than other manures. Furthermore, HTC can narrow the weight loss temperature range in differential thermogravimetric curve of manures. Therefore, HTC is considered as a more effective approach in carbonizing animal manure for solid biofuel compared to slow pyrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial warm-season grass which has great potential as a forage or bioenergy crop in marginal land. This study was conducted to determine whether nitrogen (N) fertilization could affect biomass quality of switchgrass harvested in late summer and early fall. The effects of four N fertilizer application rates (0, 60, 120, and 240 kg N ha −1 ) and two harvest times (late summer and early fall) on the quality components of forage and biofuel feedstock and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) were investigated on a sandy wasteland (Aridisol) in Inner Mongolia, China during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. Soil NO 3 − content was also examined in response to N application rates. Application of 60 kg N ha −1 significantly increased switchgrass crude protein (CP) content, protein yield, and TEY (p &lt; 0.05), but did not affect other quality parameters of forage and biofuel feedstock. Compared with the late summer harvest, CP content and protein yield were significantly lower, while TEY was significantly higher in the early fall harvest (p &lt; 0.05); however, cellulose, hemicellulose, and ash contents showed no significant differences between the two harvest times. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) contents were significantly lower for harvest in early fall than in late summer (p &lt; 0.05). Soil NO 3 − content in early fall harvest increased significantly with increasing N application rate (p &lt; 0.05), and was lower than that in the switchgrass green-up stage. These findings together with our results on biomass yield and apparent soil N balance suggest that a lower rate of N application appears sufficient to produce good quality forage as well as biomass without negatively affecting feedstock quality, while avoiding the risk of NO 3 − loss via leaching on a sandy soil. Switchgrass forage quality would be high during summer in terms of CP content, although delaying harvest until fall or even after a killing frost could provide better quality feedstock for bioenergy production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indoor air pollution from the use of dirty fuel such as firewood, and dung cake for household chores is a serious health risk globally. Currently, 2.8 billion people in the world rely on dirty fuel for cooking and heating, of which more than 700 million (25%) people are from India. In 2016, 3.8 million premature deaths were attributable only to indoor air pollution, of which the total premature deaths due to indoor air pollution in India was 1.3 million (34%). One of the effective ways to combat indoor air pollution is a rapid dissemination of biogas technology. With nearly 300 million bovine animals, and 22% of rural agricultural households that completely rely on livestock for their livelihoods, India has a great potential to expand biogas technology and to combat the killer indoor air pollution. Currently, however, only 0.4% of the households in India reportedly use biogas. Using National Sample Survey Organization data, India, and applying an econometric estimation procedure, the present study demonstrates that both physical capital, such as landholdings and house ownership, and human capital, such as general education of the household head and spouse, can significantly affect the decision to use biogas. However, the positive decision to use biogas is negatively associated with the monthly expenditure on dirty fuel. The study, therefore, recommends the provision of general education as well as external supports in developing countries to increase awareness, as well as the adoption of domestic biogas digesters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crop yields are endogenous as long as economic agents adjust to permanent changes in expected prices. The literature, however, does not offer a definitive value of how much yield would change in response to sustained price changes. To fill the gap, we use available scientific findings and data to estimate yield elasticities that enable agricultural commodity and food policy analysis. Using a world market model with short- to long-run yield response, we show the impacts of sustained energy price shocks on global cereal supply and demand. The results highlight substantial differences in quantity and price effects depending on the yield elasticities. These results demonstrate the need to recognize yield response when assessing impacts of energy prices or biofuel production on food uses or, more generally, on food security in the face of income and population growth, evolving dietary patterns, climate change implications, or other long-run pressures. © 2018

AB  - We consider a biofuel supply chain problem in which a farmer supplies two downstream refineries with nonidentical crops (corn and energy crop). The problem has been modeled as a multi leader single follower game to derive the farmer's decisions on land use as well as refineries' proposed prices to the farmer. We consider subsidizing the farmer and the refinery that uses the energy crop to study whether a subsidy plan can enhance the advanced biofuel production and meet the mandate of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This mandate requires the production of 36 billion gallons of biofuel, out of which 21 billion gallons should be noncorn-based biofuel. We solve the problem under four cases based on the willingness of the farmer to sell corn to the food market as well as the availability of land expansion for her. The Nash equilibrium is derived for all cases, and parametric analyses are used to study the effect of subsidies on the profit of the players and the total social welfare of the supply chain. We observe that a government's expenditure can be offset by the increase of the social welfare under certain circumstances. We find the minimum budget requirement to meet the EPA's mandate and show that a specific budget can be distributed in different ways while obtaining the same results. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Greater production of agricultural biomass for energy generation means a greater overlap between the energy and agricultural value chains. The production of biofuels from food crops was previously criticised as conflicting with food production. Use of so-called ‘marginal land’ is proposed to overcome previous controversies. Using interviews and document analysis, this paper explores the meaning of ‘marginal land’ for non-food energy crop production in Denmark and conflicts that arose over its proposed use. In Denmark there was a different conception of marginal land – environmentally sensitive land where intensive cultivation causes impacts. Policies were put in place to promote the use of this ‘environmentally marginal land’. However, competing environmental objectives for this land – for different types of biodiversity, ecosystems services and aesthetic preferences meant these policies were repealed. The paper shows how discussions of biomass production on agricultural land, and particularly marginal land, reflect the nuances of competing land uses in agriculturally intensive countries like Denmark. It is not only a matter of trade-offs between different types of agricultural production, such as food and fuel, or between environmental benefits and production, but over the optimal environmental use of the land to achieve multifunctional benefits. As well as questions of equity, access and practicality, the marginal land debate in agriculturally intensive countries needs to include questions of appropriate and desired environmental outcomes and means of stakeholder engagement to establish these. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The optimal role of biofuels from energy crops for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement in the German transport sectors is investigated under different progressive long-term scenarios, from a set arable land area corresponding to current use. The sectors included are land passenger and goods transport, shipping and aviation. The GHG abatement from the same land area can be increased by a factor of five through switching to higher yielding biofuel options. Silage maize based biomethane and wood based Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG), in either gaseous or liquefied form are the options with the highest GHG abatement potential per arable land unit, and thus markets where such fuels are an option should be prioritised. Sector fuel restrictions combined with fuel yields resulted in the land passenger sector to be the first priority for maximising GHG abatement, followed by land goods transport, shipping and finally aviation. Only when the previous sectors have been covered by renewable options do the following become relevant and thus a large transition is required before aviation biofuels or any liquid advanced biofuel become the climate optimal use of biomass. Applying admixture quotas to sub-sectors yields a lower GHG abatement than an optimal strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research into trees plays a very important role in evaluations of soil contamination with diesel oil. Trees are ideal for reclaiming contaminated soils because their large biomass renders them more resistant to higher concentrations of pollutants. In the literature, there is a general scarcity of long-term studies performed on trees, in particular European beeches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of Scots pines and European beeches grown for 8 years on soil contaminated with diesel oil. Selected morphological and physiological parameters of trees were analyzed. The biomass yield of Scots pines was not significantly correlated with increasing concentrations of diesel oil, but it was more than 700% higher than in European beeches. Scots pines were taller and had a larger stem diameter than European beeches during the 8-year study. The diameter of trees grown on the most contaminated soil was reduced 1.5-fold in Scots pines and more than twofold in European beeches. The length of Scots pine needles from the most contaminated treatment decreased by 50% relative to control needles. The shortest needles were heaviest. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of needle length was highest in Scots pines grown on the most contaminated soil, whereas the reverse was noted in the FA of needle weight. Diesel oil decreased the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. The Fv/Fm ratio of needles and leaves was influenced by the tested concentrations of diesel oil. The results of the study indicate that the Scots pine better adapts (grows more rapidly and produces higher biomass) to long-term soil contamination with diesel oil than the European beech. In European beeches, growth inhibition and leaf discoloration (a decrease in chlorophyll content) were observed already after the first year of the experiment, which indicates that 1-year-old seedlings of European beech are robust bioindicators of soil contamination with diesel oil. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Protic Ionic Liquids (PILs) with their labile protons are expected to simultaneously disrupt and exudate lipids from microalgae, crucial for efficient biodiesel production. A survey study with a battery of ten carboxylate PILs with lactam and ammonium cations was conducted with dried and dewatered marine Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella salina microalgae. The results showed that the formate and hexanoate PILs in comparison to acetate PILs could efficiently catalyse simultaneous near-complete cell disruption and lipid extraction from dewatered microalgae. The ability of PIL to handle dewatered microalgae avoids the energy-intensive drying step used in other conventional methods. The maximum lipid recovery of 134.9 and 85.4‰ was recorded with butyrolactam hexanoate treated N. oculata and C. salina respectively. The lipid profile showed the predominant presence of C16 and C18 fatty acids and comparable with lipid profile obtained with conventional Bligh &amp; Dyer method. The PILs were also found to favourably inhibit lipases which likely promote lipolysis in wet microalgal lipid samples. The PIL extracted lipids were found to have reduced pigments, favoured for reducing the number lipid/biodiesel purification steps. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fungus Trichoderma reesei is employed in the production of most enzyme cocktails used by the lignocellulosic biofuels industry today. Despite significant improvements, the cost of the required enzyme preparations remains high, representing a major obstacle for the industrial production of these alternative fuels. In this study, a new Trichoderma erinaceum strain was isolated from decaying sugarcane straw. The enzyme cocktail secreted by the new isolate during growth in pretreated sugarcane straw-containing medium presented higher specific activities of β-glucosidase, endoxylanase, β-xylosidase and α-galactosidase than the cocktail of a wild T. reesei strain and yielded more glucose in the hydrolysis of pretreated sugarcane straw. A proteomic analysis of the two strains’ secretomes identified a total of 86 proteins, of which 48 were exclusive to T. erinaceum, 35 were exclusive to T. reesei and only 3 were common to both strains. The secretome of T. erinaceum also displayed a higher number of carbohydrate-active enzymes than that of T. reesei (37 and 27 enzymes, respectively). Altogether, these results reveal the significant potential of the T. erinaceum species for the production of lignocellulases, both as a possible source of enzymes for the supplementation of industrial cocktails and as a candidate chassis for enzyme production. © 2019 British Mycological Society

AB  - Environmental impact of livestock production has received a considerable public scrutiny because of the adverse effects of nutrient run-offs, primarily N and P, from agricultural land harboring intensive energy livestock operations. Hence, this study was designed to determine the efficacy of dietary phytase supplementation on fermentation of a sorghum grain–based total mixed ration (TMR) using a ruminal in vitro digestion approach. Phytase was supplemented at three doses: 0 (control), 540 (P540), and 720 (P720) g/t dry matter, equivalent to 0, 2.7 × 106, and 3.6 × 106 CFU/t DM, respectively. Compared to P720 and the control, gas production was higher for P540 after 12 h (P = 0.02) and 24 h (P = 0.03) of fermentation suggesting a higher microbial activity in response to phytase supplementation at lower phytase levels. Correspondingly, dry matter degradability was found to have improved in P540 and P720 compared to the control by 13 and 11% after 24 h of incubation (P = 0.05). For ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), a tendency towards lower values was only observed for P540 at 24 h of fermentation (P = 0.07), while minimal treatment effects were observed at other fermentation times. The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) were higher (P &lt; 0.05) after 48 h of fermentation for P540 and P720 compared to the control (P = 0.03) by 10% and 14%, respectively. Ruminal acetate tended towards higher values in the presence of phytase after 12 h of fermentation (P = 0.10), but towards lower values after 24 h of fermentation (P = 0.02), irrespective of the phytase dose applied. A trend towards lower ruminal propionate levels was observed in the presence of phytase after 6 h (P = 0.10) and 12 h (P = 0.06) of fermentation, while no effects were found at other fermentation times. In conclusion, phytase supplementation has the potential to improve metabolic energy activity of rumen microorganisms and the use of feed constituents. Thus, phytase supplementation could help to reduce environmental contamination in areas of ruminant production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate a life cycle assessment of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and biodiesel addressing alternative upstream pathways. The pathways are SVO and biodiesel produced in the United Kingdom (UK) using European rapeseed and also, SVO and biodiesel produced in the UK using soybean grain and soybean oil imported from Argentina. Four environmental impact categories have been assessed using the SimaPro (ReCiPe life-cycle impact assessment) method: this includes global warming potential (GWP); acidification; eutrophication and particulate matter. Rapeseed based biofuel had the lowest emission impact in terms of GHG emissions. Significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can result from land use change due to the expansion and cultivation of soybean in Argentina. When land use change is not considered, the soy based biofuel system has the lowest GHG impact with more than 70% GHG emission reduction. The GHG emission at cultivation stage far outweighs the impacts of the other life-cycle stages irrespective of the feedstock used for the biofuel production systems. The use of fertilizers and associated soil emissions are the main contributors. The environmental impacts of biofuel can be reduced by avoiding land use change, improving soil management practices and yield, and also optimizing transportation routes. Effective implementation of options for biofuels production were explored to improve sustainability in shipping. © 2019

AB  - To investigate whether there is a nexus between the microbial diversity level (taxonomic, functional and ecological) and the stress tolerance potential of the microbial community, the impact of different ammonium sources was evaluated. Therefore reactors adapted either to the anaerobic digestions of sugar beet silage or maize silage (SBS/MS) were supplemented with animal manure (M) or ammonium carbonate (A). The results showed that increasing concentrations of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) were not the only reason for community changes: the bacterial community in the reactors given animal manure became more similar over time compared to the reactors given ammonium carbonate. However, this study revealed that a bacterial community with a few dominant members led to a functional more flexible archaeal community (SBS reactors) which was more stress resistant under the experimental conditions. This indicates that a higher functional diversity within a certain part of the community, in the present study the archaeal community, is one important factor for process stability due to a higher tolerance to increasing amounts of process-inhibiting metabolites such as TAN. Compared to this a bacterial community with higher amount of more evenly distributed community members combined with a more rigid archaeal community (MS reactors) showed a lower stress tolerance potential. Moreover it was observed that the disappearance of members of the phylum Cloacimonetes can be used as an indicator for an upcoming process disturbance due to increasing TAN concentrations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel from energy crops will play an important role in supplying carbon-neutral fuel for the transport sector. However, there are large uncertainties regarding energy crop development and the energy crop potential and distribution need to be evaluated more comprehensively and systematically. In this study, we propose an integrated approach using the AquaCrop model, a geographic information system approach, and a scenario analysis and we conduct a land availability assessment with multiple factors including climate change, land use, soil, topography, regional crop management, and technological improvement to shed light on the potential production, distribution, and temporal-spatial variation of land suitable for sweet sorghum production in China. We evaluate a full range of spatial scales from 1-km resolution to a national assessment in four representative concentration pathways from 2010 to 2100. The results show that most provinces can plant sweet sorghum. The most suitable provinces for sweet sorghum production are Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The biofuel potential of sweet sorghum in high-slope farmland (0.30–0.73 EJ) and marginal land (11.98–15.18 EJ) can satisfy the biofuel goal in 2020 (0.12 EJ) and 2050 (6.70–8.60 EJ). Climate change and land-use change are critical factors influencing for the current implementation and long-term planning of energy crops in China. © 2019

AB  - This study employs chicken manure as a feedstock to produce different forms of energy to abate environmental burdens. To achieve ultimate carbon management, the possible utilization of CO2 during pyrolysis of chicken manure was fundamentally investigated. The roles of CO2 in pyrolysis of chicken manure include enhanced thermal cracking and shifting of the carbon distribution via reaction between volatile organic compounds and CO2. The identified roles induced by CO2 were catalytically enhanced because of the inorganic content in the feedstock. The morphology of biochar created from the chicken manure pyrolysis was significantly affected by CO2. For example, a well-developed pore structure was observed in the biochar developed under a CO2 environment; this biochar was used as an effective porous material for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion coupled with combined heat and power production on dairy farms is environmentally advantageous; however, high capital and operating costs have limited its adoption, especially in the United States, where renewable electricity and heat production are under-incentivized. Biogas is also at a disadvantage because it has to compete with very low natural gas prices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of integrating absorption refrigeration technology for combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) on the farm to help bridge this economic hurdle. A combined environmental life cycle and techno-economic assessment was used to compare 2 cooling pathways with and without co-digestion. We considered using CCHP to (1) displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes (e.g., milk chilling/refrigeration, biogas inlet cooling) or (2) mitigate heat stress in dairy cattle via conductive cow cooling. All cooling scenarios reduced environmental emissions compared with combined heat and power only, with an appreciable reduction in land use impacts when employing conductive cow cooling. However, none of the cooling scenarios achieved economically viability. When using cooling power to displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes, economic viability was constrained by low electricity prices and a lack of incentives in the United States. When used for conductive cow cooling, economic viability was constrained by (1) low waste heat-to-cooling conversion efficiency; (2) limited conductive cow cooling effectiveness (i.e., heat-stress mitigation); and (3) low heat stress frequency and limited severity. However, we predict that with minor improvements in conductive cow cooling effectiveness and in hotter climates, CCHP for conductive cow cooling would be economically viable even in current US energy markets. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association

AB  - Increased use of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels raises concerns about health effects of new emissions. We analyzed cellular and molecular lung effects in Fisher 344 rats exposed to diesel engine exhaust emissions (DEE) from a Euro 5-classified diesel engine running on B7: petrodiesel fuel containing 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), or SHB20 (synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel): petrodiesel fuel containing 7% FAME and 13% hydrogenated vegetable oil. The Fisher 344 rats were exposed for 7 consecutive days (6 h/day) or 28 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week), both with and without diesel particle filter (DPF) treatment of the exhaust in whole body exposure chambers (n = 7/treatment). Histological analysis and analysis of cytokines and immune cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) did not reveal adverse pulmonary effects after exposure to DEE from B7 or SHB20 fuel. Significantly different gene expression levels for B7 compared to SHB20 indicate disturbed redox signaling (Cat, Hmox1), beta-adrenergic signaling (Adrb2) and xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp1a1). Exhaust filtration induced higher expression of redox genes (Cat, Gpx2) and the chemokine gene Cxcl7 compared to non-filtered exhaust. Exposure time (7 versus 28 days) also resulted in different patterns of lung gene expression. No genotoxic effects in the lungs were observed. Overall, exposure to B7 or SHB20 emissions suggests only minor effects in the lungs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Some countries in the world aim to increase biofuel production and consumption as a way to decarbonize the transport sector and transit to a low carbon economy. Besides their potential environmental advantages compared to conventional fuels, biofuels may also bring other socioeconomic benefits. Using the Input-Output Analysis, this study has looked at the socio-economic impacts associated to the biofuels targets established in Uruguay by estimating the associated gross and net effects on production of goods and services; value added and job creation categorized into rural and non-rural. Next, the impacts on the Uruguay's balance of payments, energy security and tax revenues have been estimated and added to the previous effects. When it comes to value added, bioethanol from sugarcane ranks first among the considered biofuels with 431 million US$2018, followed by bioethanol from sorghum and biodiesel. As to job creation, around 34,000 full time new jobs are created as a result of sugarcane bioethanol, twice as much as from biodiesel. Of these figures, rural employment share represents a 13% and 6% in the case of sugarcane bioethanol and biodiesel respectively. On concluding result from this study is that while biofuel production costs in Uruguay are higher than fossil fuel, when the economic effects on tax revenues and balance of payments are added to the previous socio-economic impacts, the total benefits from biofuels compensate the extra costs. However, this situation may be altered in the future as a result of changes in biofuel production costs, fiscal policies as well as import and export prices variations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In addition to undesirable odorous gases, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly methane (CH4), are generated during the storage of livestock manure. To reduce the CH4 emissions, first, pig slurry (PS) was stored for 40 d at 30 °C after adjusting the pH at 5.0–7.0 using H2SO4 solution. In the control (non-acidified PS), 3.7 kg CO2 eq./ton PS of CH4 emissions was detected, which was reduced to 1.8, 0.9, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 kg CO2 eq./ton PS at pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0, respectively. Methanosarcina was found to be the dominant genus (67% of the total archaeal sequence) in the control, whose dominance was reduced as storage pH decreased. The results of ribonucleic acid analysis and specific methanogenic activity test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens by acidification. Later, the biochemical CH4 potential of stored PS was tested. Compared to the control (10.6 L CH4/L PS), the acidified PS showed higher CH4 yields of 12.7–14.6 L CH4/L PS, presumably by keeping degradable organic matters in PS under acidic condition. Among different acidification pHs tested, the maximum amount of GHG reduction was achieved at pH 6.0 by reducing CH4 emission to +0.4 kg CO2 eq./ton PS during storage while increasing biogas production potential equivalent to 48.3 kWh/ton PS (−22.5 kg CO2 eq./ton PS), resulting in a further reduction of (−)9.6 kg CO2 eq./ton PS compared to the control. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this paper was to compare the markets and methods of production of ethanol to be used in transport in Poland and Brazil. Differences in terminology associated with its use for transport purposes in both countries have been discussed, as well as the market-related aspects of such use, comparing, among other things, the scale of production and use in years 2010–2016 and presenting the results of research on attractiveness (value) of the market of transport biofuels (especially bioethanol) in Poland, which were compared to the perspectives of market development in Brazil. In Brazil, the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption is at the level of 42%, making it a world leader in use of energy from RES (renewable energy sources). 18% of the energy used is sugarcane bioenergy (bioethanol). At present, most of this production is being consumed by the domestic market, where ethyl alcohol is being sold as a pure ethanol fuel or mixed with gasoline. In Poland, the share of energy from renewable sources in end use of energy is 11.8%, and energy from liquid biofuels, including bioethanol, constitutes only 10.8% of this value. Although addition of bioethanol to gasoline available on the Polish market is acceptable, vehicles fueled with pure ethanol (like in Brazil) are not popular in Poland. The quantitative data presented indicates that the market of bioethanol in Poland, in relation to the Brazilian market of ethanol fuel, is very small. Production of this biofuel in Poland in year 2016 was almost 26 billion liters lower in comparison with Brazil. In 2007 the conventional biofuel sectors in Poland were considered to be relatively attractive components of the economy. In the case of methyl esters, the value of their production sector achieved the level of almost 68%, and of ethanol – almost 62%. The current results of research on the value of biofuel sectors in Poland are not encouraging in terms of investing in biofuels of this generation (conventional biofuels). Brazil has the longest history of success in terms of biofuels, in particular, bioethanol, however without a favorable taxation system, bioethanol is still more expensive than gasoline. According to forecasts, biodiesel production and consumption in Brazil are evolving in a linear manner, mainly due to the growing demand for fuel and the associated growth in the fleet of Brazilian vehicles and the perspective of increase of the biodiesel/diesel oil mix in the coming years. © 2018

AB  - The development of bioethanol can bring about socio-economic and environmental impacts. To support the sustainability analysis of bioethanol development and the decision-making on bioethanol promotion in Thailand, this study aims at assessing the socio-economic and environmental effects of bioethanol production using recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling. The assessment is carried out based on the bioethanol production targets in Thailand's Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2015, capturing cassava ethanol and molasses ethanol. Simulation scenarios are set up to incorporate the role of bioethanol support policies, such as tax reduction, production efficiency improvement, and widening the price gap between gasoline and gasohol, into the analysis. The results show that increasing bioethanol production together with improving the efficiency of feedstock cultivation is the most efficient way to enhance economic growth. However, the higher production and consumption would also lead to more irrigation water demand and air emissions. The presentation of bioethanol support policies’ role in promoting bioethanol along with widespread socio-economic and environmental effects focus are novel. Not only are the results useful for the decision-making towards sustainable bioethanol development, the methods presented in this study should also be a guideline for other socio-economic and environmental impact assessment schemes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The United States (US) Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard support the use of soy biodiesel and renewable diesel in the transport fuel supply for climate mitigation. However, linkages between the markets for soy oil and palm oil, which is associated with very high land use change emissions, could negatively affect the climate performance of soy-based biofuels. This study estimates the own and cross-price elasticities for the supply of soy and palm oils in the US using country-level data from 1992 to 2016 under rational expectations, through a seemingly unrelated regressions system of equations. We find a positive cross-price elasticity of palm oil import with respect to soy oil price and a positive reaction of supply of soy oil to increase in prices of palm oil. These results suggest that US biofuel policies may underestimate substitution between soy and palm oils and thus overestimate the climate benefits from soy-based biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Poland depends on imports for its transportation fuel supply and EC renewable energy policy encourages rapeseed conversion into biodiesel. This paper discusses changes in winter rapeseed production following changes in sugar policy, decreased dependence on potato use as feed and food, and the EU 2007–2009 support program for production of oil seeds as biofuel feedstock. We examine whether farm cost efficiency scores differ across Poland's 16 regions between those growing rapeseed and all other farms using Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN) data. Farms growing rapeseed are more cost efficient in all regions, and while regions with long experience in growing rapeseed still dominate the production, rapeseed production is expanding into new areas. Subsidies offered under the EU support program likely initiated expansion and the expansion continues after the program expired. Less efficient farms can be encouraged to enter rapeseed production through farm outreach services and competitive prices in relation to other crops since the available land permits further expansion of this biodiesel feedstock production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The spatial dimension is a key paradigm in price determination, as attested by recent studies in the literature that highlighted the differential in market behavior between spatial and non-spatial pricing settings. In this paper, we develop a model of spatial pricing for multi-market heterogeneously distributed resources, with an application to the Swedish forestry sector. The focus of the model is to estimate the impact of spatial interaction on the demand for resources in terms of resource allocation, competition, and pricing. In its core, the pricing mechanism relies on a supply–demand framework. Using disaggregated data at the gridcell level for forest feedstock supply and harvesting costs in Sweden, we construct regional supply curves for each gridcell assuming a maximum transportation distance to delimit the potential market. Demand nodes are exogenously determined and are adjusted using a distance-decay model to assess demand pressure across locations. We apply the model empirically to assess the impact on forest feedstock prices of a 20 TWh increase in biofuel production. © 2018 The Ohio State University

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has enabled consideration of environmental impacts beyond the narrow boundary of traditional engineering methods. This reduces the chance of shifting impacts outside the system boundary. However, sustainability also requires that supporting ecosystems are not adversely affected and remain capable of providing goods and services for supporting human activities. Conventional LCA does not account for this role of nature, and its metrics are best for comparing alternatives. These relative metrics do not provide information about absolute environmental sustainability, which requires comparison between the demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). Techno-ecological synergy (TES) is a framework to account for ES, and has been demonstrated by application to systems such as buildings and manufacturing activities that have narrow system boundaries. This article develops an approach for techno-ecological synergy in life cycle assessment (TES-LCA) by expanding the steps in conventional LCA to incorporate the demand and supply of ecosystem goods and services at multiple spatial scales. This enables calculation of absolute environmental sustainability metrics, and helps identify opportunities for improving a life cycle not just by reducing impacts, but also by restoring and protecting ecosystems. TES-LCA of a biofuel life cycle demonstrates this approach by considering the ES of carbon sequestration, air quality regulation, and water provisioning. Results show that for the carbon sequestration ecosystem service, farming can be locally sustainable but unsustainable at the global or serviceshed scale. Air quality regulation is unsustainable at all scales, while water provisioning is sustainable at all scales for this study in the eastern part of the United States. © 2018 by Yale University

AB  - In this paper, we study the optimization problem of maximizing biogas production at steady state in a two-stage anaerobic digestion model, which was initially proposed in Bernard et al. (Biotechnol Bioeng 75(4):424–438, 2001). Nominal operating points, consisting of steady states where the involved microorganisms coexist, are usually referred to as desired operational conditions, in particular for maximizing biogas production. Nevertheless, we prove that under some conditions related to input substrate concentrations and microorganism biology, characterized by their growth functions, the optimal steady state can be the extinction of one of the two species. We provide some numerical examples of this situation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The regulation of genes related to lipid metabolism by genetic engineering is an important way to increase the accumulation of lipids in microalgae. DNA binding with one finger (DOF) is a plant-specific transcription factor in higher plants, where it regulates carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways by regulating key genes involved in these pathways. Overexpression of DOF can increase lipid production in plants; however, it is not clear whether overexpression of DOF can increase lipids in microalgae. Results: In this study, we cloned a DOF transcription factor, crDOF, from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The sequence of this transcription factor is 1875 bp and encodes a peptide of 624 amino acids with a conserved DOF domain. Overexpression of crDOF in C. reinhardtii significantly increased the intracellular lipid content. The content of total fatty acids in the transgenic algae line Tranc-crDOF-12 was 126.01 μg/mg (dry weight), which was 23.24% higher than that of the wild type. Additionally, the content of unsaturated fatty acids in the transgenic Tranc-crDOF-12 line increased significantly. Fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis showed that in the transgenic line Tranc-crDOF-12, the expression levels of BCC1, FAT1, SQD1, MGD1, DGD1 and PGP1 genes were significantly upregulated, while the expression levels of ACP1, ACS1, CIS1 and SQD2 were downregulated. Conclusions: Our results confirm that crDOF increases intracellular lipids in C. reinhardtii by regulating key genes involved in lipid metabolism. According to these findings, we propose that enhancing the lipid content in microalgae by overexpressing DOF may be achieved in other industrial strains of microalgae and be employed for the industrial production of biodiesel. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels play a critical role in the Paris Agreement to help achieve climate change mitigation targets. However, a significant increase in production of biofuels might potentially be realized at the expense of overusing natural resources, particularly land and water. Understanding the tradeoffs between the impacts on land and water arises as a critical issue in the development of biofuels. This energy-water-land nexus might be particularly important for Brazil, which currently is the world's second largest producer and the largest exporter of biofuels. Furthermore, Brazil itself has set up its own Intended Nationally Determined Contribution agenda with a significant growth of biofuel production (18%) by 2030. Most studies on environmental impacts of biofuel production have either focused on land use or water use, but very few studies assessed both. Using an environmentally extended multiregional input-output (MRIO) approach, this study analyzes the current water-land nexus of bioenergy production in Brazil by quantifying the distribution of tradeoffs and synergies between land and water use for bioethanol production and its environmental consequences across Brazilian states. Our results show a clear tradeoff of water and land impacts and significant differences between irrigated and rainfed ethanol production. When including water and land scarcity in the analysis, the results are significantly different, uncovering very different tradeoffs and synergies between bioethanol producer and consumer states that could inform the expansion of bioenergy in Brazil. Compared to other crops, sugarcane has a higher comparative advantage relative to land than to water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomethane produced from waste-derived biomass (biowaste) is a clean and renewable fuel, which offers substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. Biomethane is currently produced via the “biogas road” which includes the anaerobic digestion of wet biowaste and a successive upgrading of obtained biogas, with good environmental performance. An alternative production strategy is the “syngas road” which includes the gasification of dry or semi-dry biowaste followed by cleaning, conditioning, methanation, and final upgrading of obtained syngas. It is still at a demonstration level but appears of great interest for the highest values of energy efficiency and carbon utilisation. The study acquired technical data from existing plants of both these strategies, and developed a quantitative environmental assessment by means of holistic tools of sustainable engineering: material and substance flow analyses and an attributional life cycle assessment. The technical and environmental performance of the two biomethane roads have been then compared, in terms of energy and process efficiency as well as potential impacts in the main midpoint categories (global warming, respiratory inorganics, and non-renewable energy). The syngas road appears to have higher levels of carbon utilisation and better environmental performance, even though an extended sensitivity analysis shows different results if alternative plant configurations and energy mix are considered. This suggests that R&D studies and policies of economic incentives have to be further implemented for both the analysed strategies, even because they deal with different kind of biowaste, having different availability in different countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Managing the complex demands on available energy, food and water is a fundamental challenge for a world with increasingly tenuous resource pools. The North China Plain's groundwater crisis has become increasingly serious due to decades-long over-exploitation for irrigation to pursue high grain yield. This combined challenge motivated investigation of ways to mitigate the groundwater table decline while fostering the use of renewable bioenergy resources. To provide insights about tradeoffs among water, food and energy, we performed a six-year experiment from 2010 to 2015 in the North China Plain where groundwater use, biomass and biofuel production and water use efficiency were compared for four cropping systems. They are winter wheat-summer maize (WM, grains, 1-year cycle), ryegrass–sweet sorghum (RS, forage plus bioenergy crops, 1-year cycle), winter wheat–summer maize→ ryegrass–sweet sorghum (WMRS, forage, bioenergy plus grain crops, 2-year cycle), and perennial switchgrass (SG, bioenergy crop). Actual evapotranspiration (ET a ) and recharge to groundwater were calculated and validated using observed soil moisture contents. Results showed ET a of the cropping systems were statistically similar ranging from 694 to 730 mm yr −1 with the exception of switchgrass which was significantly less at 504 mm yr -1 . The water table was projected to decline by about 1.3 m yr -1 for all three multi-crop rotations and 0.4 m yr -1 for switchgrass. In terms of bioethanol production per unit land and per unit ET a , the ryegrass-sweet sorghum (RS) rotation performed best with 25.0 m 3 ha -1 and 5.7 L m -3 outperforming the yearly winter wheat–summer maize (WM) rotation (11.7 m 3 ha -1 and 3.3 L m -3 ) and switchgrass (11.4 m 3 ha -1 and 2.6 L m -3 ). The multiple year rotation of winter wheat–summer maize→ ryegrass–sweet sorghum (WMRS) yielded 16.9 m 3 bioethanol per hectare and 4.3 L m -3 bioethanol per m 3 ET a . When optimizing bioethanol against net groundwater depletion, RS and switchgrass outperformed the two grain-based rotations with 15.5 L and 14.4 L of bioethanol per m 3 of depleted groundwater, ahead of WMRS at 10.9 L m -3 and WM at 9.1 L m -3 . These results are significant for setting governmental policies on sustainable use of groundwater by various crop mixes. © 2019

AB  - In this paper we identify a concept of countries’ biomass-related sustainability through a revision of the literature and the opinion of professionals, and identify the main reasons that prevent biomass from being a major source of energy production (adversities and constraints). The Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology was used for establishing the causal and hierarchical relationships among the variables linked with the adversities and constraints associated with the production of biofuel from biomass and their impact on countries’ biomass-related sustainability. At the base of the concept of biomass related countries’ sustainability we identify an important constraint associated with the high energy production costs, but also the necessity of supporting new investments, which will drive technological innovations in this sector and allow for an increase in efficiency. The paper presents an innovative approach to the research of biofuel production from biomass by suggesting not only a concept of countries’ biomass-related sustainability but also by exploring causal and hierarchical relationships between adversities/constraints of biofuel production and impact on countries’ sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of low-cost feedstocks such as waste cooking oils has gained prominence in biodiesel production due to its potential economic and environmental advantages. Since these feedstocks are derived from multiple sources, its compositional variability has led to quality concerns that may significantly limit its utilization. One potential strategy to address this concern is to use stochastic blending models to optimize the mixing of secondary and primary oils (e.g., palm, canola, or soya). In this paper, we present a stochastic blending model that embeds a second, key source of uncertainty: the future price of feedstocks, a topic of tremendous concern for producers. The stochastic blending model embeds a chance-constrained formulation to account for compositional variability and uses time-series methods to address feedstock price uncertainty. The model was developed to support production-planning decisions to minimize cost and cost variation in biodiesel production. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is useful for determining an optimal planning of feedstock acquisition, blending and storage in order to minimize the risks associated with feedstock price fluctuations. Results show that addressing the compositional uncertainty via the chance-constrained formulation will allow for the use of waste cooking oil in biodiesel blends without compromising their technical performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels have been proposed as a potential solution for climate change mitigation. However, there exist several barriers, such as “food vs fuel” issues and technological constraints, restricting the sustainable commercialization of both first- and second-generation biofuels. Combining arable crops and their residues for hybrid first- and second-generation biofuel production provides opportunities to overcome these barriers. This study presents a high-resolution quantitative tool to support decision-making in feedstock production and sourcing for hybrid biofuel supply chains. We demonstrate this work with a case study on optimizing feedstock landscape design for a hybrid corn grain- and stover-based ethanol production system at Front Range Energy biorefinery, Windsor, Colorado, USA using a coupled simulation modeling and life-cycle assessment approach. The case study considered three competing design objectives including the minimization of feedstock-delivered costs, farm-to-refinery greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and nitrogen (N) leaching, subject to constraints in land use and biofuel feedstock demand. Social costs of carbon (SC-CO2) and nitrogen leaching (SC-NL) were used as weighting factors for GHG and N leaching in the objective function. Our results showed that marginal decreases of feedstock-delivered costs (below $0.31 L−1), N leaching (below 0.44 g N L−1), and GHG emissions (below 125 g CO2e L−1) resulted in extreme trade-offs among the design objectives. Changes in feedstock landscape design were most sensitive to the variations of the SC-CO2 between $400 and $800 per Mg CO2e, SC-NL between $0 and $50 per kg N leaching, and their ratio between 0 and 350, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effective treatment of food waste is inherently difficult due to several factors, including its heterogeneous composition, high moisture content, and low heating value. To address these issues, this study aims to convert food waste into an energy resource using naturally occurring fermentative microorganisms embedded in wooden biochips (bio-catalysis), utilizing a “Smart Food Waste Recycling Bin” (S-FRB) system. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis identified the major aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria with alpha-diversity in terms of the Phylogenetic Diversity index ranging from 40.8 (initial stage) to 24.5 (mature stage), which indicates the microbial communities are relatively homogeneous and effective for use in the S-FBR. Operational results indicated that the organic content of food waste traded in the system increased from 53% up to 72% in the final end-product and achieved a mass reduction rate of approximately 80%. The heating value of the end-product, which was 3300 kcal/kg waste when measured by the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method, confirmed its high potential as a biofuel. Overall, the S-FRB system presents a practical approach for food waste treatment that solves the putrescible waste problem and maximizes utility through resource circulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid increase in human population, per capita food consumption (i.e., meat-intensive diet), and biofuel production further drives increasing demand for land. One critical solution is agricultural intensification of crop yield (i.e., crop production per unit area) improvement on the existing croplands. Therefore, the pressure to convert other land for food production can be reduced. Here, we used a panel data of the three most important crops (i.e., corn, soybean, and wheat) in the US Midwest to explore trends of change in agricultural yields and cropland areas at both county and crop levels during 1974–2008. We then utilized mapping to visualize and explicitly examine the spatial patterns of land-sparing and agricultural expansion. Finally, we related cropland area changes to changes in yield and other factors that may impact the contraction/expansion of cropland areas. We detected agricultural expansion with yield increases when considering all counties together. However, cropland area increases were less rapid than rises in crop production. Counties located at the southern periphery of the Corn Belt experienced land-sparing, whereas counties located at the western margin of the Corn Belt, that are more arid and potentially require higher input, exhibited highest agricultural expansion. Higher crop prices and USDA farm subsidies were associated with agricultural expansion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass yield and adaptability to a broad range of environments are important characteristics of dedicated energy crops for sustainable bioenergy feedstock production. In addition to yield potential, the role of species diversity on ecosystem services is also growing in importance as we seek to develop sustainable feedstock production systems. The objective of this study was to compare the biomass yield potential of the commercially available germplasm of native warm-season grasses in monocultures and in blends (mixture of different cultivars of the same species) or mixtures of different species across an environmental gradient (temperature and precipitation) in the Midwest, USA. Warm-season grasses including switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans [L.] Nash), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula [Michx.] Torr.) and Miscanthus × giganteus (Greef and Deu.) were planted in 2009. Biomass was annually harvested from 2010 through 2015 for Urbana, IL and Mead, NE but only in 2010 and 2011 for Ames, IA. The effect of species in monocultures and mixtures (or blends) on biomass yields was significant for all locations. In monocultures, the annual biomass yields averaged over a 6-year period were 11.12 Mg ha −1 and 10.98 Mg ha −1 at Urbana and Mead, respectively, while the annual biomass yield averaged over a 2-year period was 7.99 Mg ha −1 at Ames, IA. Also, the annual biomass yields averaged across the different mixtures and blends at each location were 10.25 Mg ha −1 , 9.88 Mg ha −1 , and 7.64 Mg ha −1 at Urbana, Mead, and Ames, respectively. At all locations, M. × giganteus and ‘Kanlow N1’ produced the highest biomass yield in monocultures while mixtures containing switchgrass and big bluestem had the greatest mixture yield. The results from this multi-environment study suggest mixtures of different species provided no yield advantage over monocultures for bioenergy feedstocks in Illinois and Nebraska and both systems consistently produced biomass as long as April–July precipitation was near or above the average precipitation (300 mm) of the regions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Grass ley and whole-crop cereals used for biogas production are often finely chopped for subsequent ensiling and anaerobic digestion. Chopping can impact not only ensiling stability, digestibility and risk of process hick-ups in the digester but also harvesting capacity and fuel consumption. Based on field experiment data, the aim of this study was to investigate how three different nominal cutting lengths in the range of 3.5 mm to 12.5 mm impact methane yield and economic viability of grass ley and whole-crop cereals used as biogas substrate. A shorter cutting length affected the specific methane potential differently for the different crops, + 14 to − 25%. In biogas vehicle fuel production, balancing the additional energy and economic costs for shorter cutting length required an increased methane potential of less than 1% and 3%, respectively. As long as a decrease in cutting length increased the methane potential, the energy balance and economic result improved, despite higher energy inputs. However, mechanisms behind the impact on methane potential deserve further attention. In conclusion, we have shown that it is economically viable to produce methane gas, as a vehicle fuel, from several agricultural crops grown in the south of Sweden, i.e. grass ley and whole-crop rye and wheat, when they are harvested/chopped with a forager, ensiled as biogas feedstocks and processed to methane gas in a large-scale biogas plant. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Drought-tolerant, industrial oilseeds such as Camelina sativa (camelina) grown on marginal land are being considered as feedstock alternatives to meet the increasing biofuel demand and reduce the dependency on water and food resources. However, crops grown on rural, marginal lands are not well-connected with transportation networks and biofuel plants. Transportation routes and biofuel plant development should be optimized for sustainable biofuel development. This study aimed at developing a supply chain optimization model for biodiesel produced from camelina oilseed. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model associated with geographic information system (GIS) was built. Three echelons of camelina oilseed supply, biodiesel production, and biodiesel and by-product (livestock meal) demand were considered to optimize the numbers, locations, and capacities of new plants, transportation routes, and the utilization rate of existing plants at a minimum cost. A case study was conducted for the northern Great Plains (NGP) region of Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota. Transportation cost compared to plant construction cost was a decisive factor in supply chain configuration. The model developed in this study simulates minimum cost transportation routes directly through the GIS network analysis, which is differentiated from other studies analyzing the shortest routes in GIS and calculating their transportation costs in models. This is beneficial in seeking economic routes which incorporate multiple modes for regions having a spartan infrastructure. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Invasive species represent one of the greatest risks to global biodiversity and economic productivity of agroecosystems. The development of certain novel crops—e.g., herbaceous perennial biomass crops—may create a risk of novel invasions by these crops. Therefore, potential benefits and risks need to be weighed in making decisions about their introduction and subsequent management. Ideally, such a weighing will be based on good estimates of invasion risks in realistic scenarios pertaining to actual landscapes of concern. Most previous large-scale analyses of invasion risk have used species distribution models and their established methods. Unfortunately, these approaches are unable to incorporate local scale biotic and spatial factors that influence invasion risk. Here we present a case study for how such factors can be efficiently incorporated in large-scale analyses of invasion risk, by extending simulation models with statistical modeling tools. By these means, we predict invasion risk at the scale of the entire United States for a major biomass crop, Miscanthus × giganteus. We then combine invasion risk predictions for this method with those from bioclimatic methods, producing a map of aggregated invasion risk that can offer more nuanced predictions of invasion risk than either approach alone. Lastly, we evaluate potential risks for invasive crops that differ in invasiveness traits, to examine how geographic patterns of invasion risk vary among invaders as a result of their particular constellation of traits. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The main goal of this research is to use the biomass productivity, carbohydrate content, and carbohydrate productivity as useful responses for optimization of macronutrients concentrations (K2HPO4, NaHCO3, and NaNO3) in cultivation of Spirulina microalgae as a feedstock for bioethanol production. In this study, individual and synergistic effects of medium components on the mentioned responses were investigated. The culture medium was optimized using central composite design for achieving the maximize biomass productivity (165 mg L−1 day−1 at K2HPO4: 438 mg L−1, NaHCO3: 15.92 g L−1, and NaNO3: 0.5 g L−1), carbohydrate content (42.0% of dry mass at K2HPO4: 192 mg L−1, NaHCO3: 5.71 g L−1, and NaNO3: 0.63 g L−1), and finally carbohydrate productivity (56.97 mg L−1 day−1 at K2HPO4: 359 mg L−1, NaHCO3: 9.80 g L−1, and NaNO3: 0.60 g L−1). The most significant factors on the biomass productivity and carbohydrate productivity were K2HPO4 and NaHCO3. On the other hand, NaHCO3 was the most effective factor on the carbohydrate content. The results showed a significant interaction between K2HPO4 and NaNO3 (p value &lt; 0.05) on the biomass productivity and carbohydrate productivity. In addition, the model revealed a significant interaction between K2HPO4 and NaHCO3 on the carbohydrate content. The concentrations of NaNO3 and NaHCO3 in modified medium were remarkably lower than those in Zarrouk medium. Some possible metabolic pathways causing these effects and interactions were discussed. © 2017, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The issue of sustainability assessment of biodiesel production has increasingly gained importance due to the interest of governments in drawing up sovereignty strategies, to diversify their energy matrix and to determine the impact of biofuels production. In this context, this work proposes a system dynamics model to assess biodiesel production in a specific context. A System Dynamics model was developed and applied to assess the sustainability of the conditions in the baseline scenario of biodiesel production in Colombia. Simulation of current biodiesel production showed that a strong support from government policies is required related to the promotion of an increase of the contents of biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blend, as well as of the production capacity. Certain dynamics were observed as a result of the modeling, the increase oil palm cultivation, can be related to a lesser rate of displacement of the population, of poverty and of emissions of pollutants affecting air quality (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter). Results also predicted that the increase in oil palm cultivation under baseline scenario could boost inequitable distribution of land ownership and increase greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in palm oil cultivation, and reduce food security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a need to explore renewable alternatives (e.g., biofuels) that can produce energy sources to help reduce the reliance on fossil oils. In addition, the consumption of fossil oils adversely affects the environment and human health via the generation of waste water, greenhouse gases, and waste solids. Camelina sativa, originated from southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia, is being re-embraced as an industrial oilseed crop due to its high seed oil content (36–47%) and high unsaturated fatty acid composition (>90%), which are suitable for jet fuel, biodiesel, high-value lubricants and animal feed. C. sativa’s agronomic advantages include short time to maturation, low water and nutrient requirements, adaptability to adverse environmental conditions and resistance to common pests and pathogens. These characteristics make it an ideal crop for sustainable agricultural systems and regions of marginal land. However, the lack of genetic and genomic resources has slowed the enhancement of this emerging oilseed crop and exploration of its full agronomic and breeding potential. Here, a core of 213 spring C. sativa accessions was collected and genotyped. The genotypic data was used to characterize genetic diversity and population structure to infer how natural selection and plant breeding may have affected the formation and differentiation within the C. sativa natural populations, and how the genetic diversity of this species can be used in future breeding efforts. A total of 6,192 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.29 indicate moderate genetic diversity for the C. sativa spring panel evaluated in this report. Population structure and principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) based on SNPs revealed two distinct subpopulations. Sub-population 1 (POP1) contains accessions that mainly originated from Germany while the majority of POP2 accessions (>75%) were collected from Eastern Europe. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) identified 4% variance among and 96% variance within subpopulations, indicating a high gene exchange (or low genetic differentiation) between the two subpopulations. These findings provide important information for future allele/gene identification using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and marker-assisted selection (MAS) to enhance genetic gain in C. sativa breeding programs. © 2019 Luo, Brock, Dyer, Kutchan, Schachtman, Augustin, Ge, Fahlgren and Abdel-Haleem.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program specifies a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction threshold for cellulosic biofuels, while the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program in California does not. Here, we investigate the effects of the GHG threshold under the RFS on projected GHG savings from two corn stover-based biofuel supply chain systems in the United States Midwest. The analysis is based on a techno-economic framework that minimizes ethanol selling price. The GHG threshold lowers the lifecycle GHG of ethanol: 34.39 ± 4.92 gCO2 MJ-1 in the RFS-compliant system and 46.30 ± 10.05 gCO2 MJ-1 in the non RFS-compliant system. However, hypothetical biorefinery systems complying with the RFS will not process the more GHG-intensive corn stover, and thus much less biofuel will be produced compared to the non RFS-compliant system. Thus, taken as a whole, the non RFS-compliant system would achieve more GHG savings than an RFS-compliant system: 10.7 TgCO2 year-1 in the non RFS-compliant system compared with 4.4 TgCO2 year-1 in the RFS-compliant system. These results suggest that the current RFS GHG reduction threshold may not be the most efficient way to carry out the purposes of the Energy Security and Independence Act in the corn stover-based biofuel system: relaxing the threshold could actually increase the overall GHG savings from corn stover-based biofuels. Therefore, the LCFS-type regulatory approach is recommended for the corn stover-based cellulosic biofuel system under the RFS program. In addition, our calculation of the GHG balance for stover-based biofuel accounts for SOC losses, while the current RFS estimates do not include effects on SOC. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper reviews the domestic political and legislative context surround biofuels initiatives to highlight what opportunities exist for establishing a biofuels trade network between South Africa (as an anchor market) and its neighbours, specifically in Zambia and Mozambique. By analysing global developments in major biofuel importers, reasons for policy inertia in South Africa, and recent experiences with biofuels investments, we suggest that the likelihood for a regional biofuels market developing is slender without addressing land-related challenges in producer countries and revising South Africa’s domestic legislation. © 2019, © 2019 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - This introductory paper sets out the rationale for revisiting questions surrounding biofuel futures in Southern Africa and exploring the case for the establishment of a regional market. This contrasts with most research that has focused upon benefits and risks of production and consumption for individual countries. The analysis in this issue suggests that while benefits exist, the key challenges that have stifled production and consumption to date would need to be overcome. Unlocking trade requires relaxing requirements for South African manufacturers to source all their feedstock domestically. Key among factors to encourage production is resolving agricultural investment processes, particularly designing inclusive business models and clarifying land acquisition processes. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - Potential biofuel demand in South Africa is estimated to increase to 1550 million litres by 2025 due to mandatory blending rates. Land and water constraints, however, limit the ability for domestic production. Zambia, due to its abundance in land, suitable climate, supportive set of bioenergy incentives and close geographical location to South Africa, has the potential to meet this increase in demand. Using a dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model, we estimate the macro- and socio-economic impacts of bioethanol production in Zambia from three potential crops: sugarcane, cassava and sweet sorghum. The results show that the development of a single product bioethanol industry has the potential to increase economic growth without negatively affecting overall food security. Further expansion of the industry to multiple products results in larger gains to growth and welfare. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER. Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Management models are needed that empower local communities to produce biofuel feedstock in a manner that drives rural development. Much can be learnt through the accumulated experiences of sugarcane outgrower schemes in southern Africa. Early schemes provided limited empowerment, but protected outgrowers from the risks of volatile sugar value chains. In later schemes, processing plants were responsible for all operations and simply paid dividends to participating farmers. More recent schemes offer full ownership, which comes with greater rewards and empowerment, but also exposure to risks. The underlying institutional structures of outgrower schemes largely dictate their performance, and thus the factors that affect their viability or collapse. To understand the different institutional arrangements of sugarcane outgrower schemes we undertake a comparative analysis of 13 schemes in southern Africa employing a political economy framework that uses the three key questions: ‘who owns what’, ‘who does what’, and ‘who gets what’. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - World biofuel production has been increasing to improve energy security and mitigate global warming. Southern Africa’s bioenergy demand could increase with South Africa’s planned fuel blending mandates, triggering increased demand for feedstocks and agricultural land. Ensuring sustained production will require a full understanding of the constraints to production expansion, considering the tradeoffs that may be generated in rural areas, as has been observed for large-scale land acquisitions. We analyse the social and biophysical constraints to biofuel production expansion in Zambia. Previously social constraints have received limited attention even though they may prove more problematic. Results indicate that Zambia is at least moderately suitable for bioenergy investments with biophysically suitable areas largely coinciding with the socially suitable areas. However, existing gaps in compensatory procedures may inhibit large-scale projects’ access to development finance if not aligned with internationally acceptable practices, and generate negative outcomes if safeguards are not in place. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - The benefits of biofuels depend on the feedstock, conversion pathway and local context. This paper assesses biofuels technology readiness and developments to provide foresight to biofuels development in Southern Africa. Efficient conversion pathways, coupled with biomass from waste or high-yielding energy crops, will reduce both the costs of biofuels production, and the environmental impacts. Compared to petroleum fuels, the current commercial biofuels (ethanol, biogas and biodiesel) typically offer carbon emission reductions of 30–50% but are marginally more expensive. The extent of biofuels market penetration will therefore be influenced by mandates (blending targets) and subsidies (green premium). Advanced biofuels promise greater efficiencies and carbon emission reductions at reduced cost but will require further research and development to reach commercialisation. If developed appropriately, biofuels can reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security, while enabling sustainable agriculture and improved natural resources management. © 2018, © 2018 UNU-WIDER.

AB  - Two inorganic solids have been evaluated as supports of Lipozyme RM IM, a Rhizomucor miehei lipase immobilized on a macroporous anion exchange resin, in order to improve its application as a biocatalyst in the synthesis of biofuels. The experimental conditions have been optimized to get the selective transesterification of sunflower oil, by using a multi-factorial design based on the response surface methodology (RSM). In this way, the effects of several reaction parameters on the selective ethanolysis of triglycerides to produce Ecodiesel, a biodiesel-like biofuel constitute by one mole of monoglyceride (MG) and two moles of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE), have been evaluated. Thus, it was obtained that a 6:1 oil/ethanol molar ratio, 0.215 g of biocatalyst supported in silica-gel (0.015 g Lipase/0.2 g silica-gel), 50 µL of 10 N NaOH, together with previous optimized reaction parameters, 35 ◦ C reaction temperature and 120 min of reaction time, gave the best results (conversions around 70%; selectivity around 65%; kinematic viscosities about 9.3 mm 2 /s) in the reaction studied. Besides, Lipozyme RM IM, supported on silica-gel, biocatalyst exhibited a very good stability, remaining its activity even after 15 cycles. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Fossil fuel such as coal, natural gas, oil and recently shale gas are perhaps the most economically viable means for energy generation but are laden with inexhaustible environmental consequences. Thus, biofuel development has received tremendous support from all quarters in response to quest for energy security and clean energy. However, the rapid rate of development of bioenergy has also raised concern chiefly for its nexus with food security with some scholar considering it a disaster especially for countries in the global south. Due to her prime location along the equator, and the generally favourable climatic conditions all through the year, Nigeria is considered to have enormous potential for bioenergy development. Unfortunately, Nigeria is also highly ranked in the 2018 Global Hunger Index (GHI) of International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). Rested mainly on exploratory approach, this study analyses the bioenergy potential of Nigeria and the implications of the fast-rising market on food security in the Nigerian context. Critical investigation on the food crop-bioenergy trade-offs was conducted while bioenergy development implications were analysed in the context of the four dimensions of food security. Lastly, mitigative measures to bioenergy development impacts were discussed and one key proposition is need to strengthen the second and third generation technology for biofuel production in Nigeria. © 2019 Saheed Matemilola, Isa O.

AB  - Native warm-season grasses (NWSG) are gaining merit as biofuel feedstocks for ethanol production with potential for concomitant production of cattle forage and wildlife habitat provision. However, uncertainty continues regarding optimal production approaches for biofuel yield and forage quality within landscapes of competing wildlife conservation objectives. We used a randomized complete block design of 4 treatments to compare vegetation structure, forage and biomass nutrients, and biomass yield between Panicum virgatum (Switchgrass) monocultures and NWSG polycultures harvested once or multiple times near West Point, MS, 2011-2013. Despite taller vegetation and greater biomass in Switchgrass monocultures, NWSG polycultures had greater vegetation structure heterogeneity and plant diversity that could benefit wildlife. However, nutritional content from harvest timings optimal for wildlife conservation (i.e., late dormant season-collected biomass and mid-summer hay samples) demonstrated greater support for biofuel production than quality cattle forage. Future research should consider testing various seed mixes for maximizing biofuel or forage production among multiple site conditions with parallel observations of wildlife use. © 2019 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

AB  - Expansion of ethanol production in the United States has raised concerns regarding its land-use change effects. However, little is known about the extent to which observed land use change in the United States can be attributed to ethanol plant proximity or is caused by changes in crop prices that may be partly induced by expansion in ethanol production. This study aims to examine the determinants of changes in corn acreage and aggregate crop acreage by simultaneously identifying the effects of establishment of ethanol plants serving as terminal markets for corn and the effects of changes in crop prices in the United States between 2003 and 2014. Our results show that corn acreage and total acreage are fairly inelastic with respect to both changes in ethanol capacity in the vicinity, as well as changes in crop prices. Our estimates of acreage elasticity with respect to corn ethanol production are smaller than those obtained by previous studies that disregard the price effect on crop acreage. We find that, ceteris paribus, the increase in ethanol capacity alone led to a modest 3% increase in corn acreage and less than a 1% increase in total crop acreage by 2012 when compared to 2008. The effect of corn price and aggregate crop price on acreage change from 2008 to 2012 was more than twice larger than that of effective ethanol production capacity over this period; but this price effect was largely reversed by the downturn in crop prices after 2012. This study shows that land-use change is not a static phenomenon and that it is important to examine how it evolves in response to various factors that may change over time. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Carinata (Brassica carinata A. Braun) is an oilseed crop with potential as a winter crop in the southeastern United States to diversify crop rotations and provide biofuel production and livestock feed. The objective was to evaluate the effects of row spacing and seeding rate on carinata yield and oil composition. Field experiments were conducted in Jay and Quincy, FL, from 2013 to 2016 evaluating carinata growth, seed and oil yield, and oil composition grown in a factorial arrangement of four seeding rates (3, 6, 9, and 12 kg ha-1) and four row spacings (18, 36, 53, and 89 cm). No interactions between seeding rate and row spacing were detected. Seeding rate did not influence any of the variables studied. In contrast, row spacing affected seed and oil yield, branch production, and pods per plant. Seed yield (ranked from highest to lowest) was 2761, 2286, 1851, and 1572 kg ha-1 for rows spaced at 36, 18, 53, and 89 cm, respectively. Branching and pods per plant increased with row spacing. Neither seeding rate nor row spacing affected oil concentration and quality. Oil concentration averaged 40%, of which more than a third was erucic acid (C22:1). Protein concentration was 31%, and glucosinolate concentration was 93 µmol g-1. The results of the present study demonstrated that carinata can be successfully grown in the southeastern United States, reaching yields and oil quality similar to those reported at other latitudes, and can be a source of biofuel, protein for animal feed, and cropping system diversification for growers. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Information on the water quality impact of perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs) when grown in marginal lands as dedicated energy crops is limited. We studied how WSGs affected runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses and related near-surface soil properties to those of no-till corn (Zea mays L.) on an eroded soil in southwestern Iowa and a center pivot corner in east-central Nebraska. The experiment at the eroded soil was established in 2012, and treatments included ‘Liberty’ switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and no-till continuous corn. The experiment at the pivot corner was established in 2013 with ‘Liberty’ switchgrass, ‘Shawnee’ switchgrass, low-diversity grass mixture, and corn. We simulated rainfall at 63.5 ± 2.8 mm h −1 for 1 h to portray 5-yr return periods and measured water erosion in spring 2017. Time to runoff start and runoff depth did not differ between WSGs and corn. On the eroded soil, sediment and nutrient losses did not differ between treatments. At the pivot corner, sediment (0.71 vs. 0.15 Mg ha −1 ) and PO 4 –P (0.037 vs. 0.006 kg ha −1 ) losses were five times higher in corn than in WSGs. Near-surface soil properties did not differ on the eroded soil, but at the pivot corner, wet aggregate stability was four times higher and residue cover was 34% higher in WSGs than in corn. Water-stable aggregates were negatively correlated with NO 3 –N and PO 4 –P losses. Overall, WSGs can improve water quality in marginally productive croplands, but their effectiveness appears to be site specific.

AB  - Decarbonizing the air transportation sector remains one of the most challenging hurdles to mitigating climate change. Lignocellulosic biomass-derived jet fuel blendstocks can contribute to the shift toward renewable, low-carbon energy sources for aircrafts. Producing these renewable jet fuel molecules from biomass requires advanced pathways with the potential for efficient and affordable conversion routes. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic analysis and sensitivity analysis, including estimated minimum selling price (MSP), and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs for five routes to four potential bio-jet fuel molecules-limonane via limonene, limonane via 1,8-cineole, tetrahydromethylcyclopentadiene dimer (RJ-4), bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane. The simulated biorefineries utilize biomass sorghum and an integrated high-gravity ionic liquid-based biomass deconstruction process. We present results reflecting the current state of the technology and potential future scenarios with improved yields. Among the conversion pathways and the fuel molecules evaluated in this study, limonane, bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane could reach an MSP of $0.73-$0.91 per L-Jet A ($2.75-$3.45 per gal-Jet A) in optimized future cases, without a hypothetical lignin-derived co-product. RJ-4 requires a more costly upgrading process and catalysts, resulting in a comparatively higher MSP ($1.33 per L-Jet A or $5.04 per gal-jet A). Based on the GHG footprints of each fuel, the minimum achievable carbon mitigation cost relative to conventional Jet-A is $29 per metric ton CO2e, which is just under double the current cap-and-trade market price in California. In the absence of any policy support, the economics could be improved through high-value uses for lignin. To reach a target selling price of $0.66 per L-Jet A ($2.50 per gal), lignin-derived products would need to be sold for at least $1.9 per kg. However, the higher energy density of these bio-based blendstocks offers valuable improvements in aircraft efficiency/range; we find that commercial airlines may be willing to pay a 4-14 cent per L premium for these bio-jet fuels. Our results highlight the need for improvements beyond currently-reported yields for the biologically produced intermediates, identification of ideal microbial hosts, selection of metabolic pathways to achieve competitive production costs, and a focus on fuels with attractive properties that increase their value. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Food commodities have been used worldwide for both human consumption and energy, amid concerns of environmental degradation and damaging effects on local food systems. Presently, strategies of rural development have encompassed the use of green resources to produce biofuels and an agenda of food security. We argue that by the strengthening of a Sectorial System of Production and Innovation involving farming activity, industrial transformation and institutional support, production for food and for energy can be balanced. Our discussion contributes to the resolution of the potential conflict between agro-energy and food production and the role of public policies in stimulating second-generation ethanol based on remaining biomass. Based on the current literature and empirical evidences, the prospects for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil are examined, bearing in mind the development of a system able to produce second-generation ethanol, as a strategy able to mitigate negative effects on food security. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. However, they must comply with energy efficiency requirements and contribute to environmental protection. This study was focused on elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine) of different plants' components (stems, branches, twigs and leaves) from pyrolysed (charcoal) and non-pyrolysed samples of five semi-arid trees: Acacia berlandieri, A. wrightii, Ebenopsis ebano, Havardia pallens and Helietta parvifolia. Carbon fluctuated from 80.77% to 89.30% in charcoal and 44.99% to 49.70% in non-pyrolysed biomass, and hydrogen ranged from 2.38% to 2.69% in charcoal and 5.89% to 6.62% in non-pyrolysed biomass. Nitrogen accounted for 0.39%-0.65% (branches) and 0.32%-0.64% (stems) in charcoal, and the ranges for non-pyrolyzed material were 2.33-4.00% (leaves), 1.06%-1.76% (twigs), 0.21%-0.52% (branches) and 0.15%-0.28% (stems). Considerably higher concentrations of sulphur compared to chlorine were found, with increasing values for both elements from the base of trees to the leaves. Non-pyrolysed samples were characterized by 68.05 mg/kg-769.16 mg/kg (stems), 118.02 mg/kg-791.68 mg/kg (branches), 225.11 mg/kg-1742.25 mg/kg (twigs) and 374.73 mg/kg-6811.52 mg/kg (leaves) for sulphur, and 117.86 mg/kg-528.08 mg/kg (stems), 109.18 mg/kg-464.15 mg/kg (branches), 905.47 mg/kg-4205.19 mg/kg (twigs) and 2799.68 mg/kg-5072.76 mg/kg (leaves) for chlorine. In charcoal, the concentration ranges for sulphur were 47.54 mg/kg-376.95 mg/kg (branches) and 42.73-292.20 mg/kg (stems) and 139.34 mg/kg-419.68 mg/kg (branches) and 177.39 mg/kg-479.16 (stems) for chlorine. The study has shown that pyrolysis increased the amount of carbon and decreased the amount of hydrogen. Coincidentally, the amount of nitrogen, chlorine and sulphur could be decreased significantly by pyrolysis which means an improvement of the fuel considering the flue gas emissions. Besides the influence of the type of combustion plant and the influence of the source of biofuel, the treatment has a significant influence on the amount and composition of flue gases emitted in the combustion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated the potentiality of methane production from alginate-extracted (AEWLJ) and non-extracted (NAEWLJ) waste of Laminaria japonica through batch anaerobic fermentation in mono- and co-digestion with rice straw (RS) at different mixing ratios. Optimal C/N ratio was demonstrated, and system stability was monitored in terms of the total ammonia nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids, and pH throughout the digestion period. The results show that the combination of AEWLJ/RS at 67% mixing ratio generated the highest biogas yield of 247 NmL/gVS, which was 36% higher than the AEWLJ alone. The synergetic effect was clearly observed leading to an increase in the total methane yield up to 78% and 88%, respectively, for arrays of AEWLJ/RS and NAEWLJ/RS. The kinetic model showed a high coefficient of determination (R2 ≥ 0.9803) when the modified Gompertz model was applied to predict methane production. These outcomes support the possibility of an integrated biorefinery approach to attain value-added products in order to achieve circular economies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Current biomass production and trade volumes for energy and new materials and bio-chemicals are only a small fraction to achieve the bioenergy levels suggested by many global energy and climate change mitigation scenarios for 2050. However, comprehensive sustainability of large scale biomass production and trading has yet to be secured, and governance of developing biomass markets is a critical issue. Fundamental choices need to be made on how to develop sustainable biomass supply chains and govern sustainable international biomass markets. The aim of this paper is to provide a vision of how widespread trade and deployment of biomass for energy purposes can be integrated with the wider (bio)economy. It provides an overview of past and current trade flows of the main bioenergy products, and discusses the most important drivers and barriers for bioenergy in general, and more specifically the further development of bioenergy trade over the coming years. It discusses the role of bioenergy as part of the bioeconomy and other potential roles; and how it can help to achieve the sustainable development goals. The paper concludes that it is critical to demonstrate innovative and integrated value chains for biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower that can respond with agility to market factors while providing economic, environmental, and societal benefits to international trade and market. Furthermore, flexible biogenic carbon supply nets based on broad feedstock portfolios and multiple energy and material utilization pathways will reduce risks for involved stakeholder and foster the market entry and uptake of various densified biogenic carbon carriers. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Low-cost sustainable biomass availability in the European Union may not be able to meet increasing demand; exploring the option of importing biomass is therefore imperative for the years to come. This article assesses sustainable biomass export potential from Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Ukraine, and the United States by applying a number of sustainability criteria. Only biomass types with the highest potential are selected, to take advantage of economies of scale, e.g. pulpwood, wood waste, and residues in the United States, and agricultural residues in Ukraine. This study found that, except for the United States, pellet markets in the sourcing regions are largely undeveloped. The export potential depends strongly on pellet mill capacity and assumed growth rates in the pellet industry. Results show that the United States, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Brazil offer the highest biomass export potential. In the Business As Usual 2030 scenario, up to 204 PJ could potentially be mobilized; in the High Export scenario this could increase to 1423 PJ, with 89% of the potential being available for costs ranging from 6.4 to 15 €/GJ. These potentials meet the European Commission requirements for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions set in the Renewable Energy Directive. The total export potentials do not reflect the net possible import potentials to the European Union, as biomass could be imported to other countries where there is a demand for it, where less strict sustainability requirements are applied, and which are proximate to the sourcing regions, notably South Korea, Japan, and China. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Conversion of annual crops to native perennial grasslands for bioenergy production may help conserve wild bees by enhancing nest and food resources. However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context, and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting. Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can positively affect the ~80% of bee species that nest belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area unharvested. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial lignocellulosic crop that has gained large interest as a feedstock for advanced biofuels. Using an eddy covariance system, we monitored the net ecosystem gas exchange in a 5-ha rainfed switchgrass crop located in the Po River Valley for four consecutive years after land-use change from annual food crops. Switchgrass absorbed 58.2 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 (GPP—gross primary production), of which 24.5 (42%) were fixed by the ecosystem (NEE—net ecosystem exchange). Cumulated NEE was negative (i.e. C sink) even in the establishment year when biomass and canopy photosynthesis are considerably lower compared to the following years. Taking into account the last 3 years only (postestablishment years), mean NEE was −26.9 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 . When discounted of the removed switchgrass biomass, ecosystem CO 2 absorption was still high and corresponded to −8.4 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 . The estimation of the life cycle global warming effect made switchgrass an even greater sink (−12.4 Mg CO 2  ha −1  year −1 ), thanks to the credits obtained with fossil fuels displacement. Water use efficiency (WUE), that is the ratio of NEE to the water used by the crop as the flux of transpiration (ET), corresponded to 1.6 mg C g −1 of H 2 O, meaning that, on average, 170 m 3 of water was needed to fix 1 Mg of CO 2 . Again, considering only the postestablishment years, WUE was 1.7 mg C g −1 of H 2 O. In the end, about half of annual precipitation was used by the crop every year. We conclude that switchgrass can be a valuable crop to capture significant amount of atmospheric CO 2 while preserving water reserves and estimated that its potential large-scale deployment in the Mediterranean could lead to an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction up to 0.33% for the EU. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Although anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology, the treatment and disposal of the digestate still presents a challenge due to lack of viable methods for processing. The residual organic matter in digestates also creates a significant residual biogas potential. This fact indicates that the digestates need further processing not only to reduce their organic content for disposal, but also to capture the biogas associated with this residual organic content. This study investigated anaerobic treatment and residual biogas potential of digestates obtained from five full-scale farm-based digesters. The results indicated that it was possible to reduce the total chemical oxygen demand (CODt) of the digestates with an efficiency of 21%–84%. The corresponding biogas yields of digestates ranged between 0.078 and 0.326 Lbiogas/g VSadded. This level of biogas production is comparable to the biogas production potential of several commonly used raw substrates  Practitioner points Significant CODt reduction and biogas capture can be attained by AD of digestates. The digestates subjected to anaerobic treatment yielded up to 82% CODt removal. Residual biogas yields of digestates ranged between 0.078–0.326 Lbiogas/g VSadded. Biogas yields obtained were comparable to many raw feedstocks of biogas plants. © 2018 Water Environment Federation.

AB  - The electricity mix of Brazil is for 80% composed by renewable sources, of which the majority is supplied by hydropower. However, as the domestic energy demand is expected to increase and the abilities to expand hydropower capacity in Brazil are constrained, it is important to increase the contribution of other renewable energy resources. Considering the high theoretical potential and mature conversion technologies, bioelectricity from sugarcane straw could be a promising option. Our study aims to assess the bioelectricity potential from ecologically available sugarcane straw in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil) at multiple scales for the 2012 crop-year. We use a spatially explicit approach taking into account the spatial distribution of sugarcane fields, the spatial variation of sugarcane yield, the location and the milling data of each mill. We define a business as usual, a moderate and a high scenario on the amount of straw that can be removed given environmental constraints. The bioelectricity potential from ecologically available sugarcane straw is estimated between 18.7 and 45.8 TWh in Sao Paulo, equal to 22–37% of the electricity demand. The results show large geographical differences, with generally higher potentials and shorter collection radiuses for the mills in the traditional sugarcane areas compared to the mills in the expansion areas. We conclude that bioelectricity from sugarcane straw could have a significant contribution to the electricity supply in Brazil. The identification of regions with high potentials for bioelectricity production could support local and regional decision making on bioenergy planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper analyzes the impact of Jatropha plantation on food production in North East India. It is based on the primary data collected from 281 farmers, consisting of the present and past Jatropha growers, from Assam and Arunachal Pradesh through multistage random sampling technique. Food production in the region is hypothesized to be affected by agricultural land conversion and labor diversion from food to Jatropha plantations. Non-parametric tests and Probit models were used to examine the effects of Jatropha plantation on food production. The results show that the probability of a reduction in food production does indeed increase if either agricultural land is converted or labor is diverted from food production to Jatropha. However, the conversion of agricultural land and diversion of labor from food production to Jatropha plantation is more likely among the past-growers. Thus, it appears that while Jatropha plantation may set back the food production in the short-run, this adverse effect may reduce in the long-run. Regulation on land use pattern along with higher agricultural productivity may minimize the intensity of land conversion and labor diversion to Jatropha. Moreover, use of degraded land, intercropping, and third-generation biofuels may reduce the food versus biofuels conflict. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The amphyphylic triazoanilines recently synthesized 1-(4-(3-aminophenyl)-1H-1,2,3- triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (1) and 1-(4-(4-aminophenyl)-1H- 1,2,3-triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (2), synthesized from cardanol and glycerol, have photophysical properties which allow their use in the development of fluorescent biomarkers with applicability in the biodiesel quality control. Based on this, the present research evaluated the toxic effects of both compounds in different biological models through the investigation of survival and mortality percentages as a measure of acute toxicity on Daphnia similis and Oreochromis niloticus, larvicidal assay against Aedes aegypti, and cytotoxic activity on mammary cells. Results demonstrate that these triazoanilines 1 and 2 have shown low acute toxicity to the biological models investigated in this study up to the following concentrations: 4.0 mg L-1 (D. similis), 4.0 mg L-1 (A. aegypti larvae), 1.0 mg L-1 (O. niloticus), and 1.0 mg mL-1 (mammary cells). This fact suggests the potential for safe use of compounds 1 and 2 as fluorescent markers for the monitoring of biodiesel quality, even in the case of environmental exposure. Besides all of that, the reuse of cardanol and glycerol, both industrial wastes, favors the maintenance of environmental health and is in agreement with the assumptions of green chemistry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Furfural has been considered a potential feedstock of biofuels and biopolymers. As a waste-to-resource opportunity, this study focused on the valorization of goat excreta to obtain furfural and recover energy in the form of pyrolytic gas that helps increase thermochemical process efficiency. Three feedstocks (goat excreta, rice straw, and corncob) were compared to verify whether goat excreta is a promising feedstock of furfural. The furfural concentration from goat excreta (3.2 g L -1 ) via acid-catalyzed dehydration was comparable to that from rice straw or corncob. To maximize energy recovery from goat excreta via pyrolysis, CO 2 was employed as a reactive medium (compared with typical pyrolysis with N 2 ). This study experimentally proved that CO 2 plays a pivotal role in shifting carbon distribution from pyrolytic oil to pyrolytic gas, thereby enhancing the generation of CO (the main component of pyrolytic gas). Based on the experimental results, it is suggested that goat excreta can be a promising initial feedstock for the production of furfural and energy recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past years, there were dramatic improvements in identifying and assessing various feedstocks for the production of biodiesel fuels. To promote a particular feedstock as a renewable source of energy, it is important to analyze their energy, economic, and engine performance characteristics. The current work attempts to evaluate the net energy and economic indices for both fossil diesel and coconut-blended diesel (B20) considering the diesel consumption by the Indian railways. Further, we present the experimental results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated with neat coconut biodiesel (B100) and fossil diesel at various load and speed conditions. The engine experiments reveal that the coconut biodiesel exhibits leaner combustion and shorter ignition delay than fossil diesel. Lower amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emission is observed in the case of coconut biodiesel, with higher levels of nitric oxide (14%) and fuel consumption than diesel. The coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure is within the range of better driveability zone for both the fuels at all test conditions. Overall the engine performance, emission and combustion results with neat coconut biodiesel are favorable with a penalty in NO emission at high load conditions. The techno-economical study highlights higher production cost per liter of B20 than the cost of fossil diesel. However, the net energy ratio (NER) for B20 is 1.021, favoring higher output than diesel and thus lowers the dependency on crude oil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cultivations of poplar short rotation coppices (SRC) over five/six 3-year rotation cycles of three clones of Populus nigra and one interspecific commercial hybrid clone were studied in the Czech Republic at three sites with different environmental conditions. Two sites were planted in 1998 and the other was planted in 2002. This study focused on the evaluation of the growth and biomass yields, and on the biomass aptitude to be used as a fuel. Plant mortality, ranging between 10% and 100%, was found as a determinant variable for SRC management. Biomass yield decreased comparatively with earlier harvests, with only the commercial clone delivering productivity levels higher than 11 Mg ha−1.yr−1. The sixth harvest was applied to a single mid-level site quality profile, marginal to food cultivations. This site was subjected to an intensive management during the first four rotations with fertilization, herbicide application and soil discing. These treatments were central to assure the high plant survival rate after the sixth rotation with adequate biomass productivity. The number of shoots per plant was higher in the site chosen for extension of lifecyle, supporting the hypothesis that this variable, by facilitating resprouting, allows a cultivation to withhold further rotations. The harvested biomass was found appropriate to be used as a fuel. The results suggest that the sustainability of SRC poplar cultivations can be achieved under lifecycles longer than 20 years, under 3-year rotation cycles, with proper clones, site and management practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An increasing number of crops are being considered as potential sources of biomass for both conventional (e.g., maize/corn) and cellulosic (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, and hybrid poplar) biofuels. Studies investigating the hydrologic characteristics of these crops are often conducted at either the field scale with a focus on evapotranspiration (ET) or at the plot scale where experiments generally rely on soil water storage dynamics and residual water balances. While this has led to many important insights into crop–soil water interactions under these crops, there does not appear to be any multiyear direct comparisons of the drainage fluxes under this range of biofuel crops. Furthermore, important advancements in drainage flux measurement technologies have yet to be applied to quantify hydrologic fluxes below a range of biofuel crops. Here, we use soil water content (SWC) probes and automated equilibrium tension lysimeters (AETL) to characterize detailed differences in soil water storage and drainage fluxes under conventional and cellulosic biofuel crops. The results of this study suggest that there are significant differences between subsurface water fluxes under some conventional and cellulosic biofuel crops, such as 75% greater average annual drainage and more rapid drainage accumulation under switchgrass relative to maize. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Due to high biomass accumulation ability and multiple ecological benefits, the versatile, perennial bioenergy crop Sida hermaphrodita has sparked the interest of researchers in Central Europe. We assessed the crop's agronomy and bioenergy potential when grown under Austrian climate and soil conditions. A field trial was established in Austria, where the factors planting density and utilization strategy (thermal or biogas) were monitored for three growing seasons. Harvesting lignified biomass for thermal utilization at the end of the growing period resulted in higher dry matter yields than green biomass for biogas utilization which was harvested with a two-cut strategy. Due to lower costs but similar yield, a planting density of 1.77 plants m-2 is preferable over 2.66 plants m-2. The pelletizing process of the biomass was analyzed iteratively in 20 runs to optimize the energy efficiency and process stability while simultaneously increasing pellet durability. A simple drying step, disintegration with a pan grinder mill and pelletizing using a flat die pellet press resulted in stable, high quality pellets. Fuel characteristics of the biomass were favorable and all requirements to be categorized as solid biofuel were met, while combustion tests showed a good applicability of the produced pellets. When green biomass was used for biogas production, a significant drop in methane yield could be noted from the second growing season onward, indicating that older plants are less suitable for biogas production. Our results hint towards the potential of lignified S. hermaphrodita biomass to be used as a solid fuel for energy production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years increasing attention has been given to the potential use of contaminated lands for biofuel production, because these degraded soils cannot be used for food production. To establish these crops in Mediterranean contaminated areas, where the soil quality is usually very poor, the addition of soil amendments might be necessary to improve soil productivity. In addition, the use of crops with low water demands, adapted to these particular conditions of climate and soil contamination, is a key requirement. We studied the development of Cynara cardunculus and Silybum mariamun crops (both suitable for the production of biomass for biofuel uses under a Mediterranean climate) in trace element contaminated soils under field conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first such work under these particular experimental conditions (soil contamination and field trial). Soil physical (hydraulic), chemical, and biochemical properties were monitored for one year in experimental plots, where we tested the effects of the addition of two different amendments (sugar lime and biosolid compost) on soil functioning and crop productivity. Seed germination and plant biomass production were low, although amendment addition improved both parameters. The chemical and biological indicators (enzyme activities, PLFA profiles, and soil respiration) tended to be slightly improved by the amendments, especially sugar lime. The hydraulic properties of the soil in the experimental area were very deficient, and the effect of the amendments was not enough to improve them; this was probably the main cause of the general low productivity of these rain-fed crops, as water infiltrated poorly through the root zone. To improve crop productivity under these soil conditions, certain aspects could be improved: higher doses of amendments should be applied and deeper tillage of the soil after amendment addition should be performed to facilitate water infiltration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Once refineries are built they become fixed assets in location, general class of feedstocks that can be used and basic technology employed. These fixed characteristics are ignored by most existing national-level biofuel modeling analyses. In this study, we introduced such characteristics (asset fixity) into a model that is used in the USEPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Renewable Fuel Standard Analysis. Analysis is then done on renewable fuel issues with and without considering such fixity. The results show that neglecting fixity upwardly biases estimates of renewable fuel market penetration. Also ignoring fixity results in unrealistic location and feedstock usage for simulated refining. Additionally under asset fixity the ethanol price needed to make cellulosic ethanol economically competitive is substantially higher than current levels and predictions of models ignoring the fixity, reaching $1.06/liter. © 2019

By implementing Best Practice Technologies (BPTs) (i.e. the most advanced technologies currently in use at industrial scale) as well as by implementing recycling and energy recovery strategies through cogeneration and process intensification, consistent energy savings and CO2 emissions reduction can be achieved in the short to medium term. Long-term additional cuts may arise from development and deployment of “game changer” technologies, that re-invent the way some large-volume chemicals are made. Although still far from commercial maturity and still facing high economic and technical hurdles, switching to the use of non-food biomass as fuel and feedstock in the chemical industry may represent a suitable option. During the transition towards a more energy efficient chemistry, the environmental performance of bio-based products need to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In this study, an overview of energy improvement options is provided and the different patterns of bioethanol as fuel to generate energy or as platform chemical to generate chemical derivatives are compared as a case study within a life cycle perspective. The consequences on the environmental sustainability of the chemical industry are envisaged. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates opportunities to improve the cost competitiveness of the palm oil biodiesel industry in Indonesia. It compares costs and revenues of standalone conventional palm oil and biodiesel production with an integrated system that includes utilisation of biomass residues. Economic metrics, viz. net income, NPV, IRR, payback period and biodiesel breakeven price are evaluated. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to verify how parameter changes affect net income. The results show that the integrated concept with upgraded CPO and biodiesel processing plant (Biorefinery), which simultaneously produces biodiesel, electricity, heat and biofertiliser, can obtain an additional income of 14 USD/t-FFB compared to the Conventional System. The biorefinery system helps to reduce dependency on government subsidy for biodiesel production, and lowers the industry vulnerability to fluctuation of fossil diesel prices. The shift to modern facilities with value chain integration provides a pathway to enhance the share of renewable energy in Indonesia through increased biodiesel production and electricity generation from palm biomass residues. It may also promote resource efficiency and climate change mitigation through reduced emissions from untreated residues and fossil energy carriers. The analysis enhances understanding about potential gains and consequences of more stringent policy implementation in the country. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many studies identified the optimum temperature to maximise bio-oil/biochar yield using fast pyrolysis from woody biomass. However, the optimum mix of biochar and bio-oil production and their final utilisation to achieve optimal environmental and economic benefits are yet to be investigated. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify the optimum mix and utilisation using life cycle assessment and costing approach. Two utilisation scenarios were analysed: Scenario 1 considered terrestrial carbon sequestration through spreading biochar in corn fields while Scenario 2 assumed the co-combustion of biochar to displace coal in a coal-fired power station. In both scenarios, bio-oil was assumed to substitute heavy fuel oil in an industrial boiler. The functional unit used in the study was 1 Mg of green thinned logs from hardwood plantations. Scenario 1 showed outstanding greenhouse gas emissions offset (1680 kg-CO2-eq per function unit). However, this scenario lagged behind when considering other environmental impacts. Scenario 2 delivered more modest greenhouse gas offset, but it had better overall environmental and economic performance. The results indicated that the overall environmental performance of Scenario 2 decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to the decline in biochar yield as well as the increased energy consumption during the pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, lifecycle cost reduced when the pyrolysis temperature increased because of the increased bio-oil production, which has higher economic value than biochar. Assuming equal weights for the environmental and economic functions, the optimal performance of Scenario 2 is likely to be achieved when the pyrolysis process is run at 500 °C with the bio-oil and biochar yields being 64% and 22%, respectively. Monte Carlo Analysis revealed that for balanced environmental and economic weights (30%–70%) the solution is robust. The Monte Carlo Analysis results suggested that under the optimal conditions, there is 97.5% likelihood that Scenario 2 would achieve 1050 kg-CO2-eq greenhouse gas emissions offset and realise $25.8 life cycle cost savings per functional unit. This study demonstrates an easy method to incorporate life cycle assessment and costing into an optimisation decision making framework. Thus, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of policies incorporating multiple environmental impacts (criteria). It contributes to the debate about the economic and environmental validity of using forestry by-products, as well as other low cost woody biomass as a renewable energy source. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of long-term versus short-term water content on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralizability was evaluated in a six-week incubation trial. Soils were sampled from field sites in upstate New York used for rain-fed bioenergy crop production: nitrogen (N)- fertilized reed canarygrass, switchgrass, switchgrass + N, as well as a broadleaf-grass fallow. Within each cropping system, natural moisture gradients due to topography and subsoil structure allowed us to sample across regions with high (0.5 g g −1 ), mid (0.4 g g −1 ) and low (0.3 g g −1 ) water content. Moisture of the laboratory incubations was adjusted mimicking the three average field moisture levels in a full factorial design. Increasing laboratory moisture in the incubations increased cumulative carbon mineralization per unit soil (C mineralization) and cumulative C mineralization per unit SOC (C mineralizability) (main effect p &lt; 0.0001), indicating that lower average moisture as found at this site on average limited mineralization but higher average moisture did not. C mineralizability at high field moisture was 31% (25-42%) lower than at low field moisture across all cropping systems, regardless of moisture adjustment in the incubation. The mean slow C pool size of soils from high field moisture sites (997.1 ± 0.1 mg C g −1 C) was 0.2% greater than that of soils from low field moisture sites (p &lt; 0.0001), obtained by fitting a double-exponential model. The mean residence time of the slow mineralizing C pool for soils from low field moisture sites was 5.5 ± 0.1 years, in comparison to 8.0 ± 0.1 years for soils from high field moisture sites (p &lt; 0.0001). While permanganate-oxidizable carbon (POXC) per unit SOC (r = 0.1) was positively correlated to C mineralizability, wet aggregate stability (r = −0.2) was negatively correlated to C mineralizability. Above-ground biomass did not affect C mineralizability (p &gt; 0.05) and root biomass marginally influenced (p = 0.05) C mineralizability after correcting for soil texture variations. Additionally, after correcting for soil texture variations and biomass inputs, C mineralizability significantly decreased with higher field moisture (p = 0.02), indicating possible stabilization mechanisms through mineral interactions of SOC under high water content. Bulk contents of pedogenic iron and aluminum determined by oxalate extraction did not clearly explain differences in mineralizability. However, exchangeable calcium and magnesium contents were significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) greater in high moisture soils than soils with lower moisture. Additionally, cumulative C mineralizability at 6 weeks was negatively correlated to calcium (r = −0.7) and magnesium (r = −0.6) and mean residence time of the modeled slow pool correlated positively with calcium (r = 0.4). Therefore, cation bridging by retained or illuviated base ions was more important than redox changes of iron as a stabilization mechanism in this experiment. © 2018

AB  - The research aimed to study and characterize, in a four-year study, thirteen pluri-annual herbaceous species for their potential bioethanol and biomethane production. The highest biomass yield was obtained with Arundo donax followed by Miscanthus x giganteus. Biomass cellulose content had median values ranging from 23.1% (Symphytum x uplandicum) to 45.4% (Lythrum salicaria), hemicellulose from 9.4% (Iris pseudacorus) to 36.8% (Glyceria maxima) and lignin from 2.6% (G. maxima) to 14.5% (Helianthus tuberosus and L. salicaria). The best ethanol and methane median yields were achieved by A. donax (3.5 Mg ha−1 and 8227 m3 ha−1, respectively) followed by M. x giganteus (3.2 Mg ha−1 and 4446 m3 ha−1, respectively). Methane transformation showed a higher energy output than ethanol with values ranging from 1 GJ ha−1 (Phalaris arundinacea) to 508 GJ ha−1 (A. donax) and from 1 GJ ha−1 (P. arundinacea) to 624 GJ ha−1 (A. donax) for ethanol and methane, respectively. Results showed that A. donax and M. x giganteus are the most interesting species for bioethanol and biomethane production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are fundamental for meeting societal energy needs within the next few decades, but the sustainability of large-scale land use conversions to supply feedstock crops remains unclear. Quantitative data documenting how biofuel crop expansion will affect ecosystem services (ES) is needed to develop sustainable energy policies. Using pairwise comparisons of published and novel environmental, social and economic indicators, we quantitatively assessed the provision of critical ES related to key aspects of the sustainability of pasture-to-sugarcane transitions in Brazil. We found that with the exception of maintaining biodiversity, conversion of pasturelands to sugarcane fields enhanced many ES. Based on the Sustainability index, aimed to capture changes on key sustainability aspects by considering multiple ES and properly integrating them, we concluded that pasture to sugarcane transitions would increase the sustainability by 78% in south-central Brazil. Our results provide science-based empirical evidence that the expansion of sugarcane into degraded pasturelands is a suitable strategy to enhance Brazil's biomass feedstock supplies for producing bioenergy. Moreover, facing the complex and multidimensional concept of sustainability, our study also illustrates the importance of considering holistically land use change effects rather than individual ESs when establishing sustainable land management practices and bioenergy policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents results of a European Commission Joint Research Centre study to analyse the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiency of various options for alternative aviation fuels. Interest in alternative aviation fuels is growing, as the sector seeks viable options to reduce increasing GHG emissions. For biofuels non-biogenic emissions arise from cultivation, harvesting and transport of the feedstock, as well as from their conversion into biofuel. It is important to consider whether any emissions reductions benefits are justified by the energy efficiency of each alternative. This article is focussed on American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) certifiable alternative drop-in biojet fuels [1], i.e. non-fossil hydrocarbon fuels which have (i) the same chemical structure and (ii) can be blended with conventional jet fuels, (iii) can use the same jet fuel supply infrastructure, and (iv) do not require modification of the aircraft. The results indicate that the biofuels studied tended to exhibit lower GHG than conventional jet fuels although indirect effects or existing uses of materials were not included in this study. Some biofuels performed better at reducing GHG than others (for example biofuels from wastes and residues). A large and important effect on emissions is seen due to land type used for cultivation and whether methane capture is used for certain pathways. GHG savings results vary due to the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodology chosen for dealing with emissions and co-products. Certain pathways are notably more energy intensive than others and strong GHG reduction does not always coincide with high energy efficiency. An overview of industry initiatives and critical EU legislation relating to aviation biofuels is given. The insights from this work are expected to be of use for decision-makers considering investment options in this sector. © 2018

AB  - Biofuels derived from lignocellulosic materials is one of the options in addressing issues on climate change and energy independence. One of the most promising bioenergy crops is switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), particularly in North America. Future advancement in large-scale conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks and relatively more competitive price for biomass and other economic advantages could lead to landowners opting to venture on switchgrass monoculture (SWITCH) in lieu of loblolly pine monoculture (PINE). Therefore, we investigated the conversion of previously managed loblolly pine stand into SWITCH in eastern North Carolina, U.S.A. on soil N availability. Treatments included PINE, SWTICH, and mature loblolly pine stand (REF). Each treatment was replicated three times on 0.8 ha plots drained by open ditches dug 1.0–1.2 m deep and spaced at 100 m. Rates of net N mineralization (N m ) and nitrification (N n ) at the top 20 cm were measured using sequential in-situ techniques in 2011 and 2012 (the 3rd and 4th years of establishment, respectively) along with a one-time laboratory incubation. On average, PINE, SWITCH, and REF can have field net N m rates up to 0.40, 0.34 and 0.44 mg N·kg soil −1 ·d −1 , respectively, and net N n rates up to 0.14, 0.08 and 0.10 mg N·kg soil −1 ·d −1 , respectively. Annually, net N m rates ranged from 136.98 to 167.21, 62.00 to 142.61, and 63.57 to 127.95 kg N·ha −1 , and net N n rates were 56.31–62.98, 16.45–30.45, 31.99–32.94 kg N·ha −1 in PINE, SWITCH, and REF, respectively. Treatment effect was not significant on field N m rate (p = 0.091). However, SWITCH significantly reduced nitrate-N production (p &lt; 0.01). Overall, results indicated that establishment of SWITCH on poorly drained lands previously under PINE is less likely to significantly impact total soil N availability and potentially has minimum N leaching losses since soil mineral N under this system will be dominated by ammonium-N. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growing bioenergy crop on marginal lands has the potential to minimize land use conflicts and meet global energy demand. The newly reclaimed mudflats through sewage sludge amendment can be used as a potential marginal land for bioenergy production. This paper was one of first studies to investigate the persistent impact of sewage sludge application at the rates of 0, 25, 50, 125, and 250 t ha −1 on selected soil physicochemical properties, yields and quality of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) cultivated in newly reclaimed mudflat saline-alkaline soil. The results showed that sewage sludge amendment (SSA) improved physicochemical properties by decreasing bulk density, electric conductivity, pH, and increasing soil organic carbon, &gt;0.25 mm water-stable aggregate fraction, cation exchange capacity, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents in mudflat soil. Consequently, the sweet sorghum biomass and gross energy content were significantly elevated by SSA. The sweet sorghum achieved the maximum biomasses of 4.73 and 6.62 t ha −1 at 250 t ha −1 SSA rate in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The gross energy content of sweet sorghum significantly increased with the SSA rates, although SSA slightly reduced the calorific values in stem and leaf of sweet sorghum. The maximum gross energy contents of sweet sorghum were 79.62 and 104.47 GJ ha −1 at SSA rate of 250 t ha −1 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Although SSA led to accumulation of heavy metals in sweet sorghum, the growth of sorghum was not inhibited even at the highest SSA. In summary, cultivation of bioenergy crop in mudflat amended by sewage sludge is feasible and can be an innovative solution for mudflat reclamation, safe disposal of solid waste, resource reuse and recycle, and bioenergy production. © 2018

AB  - Small-scale agroforestry-based biofuel production has recently been proposed as a strategy for rural poverty alleviation, but few empirical evidence is available on farmer adoption of such novel systems. This study describes adoption of oilseed tree mixtures on smallholdings in Hassan district, South India, and examines the impact of a biofuel extension program and farmer characteristics on adoption. Cross-sectional survey data and regression analyses addressing various forms of selection bias, are used. The findings reveal that tree cultivation is much more prevalent than oilseed collection, and that various activities of the biofuel extension program only stimulate the former. Low seed prices and high opportunity costs of labour are major factors impeding households to collect seeds from planted or wild oilseed species. The paper concludes that the program succeeds as an agroforestry program but not as a biofuel program. Similar challenges pertain to small-scale agroforestry systems as to jatropha-based plantation systems, although the former are a Low-Risk High-Diversity approach to build feedstock for the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ammonia caused disturbance of biogas production is one of the most frequent incidents in regular operation of biogas reactors. This study provides a detailed insight into the microbial community of a mesophilic, full-scale biogas reactor (477 kWh h −1 ) fed with maize silage, dried poultry manure and cow manure undergoing initial process disturbance by increased ammonia concentration. Over a time period of 587 days, the microbial community of the reactor was regularly monitored on a monthly basis by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes. During this sampling period, the total ammonia concentrations varied between 2.7 and 5.8 g l −1 [NH 4 + –N]. To gain further inside into the active metabolic pathways, for selected time points metatranscriptomic shotgun analysis was performed allowing the quantification of marker genes for methanogenesis, hydrolysis and syntrophic interactions. The results obtained demonstrated a microbial community typical for a mesophilic biogas plant. However in response to the observed changing process conditions (e.g. increasing NH 4 + levels, changing feedstock composition), the microbial community reacted highly flexible by changing and adapting the community composition. The Methanosarcina-dominated archaeal community was shifted to a Methanomicrobiales-dominated archaeal community in the presence of increased ammonia conditions. A similar trend as in the phylogenetic composition was observed in the transcription activity of genes coding for enzymes involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidations (Codh/Acs and Fthfs). In accordance, Clostridia simultaneously increased under elevated ammonia concentrations in abundance and were identified as the primary syntrophic interaction partner with the now Methanomicrobiales-dominated archaeal community. In conclusion, overall stable process performance was maintained during increased ammonia concentration in the studied reactor based on the microbial communities’ ability to flexibly respond by reorganizing the community composition while remaining functionally stable. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - An increase in renewable energy and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops is expected in order to meet global greenhouse gas (GHG) targets. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and this paper addresses a knowledge gap concerning soil N 2 O emissions over the possible “hot spot” of land use conversion from established pasture to the biofuel crop Miscanthus. The work aims to quantify the impacts of this land use change on N 2 O fluxes using three different cultivation methods. Three replicates of four treatments were established: Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) planted without tillage; Mxg planted with light tillage; a novel seed-based Miscanthus hybrid planted with light tillage under bio-degradable mulch film; and a control of uncultivated established grass pasture with sheep grazing. Soil N 2 O fluxes were recorded every 2 weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in N 2 O emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, N 2 O emissions from the cultivated Miscanthus plots were 550%–819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%–485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017). When added to an estimated carbon cost for production over a 10 year crop lifetime (including crop management, harvest, and transportation), the measured N 2 O conversion cost of 4.13 Mg CO 2 -eq./ha represents a 44% increase in emission compared to the base case. This paper clearly shows the need to incorporate N 2 O fluxes during Miscanthus establishment into assessments of GHG balances and life cycle analysis and provides vital knowledge needed for this process. This work therefore also helps to support policy decisions regarding the costs and benefits of land use change to Miscanthus. © 2018 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable feedstock supply is a critical issue for the bioenergy sector. One concern is that feedstock production will impact biodiversity. We analyze how this concern is addressed in assessments of biomass supply potentials and in selected governance systems in the EU and Brazil, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the Brazilian Forest Act. The analysis focuses on grasslands and includes estimates of the amount of grassland area (and corresponding biomass production volume) that would be excluded from cultivation in specific biodiversity protection scenarios. The reviewed assessments used a variety of approaches to identify and exclude biodiverse grasslands as unavailable for bioenergy. Because exclusion was integrated with other nature protection considerations, quantification of excluded grassland areas was often not possible. The RED complements and strengthens the CAP in terms of biodiversity protection. Following the RED, an estimated 39%–48% (about 9–11 Mha) and 15%–54% (about 10–38 Mha) of natural and non-natural grassland, respectively, may be considered highly biodiverse in EU-28. The estimated biomass production potential on these areas corresponds to some 1–3 and 1.5–10 EJ/year for natural and non-natural grassland, respectively (depending on area availability and management intensity). However, the RED lacks clear definitions and guidance, creating uncertainty about its influence on grassland availability for bioenergy feedstock production. For Brazil, an estimated 16%–77% (about 16–76 Mha) and 1%–32% (about 7–24 Mha) of natural and non-natural grassland, respectively, may be considered highly biodiverse. In Brazil, ecological–economic zoning was found potentially important for grassland protection. Further clarification of grassland definitions and delineation in regulations will facilitate a better understanding of the prospects for bioenergy feedstock production on grasslands, and the impacts of bioenergy deployment on biodiversity. © 2018 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study examines the local processes, effects, and responses to large-scale logging and agricultural development efforts in subsistence communities on New Hanover Island, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Recently, New Hanover became the site of three special agricultural and business leases (SABLs) that combined to cover approximately 79% of the island. The proliferation of SABLs within PNG is an outcome of recent national development initiatives promoting a significant increase in the production of commercial agricultural crops such as oil palm and biofuel. Accordingly, SABLs are designed to facilitate the development of long-term commercial agricultural industries in rural locations across the country through the conversion of forested lands and the simplification of communal land tenure, for the purposes of private lease. However, SABLs have simultaneously provided a convenient loophole around more restrictive national forestry policies and thereby become attractive to traditional logging interests in the Asian/Pacific region. Consequently, many SABLs across PNG have failed to produce viable agricultural development or broad local benefit. It is within this context, that this study pays particular attention to the experiences of women and lower-status landowners living through the processes of SABL conversion, during the El Nino drought of 2015. The study details the statuses and roles of these groups within the overall development process, the ways in which their social relationships changed in the context of development, why these groups were particularly vulnerable to the broad livelihood effects of forest conversion and drought, how they adapted to these effects, and what their hopes were regarding the future of the development project and life on the island. This study adds to current theoretical interests on emerging neoliberal frontiers of land and resource control by examining these SABL landscapes on New Hanover as contemporary examples of land grabs and documenting the very real local level consequences of this phenomenon. The study is also particularly significant in light of the growing threats to forests and forest-dependent livelihoods and the recognition of the importance of local forest practices to global sustainability. © 2018 Oceania Publications

AB  - World's biggest challenge today is safe disposal and treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW). This review presents an overview of pathways for the generation of the bioenergy from MSW, through the biological–chemical–thermal route of treatment, current status, deployment of biochemical–thermochemical conversion technologies for a biogenic fraction of MSW, its challenges and performance. Currently, key challenges posed to the world are energy security, waste management, and climate change. Out of these, waste management across the world is in the dejected state due to lack of proper treatment and conversion technologies. In recent times, pressure on the global environment increased for the use of renewable resources due to depleting fossil fuels. Energy from biomass waste is going to be one of the crucial and dominant sources of renewable energy harness in the future. Conversion of a biogenic fraction of MSW to energy will solve waste management issue as well as offers energy generation in a sustainable manner and can be termed as “Renewable Waste”. This study provides technological pathways for the generation of biofuels using MSW biomass as a feedstock, and the technology progression of various pathways and gaps for implementation of these technologies were also analyzed in this study. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 654–671, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Cell wall recalcitrance is the major challenge to improving saccharification efficiency in converting lignocellulose into biofuels. However, information regarding the transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall biogenesis remains poor in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which has been selected as a biofuel crop in the United States. In this study, we present a combination of computational and experimental approaches to develop gene regulatory networks for lignin formation in switchgrass. To screen transcription factors (TFs) involved in lignin biosynthesis, we developed a modified method to perform co-expression network analysis using 14 lignin biosynthesis genes as bait (target) genes. The switchgrass lignin co-expression network was further extended by adding 14 TFs identified in this study, and seven TFs identified in previous studies, as bait genes. Six TFs (PvMYB58/63, PvMYB42/85, PvMYB4, PvWRKY12, PvSND2 and PvSWN2) were targeted to generate overexpressing and/or down-regulated transgenic switchgrass lines. The alteration of lignin content, cell wall composition and/or plant growth in the transgenic plants supported the role of the TFs in controlling secondary wall formation. RNA-seq analysis of four of the transgenic switchgrass lines revealed downstream target genes of the secondary wall-related TFs and crosstalk with other biological pathways. In vitro transactivation assays further confirmed the regulation of specific lignin pathway genes by four of the TFs. Our meta-analysis provides a hierarchical network of TFs and their potential target genes for future manipulation of secondary cell wall formation for lignin modification in switchgrass. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Biomethane Potential (BMP) of green macroalga Ulva lactuca post extraction of sap, ulvan and protein was analysed in batch studies. Extraction was performed in two different ways (individual and sequential) to understand the effect of removal of these components on methane yields. Both the treatments resulted in enhanced biomethane production in most of the treated residues, however, the highest methane yield of 408 ± 20.02 ml CH4 g−1 VS (70.93% of theoretical) was observed in sap and ulvan removed residue (batch VI). The methane production rates improved after both the treatments (0.15–0.28 day−1 for untreated and treated batches). This corroborates well with the fact that high protein and sulphate content are major inhibitors in anaerobic digestion (AD) of U. lactuca and their removal leads to improved methane yields. Sequential extraction of value-added products prior to the AD process not only improves biomass amenability and respective methane yields but also makes the overall process more efficient and viable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha for biofuel production created high expectations in Ghana for boosting rural development and national energy security. In the mid-to-late 2000s, large areas were allocated across the country to jatropha investments that eventually collapsed. Jatropha collapse has been prevalent across Africa but few studies have empirically addressed the (a) drivers of jatropha collapse (b) post-collapse impacts, and (c) future acceptability of jatropha. Through household surveys and expert interviews, we capture the perceptions of key stakeholders in Ghana involved in the biofuel sector at the national/regional level and local communities around six collapsed jatropha projects. Key drivers of collapse include the (a) low jatropha productivity, (b) weak business planning, (c) community conflicts, (d) institutional barriers, and (e) civil society opposition. Land-related issues are central to almost all of these drivers of collapse. While there is currently considerable scepticism among stakeholders about the future of the biofuel sector in Ghana (and especially of jatropha), there is still some interest in jatropha as reflected in community surveys and recent government policies. As we could not identify a single dominant driver of jatropha collapse locally or nationally “silver bullet” solutions might not exist. However, improving the land administration system would be a key if the negative past experiences of jatropha boom and bust are to be avoided. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Many countries have limited, low-cost biomass resources to satisfy their own demand for bioenergy. International trade of biomass in various solid and liquid forms is consequently increasing. The aim of this study is to present a quantitative overview of the development of international biomass trade for energy purposes, including a discussion of methodological issues. The paper focuses on the production, export, and import of solid and liquid biofuels, including industrial roundwood, wood chips, fuel wood, wood pellets, biodiesel, and bioethanol. The study highlights changes in trends that have occurred over the past decade. Trade on global bioenergy markets is increasing: total trade of biomass for energy purposes is estimated as having increased twofold from around 780 PJ in 2004 to 1250 PJ in 2015. Despite the importance of the bioenergy market and the growth of biomass trade for energy, accurate evaluation of energy-related biomass trade faces several methodological challenges, such as uncertainties in international statistics, inconsistent data regarding export and import volumes, as well as limited information about the final use of traded products. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Background: Renewable energy has become a field of high interest over the past decade, and production of biofuels from cellulosic substrates has a particularly high potential as an alternative source of energy. Industrial deconstruction of biomass, however, is an onerous, exothermic process, the cost of which could be decreased significantly by use of hyperthermophilic enzymes. An efficient way of breaking down cellulosic substrates can also be achieved by highly efficient enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes. The modular architecture of these multi-enzyme complexes results in substrate targeting and proximity-based synergy among the resident enzymes. However, cellulosomes have not been observed in hyperthermophilic bacteria. Results: Here, we report the design and function of a novel hyperthermostable "designer cellulosome" system, which is stable and active at 75 °C. Enzymes from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, a highly cellulolytic hyperthermophilic anaerobic bacterium, were selected and successfully converted to the cellulosomal mode by grafting onto them divergent dockerin modules that can be inserted in a precise manner into a thermostable chimaeric scaffoldin by virtue of their matching cohesins. Three pairs of cohesins and dockerins, selected from thermophilic microbes, were examined for their stability at extreme temperatures and were determined stable at 75 °C for at least 72 h. The resultant hyperthermostable cellulosome complex exhibited the highest levels of enzymatic activity on microcrystalline cellulose at 75 °C, compared to those of previously reported designer cellulosome systems and the native cellulosome from Clostridium thermocellum. Conclusion: The functional hyperthermophilic platform fulfills the appropriate physico-chemical properties required for exothermic processes. This system can thus be adapted for other types of thermostable enzyme systems and could serve as a basis for a variety of cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic industrial objectives at high temperatures. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The feasibility of using floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) to treat runoff typical of commercial nurseries was investigated using two 8-week trials with replicated mesocosms. Plants were supported by Beemat rafts. Five monoculture treatments of Agrostis alba (red top), Canna × generalis ‘Firebird’ (canna lily), Carex stricta (tussock sedge), Iris ensata ‘Rising Sun’ (Japanese water iris), Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), two mixed species treatments, and an unplanted control were assessed. These plant species are used for ornamental, wetland, and biofuel purposes. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removals were evaluated after a 7-day hydraulic retention time (HRT). N removal (sum of ammonium-N, nitrate-N, and nitrite-N) from FTW treatments ranged from 0.255 to 0.738 g·m −2 ·d −1 (38.9 to 82.4% removal) and 0.147 to 0.656 g·m −2 ·d −1 (12.9 to 59.6% removal) for trials 1 and 2, respectively. P removal (phosphate-P) ranged from 0.052 to 0.128 g·m −2 ·d −1 (26.1 to 64.7% removal) for trial 1, and 0.074 to 0.194 g·m −2 ·d −1 (26.8 to 63.2% removal) for trial 2. Panicum virgatum removed more N and P than any other FTW treatment and the control in both trials. Results show that species selection and timing of FTW harvest impact the rate and mass of nutrient remediation. FTWs can effectively remove N and P from runoff from commercial nurseries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Concerns about the negative impacts of crop biomass removal on soil ecological functions have led to questioning the long-term sustainability of bioenergy production. To offset this potential negative impact, use of organic C rich by-products from the bioenergy industries have been proposed as a means to replenish soil C in degraded soils. However, the impact of these by-products application on soil carbon dynamics is not fully understood. We measured biogeochemical changes in soil organic C following a three-year field application of two by-products, biochar (BC) and fermentation-by product (FBP), of bioenergy industry processes in an elephant grass [Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.] field. There was a significant increase in overall soil organic C (SOC) observed in BC (270%) treated plots, however the higher labile SOC (51%) content was present in FBP treated plots. Solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy further revealed increased aromatic and alkyl groups in BC amended soils which lend to its significantly higher hydrophobicity index, HI (2.13) compared with FBP amended soils (HI = 0.8). Initial biogeochemical responses of amended soils to drought conditions were also investigated during a short-term experiment with drying and rewetting of soils. Increased concentrations of extractable C and higher stimulation of microbial activities (respiration and enzyme activities) in FBP amended soils were measured. Overall, our results reveal different impacts of the two soil amendments, where FBP soil application can affect the labile SOC availability, and stimulate rapid microbial response in drought affected soils, and biochar soil application lowers the labile SOC and microbial stimulation facilitating C sequestration over time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the water resource potential for bioenergy production from sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)) in Northern China according to the distribution of water resources, climate conditions and the total water consumption of bioenergy based on sweet sorghum, which consisted of blue water, green water and grey water. At a case study site in Inner Mongolia, simulation with a plant phenological model was used to determine whether sweet sorghum could reach the harvestable stage for sugar juice production. The blue water in the agricultural phase was estimated according to the potential crop evapotranspiration (ET c ), the drought sensitivity of sweet sorghum in different stages and the precipitation during the growing season. The results showed that the irrigation water was significantly different among the districts, ranging from 730 to 5500 m 3 /ha and 2060 to 6680 m 3 /ha for early-maturing and late-maturing varieties, respectively. To avoid the water pressure level to be exacerbated and the severe reallocation of water resources resulting in negative effects on other sectors, the maximal annual water withdrawal was set to not surpass the upper threshold of water stress level of 40%. That makes the maximum area for the production of sweet sorghum cannot exceed 1.95 × 10 4 ha, representing only 0.24% of the total marginal land area in Inner Mongolia. However, the economic benefits of bioenergy production from sweet sorghum would be negative due to the high labour input. Therefore, not only the availability of marginal land, the climate conditions and local water resources but also the improvement of mechanisation and agricultural production techniques should be considered to attain the sustainable development of bioenergy production and address global energy and environmental crises. © 2018

AB  - European climate policy faced increasing constraints during the economic and Eurozone crises (2008–2014). The European Commission subsequently refocused policymaking toward integrating climate objectives into other policy areas such as energy and the 2014–2020 European Union (EU) budget. The conditions for successful climate policy integration (CPI) are analyzed, focusing on the compatibility of key actors’ beliefs. In renewable energy policy, CPI was successful as long as the co-benefits and related policy-core beliefs of energy security, rural economic development and climate action coexisted harmoniously. Once conflict among these policy-core beliefs emerged during the biofuels controversy, CPI was weakened as actors with competing economy-focused beliefs controlled the decision-making process. The case of EU budget climate mainstreaming illustrates how actors can add climate objectives into legislation despite meaningful discussion being ‘crowded out’ by other priorities. The findings highlight the importance of low conflict between departments, compatible beliefs and policy priorities for successful CPI. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic biomass is considered as a potential source for sustainable biofuels. In the conversion process, a pretreatment step is necessary in order to overcome the biomass recalcitrance and allow for sufficient fermentable sugar yields in enzymatic hydrolysis. Steam explosion is a well known pretreatment method working without additional chemicals and allowing for efficient particle size reduction. However, it is not effective for the pretreatment of softwood and the harsh conditions necessary to achieve a highly digestible cellulose fraction lead to the partial degradation of the hemicellulosic sugars. Previous studies showed that the autohydrolysis pretreatreatment of softwood can benefit from the addition of 2-naphthol. This carbocation scavenger prevents lignin repolymerisation leading to an enhanced glucose yield in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Results: In order to prevent the degradation of the hemicellulose, we investigated in this study a two-stage 2-naphthol steam explosion pretreatment. In the first stage, spruce wood is pretreated at a severity which is optimal for the autocatalytic hydrolysis of the hemicellulose. The hydrolyzate containing the solubilized sugars is withdrawn from the reactor and the remaining solids are pretreated with different amounts of 2-naphthol in a second stage at a severity that allows for high glucose yields in enzymatic hydrolysis. The pretreated spruce was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). In the first stage, the maximal yield of hemicellulosic sugars was 47.5% at a pretreatment severity of log R-0 R 0 = 3.75 at 180 °C. In the second stage, a 2-naphthol dosage of 0.205 mol/mol lignin C 9 -unit increased the ethanol yield in SSF with a cellulose loading of 1% using the whole second stage pretreatment slurry by 17% from 73.6% for the control without 2-naphthol to 90.4%. At a higher solid loading corresponding to 5% w/w cellulose, the yields decreased due to higher concentrations of residual 2-naphthol in the biomass and the pretreatment liquor, but also due to higher concentrations of potential inhibitors like HMF, furfural and acetic acid. Experiments with washed solids, vacuum filtered solids and the whole slurry showed that residual 2-naphthol can inhibit the fermentation as a single inhibitor but also synergistically together with HMF, furfural and acetic acid. Conclusions: This work shows that a two-stage pretreatment greatly enhances the recovery of hemicellulosic sugars from spruce wood. The presence of 2-naphthol in the second pretreatment stage can enhance the ethanol yield in SSF of steam explosion pretreated softwood at low cellulose concentrations of 1% w/w. However, with higher solid loadings of 5% w/w cellulose, the ethanol yields were in general lower due to the solid effect and a synergistic inhibition of HMF, furfural, acetic acid with residual 2-naphthol. The concentration of residual 2-naphthol tolerated by the yeast decreased with increasing concentrations of HMF, furfural, and acetic acid. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Over 5 million ha of US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands have been converted to annual crops since 2000, driven mainly by demand for corn grain ethanol. Much of the soil carbon sequestered under CRP is lost upon conversion, creating a 'carbon debt' that is presumed to be repaid by future greenhouse gas (GHG) savings from ethanol's substitution for petroleum. Model simulations, extrapolations, and national statistics rather than direct measurements have been used thus far to estimate the long-term global warming impact (GWI) of such conversions. Here we report measured GWIs for three 22-year-old CRP grassland fields and three conventionally tilled agricultural (AGR) fields (11-17 ha) converted to either annual no-till corn or perennial cellulosic (switchgrass or restored prairie) bioenergy crops. We assessed GWIs for each field over eight years using whole-system life cycle analysis (LCA) by measuring: (a) GHG fluxes via eddy covariance and static chamber methodologies, (b) farming operations and agronomic inputs, and (c) the fossil fuel offset by ethanol use. Payback times were much longer than those estimated by prior modeling efforts. After 8 years, cumulative GWIs of switchgrass, restored prairie, and corn at the CRP grasslands were, respectively, -2.6 ±4.0, 6.9 ±3.6 and 85.2 ±5.1 Mg CO 2 -equivalent ha -1 . The switchgrass system had repaid its carbon debt by year eight and the restored prairie will have likely repaid by year ten; however, the no-till corn system appears likely to require &gt;300 years. The same bioenergy crops grown on former agricultural lands, with no sequestered carbon lost on conversion, repaid their carbon debts within two years. Results indicate that GWI estimates and carbon debt payback times due to conversion of CRP lands to annual bioenergy crops have been substantially underestimated by current models. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Performance-based environmental regulation has gained popularity as a policy tool to prevent climate change. California implements a Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation to reduce the average carbon intensity of fuels by 10 percent, without specifying technologies to achieve the target. A carbon trading market is established to facilitate fuel producers making revenue by producing low carbon second-generation renewable fuels. There is a knowledge gap in understanding interactions between commodity and carbon trade markets under performance-based regulation. We propose a mathematical program with an equilibrium constraints model to find the equilibrium transportation energy portfolio under environmental protection policy. The model utilizes Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions to represent the profit maximization of fuel suppliers. Profit is counted in both the commodity market and the carbon trading market. Our results show that carbon credit encourages the production of second-generation biofuels, which plays a critical role in the success of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Carbon credit price is driven by compliance with carbon intensity regulations, which we prove through mathematical formulation and empirical data analysis. Reducing carbon intensity is the key to promote biobutanol underperformance based on the low carbon fuel policy. The proposed framework, with small adjustments, can be used to evaluate performance-based regulation in other fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a native perennial grass identified as a promising biofuel crop for production on marginal agricultural lands. As such, research into switchgrass fertility and the switchgrass rhizosphere microbiome has been ongoing in an effort to increase production sustainability. We examined the effects of cultivar and phosphorus (P) fertilization on biomass yield, P removal, and rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structure in three switchgrass cultivars: Sunburst, Shawnee, and Liberty. The Liberty cv. is the first lowland-type bioenergy switchgrass adapted to USDA hardiness zones 4, 5, and 6. On a medium soil test P clay loam soil, biomass yield response to applied P was linear, increasing 135 kg ha −1 for every kilogram of P applied prior to establishment. Average post-frost biomass yield was 9.6 Mg ha −1  year −1 when unfertilized, and maximum biomass yield was 10.3 Mg ha −1  year −1 when fertilized at 58.6 kg ha −1 P, suggesting that P application on medium soil test P soils is beneficial for switchgrass establishment and early growth. Switchgrass cv. Shawnee was more productive than cvs. Liberty or Sunburst (11.3, 10.2, and 8.6 Mg ha −1  year −1 , respectively). Both bacterial and fungal communities were significantly shaped by cultivar. These shifts, while inconsistent between year and cultivar, may reflect a selection of the microbial community from that present in soil to maximize total nutrient uptake, regardless of additional P amendments. Phosphorus fertilization did not affect microbial community structure. Results of this study suggest that the cultivar-associated selection of particular microbial taxa may have implications for increased productivity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel plays an important role in the transition to low-carbon energy systems. However, the large-scale expansion of biofuels may cause drastic land use change (LUC) due to feedstock cultivation and further result in other sustainability impacts (e.g., food supply), which are the key concerns for policy makers when designing bioenergy policies. However, biophysical models omit the indirect LUC from interactions of economic agents, whereas economic models lack the depiction of heterogeneous land use types. Thus, through either technique, it has formidable challenges to simulate land conversions among alternative uses driven by socioeconomic activities, especially policy mandates. To bridge the gap between these models by simultaneously considering land heterogeneity and market mechanisms and to gain better insights into specific national/regional cases to supplement previous global biofuel and LUC analyses, in this study, we develop a national computable general equilibrium (CGE) model augmented with an explicit land allocation module and design a scenario approach to simulate different patterns of land use management. Food grains and dedicated energy crops are considered feedstock sources and marginal land is incorporated as a potential land supply. Using this model, the case study of China quantifies the direct and indirect LUC driven by the bioethanol (one of the main biofuels) expansion of the new nationwide E10 mandate (gasoline containing 10% ethanol) in 2020, as well as the further impacts on food security. The results show that a slight land reallocation occurs with decreases in the land supply for rice (−0.016%), other non-feedstock grains and crops, as well as forest and grassland (−0.023%). The land competition among existing croplands would be intense in the non-deforestation scenario. If marginal land is reclaimed for feedstock cultivation, the cropland competition could be softened. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the total LUC scale would be 4.0–5.9% with no corn stockpile serving as feedstock. Additionally, the bioethanol expansion would trigger higher food prices (around +0.1%). To alleviate the negative impacts on land resources and food security, planting energy crops on marginal land could increase non-grain feedstocks by 10% and save 0.217% of croplands; therefore, it may be one of the promising pathways for sustainable biofuel development in China. This study can lay a common foundation for further integrated impact assessments of biofuel expansion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on evaluating whether the injection of CO2, which is associated with the use of thermoelectric fly ashes and a reduced supply of nitrogen, affects the production of intracellular carbohydrates from Spirulina. For this purpose, the addition of 0.25 g L−1 of NaNO3, along with a 10% (v v−1) of CO2 injection, a flow rate of 0.3 vvm for 1 or 5 min, as well as 0, 120 and 160 ppm of fly ashes, was studied. The assays with 120 ppm of fly ashes presented the best kinetic parameters and CO2 biofixation rate, regardless of the CO2 injection time. Meanwhile, the experiments with 120 and 160 ppm of fly ash and CO2 injection for 1 min presented 63.3 and 61.0% (w w−1) of carbohydrates, respectively. Thus, this study represents an important strategy to increase the accumulation of carbohydrates in Spirulina, with potential application in the production of bioethanol. © 2018

AB  - Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ΔH (MTH) is a potential methanogen known to reduce CO2 with H2 for producing methane biofuel in thermophilic digesters. The genome of this organism contains ~50.5% conserved hypothetical proteins (HPs; operome) whose function is still not determined precisely. Here, we employed a combined bioinformatics approach to annotate a precise function to HPs and categorize them as enzymes, binding proteins, and transport proteins. Results of our study show that 315 (35.6%) HPs have exhibited well-defined functions contributing imperative roles in diverse cellular metabolism. Some of them are responsible for stress-response mechanisms and cell cycle, membrane transport, and regulatory processes. The genome-neighborhood analysis found five important gene clusters (dsr, ehb, kaiC, cmr, and gas) involving in the energetic metabolism and defense systems. MTH operome contains 223 enzymes with 15 metabolic subsystems, 15 cell cycle proteins, 17 transcriptional regulators and 33 binding proteins. Functional annotation of its operome is thus more fundamental to a profound understanding of the molecular and cellular machinery at systems-level. © 2018

AB  - The Solow-Swan macroeconomic model reveals the fact that the marginal capital rate of the bioenergy sector, as well as the bioenergy productivity and productivity of the resources variation, having positive values of their estimated coefficients, have the capacity of stimulating the sustainable economic development of an emerging country, such as Romania. The economic model substantiated by the correlations between the macroeconomic indicators evaluates the convergence in relation with the European Union (EU) average. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of bioenergy on sustainable economic development. The econometric analysis revealed the fact that the bioenergy productivity, the productivity of the resources and the capital productivity of the bioenergy sector have a positive and statistically significant impact on the sustainable economic development. Data was collected from The European Statistical Office and analyzed with SPSS 22 statistical software package. Quantitative methods highlight the disparities between developed and developing countries of EU in terms of bioenergy use and efficiency. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - The need to develop an alternative fuel to fossil fuel is growing day by day, especially for the transportation industry, as the supply of fossil fuels is limited and is depleting at a rapid rate. One available resource that has emerged recently is biodiesel. However, the usage of biodiesel is very low among transportation companies. An investigation into the barriers of adopting biodiesel by transportation companies is the focus of the present study. A survey of 147 transportation companies in Malaysia was undertaken, and the data gathered were analyzed using partial least squares technique. Lack of government support, lack of environmental-commercial benefits, and lack of competitive pressure were found to be the barriers to biodiesel adoption. The results also indicated that differentiation strategy moderates the impact of lack of government support, lack of customer demand, lack of environmental-commercial benefits and lack of competitive pressure on biodiesel adoption. The results of this study could benefit policy makers by providing them key focus areas in which they can modify their strategies to actively and successfully promote the use of biodiesel among transportation companies in developing countries. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - One approach to effectively control the rapid expansion of water hyacinth is to use it as a feedstock in producing valuable goods. While it is technically feasible to produce bioethanol using water hyacinth, the economic feasibility of this valorization is yet unknown. This article conducted an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis of the production of bioethanol from water hyacinth. The results show that in comparison with the active control approach of collection and landfill, it is economically feasible to produce bioethanol from the collected biomass. In addition to its contribution to energy diversification, the production of bioethanol using water hyacinth as a feedstock cannot only control the rapid expansion of water hyacinth but can also contribute to carbon emissions reduction and water quality improvement. While the production cost of bioethanol is high, environmental values play an important role in the economic justification of the production. The coupled use of water hyacinth as a phytoremediation plant and bioethanol feedstock is a potential response to green development strategies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a potentially low-carbon, renewable alternative fuel to diesel, sharing similar chemical and physical properties to diesel. There have been significant efforts in introducing primarily bioethanol and some biodiesel to the road transport sector, with varying levels of success. However, the rail sector has not seen as large an effort in introducing biodiesel. This paper summarizes the literature on the introduction of biodiesel (bioethanol was a relevant fuel) in order to learn lessons, which can be applied to the rail transport sector. A decision-making framework PESTLE (Political/Policies, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) is used to analyze these lessons, and their relevance (or not) to the rail sector. While introduction of biodiesel in the rail sector has some inherent advantages, such as fewer refueling points, customers and manufacturers compared to the road sector, it also faces some challenges, especially in the context of the longer life of locomotives, making fleet turnover and potential transition to 100% biodiesel slow. Additionally, maintenance costs are still uncertain. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The use of bagasse and trash from sugarcane fields in ethanol production is supposed to increase the ethanol yield per hectare, to reduce the energy demand, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental impacts. In this article, different technological options of ethanol production are investigated and quantified looking at potential environmental impacts. The first-generation ethanol from sugarcane is compared to stand-alone second-generation ethanol as well as an integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production. Methods: The method applied for this life cycle assessment follows the ISO standards 14040/44. The data used in this life cycle assessment is mainly derived from process simulation, literature, and primary data collection. Background data was taken from databases such as GaBi and ecoinvent. The life cycle impact assessment follows the default methods at midpoint level recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System. The calculations were performed using the GaBi 7 life cycle assessment software. It is assumed that 50% of sugarcane trash is recovered and used for second-generation ethanol production, whereas the other 50% remain in the field to maintain soil fertility and to prevent soil erosion. In the case of first-generation ethanol, the same amount of trash is used for energy generation. Results and discussion: The results of the life cycle impact assessment show that, compared to first-generation ethanol, second-generation ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil allows significant reductions in all investigated impact categories except resource depletion. Resource depletion, however, is strongly influenced by the demand for ammonium phosphate which is needed for inoculum preparation. Integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production also allows reductions in most of the environmental impacts except for global warming, photochemical ozone depletion, and resource depletion. The yield of ethanol per hectare increases since bagasse and trash are used for the production of second-generation ethanol. Consequently, the results show that agricultural land occupation is reduced for integrated first- and second-generation ethanol by approximately 11%, whereas second-generation ethanol allows reduction of land use by approximately a factor of 30. Conclusions: The use of bagasse and trash for ethanol production allows both the reduction of several environmental impacts and land use, in particular, because impacts caused by sugarcane cultivation are avoided. For the integrated first- and second-generation ethanol scenario, it is important to further reduce the total energy demand in order to achieve self-sufficiency for the plant energy and to avoid additional emissions from burning fossil fuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during 15 months to study the effects of four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the growth of Ricinus communis accession SF7. Plants were established on amended soil (vermicompost:sawdust:soil 1:1:1) severely polluted by lead-acid batteries (LAB) located at Mexico State, Mexico. Plants inoculated with Acaulospora sp., Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora gigantea had 100% survival in comparison to non-inoculated plants (57%). These same AMF enhanced palmitic and linoleic acids content in seeds of R. communis. Acaulospora sp. modified rhizosphere soil pH and decreased 3.5 folds Pb foliar concentrations while F. mosseae BEG25 decreased three times Pb soil availability in comparison to non-inoculated plants. Spatial changes in Pb soil availability were observed at the end of this research. No fungal effect on P, Ca, Cu foliar concentrations, soluble sugars, proline, chlorophyll or on the activity of two oxidative stress enzymes was observed. Mycorrhizal colonization from the inoculated fungi was between 40% and 60%, while colonization by native fungi was between 16% and 22%. A similar percentage of foliar total phenolic compounds was observed in non-mycorrhizal plants and those inoculated with G. gigantea and Acaulospora sp. This is the first research reporting effects of AMF on R. communis (castor bean) shrubs when grown on a LAB recycling site suggesting the use of Acaulospora sp. and F. mosseae BEG25 in phytostabilization to ameliorate Pb pollution and decreasing its ecological risk. © 2018

AB  - Phytochemical extractives can include hundreds of molecules in diverse classes—including soluble components such as flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and terpenes—and they make-up several percent of the non-carbohydrate dry mass in small diameter Douglas-fir forestry residues. We establish that aqueous extracts from the most extractive rich tissue of Douglas-fir, bark, are inhibitory at biofuel relevant concentrations and demonstrate the inhibition with initial rate saccharification experiments using Trichoderma reesei cellulases. Initial rates of carbohydrate production from crystalline cellulose and amorphous cellulose substrates suggest that exoglucanase, endoglucanase and β-glucosidases are each inhibited between 15 and 25% in the presence of bark extracts. We find that despite the chemical complexity of this feedstock, the bulk of the inhibition comes from tannins while other suspicious extractive components we tested produced no statistically significant inhibition (in conditions of up to 3 grams per liter dry extractives). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the potential of poultry wastes to be used as feedstock in non-catalytic and catalytic fast pyrolysis processes, which is a continuation of our previous research on their conversion into biofuel via slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal conversion. Both poultry meal and poultry litter were examined, initially in a fixed bed bench-scale reactor using ZSM-5 and MgO as catalysts. Pyrolysis of poultry meal yielded high amounts of bio-oil, while pyrolysis of poultry litter yielded high amounts of solid residue owing to its high ash content. MgO was found to be more effective for the deoxygenation of bio-oil and reduction of undesirable compounds, by converting mainly the acids in the pyrolysis vapours of poultry meal into aliphatic hydrocarbons. ZSM-5 favoured the formation of both aromatic compounds and undesirable nitrogenous compounds. Overall, all bio-oil samples from the pyrolysis of poultry wastes contained relatively high amounts of nitrogen compared with bio-oils from lignocellulosic biomass, ca. 9 wt.% in the case of poultry meal and ca. 5–8 wt.% in the case of poultry litter. This was attributed to the high nitrogen content of the poultry wastes, unlike that of lignocellulosic biomass. Poultry meal yielded the highest amount of bio-oil and was selected as optimum feedstock to be scaled-up in a semi-pilot scale fluidised bed biomass pyrolysis unit with the ZSM-5 catalyst. Pyrolysis in the fluidised bed reactor was more efficient for deoxygenation of the bio-oil vapours, as evidenced from the lower oxygen content of the bio-oil. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Mobile pelleting machines (MPMs) provide an as-yet-unexplored opportunity to reduce logistic costs associated with biomass-to-biofuel supply chains. We develop an optimization model to minimize the overall cost of producing ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. We present results from a case study that considers multiple biomass types (switchgrass and corn stover) and forms (round and rectangular bales) and the potential for mobile pelleting. Our analyses offer insight into conditions under which mobile densification is economically viable. Results indicate that MPM utilization is sensitive to changes in biomass densification costs, transportation distances, satellite storage location fixed cost, and the number of MPMs. © 2018

AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, now dubbed the ‘Green OPEC’ of the global bioenergy economy, biofuels have been hailed as a ‘new profitability frontier’ that will provide ‘win-win’ outcomes and deliver development to poor communities. Yet, in an era of economic recession and soaring food prices, their ‘sustainability’ has been at the centre of controversy. This paper focuses on the case of Sierra Leone, where in 2008, a Swiss bioenergy company ushered in the largest foreign direct investment since the end of the country's civil war. Although recently set back by the catastrophic impacts of the Ebola crisis, there continues to be much support for the government's strategy to secure foreign direct investment in biofuels production in agriculturally rich regions of the country. Bioenergy proponents believe that such investments will transform rural areas, in light of the fact that Sierra Leone has over the last decade been consistently ranked as one of the poorest in the world, facing food insecurity, high unemployment and entrenched poverty. But land access and control remain central to debates around biofuels and development, particularly for poor rural people living in project areas. This paper explores the perceptions of a wide range of project stakeholders, many of whom have differing interpretations of what biofuel sustainability entails. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications this may have for the present post-Ebola environment, where evolving policy discussions on land investment and ‘green’ development continue to assume a key part of the government's recovery trajectory. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The capacity of the Denver Basin to store CO2 in hydrocarbon reservoirs was analyzed using two techniques. The first approach employed by the Southwest Carbon Partnership assumes CO2 is injected into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs but no fluids are withdrawn. The second method analyzes the storage capacity of the Denver Basin assuming CO2 is injected until the pressure in each oil reservoir reaches the hydrostatic gradient, and CO2 then continues to be injected into the oil reservoirs in order to recover additional oil, until the incremental oil recovery would no longer be commercially viable. The amount of CO2 sequestered in the 30 oil fields studied was found to be 160 Mt with the first method but only 50 to 70 Mt using the second method. If the CO2 source is fermentation emissions available from corn ethanol plants in Nebraska, and the produced bio-CO2-EOR oil is refined into gasoline that is consumed in Colorado, then the CO2 sequestration project described in this paper could reduce the GHG emissions from the transportation sector in Colorado by 10% during peak oil production from the project. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is often assigned a central role in future energy system scenarios as a carbon sink, making negative greenhouse gas emissions possible through carbon capture and storage of biogenic carbon dioxide from biomass-fuelled power plants. However, biomass could also serve as a strategic complement to variable renewables by supplying electricity during hours of high residual load. In this work, we investigate the role of biomass in electricity systems with net zero or negative emissions of carbon dioxide and with different levels of biomass availability. We show that access to biomass corresponding to ca. 20% of the electricity demand in primary energy terms, is of high value to the electricity system. Biomass for flexibility purposes can be a cost-efficient support to reach a carbon neutral electricity system with the main share of electricity from wind and solar power. Biomass-fired power plants equipped with carbon capture and storage in combination with natural gas combined cycle turbines are identified as being the cost-effective choice to supply the electricity system with flexibility if the availability of biomass within the electricity system is low. In contrast, in the case of excess biomass, flexibility is supplied by biomethane-fired combined cycle turbines or by biomass-fired power plants. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The aim in new agricultural investment projects is to achieve a proper balance between customer value creation and investor economic benefits. Several authors have highlighted the importance of integrating agroindustrial supply chain operations, as a way to improve competitiveness. In the specific case of sugarcane, most research only integrates harvest and transport operations, lacking simultaneous analysis of sowing, growing and harvesting. Also, from the perspective of sugarcane supply chain planning, few contributions undertake tactical and strategic decisions. This paper proposes an optimization model for sugarcane supply chain planning, integrating several agricultural decisions from a strategic-tactical planning perspective. The uncertainty effects generated by weather conditions were also considered. As a main contribution, the model establishes a set of agricultural decisions that maximize cane yield, in order to optimize the Net Present Value (NPV) of expected profits. The proposed model is utilized to evaluate the feasibility of a new biofuel production plant in Colombia. Results allowed for the identification of critical variables to control, in order to reduce investment risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We investigate how value chain governance can evolve in the transport biofuel sector beyond logistics and operations optimization, drawing on cases of eighteen manufacturers in four Belt and Road countries. We find that key motivations for vertical integration include control of strategic factors such as security of supply and gaining access to the retail market, subject to inter-institutional and intra-organizational barriers. We contribute to a theory of governance mode selection by suggesting plural governance mode offers a key strategic choice under institutional constraints. In BRI countries, plural mode could be less disruptive when integrating value chains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial grass highly valued as an energy crop resource for the production of bioethanol due to its high carbohydrate content, fast growth, and ability to grow in lands that cannot support crop or food production. In the present study, this biomass was submitted to steam explosion pretreatment in a semi-continuous pre-pilot reactor with the aim of obtaining a pretreated solid with high digestibility for enzymatic hydrolysis. Different conditions of temperature (170–200 °C) and residence time (5–15 min), leading to different severity factors (2.76–4.12) were used for steam explosion pretreatment, which were combined through a 22 central composite design. The results revealed that both variables had great influence in the process, affecting both the biomass structure and the saccharification yield, as a consequence. However, in the range of values evaluated in this study, the effect of the temperature was more prominent than the effect of the residence time. The best saccharification yield (88.3%) was obtained when using the biomass pretreated at 200 °C for 10 min. Similar result was obtained using a commercial cellulose pulp as feedstock for enzymatic hydrolysis, confirming that the best conditions for switchgrass pretreatment in the pre-pilot scale were successfully established. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass has emerged as an attractive renewable source of energy to shift away from fossil fuels. The high cost of biomass feedstock and variations in its availability and quality are among the key barriers in bioenergy and biofuel development. Therefore, it is crucial to design and operate biomass supply chains that are efficient. In previous studies, simulation modelling was used to analyse biomass supply chains while incorporating its complexities and dynamic nature. Despite the impact of biomass storage on demand fulfilment and logistics cost, the problem of biomass inventory management is overlooked. In this paper, a simulation model is developed to compare demand fulfilment, cost, and emission of a forest-based biomass supply chain for two inventory systems: 1) order-up-to-level, and 2) fixed order quantity. Unlike the previous simulation studies, the considered supply chain includes multiple number of conversion facilities that use different types of biomass. Additionally, competition for biomass and logistical resources as well as substitution of biomass, when possible, are considered in the model. The simulation model is applied to a case study in Canada to assess different scenarios. The fixed order quantity system often results in higher demand fulfilment, however, it has higher cost and CO2 eq. emission compared with the order-up-to-level system. In both inventory systems, the transportation cost has the highest contribution to the total cost, ranging from 50% to 82% depending on the type of conversion facility. The grinding operation contributes the most (56%–81%) to the total CO2 eq. emission for both inventory systems. © 2018 IAgrE

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the environmental benefits of implementing low-cost digesters in small-scale farms in Colombia by using the LCA methodology. Four scenarios were taken into account considering two small-scale farms located in different areas: two (previous) scenarios where manure was stored in a manure pit and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was used for cooking; and two (current) scenarios where manure is treated in low-cost digesters, the digestate replaces the synthetic fertiliser and the biogas is used for cooking replacing the LPG. Results showed that digesters implementation considerably reduced (by up to 80%) potential environmental impacts associated with manure handling, fuel and fertiliser use in the small-scale Colombian farms. This was mainly due to the reduction of LPG and synthetic fertiliser use which were replaced by biogas and digestate. An economic assessment showed that low-cost digesters reduced expenses associated with cooking fuel and fertiliser purchase by 80%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levoglucosenone (LGO), furfural (FF) and levoglucosan are high value-added chemical components of bio-oil derived by thermal deconstruction of biomass. However, separation of these chemicals from bio-oil is challenging due to low selectivity. Impregnation of metal salts for catalytic pyrolysis or microwave treatment for altering chemical composition in biomass are potential methods to enhance selectivity of these high value-added chemicals. In the current study, Ashe juniper waste was pretreated with metal salts prior to vacuum pyrolysis and investigated the effects of metal salt type and its concentration on product yield and properties. The results showed that Levoglucosenone, which was attributed to dehydration of levoglucosan, was obtained only with the biomass pretreated with CuSO4 and ZnSO4. Metal salt type and concentration also affected the selectivity of levoglucosenone (LGO) and furfural (FF) by catalytic vacuum pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted organosolv treatment also affected biomass chemical composition, pyrolysis characteristics and promoted the selectivity of levoglucosan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris) is considered as one of the most viable feedstock alternatives to maize for biofuel production since herbicide resistant sugarbeet was deregulated by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2012. So far, only a few sugarbeet simulation models have been developed and these models are limited to application for local regions. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) provides a common framework for a cropping system study and currently has crop modules for >40 crops. However, DSSAT currently does not include a model for sugarbeet. In this study, the Crop and Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES) Beet model was modified and incorporated into the current version of the Cropping System Model (CSM) to simulate growth, development, and yield of sugarbeet. The PEST optimizer was used for parameter estimation, transferability evaluation, and predictive uncertainty analysis. The sugarbeet model was evaluated with two sets of experimental data collected in two different regions and under different environmental conditions; one in Romania (Southeastern Europe) during 1997–1998 and the other in North Dakota, US (North America) during 2014–2016. After model calibration for specific cultivars, the CSM-CERES-Beet model performed well for the simulation of leaf area index, leaf number, leaf or top weight, and root weight for both datasets (NSE = 0.144–0.976, rRMSE = 0.127–1.014). Uncertainty analysis revealed that the calibrated CSM-CERES-Beet consistently over-predicted leaf number with false confidence, although measured leaf number also showed a significant variability. The model was successfully applied for predicting yield for six different sugarbeet cultivars grown in North Dakota during the 2014 to 2016 growing seasons. CSM-CERES-Beet could be applied for predicting sugarbeet yield for different soil and climatic conditions and various management scenarios for the Red River Valley in the US and other regions with environmental conditions favorable for sugarbeet production. © 2018

AB  - The climate impact of bioenergy is commonly quantified in terms of CO 2 equivalents, using a fixed 100-year global warming potential as an equivalency metric. This method has been criticized for the inability to appropriately address emissions timing and the focus on a single impact metric, which may lead to inaccurate or incomplete quantification of the climate impact of bioenergy production. In this study, we introduce Dynamic Relative Climate Impact (DRCI) curves, a novel approach to visualize and quantify the climate impact of bioenergy systems over time. The DRCI approach offers the flexibility to analyze system performance for different value judgments regarding the impact category (e.g., emissions, radiative forcing, and temperature change), equivalency metric, and analytical time horizon. The DRCI curves constructed for fourteen bioenergy systems illustrate how value judgments affect the merit order of bioenergy systems, because they alter the importance of one-time (associated with land use change emissions) versus sustained (associated with carbon debt or foregone sequestration) emission fluxes and short- versus long-lived climate forcers. Best practices for bioenergy production (irrespective of value judgments) include high feedstock yields, high conversion efficiencies, and the application of carbon capture and storage. Furthermore, this study provides examples of production contexts in which the risk of land use change emissions, carbon debt, or foregone sequestration can be mitigated. For example, the risk of indirect land use change emissions can be mitigated by accompanying bioenergy production with increasing agricultural yields. Moreover, production contexts in which the counterfactual scenario yields immediate or additional climate impacts can provide significant climate benefits. This paper is accompanied by an Excel-based calculation tool to reproduce the calculation steps outlined in this paper and construct DRCI curves for bioenergy systems of choice. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Using municipal wastewater effluent as a feedstock in algae cultivation is a promising approach for increasing the commercial viability of algal biofuel production. However, differences in site-specific characteristics at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could drive tradeoffs between maximizing the profitability of algae production and minimizing the cost of meeting water quality standards. A complicating factor is how water quality regulations are enforced, namely the potential presence of nutrient trading markets that would monetize removal of nutrients from wastewater effluent. This study develops an analytical framework for optimizing the siting of an algal biofuel production facility within a network of WWTPs. A combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) model of an algal biofuel production facility is integrated with a simplified watershed model. An evolutionary algorithm is used to identify optimal sites for algal biofuel production and explore financial tradeoffs for algae biofuel producers and wastewater treatment plants. This analytical framework is then applied to a high-priority, impaired watershed in North Carolina, the Neuse River Basin. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The effects of bioreactor temperatures and salinities of an anaerobic membrane distillation bioreactor (anMDBR) on the permeation performance and their potential recovery of bioresources were fully examined in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a lab-scale anMDBR process utilizing sub-merged hollow fiber membranes. The hybrid system utilizing both membrane distillation (MD) and anaerobic bioreactors achieved 99.99% inorganic salt rejection regardless the operation temperatures and high initial flux from (2–4 L m−2 h−1) at 45–65 °C. However, after 7-day operation, the flux dropped by 16–50% proportional to the bioreactor temperatures. It was found that the effects of bioreactor temperatures had strong impacts on both the permeation performance and fouling behavior while salinity had insignificant effect. A compact non-porous fouling layer was observed on the membrane surface from the bioreactor operated at 65 °C while only a few depositions was found on the membrane from 45 °C bioreactor. In the present study, the optimal anMDBR temperature was found to be 45 °C, showing a balanced biogas production and membrane permeation performance including less fouling formation. At this bioreactor temperature (45 °C), the biogas yield was 0.14 L/g CODremoval, while maintaining a methane recovery of 42% in the biogas, similar recovery to those at bioreactor temperatures of 55 and 65 °C. The potential recovery of volatile fatty acids made anMDBR a more economically efficient system, in addition to its lower operation cost and smaller footprint compared with most other technologies for on-site wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In tropical countries, the use of fossil fuels and wood to obtain energy is the main option. To preserve natural habitats in this biome, the seeds gathered from wild and cultivated plants, native to this area, could be used for biodiesel production to satisfy the energy demand. For this, the fatty acid profiles of seed oils from 71 species belonging to 28 plant families, all native of tropical regions, were surveyed in a search for carbon-based fuels substitutes. Empirical data obtained from the fatty acid composition of seed oils, as well as lab data obtained from seed oils, were used to assess biodiesel properties, and good correlation between the two methodologies was found. The saponification number, iodine value, cetane number, higher heating value, cold filter-plugging point, density, induction period, and kinematic viscosity were used to establish the suitability of the different seed oils for biodiesel production. The aptness to serve as biodiesel was determined by applying the specification for biodiesel standard made by several organizations. Twenty-seven species have been detected as complying with the most restrictive standards established for quality of biodiesel, which contain enough oil in the seeds as to be considered promising choices for biodiesel production. Actions for promoting the growth of selected species in tropical habitats, in addition to providing a valuable resource as is biodiesel, will improve such areas as adequate habitats for wildlife, while this action would create employment in rural areas using natural resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gasification of Short Rotation Forestry (SRF) poplar wood chips and anaerobic digestion of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris have been analyzed as alternative supply chains for the production of biomethane. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed from the biomass cultivation to the upgrading stages. Process simulation of gasification and upgrading was carried out, environmental impacts of the entire supply chains have been estimated and discussed. The highest CO2 removal has been reached by absorption on monoethanolamine. Electricity requirements heavily affect the SRF chain, while productions of carbon dioxide and fertilizers are the main sources of impact of the microalgae cultivation. The recycle of non-absorbed fertilizers, as well as integration of microalgae digestion in wastewater plants, are recommended. Capture and re-injection of the CO2 lost during the upgrading stages would result, simultaneously, in an 8.53% reduction of the atmospheric emission, and in a minor demand to promote algal growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large scale industrial biomass efforts, whether in pursuit of cellulosic bioethanol, or combustion, will require amounts of feedstock in excess of available crop residues, leading to considerations of purpose grown agricultural biomass. This study determines the yields and break-even prices of perennial grass biomass crops in the state of North Dakota using bioeconomic GIS-based simulation modelling to address the uncertainty surrounding investments in biomass feedstock, particularly in northern climates and the Northern Great Plains. Cordgrass state average yields are 4.9 t/ha with break-even prices of $274/t. Switchgrass state average yields are 5.8 t/ha with break-even prices of $271/t. Miscanthus yields average 4.0 t/ha with break-even prices of $272/t. Average yields are lower than other parts of the United States and Canada, with Miscanthus suffering from significant potential winterkill. Average break-even prices are expensive, limiting the attractiveness of industrial scale investments in perennial grass biomass in the Northern Great Plains and other northerly climates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, there is a growing interest among agriculturists to use nanotechnology for the development of nutrient-use efficient fertilizers. However, its sustainable use for the synthesis of mineral or organic nano-fertilizers requires a thoughtful of the mechanism as well as the fate of nutrients and their interaction with soil-plant systems. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate the mixing of three different application rates of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZNPs: 1.4, 2.8 and 3.6 mg kg−1 soil) as well as zeolite (141, 282 and 423 mg kg−1 soil) with biogas slurry (AS) on soil nutrient availability and herbage nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) uptake in a standard pot experiment. We found that both ZNPs and zeolite significantly increased mineral N content in soil compared to AS alone (P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, plant available phosphorus or potassium and microbial biomass carbon (C) in the soil were neither significantly affected by any application rate of ZNPs nor zeolite mixed AS. Soil microbial biomass N was significantly higher in second and third application rates of both ZNPs and zeolite amended AS treatments compared to AS alone. However, this increment in mineral N did not influence shoot uptake and herbage apparent recovery of this nutrient from AS. Similarly, co-mixing of both ZNPs and zeolite in AS did not influence shoot N uptake but Zn uptake was significantly higher in this treatment compared to AS alone. Therefore, this combination would be considered for improving crop Zn uptake under such fertilizer management regimes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper evaluates differences in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn stover ethanol produced in the U.S. Midwest, as estimated by the life cycle-based software GHGenius 4.03a, GREET 2013, and GREET 2015. Life cycle assessments are not typically conducted using more than one software package, but comparisons such as the analysis in this paper provide a critical review of a fuel product system. In particular, differences in the data and assumptions become evident for life cycle stages of the same fuel product when compared between life cycle assessment software packages. Using default settings in the three software packages, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions predictions ranged from 2.75 to 47.8 gCO2 equivalent per MJ of ethanol (gCO2e MJ−1), which presents a difference of as much as 45 gCO2e MJ−1. Assumptions regarding nitrogen fertilizer, land management, on/off-site enzyme production, and material/energy inputs included/excluded had substantial effects on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. A consistent corn stover ethanol pathway using equivalent model assumptions and material/energy inputs was developed and implemented in each of the software packages, resulting in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions ranging from 40.7 to 42.0 gCO2e MJ−1. The difference in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions was considerably reduced to 1.3 gCO2e MJ−1 at most between software packages; however, individual emissions sources such as nitrogen fertilizer production, fertilizer application, corn steep liquor, glucose, sodium hydroxide, and biomass electricity still exhibit variation between software packages (e.g., up to 7.3 gCO2e MJ−1 E100 for equivalent glucose input), mainly due to different emissions factors data. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions appeared consistent because emissions sources that vary between software packages offset each other. Differences in greenhouse gas emissions determined for corn stover ethanol point to the need to improve the life cycle modelling and replicability of life cycle studies on this biofuel pathway. Such inconsistencies are relevant in a carbon economy because the same product will have a different value in different jurisdictions as a result of differences in life cycle assessment software packages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An environmental friendly process was developed to produce Arthrospira maxima's biomass from sugarcane vinasse, which was generated in a bioethanol production chain, at laboratory and pilot scale. Peptides fractions were than obtained from enzymatically hydrolyzed biomass. High microalgae biomass productivities were reached (0.150 g L−1 day−1) coupled with a significant reduction of BOD and COD (89.2 and 81%, respectively). Three peptide fractions were obtained from microalgae biomass through single or sequential enzymatic hydrolysis. Antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and/or anti-collagenase activities of biopetides’ fractions were observed. The PHS showed multi-biological activities. The three peptides fractions could be potential candidates for different applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presented experimental results to evaluate the optimization of production parameters through response surface methodology. These parameters significantly affected the yield of cottonseed oil methyl ester (COME). The input variables for the production of methyl ester from cottonseed oil were methanol/oil molar ratio, concentration of catalyst, temperature, and stirring speed. The response or output variable was the yield of methyl ester. The fatty acid methyl ester composition of COME (biodiesel) was obtained using a gas chromatography (GC) analyzer. BS EN 14103:2011 was the standard used to analyze the fatty acid methyl ester. The derived mathematical model was statistically accurate to predict the optimum value of COME. The optimized values to obtain a 98.3% yield of methyl ester were as follows: methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst concentration of 0.97% (w/w), temperature of 63.8 °C, and speed of 797 rpm. The physicochemical properties of COME were measured in accordance with ASTM D6751. The friction and wear properties of COME and its blends with petroleum diesel were tested using a four-ball wear testing machine. The tribological characteristics of COME as a new biofuel were assessed. COME displayed good lubricity with a low coefficient of friction and wear scar diameter. The coefficient of friction of pure COME (COME100) was lower than that of pure petroleum diesel (DL100) and COME blends with petrol diesel (COME10, COME20, and COME50). The average coefficient of friction of COME 100 was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 28.06%, 19.49%, 7.49%, and 3.65%, respectively. The wear scar diameter of COME100 for the tested ball was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 47.6%, 33.3%, 32.1%, and 21.42%, respectively. The worn surfaces of the tested balls were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the results were presented in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing water scarcity and Asia's rapid economic and social development, specifically the growing demand for animal products and biofuels, is forcing farmers to transform their traditional lowland double-rice cropping systems [R-R] to mixed lowland-upland systems where upland crops such as aerobic rice [R-A] or maize [R-M] are grown instead of paddy rice during the dry period. Such changes have implications on the C and N cycling in the soil-plant system, including major shifts in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from CH4 to N2O once paddies are used for upland cropping. Moreover, soil organic carbon stocks are decreasing, thereby jeopardizing soil fertility. In this study, we investigated if straw residue incorporation and/or catch crop cultivation impairs the greenhouse gas footprint of diversifying rice cropping systems and thus, presents an alternative to open-field straw burning and intensive mineral N fertilization. For this, we calculate annual global warming potentials (GWP) and yield-scaled GWPs of three different rice systems (R-R: rice-rice, R-A: rice- aerobic rice, R-M: rice maize) without (control) or with additions of straw (+6 Mg ha−1 [S]) or + straw + mungbean as catch crop ([M + S]) on the basis of high-temporal-resolution GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O), and measurements of yield parameters. The field trial was carried out at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, covering two full years. Although dry season N2O emissions increased twice- to threefold in the diversified systems (R-A, R-M), the strong reduction of CH4 emissions during this period resulted in significantly lower annual yield-scaled GWP as compared to the traditional R-R system. The same pattern was observed after application and incorporation of organic material (straw and mungbean), but led to higher substrate availability for methanogens during the following season. Therefore, the GWP was 9–39% higher in treatments including straw incorporation as compared to a control treatment without organic substrate amendments. Additional incorporation of mungbeans further increased GWPs, whereby the increment was highest in R-R rotation (88%) and lowest in R-M rotation (55%), with annual GHG emissions of 11.8 and 5.6 Mg CO2-eq ha−1, respectively. Our study shows that the yield-scaled GWP, as well as irrigation water demand, is lowest for rice-maize (R-M) cropping systems, followed by R-A and R-R systems. This ranking persists even with the incorporation of crop residues, a requirement for farmers as the ban of open-field burning is increasingly enforced. Our work also calls for a refinement of IPCC emission factors for lowland-upland rotations and the inclusion of the land-preparation period within the GHG balance of rice cropping systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the torrefaction process was optimized to improve the energy yield (Yenergy) in wheat straw pellet production. Wheat is the main agricultural product of Chile and cultivated in approximately 262 000 ha of land. Additionally, solid biofuel alternatives are necessary in the southern cities of Chile to reduce the pollution produced by low-quality firewood used as fuel. That being the case, it appears that wheat straw is a feasible raw material for solid biofuel production. In the current study, the torrefaction of wheat straw was optimized in a thermogravimetric analyzer using the response surface methodology (RSM). The polynomial model generated from the RSM study showed that heating rate and temperature were significant variables on the response variable, Yenergy; time was insignificant. It was shown that a decrease in temperature of up to 130 °C resulted in an enhancement of the Yenergy value, and at the aforementioned temperature, a low heating rate improved Yenergy. Following the conditions predicted by the model, torrefaction assays were conducted in a bench scale reactor under light torrefaction conditions: a torrefaction temperature of 145 °C, heating rate of 3 °C/min, and final torrefaction time of 50 min. The torrefied biomass was employed in a pellet production process that was performed in a pilot plant facility. The pellet produced from the torrefied biomass under light torrefaction conditions was named “brown pellet” because of its color. Most of the pellet properties satisfy the Standards for Industrial pellets (ISO 17225-6). This showed that light torrefaction temperature can be a potential pretreatment to achieve a commercial production process. Finally, an interesting result was obtained—the bulk density of brown pellets (568 ± 8 kg/m3) was considerably higher compared to that of wheat straw pellets (469 ± 8 kg/m3). This was probably caused by an increment in grinding characteristics. Further studies that focus on identifying the effects of light torrefaction conditions on the mechanical properties of wheat straw pellets should be conducted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advocacy for climate mitigation aims to minimize the use of fossil fuel and to support clean energy adaptation. While alternative energies (e.g., biofuels) extracted from feedstock (e.g., micro-algae) represent a promising role, their production requires reliably modeled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). PAR models predict energy parameters (e.g., algal carbon fixation) to aid in decision-making at PAR sites. Here, we model very short-term (5-min scale), sub-tropical region's PAR with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model with a Centroid-Mean (ANFIS-CM) trained with a non-climate input (i.e., only the solar angle, θ Z ). Accuracy is benchmarked against genetic programming (GP), M5Tree, Random Forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR). ANFIS-CM integrates fuzzy and neural network algorithms, whereas GP adopts an evolutionary approach, M5Tree employs binary decision, RF employs a bootstrapped ensemble, and MLR uses statistical tools to link PAR with θ Z . To design the ANFIS-CM model, 5-min θ Z (01–31 December 2012; 0500H–1900H) for sub-tropical, Toowoomba are utilized to extract predictive features, and the testing accuracy (i.e., differences between measurements and forecasts) is evaluated with correlation (r), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott (WI), Nash–Sutcliffe (E NS ), and Legates &amp; McCabes (E LM ) Index. ANFIS-CM and GP are equivalent for 5-min forecasts, yielding the lowest RMSE (233.45 and 233.01μ mol m −2 s −1 ) and MAE (186.59 and 186.23 μmol m −2 s −1 ). In contrast, MLR, M5Tree, and RF yields higher RMSE and MAE [(RMSE = 322.25 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 275.32 μmol m −2 s −1 ), (RMSE = 287.70 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 234.78 μmol m −2 s −1 ), and (RMSE = 359.91 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 324.52 μmol m −2 s −1 )]. Based on normalized error, ANFIS-CM is considerably superior (MAE = 17.18% versus 19.78%, 34.37%, 26.39%, and 30.60% for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF models, respectively). For hourly forecasts, ANFIS-CM outperforms all other methods (WI = 0.964 vs. 0.942, 0.955, 0.933 &amp; 0.893, and E LM  = 0.741 versus 0.701, 0.728, 0.619 &amp; 0.490 for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF, respectively). Descriptive errors support the versatile predictive skills of the ANFIS-CM model and its role in real-time prediction of the photosynthetic-active energy to explore biofuel generation from micro-algae, studying food chains, and supporting agricultural precision. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Bioenergy may have significant lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities compared to fossil alternatives, but concerns are raised that bioenergy would contribute to additional water scarcity. Therefore, the GHG intensity, water intensity and water-related risks are analysed simultaneously for conventional diesel and soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina, Brazil, Unites States (U.S.), Thailand and Iran on a life cycle basis. The water-related risks are estimated with a water scarcity—consumption matrix, which was recently developed. Results show that a significant share (9%-38%) of the GHG emissions in all biodiesel cases is caused by soil N 2 O emissions. In addition, the ranges in water consumption intensity for soya bean-based biodiesel are considerably larger than for fossil fuels. However, whether this leads to high water-related risks depends on the local water scarcity. Soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina has low water-related risks to all nodes of the supply chain due to low local water stress combined with a low direct water consumption intensity (20 L/GJ fuel ). In addition, high GHG emission reduction (71%) and a low-specific eutrophication potential (0.04 kg PO 4 3− /GJ fuel ) are achieved. The indirect water consumption intensity is estimated at 120–420 L/GJ for soya bean-based biodiesel, which is significant if the soya beans are rainfed, like in Argentina and Brazil. If irrigation is required, indirect water consumption is dwarfed by irrigation water. Overall, it is concluded that soya bean-based biodiesel can have significant lower GHG emission intensity than fossil diesel, without causing additional water stress in the supply chain if they are produced in water abundant areas and good agricultural practices are used. The used method shows disaggregated water-related risks for the different nodes of the supply chain to acknowledge the regional nature of water scarcity and enables decision makers to identify “hot spots” and take targeted actions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas (physic nut), a non-edible oilseed crop, represents one of the most promising alternative energy sources due to its high seed oil content, rapid growth and adaptability to various environments. We report ~339 Mbp draft whole genome sequence of J. curcas var. Chai Nat using both the PacBio and Illumina sequencing platforms. We identified and categorized differentially expressed genes related to biosynthesis of lipid and toxic compound among four stages of seed development. Triacylglycerol (TAG), the major component of seed storage oil, is mainly synthesized by phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase in Jatropha, and continuous high expression of homologs of oleosin over seed development contributes to accumulation of high level of oil in kernels by preventing the breakdown of TAG. A physical cluster of genes for diterpenoid biosynthetic enzymes, including casbene synthases highly responsible for a toxic compound, phorbol ester, in seed cake, was syntenically highly conserved between Jatropha and castor bean. Transcriptomic analysis of female and male flowers revealed the up-regulation of a dozen family of TFs in female flower. Additionally, we constructed a robust species tree enabling estimation of divergence times among nine Jatropha species and five commercial crops in Malpighiales order. Our results will help researchers and breeders increase energy efficiency of this important oil seed crop by improving yield and oil content, and eliminating toxic compound in seed cake for animal feed. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Policy and legislative initiatives, along with volatility in agricultural commodity prices, have encouraged farmers to consider alternative crops, such as potential advanced biomass feedstock for bioenergy, including energy beets. This paper employs an integrated biophysical, economic and transportation GIS-based model to examine the production of beet-bioethanol from five sites in North Dakota. The study finds that beet-bioethanol could provide net benefits to farmers and ethanol producers in the state, under current market conditions, but only if the bioethanol plant site is carefully selected. Specifically, a 75 million litre plant could produce a profit at capacity offering a beet price of $33/t at an ethanol price of $0.40/L at one of five analyzed sites. Policy initiatives that increase the price of ethanol could make production attractive at all of the investigated sites. Both increased agricultural opportunity costs and decreased transportation costs move feedstock production away from the plant site to higher quality lands. This result implies that, in some cases, to pursue biomass production on marginal lands, policy initiatives would need to increase transportation costs, lower agricultural commodity prices, or increase biomass prices. Therefore, assumptions about land quality should be carefully considered in biomass and bioenergy policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from cellulosic feedstocks may increase during the next century. To be sustainable, this production should protect environmental quality and biodiversity. Fertilized mixed-species prairie can deliver substantial quantities of cellulosic ethanol per unit land area with minimal losses of NO 3 -N in drainage water, but the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in such systems has been uncertain. We report how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application, precipitation, and time affected the species composition and productivity of reconstructed prairie communities harvested annually as biofuel feedstocks over a 9-year period. Results indicated that both precipitation and fertilizer application drove above-ground biomass production, with the greatest response to fertilizer occurring in wetter than average years. Fertilization reduced species richness, but increased species evenness. Consequently, Simpson's diversity index did not differ between the fertilized and unfertilized communities, though it declined in both communities over time. A total of 59 plant species was recorded, with eight of them explaining most of the differences in vegetation cover between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments. After 9 years, the high fertility community was dominated by the C4 grass Andropogon gerardii, the C3 grass Elymus canadensis, and the non-leguminous forbs Heliopsis helianthoides, Helianthus maximiliani, and Monarda fistulosa, whereas the low fertility community was dominated by the C4 grasses A. gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, the C3 grass E. canadensis, and the non-leguminous forb M. fistulosa. Fertilization increased the abundance of flowering forbs available to pollinators in the early, middle and late portions of the growing season. Synthesis and applications. Results of our study suggest that maintenance of reasonably high levels of productivity and biodiversity are possible in fertilized prairie communities harvested annually for bioenergy, with plant cover more evenly distributed among different functional groups. In the future, if policy and markets favour biofuels and better delivery of ecosystem services from harvested land, prairie-based feedstocks could become part of a renewable energy portfolio that fosters biodiversity and contributes to the provision of floral resources for pollinators. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Oil production by microalgae is investigated as a possible solution to sustain the petroleum shortage. Some microalgae such as Botryococcus braunii have the advantage of being able to produce a high amount of hydrocarbon without requiring arable lands to grow on. Also, hydrocarbons extracted from B. braunii are suitable for the cosmetic industry, as they are long-chain hydrocarbons similar to squalene. As such, B. braunii oil might generate a high profit. However, harvesting hydrocarbon from microalgae cultures is difficult. Here we show an innovative way of collecting hydrocarbon from algae culture using high voltage electric discharges (HVED). Botryococcus braunii form a matrix full of hydrocarbons allowing many cells to stick together as microcolonies. When the energy applied is too high, hydrocarbons are destroyed; and when the energy is to low, algae culture stays unchanged. But when energy applied is just sufficient (near 625 J mL −1 ), cells leave colonies and sink to the bottom of the samples, while hydrocarbons remain unaffected and float to the surface of the samples. Such a phenomenon allows us to harvest the matrices of colonies which are empty of cells, suitable as a biomass for biofuel production. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 °C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 °C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The deposition of insoluble light-absorbing particles (ILAPs) on snow and ice surfaces can significantly reduce albedo, thereby accelerating the melting process. In this study, 67 ice samples were collected from seven glaciers located on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) between May 2013 and October 2015. The mixing ratios of black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and mineral dust (MD) were measured with an integrating sphere/integrating sandwich spectrophotometer (ISSW) system, which assumes that the light absorption of MD is due to iron oxide (Fe). Our results indicate that the mass-mixing ratios of BC, OC, and Fe exhibit considerable variability (BC: 10-3100 ng g -1 ; OC: 10-17 000 ng g -1 ; Fe: 10-3500 ng g -1 ) with respective mean values of 220±400 ng g -1 , 1360±2420 ng g -1 , and 240 ± 450 ng g -1 over the course of the field campaign. We observed that for wavelengths of 450-600 nm, the measured light absorption can be largely attributed to the average light absorption of BC (50.7 %) and OC (33.2 %). Chemical elements and selected carbonaceous particles were also analyzed for source attributions of particulate light absorption based on a positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model. Our findings indicate that on average, industrial pollution (33.1 %), biomass or biofuel burning (29.4 %), and MD (37.5 %) constitute the principal sources of ILAPs deposited on TP glaciers. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel and single cell oils obtained from oleaginous yeasts grown in industrial waste are attractive alternatives to the conventional fuels. However, there are only few articles dealing with the stability of the microbial biofuels. Hence, this study aimed at characterizing the storage time of biodiesels using Rancimat methods. The microbial oil and the biodiesel obtained from microbial oil have been characterized with storage stability due to various oxidizing and thermal damage. Here, the microbial fuels were subject to Rancimat analysis and found to have high thermal-oxidative stability of 18 and 8.78 h for biodiesel and oil, respectively. The storage stability resulting from storage conditions was extrapolated for biodiesel and oil and has been found to be 1.62 and 0.54 years, respectively. The infrared spectroscopic analysis reveals the degree of oxidation found after the induction time was reached and shows the characteristic peaks for degradation products. Gas chromatography revealed the compounds that were responsible for the stability as well as the amount of degradation products left. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Outdoor cultivation of microalgae for biofuel production is not yet economically feasible, in part due to costs associated with CO 2 supply. Large point sources of CO 2 are also rarely available in proximity to desired large-scale algae cultivation sites (nonagricultural, barren, and flat lands). The cost and location constraints posed by concentrated CO 2 supply can be avoided by cultivation of microalgae that have the ability to grow under extreme alkaline pH conditions (pH &gt; 10). These alkaline solutions are effective at scavenging atmospheric CO 2 at high rates and, in addition, afford natural protection for desired alkaliphilic microalgae cultivars against common competing organisms and predators. In this study, we report the cultivation of an extreme alkaliphilic microalgae isolate, Chlorella sorokiniana str. SLA-04 in a high pH (pH &gt; 10) medium that also contains a high carbonate/bicarbonate alkalinity (&gt;100 mequiv·L -1 ). This medium design simultaneously provides (i) a high driving force to effectively scavenge atmospheric CO 2 due to the high medium pH and (ii) nonlimiting bicarbonate concentrations (&gt;20 mM) for photosynthetic carbon fixation. We demonstrated high biomass productivities (&gt;16 g·m -2 ·d -1 ) in 4.2 m 2 raceway ponds by using this medium and without addition of concentrated CO 2 (i.e., using atmospheric CO 2 alone). Experimental measurements and theoretical mass transfer calculations show that rates of CO 2 uptake into the medium from the ambient atmosphere matched or exceeded the rates of dissolved inorganic carbon uptake due to photosynthesis. Further, measured lipid productivities were either higher or comparable to those reported for other raceway pond microalgae cultivations that used concentrated CO 2 sparging. This is the first study to report high biomass and lipid productivities of phototrophic microalgae cultures sustained with atmospheric CO 2 alone. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of microalgal biomass for fermentation has been highlighted as a means of producing a range of value-added biofuels and chemicals. On the other hand, the microalgal residue from the fermentation process still contains as much as 50% organic contaminants, which can be a valuable substrate for further bioenergy recovery. In this study, a microbial fuel cell and automatic external load control by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) were implemented to harvest the electrical energy from waste fermented microalgal residue (FMR). The MFC with MPPT produced the highest amount of energy (1.82 kJ/L) compared to the other MFCs with fixed resistances: 0.98 (1000 Ω), 1.16 (500 Ω), and 1.17 kJ/L (300 Ω). The MFC with MPPT also showed the highest maximum power density (88.6 mW/m2) and COD removal efficiency (620.0 mg COD/L removal with 85% removal efficiency). The implementation of MPPT gained an approximate 12.9% energy yield compared to the previous fermentation stage. These results suggest that FMR can be an appropriate feedstock for electrical energy recovery using MFCs, and the combined fermentation and MFC system improves significantly the energy recovery and treatment efficiency from FMR. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Trash fish feeding of cage fish can result in marine pollution. Whole and chopped trash fish can leach pollutants such as ammonia, phosphate and protein into surrounding waters. Reduction of pollution can be achieved by recycling the wastewater generated from trash fish feeding for cultivation of microalgae. Microalgae are potent candidates for the production of renewable and sustainable products such as feed and food, health and pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, industrial products, and biofuel. Two microalgae, Chlorella saccharophila and Nannochloropsis sp., have the potential to produce high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, high oil content ranging from 10.7 to 13.6% is found in Chlorella saccharophila and up to 9.3% for Nannochloropsis sp. Moreover, these microalgae can also be utilized as a biofuel to give a mean calorific value of 5364 Cal/g which is higher than that of wood for Chlorella saccharophila and 6132 Cal/g which is equivalent to that of coal for Nannochloropsis sp. An alternative biofuel derived from microalgae is feasible due to the fact that they do not compete for arable land for cultivation and land crops for feed and food. This study discusses the synergistic coupling of microalgae mass production with wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration potential for mitigation of environmental impacts and a technically viable alternative energy resource. Additionally, the de-oiled biomass byproduct after oil extraction or its whole biomass can be converted into sustainable and renewal industrial products such as bioplastic, biopaint, bioasphalt, and biobuilding components. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a common abiotic stress factor in the environment. Screening germplasm resources for Cd tolerance is an effective way to develop plants for use in biofuel production on land contaminated by heavy metals. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been identified by the U.S. Department of Energy as having very high potential as a biofuel substrate. Hence, 14 switchgrass cultivars under hydroponic culture were treated with 0 (control) or 10 μmol•L -1 Cd, and morphological and physiological traits were investigated. Root morphology data of switchgrass were obtained using an EPSON scanner and WinRHIZO software. Net photosynthetic rate was determined with the LiCor-6400 portable photosynthesis system and a spectrophotometer was used to determine root activity. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used to examine Cd accumulation of switchgrass. Data for measured traits were transformed to units of statistical standard deviation by division by their standard error and aggregated with positive/negative sign reversal where relevant, so that Cd tolerance was additive across traits, and a composite index of Cd tolerance compiled. Lastly a cluster analysis was performed. It was found that Cd stress significantly reduced the root length, root surface area, number of root tips, total dry weight, net photosynthetic rate and root activity of different switchgrass cultivars to different degrees. Significant differences were found (P&lt;0.01) among cultivars. According to composite index (D value), Kanlow was the most tolerant variety, while Foreburg was the least tolerant. On cluster analysis, the 14 switchgrass cultivars were classified into 3 Cd-tolerance types. One cultivar (Kanlow) had high Cd tolerance; 9 cultivars (Alamo, BoMaster, Carthage, Cave in Rock, Long Island, Newyork, Shawnee, Sunburst, Trailblazer) were medium-cadmium-tolerance types and 4 cultivars (Blackwell, Dacotah, Foresburg, Shelter) were Cd-sensitive types. It was also found that the cultivar Kanlow with high Cd tolerance had a strong ability to accumulate Cd. This study provides a theoretical basis for selecting suitable switchgrass cultivars for the cultivation of Cd-polluted land, and the results illustrate an operable method to evaluate the Cd tolerance of plant germplasm lines. © 2019, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

AB  - Biomass, as a renewable material and a clean alternative fuel in generating electricity and heat, is of particular importance in the transportation industry for the production of biofuel instead of fossil fuels. So far, many models have been proposed for the Bioenergy Supply network design, all of which are local and focus on designing new configurations that conform to a specific country's economic policies. But since globalization of the economy and industry is unavoidable today, effort has been made in this paper to propose a global Bioenergy Supply network management model. Contrary to the present literature on the Bioenergy Supply network, the proposed model addresses the redesign of an existing biomass supply network through logistic decisions, financial problems, and related merits. The model objectives can help managers to make decisions using the best transfer prices to maximize the global after tax profit of the biomass company even under uncertain conditions. To validate the model, use has been made of the data of a case study in Iran and Armenia. At last, it is concluded when transfer price is considered at the model, the global after tax profit can increase more than 8% compared with the case of without transfer price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) crop is major source of edible oil and protein for human and animals besides its various industrial uses including biofuels. Phytoplasma induced floral bud distortion syndrome (FBD), also known as witches' broom syndrome (WBS) has been one of the major biotic stresses adversely affecting its productivity. Transcriptomic approach can be used for knowledge discovery of this disease manifestation by morpho-physiological key pathways. Results: We report transcriptomic study using Illumina HiSeq NGS data of FBD in soybean, revealing 17,454 differentially expressed genes, 5561 transcription factors, 139 pathways and 176,029 genic region putative markers single sequence repeats, single nucleotide polymorphism and Insertion Deletion. Roles of PmbA, Zn-dependent protease, SAP family and auxin responsive system are described revealing mechanism of flower bud distortion having abnormalities in pollen, stigma development. Validation of 10 randomly selected genes was done by qPCR. Our findings describe the basic mechanism of FBD disease, right from sensing of phytoplasma infection by host plant triggering molecular signalling leading to mobilization of carbohydrate and protein, phyllody, abnormal pollen development, improved colonization of insect in host plants to spread the disease. Study reveals how phytoplasma hijacks metabolic machinery of soybean manifesting FBD. Conclusions: This is the first report of transcriptomic signature of FBD or WBS disease of soybean revealing morphological and metabolic changes which attracts insect for spread of disease. All the genic region putative markers may be used as genomic resource for variety improvement and new agro-chemical development for disease control to enhance soybean productivity. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuel production is of particular interest to Taiwan in the face of energy insecurity and climate change. Since climate-induced impacts such as changes in regional temperature and precipitation will influence crop yields, this study accommodates the estimated yield changes and subsequently develops a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model to investigate the economic and environmental effects of biofuel production. The results indicate that the utilization of sweet potato, along with its by-products, can result in the maximum amount of ethanol production. At higher levels of gasoline and greenhouse gas (GHG) prices, 441.2 million liters of ethanol can be produced, of which 70 million liters come from utilization of by-products. In general, economic factors such as gasoline and GHG prices have larger impacts on biofuel production than yield changes. However, although biofuel production is relative stable in the face of crop yield change, a shift in cultivars and land-use pattern is likely to occur. We show that the net emission reduction is relatively low compared to Taiwan's total emission and the aggregate value of emission reduction merits more investigation. These concerns, as well as resource reallocation and policy reformulation are also discussed in detail. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Investigations into the influence of variations in relative humidity, mixed-layer height, and mesoscale vertical velocity on column and surface aerosol characteristics over urban regions are quite rare. Here we report on a comprehensive investigation that was conducted over Ahmedabad, an urban location in western India, during December 2006. In this campaign columnar and surface aerosol characteristics were measured and compared to relative humidity, mixed-layer height, and mesoscale vertical velocity to examine their influence on urban aerosol characteristics. The 500-nm aerosol optical depth was found to be approximately 0.8 between 24 and 26 December while on a cleaner day such as 7 and 18 December the aerosol optical depth was 0.1. Aerosol optical depths based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level-2 and level-3 data, and on in situ Sun photometer measurements, show good agreement. The scattering coefficient (β sca ) and absorption coefficient (β abs ) increased by a factor of 5–10 on 26 December compared to 7 December (a normal day). This latter date was characterized by a clear atmosphere, a lower mixed-layer height (≈ 1650 m), positive vertical velocity and higher aerosol scale height (&gt;3 km), while 26 December was marked with hazy and smoky conditions, a larger mixed-layer height (≈ 2500 m), negative vertical velocity and smaller aerosol scale height (≈ 1 km). These atmospheric conditions lead to lower and higher values of surface and columnar aerosol concentrations on 7 and 26 December respectively. A measure of spectral aerosol absorption, αabs′ &gt; 2, indicating the dominance of carbonaceous aerosols from biomass/biofuel emissions (open biomass burning), is rather surprising as fossil-fuel emissions that produce strongly light absorbing carbonaceous particles usually dominate urban regions. The single-scattering albedo on both days is 0.56 and 0.67 respectively, while monthly mean hemispheric backscatter fraction b and asymmetry parameter g values are 0.16 and 0.53 respectively. Higher b and lower g values on 7 December, and lower b and higher g values on 26 December, provide the relative scale of variation in the amount of sub-micron aerosols that dominate on a normal/clear day vis-à-vis a smoky/perturbed day. Lower single-scattering albedo indicates the dominance of absorbing aerosols above Ahmedabad, and higher b and lower g values suggest the abundance of fine mode particles in aerosol size distribution. The in-depth results serve as representative inputs to modelling the column and surface characteristics, and the resultant radiative forcing of urban aerosols influenced by variations in relative humidity, mixed-layer height, and mesoscale vertical velocity. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Algal biofuel has a potential for reducing dependence on fossil fuel while curbing CO 2 emissions. Despite these potential benefits, a scalable, sustainable, and commercially viable system has not yet been developed. One of the key barriers is the lack of viable methods for disrupting algal biomass for the separation and extraction of bioproducts. This study experimentally investigated the feasibility of using chlorine as an agent for algal biomass disruption. Results: Chlorine was an effective agent for disrupting algal cell, as demonstrated with cell viability and SEM analyses. For disruption studies conducted using algal suspension at 0.02% solids (0.2 g/L), 90% of the algal cells were disrupted in 6 min at 10 mg/L chlorine dose. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the estimated specific energy requirement, specific cost, and GWP for chlorine were lower than those of the existing methods. The energy requirement for chlorine was 3.73 MJ/ kg of dry algae disrupted, while the requirements for the existing methods ranged from 33 to 860 MJ/ kg of dry algae. The GWP for chlorine was 0.3 kg CO 2 -eq./kg dry algae, while for the existing methods it varied from 5.9 to 369.8 CO 2 -eq./kg dry algae. Despite these advantages, it was observed that residual chlorine reacted with and mineralized the cell contents, which is undesirable. Conclusions: Future research efforts must be focused on eliminating or reducing the reaction of residual chlorine with cell contents. If this challenge is addressed, chlorine has a potential to be developed into an energy-efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable method for algal biomass disruption. This will in turn will overcome one of the technical bottlenecks, and ultimately increase algal biofuel production and reduce dependence on fossil fuel and curb CO 2 emissions. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cellulosic biofuels are sustainable compared to fossil fuels. However, inhibitors, such as acetic acid generated during lignocellulose pretreatment and hydrolysis, would significantly inhibit microbial fermentation efficiency. Microbial mutants able to tolerate high concentration of acetic acid are needed urgently to alleviate this inhibition. Results: Zymomonas mobilis mutants AQ8-1 and AC8-9 with enhanced tolerance against acetic acid were generated via a multiplex atmospheric and room temperature plasma (mARTP) mutagenesis. The growth and ethanol productivity of AQ8-1 and AC8-9 were both improved in the presence of 5.0-8.0 g/L acetic acid. Ethanol yield reached 84% of theoretical value in the presence of 8.0 g/L acetic acid (~ pH 4.0). Furthermore, a mutant tolerant to pH 3.5, named PH1-29, was generated via the third round of ARTP mutagenesis. PH1-29 showed enhanced growth and ethanol production under both sterilized/unsterilized conditions at pH 4.0 or 3.5. Intracellular NAD levels revealed that mARTP mutants could modulate NADH/NAD + ratio to respond to acetic acid and low pH stresses. Moreover, genomic re-sequencing revealed that eleven single nucleic variations (SNVs) were likely related to acetic acid and low pH tolerance. Most SNVs were targeted in regions between genes ZMO0952 and ZMO0956, ZMO0152 and ZMO0153, and ZMO0373 and ZMO0374. Conclusions: The multiplex mutagenesis strategy mARTP was efficient for enhancing the tolerance in Z. mobilis. The ARTP mutants generated in this study could serve as potential cellulosic ethanol producers. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Soybean oil constitutes an important source of vegetable oil and biofuel. However, high temperature and humidity adversely impacts soybean seed development, yield, and quality during plant development and after harvest. Genetic improvement of soybean tolerance to stress environments is highly desirable. Results: Transgenic soybean lines with knockdown of phospholipase Dα1 (PLDα1KD) were generated to study PLDα1′s effects on lipid metabolism and seed vigor under high temperature and humidity conditions. Under such stress, as compared with normal growth conditions, PLDα1KD lines showed an attenuated stress-induced deterioration during soybean seed development, which was associated with elevated expression of reactive oxygen species-scavenging genes when compared with wild-type control. The developing seeds of PLDα1KD had higher levels of unsaturation in triacylglycerol (TAG) and major membrane phospholipids, but lower levels of phosphatidic acid and lysophospholipids compared with control cultivar. Lipid metabolite and gene expression profiling indicates that the increased unsaturation on phosphatidylcholine (PC) and enhanced conversion between PC and diacylglycerol (DAG) by PC:DAG acyltransferase underlie a basis for increased TAG unsaturation in PLDα1KD seeds. Meanwhile, the turnover of PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) into lysoPC and lysoPE was suppressed in PLDα1KD seeds under high temperature and humidity conditions. PLDα1KD developing seeds suffered lighter oxidative stresses than did wild-type developing seeds in the stressful environments. PLDα1KD seeds contain higher oil contents and maintained higher germination rates than the wild-type seeds. Conclusions: The study provides insights into the roles of PLDα1 in developing soybean seeds under high temperature and humidity stress. PLDα1KD decreases pre-harvest deterioration and enhances acyl editing in phospholipids and TAGs. The results indicate a way towards improving production of quality soybean seeds as foods and biofuels under increasing environmental stress. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Energy is the primary driver of current economic. Drastic increasing population and their improved living standards are augmenting the demand of energy. This increasing demand of energy is requiring energy management to maintain regular power supply. The main energy demand in India is electricity, heat for various applications commercial and domestic applications and transport sectors. India has a growing economy which is rapidly expanding their transportation and power sectors in which major contribution of electricity generation by coal (59%). Renewable energy based generation is consistently increasing by the effect of climate change obligations and commitments. India is target to generate 10 GW bioenergy till 2022. Therefore, it is desirable that the policies on such issues are be regularly modifying based on the results on ground level. India is very rich in biomass and municipal waste and having long term vision to achieve energy generation by biomass. A close balancing is also required to sustain the biofuel programs without any subsidies and without compromising other priority sector related to the development of nation and quality of life to the last persons in this country.

AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs) and their potential role in meeting emission targets is a rapidly growing and contentious area of climate change mitigation research. The literature ranges in scope from general reviews of NETs options to research and development through applied case studies. Within this field, a gap exists in the application of this growing body of research to the unique limitations and opportunities of a specific nation. Ireland is a small developed island nation in the EU with a unique emissions profile, as 32% of the total comes from agriculture due to the high number of cattle. In this study we aim to assess the potential capacity of terrestrial NETs options for Ireland and review the nation-specific context for their deployment. Despite the proportionally high representation of biochar and carbon capture and storage in the international NETs research, in an Irish context afforestation and bioenergy crops are much more established practices and could readily be considered in possible emission pathways that use NETs. Higher capacities were found for NETs options that are currently unavailable (direct air carbon capture and storage and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), while options available to deploy at scale (afforestation, soil carbon management and biochar) have capacities limited by saturation of soil carbon stock and have higher risk of reversibility due to impermanence. Hence, while we estimate a reasonable technical capacity for NETs in Ireland, emission reduction remains the highest priority for feasibly meeting a Paris-aligned carbon quota for Ireland. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The demand for bioenergy (biofuels, heat and electricity) is increasing steadily around the globe. Major policy-related interventions for adoption and promotion of bioenergy have also been realized by several countries over the past few decades. The biomass supply chain incorporates several components of bioenergy production, which in turn consist of several activities for which different alternative methods are available. Different components of the biomass supply chain include production of bioenergy feedstock (biomass), logistics of biomass, conversion of biomass to bioenergy, and distribution of bioenergy or bioenergy carriers for end use. The single largest limiting factor for the production of bioenergy is the unavailability of biomass. Dedicated, fast-growing and high-biomass-producing plantations on non-arable land and utilization of agro-industrial waste materials can overcome this problem. Holistic integration of different components of the biomass supply chain and activities involved therein along with judicious design are likely to enhance the quantum of energy return, improve the greenhouse gas balance and reduce the water footprint of the bioenergy production facility. Additionally, the emerging yet promising concept of lignocellulosic and algal biorefinery would require a careful and prudent design of the biomass supply chain to achieve one of the most attractive characteristic of bioenergy: environmental sustainability. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Land quality influences how farmers allocate croplands in response to market forces. Farmers in the Western Corn Belt (WCB) have historically utilized the highest quality lands for corn cultivation, putting lower quality lands to other uses. This paper questions whether high corn prices influenced expansion of corn cultivation on lower quality lands, and the role played by US biofuel policy in such land use change. Using three decades of data, I estimate that the proportional change in corn acreage to rising corn prices is nearly three times larger in counties with lowest land quality versus those with the highest land quality. This variable response, however, is driven by the changes in cropland use for corn cultivation after 2006, the period following the change in US biofuel policy, and punctuated by two crop price spikes. Marginal agricultural lands and other lower quality lands, such as grasslands used for range or pasture, are therefore prone to conversion into corn cropping disproportionately during high price periods. High price responsiveness of lower quality lands also suggests these lands may cycle in and out of corn cropping opportunistically. This has implications for marginal land availability for bioenergy crops, and poses environmental concerns to the extent lower quality lands are also more environmentally sensitive. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Core Ideas: Varietal differences in salt tolerance were observed. There were differences in salt tolerance between the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. Growth and photosynthesis decreased at high salinity, indicating osmotic stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence did not decrease at high salinity, indicating no stress on photosystem II. Leaf chloride concentrations varied among genotypes, suggesting different salt tolerance mechanisms. Salt-tolerant energy crops can be grown on marginal lands for sustainable biofuel production without competing with food crops for arable land. However, salt tolerance is a variable trait among plant species, varieties, and growth stages. In this study, the relative salt tolerance of seven mustard (Brassica juncea) genotypes and four rapeseed (Brassica napus) genotypes was evaluated at the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. In the first experiment, seeds were sown in a growth chamber with reverse osmosis water or saline solution at an electrical conductivity (EC) of 10 mS cm−1 for 10 d, and emergence was determined daily. In the second experiment, seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and irrigated with nutrient solution (control) with an EC of 1.5 mS cm−1 or saline solutions (EC 5 and 10 mS cm−1, respectively) for 4 wk. For the seedling emergence stage, the relative emergence percent, and emergence index showed great variation among genotypes (range, 11–112% and 7–110%, respectively). For the seedling growth stage, the saline treatments caused reductions in leaf area and fresh and dry biomass that averaged 63, 65, and 65% relative to the control, respectively. Overall, hierarchal cluster analyses showed differences in salt tolerance between the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. Net photosynthetic rate decreased with salinity, but soil-plant analysis development readings increased by an average of 18% in the EC10 treatment. Chlorophyll fluorescence did not change, but performance index tended to increase in response to salinity. Chloride concentrations in the leaf tissue increased with salinity and ranged from 32 to 111 mg g−1, with significant varietal differences. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The demand for the utilization of agricultural resources for non-food purposes, such as feed-stock, has been on the rise globally in recent times. This article seeks to examine the under-lying reasons behind the boom in agricultural crops for bio fuel feedstock. Cognizant of this peak in demand, the article aims to show how the right to adequate food is being restrained by large-scale land acquisition as well as conversion for agricultural crop production namely for the purpose of agro-fuels. In the first part, the rationale that has galvanized the demand or bio fuels will be explored. In the second part, the restrictions posed on the right to food will be presented.

AB  - Science fiction (sf) has repeatedly explored the social and environmental consequences of technological developments in food and energy production. Never before have these explorations been of more importance and significance; recent shifts in resource extraction and processing (by both fossil fuel and ‘biofuel’ companies) have dramatically increased the reach and destructiveness of industrial food and energy production, as well as the extent of their entanglement. This article will begin by giving an indication of the reach and impacts of modern biofuel production, followed by a brief examination of the ‘food sovereignty’ movement and the theoretical frameworks and practical strategies that underpin it. Through the lens of the ‘food sovereignty’ movement, the article examines the ways in which sf writing and culture has explored the entanglement of food and energy regimes. Taking three aspects developed from the ‘six pillars’ of food sovereignty – political power, ecological integration and the fantastical – I examine three sf texts which place at their centre concerns over the entanglement of food and energy regimes. As I go on to demonstrate, all three texts – Robert A. Heinlein’s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966), the British post-apocalyptic TV show Survivors (1975–7), and Paolo Bacigalupi’s The Windup Girl (2009) – use elements of the fantastical to explore and make visible effects which are rarely seen or only understood in the abstract language of international political economy. I then conclude by reflecting on the urgent need apply these insights in the struggle for a fairer and more sustainable food system. © 2019. The Author(s).

AB  - The present work studied the effects of nitrogen limitation on the growth and biochemical composition (protein carbohydrate, lipid and pigments) of marine microalgae Isochrysis galbana. Stress of nitrogen limitations was given for 5 days and harvested freeze-dried algal biomass was analyzed for their growth and biochemical compositions. The growth of Isochrysis galbana cells were estimated by measuring optical density at 710nm and dry weight of filtered cells was incinerated at 550°C in a muffle oven after every two days. The biochemical components protein, lipid, carbohydrate and pigment were measured by Lowry, Bligh and Dryer, Dubois and Strickland and Parsons Method respectively. The result of present study found that stress of nitrogen deprivation shifts the metabolic pathways towards accumulation carbohydrate content (15.8%DW-22.2%DW) and lipid content (23.3%DW-37.9%DW). These valuable compounds exhibit potential applications in human health and biofuel industry. © 2019 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

AB  - On many public lands in the Great Plains region of the USA and Canada, cattail (Typha spp.) growth has far exceeded the 50:50 distribution recommended for optimum wetland wildlife habitat. Excessive cattail growth is the primary concern of wetland managers and its integrated management is reviewed here. The coverage of this mostly hybrid cattail (T. latifolia × T. angustifolia) is often over 90 % and if partially removed for habitat enhancement represents a substantial biomass resource in sites such as conservation wetlands, water retention basins and roadside drainage ditches. Available biomass is estimated to be 3,000 kg/ha assuming a 50 % harvest rate. Cattail control using mowing, herbicides, and burning is expensive, therefore if harvest logistics can be improved along with developing biomass markets, harvest management would become much more viable. Energy values of cattails are comparable to wood pellets at 20 MJ/kg. Cattails can be simultaneously managed for wetland wildlife, harvested for biofuel, serve as a partial substitute for coal, generate carbon credits, and remove phosphorus from the watershed. Cattails extract nitrogen and phosphorous from runoff water that enters rivers and lakes that could be used for agricultural fertiliser while reducing eutrophication. Additionally, rural economies could be boosted by harvesting a renewable energy resource, especially in areas with little fossil fuels or unsustainable biomass practices. © 2019 International Mire Conservation Group and International Peatland Society,.

AB  - Considering the fulfilment of future energy requirement in the world with green energy, it is necessary to consider the environmental pollution due to the use of conventional fossil fuel sources. Present environmental pollution caused by different fossil energy sources are discussed in detail. Advancement of biofuels as a green energy source and the environmental pollution savings due to the use of biofuel life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the fossil fuels are discussed in detail. Finally, emission due to transportation with biofuels is compared with relevant fossil fuels. It is evident that the atmospheric CO2 and CH4, emitted as a product of combustion of fossil fuel are the main sources for global warming. It is well understood that the usage of bioethanol as a substitute for gasoline is a green effect saving. Further, bioethanol produced using sugar cane, corn and sugar beet reduces greenhouse effect about one third, relative to gasoline. But, vice versa for biodiesel. Considering emission due to transportation with biofuels, compared with relevant fossil fuels, few positive and negative merits could be observed. It can be concluded that usage of bio ethanol as a substitute for gasoline should be promoted considering energy saving and greenhouse effect saving. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - This study evaluates the welfare impacts of jatropha (Jatropha curcas) cultivation measured as consumption expend-iture per adult-equivalent for smallholders in southern Malawi. Household survey data from the southern region of Malawi collected in 2014 from 303 smallholders using purposive and random selection strategies were used. Propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression methods were employed to address the selection bias problem and to control for observed and unobserved covariate effects. The analysis suggests that when selection bias and endogeneity were accounted for, jatropha cultivating farmers’ welfare was lower as compared to their counterparts. In the absence of tangible empirical evidence on welfare benefits to smallholder jatropha feedstock pro-ducers, this study concludes that jatropha is unlikely to bring meaningful welfare benefits to smallholders. As such, further research should consider pursuing other potential biofuel options like ‘moringa’ for biodiesel in the future Malawi biofuels policy. These findings also show that biofuels are not a panacea to the rural development and welfare of smallholders. Rather, the results suggest that programme initiatives which build household assets need to be encouraged to improve the plight of rural households largely dependent on agriculture. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Environmental or ‘ecological’ footprints have been widely used in recent years as indicators of resource consumption and waste absorption transformed on the basis of biologically productive land area [in global hectares (gha)] required per capita with prevailing technology. It has been employed here to estimate the footprints associated with three low carbon, more electric transition pathways for the United Kingdom (UK): described as ‘Market Rules’ (MR), ‘Central Co-ordination’ (CC) and ‘Thousand Flowers’ (TF) respectively. These pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their overall environmental footprint has been disaggregated into various components: bioproductive and built land, carbon emissions, embodied energy, materials and waste, transport, and water consumption. This component-based approach provides, for example, a means for evaluating the implications for the so-called ‘energy-land-water nexus’. Electricity demand was projected to decrease significantly under the TF pathway by 2050, but its total environmental footprint (EF) was greater than either that under the MR or CC pathways. This is mainly due to the increase in the use of bioproductive land associated with solid biofuel production and that of the carbon footprint, which are both seen to be larger than under either the MR or CC cases. Water and waste footprint components made almost negligibly small contributions under all three transition pathways. Lessons can clearly be drawn for other industrialised nations attempting to decarbonise their electricity generation systems, although local circumstances will determine the country-specific findings. © 2019 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to explore the solvent extraction of jojoba oil from the ground seeds of jojoba shrub (Simmondsia chinensis) cultivated in Taif region-Saudi Arabia and production of biodiesel from it as an alternative renewable energy source. The transesterification reaction of the extracted jojoba oil was carried out in a microwave reactor at 60°C using methanol: oil in a molar ratio of 7.5:1 with vigorous stirring (800 rpm). This microwave assisted process achieved quantifiable conversion of the jojoba oil to biofuel after 1 h compared to 4 h under conventional methods. The chemical compositions of the crude prodcut were determined using Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the physicochemical properties to of the separated biodiesel were determined according Saudi Standard, Metrology and Quality Org (SASO) FDS 30183; 2018. The results of the performance tests applied to the obtained biodiesel showed an appropriate density and high calorific value of 0.8766 g.cm-3 and 41.226 j.g-1 respectively. The fluidity of the extracted biofuel assessed through kinematic viscosity was found to be 5.73 mm2s-1 which was superior to that obtained by conventional heating transesterification (5.73 mm2s-1 vs. 9.04 mm2s-1). This viscosity value is close to the European standard for biodiesel (3.5-5.0 mm2s-1). The physicochemical and combustion characteristics were found to be in conformity with the Saudi Arabian clean diesel fuel (low Sulphur) specifications. © 2019 World Research Association.

AB  - Defence sector desires to attain energy self-sufficiency and security. In recent years, emergence of biofuel as an alternative source has raised the hopes of Defence. Ethanol and bio-diesel are currently being used as blends in different parts of the world. While, bio-diesel is mostly being blended in 2-20 per cent in different parts of the world, ethanol blending has reached upto 85 per cent. Owing to the sustainability reasons, the choice of feedstock for ethanol production is gradually changing from corn to lignocelluloses biomass. Jatropha curcas, is still the choice feedstock for bio-diesel in most third world countries. This institute has put in rigrous efforts to identify high yielding varieties of Jatropha, improving its yield, standardising trans-esterification to obtain high quality bio-diesel and its trials and testing in various vehicles and equipment. Second generation biofuels using biomass such as farm and forest wastes as feedstocks are promising in terms of their overall sustainability and volume produced. They can be used as drop in fuels. However, time is required to utilise their potential fully. Algae, the third generation biofuel feedstock still needs extensive R&D to make it economically sustainable. Whatever, the technology used, defence forces will accept any biofuel, which should be available constantly and priced below the existing petroleum fuels. The scope of producing by-products and finding a lucarative market for these products can ensure that prices of biofuels remain lower than the petroleum fuels. © 2019, DESIDOC.

AB  - Algae-based biofuels are the most capable solutions to energy catastrophe and global warming for years to come due to its potentially high yield, higher growth rate, biodegradable, nontoxic, carbon neutral, low emission profile, use of non-arable land and non-potable water with less attention and resource consumption. A biofuel produced from chlorella algae oil througha transesterification process was used in this study. Experimental tests were performed on a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine at constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and compression ratio of 18 at various loading conditions to evaluate the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics using algae biofuel blends of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, moreover the results are compared with those of standard diesel. The brake thermal efficiency showed decreasing trend (upto 5%) whereas specific fuel consumption (upto 7%)and exhaust gas temperature (upto 3%) showed increasing trend for algae biofuel blends compared to diesel. Reduction in hydrocarbon (upto 28%) and carbon monoxide (upto 22%) emission was noted for algae biofuel blends along with a marginal increase in NOx (upto 13%) emissions. Also, algae biofuel blends showed almost comparable combustion results compared to conventional diesel, however, the blends confirm shortened ignition delay due to their earlier start of combustion. From this study, we can conclude that small fraction by volume (20%) of algae biofuel addition with diesel has exhibited satisfactory results and could be used as a good substitute for petrodiesel fuel. © Yildiz Technical University.

AB  - The research paper deals with the formation of new scientific decisions regarding the improvement of the processes of resource management of agrarian enterprises on the basis of economic diagnostics of biofuel consumption. In the course of the research, the essence of the research paper is revealed and the features of the use of tools of economic diagnostics in relation to a particular energy resource as the basis for substantiation of effective management decisions concerning resource management of a modern agricultural enterprise are described. The research methodology is based on the system approach, the identification of causal relationships (deduction, induction) and the synthesis of factors that influence the implementation of the development potential and improvement of resourcing for the operation of modern agricultural enterprises in Ukraine. The research paper systematically presents the processes of providing agricultural enterprise with fuel resources as an element of the resource management system, which focuses on the direction of biofuel consumption, its economic diagnostics, the identification of problems, prospects of use and developmental prerequisites. It is shown that structured integrated economic diagnostics of biofuel consumption by agricultural enterprises as part of a certain system, action algorithm, to a large extent positively influences on the success of application in practice of the tools of resource management of these enterprises, increasing the soundness of managerial decisions in this area. This contributes to a more efficient organization of the processes of the agrarian enterprises of Ukraine, giving an opportunity to respond adequately to the variability of the market environment and create the preconditions for the long-term development. © 2015-2017 Academic Research Publishing Group.

AB  - Crude glycerol (CG) is a low-cost biodiesel industry co-product in a ratio of 1:10 with the main product. The large quantities of CG produced affect the biodiesel and glycerol markets. As the composition of CG differs significantly from that of purified glycerol, the effect of CG impurities on its polymerization was evaluated. An experimental design using simulated- CG was performed to study the effect of the most abundant impurities in the CG on the polymerization and the impurities that would persist with such reaction conditions, e.g., soap and sodium. The response variable for the experimental design was the hydroxyl number of the reaction products. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to analyze differences among the reaction products obtained from different treatments. The presence of soap was the primary inhibitory factor and the bottleneck in the formation of polyglycerol via polymerization of CG. The identification of the effect of impurities of CG polymerization suggests new routes for using it in the production of high value-added chemicals.

AB  - Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) is characterized by higher biogas production rates as a result of assumedly faster microbial metabolic conversion rates compared to mesophilic AD. It was hypothesized that the thermophilic microbiome with its lower diversity than the mesophilic one is more susceptible to disturbances introduced by alterations in the operating factors, as an example, the supply of nitrogen-rich feedstock such as poultry manure (PM). Laboratory scaled TAD experiments using cattle slurry and increasing amounts of PM were carried out to investigate the (in-) stability of the process performance caused by the accumulation of ammonium and ammonia with special emphasis on the microbial community structure and its dynamic variation. The results revealed that the moderate PM addition, i.e., 25% (vol/vol based on volatile substances) PM, resulted in a reorganization of the microbial community structure which was still working sufficiently. With 50% PM application, the microbial community was further stepwise re-organized and was able to compensate for the high cytotoxic ammonia contents only for a short time resulting in consequent process disturbance and final process failure. This study demonstrated the ability of the acclimated thermophilic microbial community to tolerate a certain amount of nitrogen-rich substrate.

AB  - Almost all of the studied sorghum hybrids showed a good growth both on the black soil mass and on loess-like loam. The yield of fresh biomass was reached at the level of 50-100 t ha-1. The juice amount in the stems of Ukrainian hybrids was more than in American ones by 5-10%. At the same time, the concentration of sugar in it was less, 16-19% as against 18-21%. The theoretical ethanol yield for highly productive hybrids (Zubr, Medove, Mohawk, SS506) was 2500-3600 L ha-1, and for low-output hybrids (Sioux and Silosne-42) 705-1600 L ha-1. Hybrids Zubr, Medove, Mohawk, SS506 and G1990 were selected as the most promising for cultivation on reclaimed lands. Addition of the plant biomass to sludge activates the thermal behavior of the composite mix. As a result, the combustion level rises to 41.4%. © 2019, University of Montenegro. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the effects of foliar supplementation of different nitrogen sources (urea, Nitamin, NH4NO3, and arginine) to study their efficacy as fertilizers for growth of two clonally propagated shrub willow cultivars; namely, ‘Fish Creek’ (Salix purpurea L.) and ‘Preble’ (Salix viminalis L.×(Salix sachalinensis F. Schmidt × Salix miyabeana Seemen)). Our objectives were to determine (i) if foliar nitrogen application is an effective method of fertilization for the two shrub willows and (ii) if different nitrogen sources are metabolized similarly by the plants. The analyses involved soluble leaf polyamines, amino acids, total protein, total nitrogen and carbon, and plant biomass in response to short-term treatments with four sources of nitrogen. The effects of foliar nitrogen application on leaf chemistry, biomass, and foliar nitrogen content varied according to the form of nitrogen used. The data indicate that (i) urea is the most suitable nitrogen source for foliar spray (29% higher N accumulation vs. Nitamin), whereas arginine is the least suitable, and (ii) different nitrogen sources are metabolized differently by the plant. While the foliar nitrogen application method could become a practical and sustainable way to fertilize shrub willows and other short-rotation biofuel crops, it may also help reduce nitrogen loss to the environment. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an approach for the processing of agricultural and organic wastes to produce alcoholic fuels such as ethanol and butanol. The cellulosic materials wheat straw (WS), rice straw (RS), and corn stover (CS) were pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) individually, and microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) was treated with dilute H2SO4 and then fermented. The results indicated that pretreatment in acidic condition was best to produce fermentable sugar. However, the high glucose concentration was achieved in C. vulgaris (32 g/L) and WS (20.6 g/L) among lignocellulosic biomass. The microalga that was grown in the nutrient deficient condition had a carbohydrate content of 51% ± 2.1. After fermentation, high concentration of ethanol 9.5 g/L (yield 93.7%) and butanol contents of 7.4 g/L (yield 91.3%) were recorded in wheat straw, whereas C. vulgaris yielded ethanol and butanol concentrations of 14 g/L and 11.8 g/L respectively. The results may help to increase the production of biofuels and reduce the need for imported fuels. © 2019 BioResources.

AB  - Digestate and biochar can be land applied to sequester carbon and improve net primary productivity, but the achievable scale is tied to expected growth in bioenergy production and land available for application. We use an attributional life-cycle assessment approach to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon storage potential of biochar, digested solids, and composted digested solids generated from organic waste in California as a test case. Our scenarios characterize changes in organic waste production, bioenergy facility build-out, bioenergy byproduct quality, and soil response. Moderate to upper bound growth in the bioenergy sector with annual byproduct disposal over 100 years could provide a cumulative GHG offset of 50-400 MMTCO2 equiv, with an additional 80-300 MMTC sequestered in soils. This corresponds to net GHG mitigation over 100 years equivalent to 340-1500 MMTCO2 equiv (80-350% of California's annual emissions). In most scenarios, there is sufficient working land to apply all available biochar and digestate, although land becomes a constraint if the soil's rest time between applications increases from 5 to 15 years. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydroliquefaction is a possible pathway to produce liquid transportation fuels from solid feedstocks like coal or biomass. Though much effort has been put into the investigation of maximizing the oil yield using expensive catalysts and pasting oils in batch setups, little is known about how to commercialize the process. This work aims at the demonstration of lignin hydroliquefaction under conditions interesting for commercial operation. The results from hydroliquefaction experiments of two different lignin types using a cheap iron-based catalyst and anthracene oil as the pasting oil in a semibatch system are presented here. Oil yields of above 50% are reached without observing coke formation. Extensive analyses of the feedstocks and product oils were performed. The process supplies high-quality oil, while differences in the decomposition path of both lignin types are observed. An high heating value of 39 400 J/g and H/C and O/C ratios of up to 1.6 and 0.1, respectively, are detected for the produced bio-oils. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Growing plants for biofuel production on marginal lands is of major importance in many developing countries. As a biomass source, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a most adaptable plastic crop, forming extensive ground cover and vegetative biomass, providing a very high productivity over a short period of time. This study investigated the effects of cultivation (type of growing conditions and N fertilization rates) on biomass yields and changes in the structure of the switchgrass phytocenosis in different types of cropping systems. The biomass yields in stripe and mixed crops were higher than in single crops in the third year of cultivation. Switchgrass plants in intercrops were characterized by a greater height and number of shoots per unit area compared to mixed crops and monocultures. Biomass yields increased with each year of this research. The maximum biomass yields were attained with 30 kg ha-1 of N fertilization and the minimum yields where there was no fertilization. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The focus of this article is on the potential land use change impacts associated with the oilseed-based biodiesel consumption. The three main crops used for biodiesel production to date are oilseed rape (OSR), soybeans and oil palm. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a technical assessment of potential land use change arising from the growth of these three major crops at global level, obtained through a broad country-level analysis for their respective major producing countries. The article presents an historical data analysis, evaluating the interaction between the expansion and contraction of these three crops over the last three decades (with a closer look from 2008) together with the carbon stock changes to the land. We categorise the land use by its carbon stock and resulting carbon stock changes from land use change. Crops aimed at the production of ethanol, such as maize (corn), sugarcane, wheat, cassava and sugar beet, although extremely relevant for biofuel policies, are not the subject of this present study. While we did not know at the time of writing this report how the term "significant" would be defined in the EU delegated act we concluded from the analysis of the historical data and using the high ILUC-risk definition as it stands, that the emissions associated with palm and soy are significant. For oil palm, we take Indonesia and Malaysia as proxy for the global position. We calculate an average expansion of 29% on high carbon stock land. For soy, we calculate a global average of 19% expansion. We calculate the global average greenhouse gas emissions intensities based on the ILUC-risks as 56 gCO2eq/MJ for soy oil and 108 gCO2eq/MJ for palm oil. Future projections (OECD-FAO, 2017) suggest these numbers could drop significantly. We do not find evidence for high ILUC-risk expansion of oilseed rape. © A. Strapasson.

AB  - Iran is the fourth biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Meanwhile, this country is the largest CO2 emitter among the Middle East countries and 99% of energy in this country is produced from nonrenewable-based resources. Nevertheless, Iran has a promising potential to generate energy from its renewable resources such as biomass. Therefore, renewable energy generation can contribute to increasing the renewable energy share in the country’s energy generation and mitigating the environmental impacts. Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the second generation biofuel production potential in Guilan province (as one of the important agricultural areas in the region) of Iran. In this research, energy generation from cow manure, poultry manure, municipal solid wastes, rice wastes, and peanut wastes were studied. The results showed that the total energy generation from second-generation biomass resources in Guilan province of Iran was 76,523,985.50 GJ year−1. The yearly potential of energy generation from cow manure, poultry manure, municipal solid wastes, rice wastes, and peanut wastes were 2,284,529, 352,138, 648,523, 73,238,768, and 27 GJ, respectively. In conclusion, there is a remarkable potential to generate energy from second-generation biomass resources in Guilan province of Iran. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Genetic engineering has been used to decrease the lignin content and to change the lignin composition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to decrease cell wall recalcitrance to enable more efficient cellulosic biofuel production. Previous greenhouse and field studies showed that downregulation of the gene encoding switchgrass caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and overexpression of the switchgrass PvMYB4 (MYB4) gene effectively improved ethanol yield. To understand potential environmental impacts of cultivating these transgenic bioenergy crops in the field, we quantified the effects of field cultivation of transgenic switchgrass on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Total and active SOC as well as soil respiration were measured in soils grown with two COMT-downregulated transgenic lines (COMT2 and COMT3), three MYB4-overexpressed transgenic lines (L1, L6, and L8), and their corresponding non-transgenic controls. No differences in total SOC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) were detected between transgenic and non-transgenic treatments for both COMT (10.4-11.1 g kg-1 for SOC, 60.0-64.8 mg kg-1 for DOC, and 299-384 mg kg-1 for POXC) and MYB4 lines (6.89-8.21 g kg-1 for SOC, 56.0-61.1 mg kg-1 for DOC, and 177-199 mg kg-1 for POXC). Soil CO2-carbon (CO2-C) production from the COMT2 transgenic line was not significantly different from its non-transgenic control. In contrast, the COMT3 transgenic line had greater soil CO2-C production than its non-transgenic control (210 vs. 165 μg g-1) after 72 days of laboratory incubation. Combining the improvement in ethanol yield and biomass production reported in previous studies with negligible change in SOC and soil respiration, COMT2 could be a better biofuel feedstock than COMT3 for environmental conservation and cost-effective biofuel production. On the other hand, MYB4 transgenic line L8 produced more biomass and total ethanol per hectare while it released more CO2-C than the control (253 vs. 207 μg g-1). Long-term in situ monitoring of transgenic switchgrass systems using a suite of soil and environmental variables is needed to determine the sustainability of growing genetically modified bioenergy crops. © 2019 Xu et al.

AB  - Renewable liquid biofuels for transportation have recently attracted enormous global attention due to their potential to provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. In recent years, the attention has shifted from first-generation bioethanol to the production of higher molecular weight alcohols, such as biobutanol, from cellulosic feedstocks. The economic feasibility of such processes depends on several parameters such as the cost of raw materials, the fermentation performance and the energy demand for the pretreatment of biomass and downstream processing. In this work, two conceptual process scenarios for isobutanol production, one with and one without integrated product removal from the fermentor by vacuum stripping, were developed and evaluated using SuperPro Designer®. In agreement with previous publications, it was concluded that the fermentation titer is a crucial parameter for the economic competitiveness of the process as it is closely related to the energy requirements for product purification. In the first scenario where the product titer was 22 g/L, the energy demand for downstream processing was 15.8 MJ/L isobutanol and the unit production cost of isobutanol was $2.24/L. The integrated product removal by vacuum stripping implemented in the second scenario was assumed to improve the isobutanol titer to 50 g/L. In this case, the energy demand for the product removal (electricity) and downstream processing were 1.8 MJ/L isobutanol and 10 MJ/L isobutanol, respectively, and the unit production cost was reduced to $1.42/L. The uncertainty associated with the choice of modeling and economic parameters was investigated by Monte Carlo simulation sensitivity analysis. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Maize (Zea mays L.) is a principal cereal crop cultivated worldwide for human food, animal feed, and more recently as a source of biofuel. However, as a direct consequence of water insufficiency and climate change, frequent occurrences of both biotic and abiotic stresses have been reported in various regions around the world, and recently, this has become a constant threat in increasing global maize yields. Plants respond to abiotic stresses by utilizing the activities of transcription factors (TFs), which are families of genes coding for specific TF proteins. TF target genes form a regulon that is involved in the repression/activation of genes associated with abiotic stress responses. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have a systematic study on each TF family, the downstream target genes they regulate, and the specific TF genes involved in multiple abiotic stress responses in maize and other staple crops. Method: In this review, the main TF families, the specific TF genes and their regulons that are involved in abiotic stress regulation will be briefly discussed. Great emphasis will be given on maize abiotic stress improvement throughout this review, although other examples from different plants like rice, Arabidopsis, wheat, and barley will be used. Results: We have described in detail the main TF families in maize that take part in abiotic stress responses together with their regulons. Furthermore, we have also briefly described the utilization of high-efficiency technologies in the study and characterization of TFs involved in the abiotic stress regulatory networks in plants with an emphasis on increasing maize production. Examples of these technologies include next-generation sequencing, microarray analysis, machine learning, and RNA-Seq. Conclusion: In conclusion, it is expected that all the information provided in this review will in time contribute to the use of TF genes in the research, breeding, and development of new abiotic stress tolerant maize cultivars. © 2019 Kimotho et al.

AB  - Indirect land use change (ILUC) occurs when vegetable oils which were previously used for food are now also used as fuels, which compels more land to be cleared to fulfil this additional demand. This article analyses the uncertainties and biasness of the inclusion of ILUC into the European Union Renewable Energy Sources Directive (EU RED) II especially towards palm oil. The consideration of a feedstock globally instead of regions penalises sustainable producers of a feedstock. Loading a detrimental projected deforestation percentage on palm oil based on limited publication with high uncertainties is not acceptable. Disregarding the increasing forest cover in Malaysia now at 55.6% due to Malaysian government pledge and intervention to maintain at least 50% of the country as forest cover seems unfair. Projections were based on historical data which contradicts developments and improvements which never follows historical data or events. In terms of oil yield, palm oil is 5.56, 10.53 and 7.84 times more productive than rapeseed, soyabean and sunflower oil, respectively. To substitute one million tonnes of palm oil which can be produced in 250 000 ha yr-1 will require soyabean, rapeseed and sunflower oil 2 632 500, 1 390 000 and 1 960 000 ha yr-1 respectively which will increase the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the land use change and ILUC for these crops as well. National sustainability certifications need to be supported by EU to fill the gap and to be recognised to certify the low ILUC risk and additionality. Generally, many components of the Commission Delegated Regulation are very restrictive to palm oil and are presented without clear scientific evidence which appears to be targeted at disqualifying the use of palm oil as biofuel. This can be construed as a form of trade protectionism and more politically driven rather than science. © 2019 Lembaga Minyak Sawit Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Solid biomass is a promising alternative to traditional energy resources, able to successfully reduce the negative effects of climate change. The structure of energy production from renewable sources shows that solid biofuels have the largest share in Poland and the EU28. Thus, solid biofuels constitute an important and interesting alternative to solid fossil fuels. However, due to its wide variety of origin, logistics and processing technology, the properties and quality of solid biofuels may vary. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the thermophysical properties and elemental composition of solid biofuels of agricultural and forestry origin compared to solid fossil fuels. The research material were 20 types of solid fuel, including 16 renewable and 4 fossil fuels obtained from plantations of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn and from two heat generation and distribution enterprises (Olsztyn and Grudziadz). The experiment confirmed that selected solid biofuels from agriculture and forestry are a good alternative to fossil fuels like coal in terms of some thermophysical properties and elemental compositions. The content of ash in coal fuels was 3- to16-fold higher than in agricultural and forest origin biofuels. Moreover, the content of sulphur in coal fuels was from 5- to 31-fold higher than in agricultural and forest biofuels. Considering the above, the use of solid biofuels for energy generation may create a less negative effect on the environment than coal fuels. © 2019, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

AB  - In the article, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of motor biofuels for water and land types of transport is carried out. In that context, the possibility of increasing their efficiency is demonstrated through the introduction of the rapid pyrolysis process, which allows up to 25% of renewable fuels to be used in a mixture with conventional diesel. It is established that the most effective way is the joint processing of bio-oil with oil products on existing production facilities, which does not require the construction of new plants, significantly reduces the dependence on fossil oil, and the obtained gasoline and diesel fuel have good performance characteristics and their use practically does not require changes in the fuel consumption infrastructure. © 2019, University of Dubronvnik.

AB  - Sugarcane and cattle pastures are two of the most widespread and economically important agricultural landscapes. However, in Brazil, they have not been properly investigated for their importance to native birds and wildlife conservation. Thus, we aim to characterize and compare bird assemblages of sugarcane and cattle pastures; and understand how landscape features within both habitats influence bird assemblages. We surveyed birds in both agricultural habitats over one year, and then investigated the relationship between species richness and composition with landscape diversity, matrix permeability, and the size and distribution of natural forests close to both habitats. We observed 132 species in cattle pastures and only 72 in sugarcane (48% bird community similarity). We further evaluated the richness and relative abundance of avian ecological groups, including habitat specialists and habitat generalists, insectivores, omnivores, granivores and frugivores. All avian groups were higher in pastures, the habitat where landscape heterogeneity and number of scattered trees was higher. Our results show that overall increasing landscape heterogeneity favors an assemblage with higher richness and composed by species with more diverse ecological functions. Therefore, we argue in favor of management practices that incorporate heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes, mainly in sugarcane fields where a homogeneous scheme has been used. Otherwise, the potential of agricultural landscapes for bird conservation will be highly hindered, particularly if the sugarcane sector expands to other agricultural lands. © Eduardo R.

AB  - Corn is a staple feed and biofuel crop with a value close to $3.7 billion dollars for Michigan’s economy. Knowledge about distribution and abundance of seedling pathogens in Michigan corn fields is limited. Here we used a combination of culture-based and next-generation sequencing of soil samples to determine the extent of species associated with diseased corn seedlings and those present in soil. Over 2 years, symptomatic seedlings and associated soil samples were collected from 11 Michigan fields. A total of 170 oomycete cultures were obtained from seedlings using a semiselective medium (CMA-PARPB) and identified using the internal transcribed spacer region. Thirty-three species were isolated, with Pythium inflatum (25%; clade B) and P. sylvaticum (12%; clade F) being the most abundant species. For the amplicon-based approach, the cytochrome oxidase subunit I marker (COI) mitochondrial region was amplified from soil samples and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. The dominant Pythium clades present in the soil were F, I, D, and B and accounted for at least 75% of the abundance in all locations. Pythium clades F, I, and D were recovered with similar trends with the culture and amplicon approach; however, clade B was highly abundant in plant isolation, but not in soil. The 20 most abundant species were characterized for pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity. P. irregulare and P. ultimum var. ultimum were the most virulent at both 15 and 20°C. Isolates were tested for their sensitivity to mefenoxam and ethaboxam. Most isolates were sensitive to both chemistries, but P. rostratifingens and P. aff. torulosum were less sensitive to ethaboxam and P. ultimum var. ultimum less sensitive to mefenoxam. The survey and isolate characterization provides a better understanding of seedling and root rot disease of corn and opportunities to improve management of this disease complex. © 2019 The American Phytopathological Society

AB  - With more than 40 countries currently proposing to boost their national bioeconomies, there is no better time for a clarion call for a “new” bioeconomy, which, at its core, tackles the current disparities and inequalities in phosphorus (P) availability. Existing biofuel production systems have widened P inequalities and contributed to a linear P economy, impairing water quality and accelerating dependence on P fertilizers manufactured from finite nonrenewable phosphate rock reserves. Here, we explore how the emerging bioeconomy in novel, value-added, biobased products offers opportunities to rethink our stewardship of P. Development of integrated value chains of new bio-based products offers opportunities for codevelopment of “P refineries” to recover P fertilizer products from organic wastes. Advances in material sciences are exploiting unique semiconductor and opto-electrical properties of new “two-dimensional” (2D) P allotropes (2D black phosphorus and blue phosphorus). These novel P materials offer the tantalizing prospect of step-change innovations in renewable energy production and storage, in biomedical applications, and in biomimetic processes, including artificial photosynthesis. They also offer a possible antidote to the P paradox that our agricultural production systems have engineered us into, as well as the potential to expand the future role of P in securing sustainability across both agroecological and technological domains of the bioeconomy. However, a myriad of social, technological, and commercialization hurdles remains to be crossed before such an advanced circular P bioeconomy can be realized. The emerging bioeconomy is just one piece of a much larger puzzle of how to achieve more sustainable and circular horizons in our future use of P. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The launching of biofuel vehicles in 2003 led to ethanol demand increase and a new phase of expansion of sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Although the increase in area of production and the quantity of sugarcane produced have been very important to Brazilian agribusiness, the recent agricultural productivity rate has slowed. In this context, this article analyzed the factors that influence the growth rate of sugarcane productivity in the regions of new agricultural expansions, specifically in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias. For the collection and data analysis, we used bibliographical and documentary research. The shift-share method was used to analyze the evolution of sugarcane production, through the decomposition of this variable into two factors: area effect and productivity effect. The results show that the increase in production in the region under analysis was mainly due to the incorporation of new planting areas and not to an increase in productivity. In addition, structural factors have negatively impacted crop performance. The analysis indicates that there is a slow rhythm of sugarcane fields’ renovation and the adoption of old varieties. Although the mechanization index is high in the studied regions, difficulties of technological adaptation still provide deficiency in the agricultural performance of sugarcane. © 2019 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze a variety of environmental organic contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) and their metabolites in representative digestate samples from Norwegian biogas production plants. Biogas digestates can be a valuable source for soil amendments and/or fertilizers in commercial agriculture. It is important to assess whether the digestates contain harmful contaminants in order to avoid unintended exposure of human consumers. In total 19 biogas digestates from 12 biogas production plants in Norway were collected and analyzed. Furthermore, process related parameters such as pretreatment of substrates, additives, flocculation and temperature conditions were considered for interpretation of the results. The CEC levels found in the digestates were shown to be dependent on the original composition of the substrate, dry-matter content, and conditioning of the substrate. The sunscreen octocrylene (147 μg L-1) and acetaminophen (paracetamol; 58.6 μg L-1) were found at the highest concentrations in liquid digestates, whereas octocrylene (&gt;600 ng g-1, on a wet weight basis = ww) and the flame retardant TCPP (tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, &gt;500 ng g-1 ww) were found at the highest levels in solid digestates, exceeding even the upper limit of quantification (uLOQ) threshold. The highest levels of total CECs were measured in solid digestates (1411 ng g-1 ww) compared to liquid digestates (354 μg L-1 equals 354 ng g-1). The occurrence of CECs in digestate samples, even after extensive and optimized anaerobic digestion, indicates that the operational conditions of the treatment process should be adjusted in order to minimize CEC contamination. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.

AB  - Global energy consumption is expected to grow by 56% between 2010 and 2040. Renewable energy is one of the fastest-growing energy resources, and biomass is a major feedstock for providing renewable energy. It constitutes up to 35% of the main energy consumption in developing countries. Densified solid biofuel with high density gets a lot of attention due to its uniform shape and low heating cost. When considering densified solid biofuels as a viable solution for energy production, its quality needs to be improved. Solid biofuel quality is a function of the chemical composition and physical properties of the raw materials. It is widely reported that the raw material chemical composition has a major effect on the final solid biofuel quality, as it influences the heating value, ash content, and mechanical durability. The moisture content influences the net heating value, combustion efficiency, and mechanical durability of solid biofuels. The bulk density influences the mechanical durability, thermal characteristics, as well as handling and storage costs of solid biofuels. This work reviewed the latest developments on the effects of the chemical composition, moisture content, and bulk density of raw materials on the thermal efficiency, emission, and mechanical durability of densified solid biofuels. © 2019, North Carolina State University.

AB  - The hypothesis that land degraded by activities in the Kolubara Mining Basin may be restored by production of agri-energy crop Miscanthus gigantheus in ecologically and economically sustainable manner was investigated. The characteristics of the arable soil in the zone of influence of the thermal power plant Kolubara A, the overburden from the mine Kolubara and the ash from Kolubara A indicate limited fertility due to low contents of N and organic C, also contain heavy metals in concentrations between maximal allowable and remediation values (Ni, Cu, Zn), are slightly to moderately contaminated. Contents of heavy metals in aboveground biomass of miscanthus is low, making it suitable for use as biofuel. On the opposite side, in whole plants there are significant contents of Cr, Zn and Ni, mainly in underground organs, indicating phytostabilization potential. - Main strength: the use of marginal land for the production of bioenergetic crops. - Weaknesses: low yield. - Opportunity: use of large marginal land areas with a simultaneous reduced risk of heavy metal transfer to the environment, improving yields with the use of more intensive agri-technical measures. - Threats: the poorly developed biomass market as well as the lack of interest by land owners for its remediation. © 2019, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies.

AB  - Background: Butea monosperma is an economically and medicinally important plant that grows all over India, however, the plant is highly susceptible to termite attack. The present study unravelled the bacterial community composition and their functional attributions from the termite degraded Butea. Methods: Total genomic DNA from termite degraded Butea monosperma samples was extracted and subjected to sequencing on Illumina's Miseq. The raw and unassembled reads obtained from high-throughput sequencing were used for taxonomic and functional profiling using different online and stand-alone softwares. Moreover, to ascertain the effect of different geographical locations and environmental factors, comparative analysis was performed using four other publically available metagenomes. Results: The higher abundance of Actinobacteria (21.27%), Proteobacteria (14.18%), Firmicutes (10.46%), and Bacteroidetes (4.11%) was found at the phylum level. The genus level was dominated by Bacillus (4.33%), Gemmatimonas (3.13%), Mycobacterium (1.82%), Acidimicrobium (1.69%), Thermoleophilum (1.23%), Nocardioides (1.44%), Terrimonas and Acidithermus (1.09%) and Clostridium (1.05%). Functional annotation of the termite degraded B. monosperma metagenome revealed a high abundance of ammonia oxidizers, sulfate reducers, dehalogenators, nitrate reducers, sulfide oxidizers, xylan degraders, nitrogen fixers and chitin degraders. Conclusion: The present study highlights the significance of the inherent microbiome of the degraded Butea shaping the microbial communities for effective degradation of biomass and different environmental toxicants. The unknown bacterial communities present in the sample can serve as enzyme sources for lignocelluloses degradation for biofuel production. © 2019 Kumar et al. All rights reserved.

AB  - There was a heightened global interest in large-scale Jatropha cultivation for the past few decades, and this incited investment toward the crop in many developing countries. Many saw Jatropha as a green fuel that could possibly be an alternative to fossil fuel, which has adverse implications to deal with the impacts of climate change. However, Jatropha investments failed to meet global expectations, leading to unexpected social, environmental, and economic transformations in the investment spaces. This paper reviews and synthesizes the transformations and complexities in failed Jatropha spaces in six previous major Jatropha investment destinations across the world-Mexico, India, China, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Ghana-by employing qualitative data analysis. The findings generally show that, in all of the countries studied, promoters of Jatropha investments, including the central government and private investors, subscribed to a "wait-and-see" approach with positive expectations. The review revealed that the intended goal of establishing global Jatropha investments to serve as an alternative source of fuel failed because of the unexpected complexities of the hype, which dwelled much on the deferment option of the "wait-and-see" approach for global Jatropha investments. Failure of the investments along with unmet expectations led to land-use changes from Jatropha to the cultivation of other crops (often food crops) or total land abandonment. Although we are not totally pessimistic about the economic and production viability of Jatropha as a biofuel feedstock, we emphasize the importance of paying considerable attention to other feedstocks that might have a better future as alternatives to fossil-based energy for the deployment of sustainable bioenergy. Furthermore, our findings provide meaningful justification for policy- and decision-makers in the development space to tacitly reflect and appraise new investment initiatives or interventions before endorsement. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Modern bioenergy crops have potential to play a crucial role in the global energy mix, especially under policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The management of short-rotation willow crops involves several operations that deliver biomass for different uses. In commercial-scale operations, high-performance, mostly automated equipment is frequently used; however, in small-scale operations, smallholder farmers adapt traditional agricultural equipment to fit their needs. This study evaluated the field performance of planting and cutback operations in small-scale willow crops using equipment that was characterized by a low level of technological integration. Following the implementation of both operations, the planting work rates ranged from 0.216 to 0.300 ha h-1, depending on the soil preparation and planting density. Delays significantly reduced the field performance, resulting in gross work rates of 0.149 to 0.230 ha h-1. By comparison, cutback operations had higher work rates of 2.31 and 2.35 ha h-1 for gross and net production, respectively. These rates dropped to approximately 1.77 and 2.00 ha h-1, respectively, due to time spent in headland turns and other delays. Possibilities to improve the field performance depend on good preparation of the soil prior to planting, which includes removal of agricultural residue. In the case of cutback operations, avoiding backward movement of the equipment when additional headland space is available and an improved field layout may shorten the time spent in headland turns. The results indicate that small-scale energy crop plantations can be sustainable in terms of efficiency when unspecialized technologies are used. Therefore, small-scale agriculture can make a positive contribution to climate change mitigation targets. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cellulases have a broad range of different industrial applications, ranging from food and beverages to pulp and paper and the biofuels area. Here a metagenomics based strategy was used to identify the cellulolytic enzyme CelRH5 from the rhizosphere. CelRH5 is a novel monospecific endo-β-1, 4-glucanase belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5). Structural based modeling analysis indicated that CelRH5 is related to endo-β-1, 4-glucanases derived from thermophilic microorganisms such as Thermotoga maritima, Fervidobacterium nodosum, and Ruminiclostridium thermocellum sharing 30-40% amino acid sequence identity. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined as 40.5 kDa. Biochemical analyses revealed that the enzyme displayed good activity with soluble forms of cellulose as a substrate such as ostazin brilliant red hydroxyethyl cellulose (OBR-HEC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and insoluble azurine cross-linked hydroxyethylcellulose (AZCL-HEC). The enzyme shows highest enzymatic activity at pH 6.5 with high pH tolerance, remaining stable in the pH range 4.5-8.5. Highest activity was observed at 40°C, but CelRH5 is psychrotolerant being active and stable at temperatures below 30°C. The presence of the final products of cellulose hydrolysis (glucose and cellobiose) or metal ions such as Na+, K+, Li+, and Mg2+, as well as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), urea, dithiothreitol (DTT), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) or glycerol, did not have a marked effect on CelRH5 activity. However, the enzyme is quite sensitive to the presence of 10 mM ions Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe3+ and reagents such as 1 M guanidine HCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 20% ethanol. Given that it is psychrotolerant and retains activity in the presence of final cellulose degradation products, metal ions and various reagents, which are common in many technological processes; CelRH5 may be potential suitability for a variety of different biotechnological applications.

AB  - Blazing of fossil energy resources generally changes the global climate. Speeding up of global temperate nowadays is an important aspect. Emission of greenhouse gases mainly from blazing of fossil energy resources is one of the most important sources. So, to carry the significant energy and to reduce air pollution, biofuels might be a substitute energy sources. The unnecessary utilization of fossil energy resources or fuels results deficient in the storage in underground earth then people naturally have to depend on biofuels. Consequently increasing demand for the manufacture of biofuels will put a huge burden on agriculture and food prices. Biofuels generally attributed as liquid fuels which are made from the biomass. This consists of mostly wood, vegetable oils, forestry products, agricultural crops, agricultural residues or municipal garbage, residues of domestic animal wastes and aquatic plants. In this review, we summarized the different types of biofuels including biodiesel and their comparative study, production and uses from an ecological perspective. © 2019 Chemical Publishing Co..

AB  - Palm oil is consistently outperforming all other substitute vegetable oils in terms of the price and becomes an important food ingredient around the world. Malaysia is the second largest producer of palm oil in the world market. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding global biofuel sector can grow into an important new market outlet for Malaysia. In order for the company to gain business profits through the palm oil industry internationally, there are detrimental effects on the element of CSR which involve natural environment, local community, stakeholder relationship and original country image. Moreover, many companies ignore the consequences from the deforestation and open burning where those activities are, in fact, the cause of global warming as well as severe haze that happen every year. Since this industry becomes the most important industry for Malaysian economic, the palm oil companies should ensure that their business activities sustain over the time in the global market. Most of the palm oil companies take into consideration of CSR programme as one of their business sustainability strategic management. Therefore, the CSR becomes one of the strategic initiatives taken by the company to address the issues related to palm oil industry. Based on the interview conducted, researcher illustrated the result in a form of model. This study indirectly will help companies and community to collaborate and to take care each other. © 2019 Allied Academies.

AB  - The use of various types of biomass for energy production provides great prospects for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and the negative impact on the environment. However, the use of biomass, in particular agromass for this purpose, results in relatively large amounts of bottom ashes and fly ashes, the composition and properties of which also raise a number of additional environmental problems. The composition and properties of fly ash are investigated in the paper, taking into account the possibilities of utilizing them for soil fertilization and other applications. Fly ash samples were collected from bunkers of flue gas cleaning equipment (electrostatic precipitator and cyclones) installed after water heating boilers, which are firing wood chips and chuffed straw. The composition of fly ash was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) while particle size distribution was obtained using scattered-light aerosol spectrometer. Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI) was used to separate fly ash into 14 groups by particle diameter, and the analysis of their composition showed differences in the composition of the fly ash collected in cyclones and Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP). An analysis of the composition of samples in regard to the existing heavy metals norms and considering concentrations of elements beneficial to the growth of plants, enables to prepare recommendations for fertilization. The determined alkalinity of fly ash pH 13 confirms the possibility of their use for reducing soil acidity. The analysis of fly ash composition has shown that they contain elements, important for plant growth (Ca, Mg, K, P, N, S), and their concentrations determine the further use for soil quality improvement because the amount of these elements in the acid soils is reduced. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Inhibitor tolerance is one of the key challenges in lignocellulosic bioethanol production. The presence of inhibitors in a lignocellulosic hydrolysate induces stress in microorganisms and thus reduces bioethanol synthesis efficiency. In this study, 166 marine yeasts isolated from different marine environments were compared with 78 terrestrial yeasts for their tolerance to inhibitory compounds such as acetic acid, formic acid, furfural, vanillin and salt, which are commonly found in hydrolysates derived from lignocellulosic materials. Marine yeasts showed higher tolerance to all the inhibitors tested than terrestrial yeasts. The most tolerant marine yeast was Wickerhamomyces anomalus M15 which had IC50 values of 10.7% (w/w) and 83.9 mM for salt and acetic acid, respectively, while those for an industrial terrestrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC2592 were 6.0% (w/w) and 75.9 mM, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that marine yeast clustered separately from terrestrial yeast. In fermentation, using simulated wheat straw hydrolysates containing inhibitors and prepared using seawater, three selected marine yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae AZ65, W. anomalus M15, and Candida membranifaciens M2 produced 23-24 g L-1 bioethanol from 60 g L-1 glucose, while terrestrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced only 12.5 g L-1 bioethanol. Marine yeasts were significantly more tolerant to the presence of inhibitory compounds and are phenotypically distinct from terrestrial yeasts. Significantly, a higher quantity of bioethanol was obtained in fermentation using selected marine yeasts with media containing inhibitory compounds. The study has highlighted the potential of finding microorganisms with industrially favourable characteristics in marine ecosystems and other adverse and challenging environments. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microalgae lipid-derived biofuels is considered promising candidates for substitution of petroleum-based energy sources. However, the lipid extraction from the algal biomass stands as a challenge due to its low yields and cost-intensive cell disruption procedures. In this study a multivariate optimization of the extraction conditions was suggested, aiming a maximization of the lipid extraction from Scenedesmus sp. microalgae grown using wastewater as a nutrient medium. The extraction method, extraction time, solvent mixture and pretreatment were considered between upper and lower levels in order to access their significance, including their interactions, on the experimental response, while using a reduced number of experiments. The studies were performed using low-cost extraction methods (magnetic stirring and ultrasonication). The optimal extraction condition was obtained using CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) solvent mixture, in a 2-hour extraction period using ultrasonication. Fatty acid profiles of extracted lipids were also evaluated. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - The current fossil fuel reserves are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand and very soon will become exhausted. Pollution, global warming, and inflated oil prices have led the quest for renewable energy sources. Algal biofuels represent a potential source of renewable energy. Algae, as the third generation feedstock, are suitable for biodiesel and bioethanol production due to their quick growth, excellent biomass yield, and high lipid and carbohydrate contents. With their huge potential, algae are expected to surpass the first and second generation feedstocks. Only a few thousand algal species have been investigated as possible biofuel sources, and none of them was ideal. This review summarizes the current status of algal biofuels, important steps of algal biofuel production, and the major commercial production challenges. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The meals after oil extraction from many oilseed crops have nutrition and biofumigation potential for land application. Oilseed meal (SM) from the dedicated bioenergy crop Jatropha curcas were implicated to contain compounds that have antibacterial properties on some soil pathogens. However, little is known about its effect on non-targeted soil microbial community, especially on fungi. SM from Camelina sativa contains moderate level of glucosinolates (GLS) and was under studied. To investigate soil fungal community responses to jatropha and camelina SMs, we conducted a lab based microcosm study, amending soil with 1% SMs of jatropha, camelina, flax, and biomass of wheat straw. Fungal community abundance and structure were analyzed based on the ITS region using qPCR and tag-pyrosequencing. Microbial functional changes were examined by community level physiological profile (CLPP) using Biolog assay. Both SMs from jatropha and camelina showed biofumigant properties and inhibited fungal proliferation. Jatropha SM significantly altered soil fungal community structures with lower fungal biodiversity and higher Chaetomium composition. Camelina SM amended soil promoted Fusarium proliferation. CLPP indicated sequential hierarchy for C metabolism in the oilseed-amended microcosms was generally complex C > phosphate-associated C > carboxylic acids > carbohydrates > amines > amino acids. No significant difference in CLPP was detected due to the type of SM treatment. Our data indicate that both SMs of jatropha and camelina have biofumigant properties and can differentially impact soil microbial communities, and the changes were relatively persistent over time. Microbial functional patterns on the other side were not impacted by SM type. Our study revealed biofumigant and nutritional influence of SMs from dedicated biofuel plants on soil microbial community. This information will help properly using jatropha and camelina SMs for pathogen control while minimizing their negative impacts on non-target microorganisms. However, further studies in the field are demanded to investigate their influences in real practice. Copyright © 2019 Hu, Wu, Hollister, Wang, Somenahally, Hons and Gentry.

AB  - For this issue of Bois et Forêts des Tropiques, the editor reviews the research and activities on fuelwood that he and his team have undertaken in Africa over the last forty years. A forward scenario is proposed that explains how these activities – some focusing on forestry, agroforestry and biofuels, others on social, economic and legal aspects – have complemented each other. He shows that in the 1990s, for demographic reasons, demand for fuelwood first caught up with and then exceeded the productive capacity of regions supplying large cities in the Sahel. Attempts were subsequently made by various government departments, NGOs and other projects to reduce fuelwood consumption, improve the management of natural forest stands and restore agroforestry systems. Although these attempts have slowed down the degradation of natural resources and are satisfying urban needs for domestic fuel while providing income for rural families, degradation is continuing almost everywhere and demand is only being met by depleting productive forest capital. The proposal made for the future is that in order to avoid social unrest in cities due to domestic fuel scarcities while continuing to guarantee an income for rural people, it is essential to combine energy efficiency policies with measures to restore and manage agroforestry systems. The share of domestic fuel that exceeds the productive capacities of fuelwood supply basins has to be substituted, and this will demand changes in national policies on land, taxation and subsidies and the introduction of regional planning measures. © 2019 Droit d’auteur.

AB  - This paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of landowners’ willingness to supply three bioenergy crops: switchgrass, Miscanthus, and willow, in the northeastern United States. Spatial heterogeneity might arise for several reasons. For example, landowners closer to bioenergy processing plants might be more likely to be willing to supply bioenergy crops, and landowners who are more willing to supply bioenergy crops may be spatially clustered because they share similar land attributes, demographics, experiences, and/or values. Using high-resolution GIS data related to the location of pellet plants utilizing bioenergy crops and survey data related to landowners’ characteristics including spatial location, we estimate a spatial probit model to explain the variation in individual-specific reservation prices (RPs)—the feedstock price at which landowners become willing to supply a bioenergy crop. We find that respondents’ RP is lower the closer they live to their nearest pellet plant and spatial dependency is only present for switchgrass supply. We also identify three economic hotspots (areas with high potential supply and low RPs) for each bioenergy crop. We believe that bioenergy supply chains could be developed around these hotspots. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In this study, effects of different pretreatment methods on the enzymatic digestibility of Pennisetum alopecuroides, a ubiquitous wild grass in China, were investigated to evaluate its potential as a feedstock for biofuel production. The stalk samples were separately pretreated with H2SO4, NaOH and FeCl3 solutions of different concentrations at 120 °C for 30 min, after which enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted to measure the digestibility of pretreated samples. Results demonstrated that different pretreatments were effective at removing hemicellulose, among which ferric chloride pretreatment (FCP) gave the highest soluble sugar recovery (200.2 mg/g raw stalk) from the pretreatment stage. In comparison with FCP and dilute acid pretreatment (DAP), dilute alkaline pretreatment (DALP) induced much higher delignification and stronger morphological changes of the biomass, making it more accessible to hydrolysis enzymes. As a result, DALP using 1.2% NaOH showed the highest total soluble sugar yield through the whole process from pretreatment to enzymatic hydrolysis (508.5 mg/g raw stalk). The present work indicates that DALP and FCP have the potential to enhance the effective bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass like P. alopecuroides, hence making this material a valuable and promising energy plant. © 2019 by the Authors.

AB  - The food-energy nexus has attracted great attention from policymakers, practitioners, and academia since the food price crisis during the 2007–2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and new policies that aim to increase ethanol production. This paper incorporates aggregate demand and alternative oil shocks to investigate the causal relationship between agricultural products and oil markets. For the period January 2000–July 2018, monthly spot prices of 15 commodities are examined, including Brent crude oil, biofuel-related agricultural commodities, and other agricultural commodities. The sample is divided into three sub-periods, namely: (i) January 2000–July 2006, (ii) August 2006–April 2013, and (iii) May 2013–July 2018. The structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition technique are used to examine how the shocks to agricultural markets contribute to the variance of crude oil prices. The empirical findings from the paper indicate that not every oil shock contributes the same to agricultural price fluctuations, and similarly for the effects of aggregate demand shocks on the agricultural market. These results show that the crude oil market plays a major role in explaining fluctuations in the prices and associated volatility of agricultural commodities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Energy security, fluctuating petroleum prices, resource depletion issues and global climate change have driven countries to consider adding alternative and renewable energy options to their conventional energy share. The use of biofuel such as non-edible oils-based biodiesel is as an option over conventional diesel and could be important for the development of a sustainable and eco-friendly energy resource. The aim of the present study was to select the most feasible non-edible plant oil as biodiesel feedstock by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of the multi-criteria decision making methods based on priority estimation model. Among various non-edible plant oils which are widely available in the South-East-Asian region, selection of the most feasible plant oil was evaluated based on seven criteria; seed oil yield, oil yield, free fatty acid (FFA) content, cold filter plugging point, oxidation stability, easiness to grow in marginal land, and availability in tropical areas. The obtained results from priority determination showed that nyamplung was the most efficient feedstock of biodiesel for the industry with the criteria weightage of 0.180. It was followed by kemiri sunan (2 nd order) having weightage of 0.164, physic nut 0.150 (3 rd order), indian beech 0.107 (4 th order), indian milkweed 0.095(5 th order), lead 0.092 (6 th order), kapok 0.076 (7 th order), cassia 0.049 (8 th order), soursop 0.043 (9 th order) and monkey pod 0.043 (10 th order). This study highlights an insight into multi-criteria decision making technique to assess the feasible plant oil for biodiesel production that could aid decision-making in the industry and policy development, particularly for the South-East-Asian region. © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - This paper aims to determine the environmental performance of the current landfill gas management system (based on flaring) in Mexico City (Bordo Poniente) in comparison to the collection of biogas generated from solid waste through one of the most innovative technology implemented in Denmark (Aikan Technology), which produces biogas and digestate from waste. Two alternative scenarios are proposed in which the Aikan Technology is implemented in Bordo Poniente to replace the existing system (reference scenario) that involves landfilling inorganic waste and composting organic waste in Bordo Poniente with no biogas recovery. The biogas recovered through Aikan Technology is exploited to provide heat and electricity (Scenario 1) or biofuel for the transportation sector (Scenario 2). A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to evaluate the environmental performances associated with all scenarios by evaluating the impact categories Climate Change, Fossil Depletion, and Cumulative Energy Demand. According to the waste capacity of Bordo Poniente, the implementation of the Aikan Technology would result in a total annual reduction of 0.14 and 0.08 Mt of CO2 eq for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively. Scenario 1 was also the best performing scenario with respect to fossil depletion (-52 kg oil eq ton-1 of organic waste) and cumulative energy demand (-3,557 MJ ton-1 of organic waste). The implementation of Aikan Technology in Mexico City represents an important challenge and requires further research into its economic and political feasibility. When it comes to tackling global environmental problems, international agreements ascribe high importance to environmental technology transfer. This study represents a preliminary step in terms of environmental assessment and thus provides important information for policymakers attempting to achieve more sustainable management of solid waste in Mexico. © 2019 Chávez, Caro and Thomsen.

AB  - Food security is essential to sustain human societies. Food production is often limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distils discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops aimed to enhance integrated management through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both for better planning and decision-making. Opportunities for enhancing food, energy, and water sustainability decisions through a data and information system are the focus of this paper. Data from each sector are needed to provide a full overview of the W-E-F Nexus. Relevant datasets and potential satellite products for water include water quality, watershed use change, snow and glacier monitoring, wetlands monitoring, water reservoir mapping, irrigation water management, aquifer monitoring, and measurements of critical water variables like precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Food and agricultural products include land use change maps, crop type mapping, crop acreage mapping, early warning indicators, yield assessment, precision agriculture, land degradation, clear-cut and burnt area maps, and soil moisture. Energy products include geological mapping, habitat assessment maps, logistic planning support, mine waste monitoring, renewable energy monitoring and mapping, and crop yield estimates for biofuels. However, specific priorities for W-E-F Nexus data products await further guidance from the W-E-F Nexus community. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a role in facilitating the paradigm shifts that benefit the W-E-F Nexus: explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and the appropriate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper explores the hypothesis that a properly defined system that integrates and consolidates W-E-F Nexus information and data could support the implementation of a W-E-F Nexus approach. © 2019 Lawford.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) is emitted to the atmosphere during biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel combustion, and leaves the atmosphere via dry or wet deposition on land and on the ocean. On a global scale, wet deposition accounts for about 80% of the total atmospheric BC inputs to the ocean. The input of BC particles to the ocean can enrich surface waters with carbon and associated elements, and owing to high porosity and surface-active properties, BC can alter biogeochemical cycles by sorbing dissolved compounds and promoting aggregation. The rain-mediated input of BC to the ocean and its consequences on nutrient concentrations and particle dynamics were studied in Halong Bay, Vietnam, during a 24-h cycle impacted by short and heavy rainfall events. This study suggests that once introduced in the surface ocean via wet deposition, BC sorbs dissolved organic matter (DOM) and stimulates aggregation processes. The observed wet deposition events were characterized by sudden and pulsed inputs of BC particles that created a thin layer of sinking surface-active aggregates, acting as a net-like scavenger for DOM, nutrients (especially phosphate), and small particles. In addition, the wet deposition events coincided with an enrichment of nutrients in the surface microlayer, with an excess input of nitrogen relative to phosphorus leading to an increase of the molar N:P ratio from 24:1 to 37:1. In the underlying water, the molar N:P ratio also increased (i.e., from 39:1 to 64:1), and this can be attributed to the preferential scavenging of dissolved P-compounds on sinking BC-aggregates. © 2019 Mari, Guinot, Thuoc, Brune, Lefebvre, Angia Sriram, Raimbault, Dittmar and Niggemann.

AB  - Most recent research concerning biofuels focuses on their potential for mitigating climate change, while their rural development dimension is given less prominence. Ongoing policy debates, including EU and US biofuel policies, pay little attention to this feature of the industry. This paper explores the impact of biorefineries on rural development, and employment in particular. It shows that biorefineries can have a considerable economic impact on the regions in which they are located. Embedded in the local social and economic fabric, the paper demonstrates their influence on regional and national labour markets. The case of a bioethanol plant in Hungary and its effect on the rural labour market in two counties of the country is studied by way of an input-output model. The research has found that the operation of a biorefinery stimulates the creation and maintenance of jobs in both farming and service industries. Results suggest that biorefineries are an important driver of rural development and that this aspect of the industry should be given greater weight in formulating biofuel policies. © 2019, NAIK Research Institute of Agricultural Economics.

AB  - Although bioenergy sorghum has many traits that make it ideal for biofuel production, management conditions that can affect the productivity and sustainability of these systems are still poorly understood. This paper estimated the energy and CO2 balance of two bioenergy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.) hybrids (H128 and H133) cultivated during two growing seasons and under two different levels of crop management, high and low input. At the end of both growing season, sorghum was harvested for biomass yield determination. Calorific value and net energy production were also estimated. Crop management had important effects on sorghum CO2 and energy balance. The energy produced varied between 126 and 365 GJ ha–1 depending on crop management, hybrid and growing season. Regarding of the CO2 balance, the high level of crop management had a superior CO2 emission. However, the energy produced per kg of CO2 emitted was higher (&gt;300%) than the energy produced with the use of fossil fuels. The use of bioenergy sorghum can contribute to better energy sustainability and reduced CO2 emission in Mediterranean ecosystems. © A.M. Cabrera-Ariza et al., 2018.

AB  - As the largest consumer of petroleum and second highest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, the United States currently is a leading country in bioenergy production driven by a series of policies. One such public program that directly subsidizes biomass feedstock growers is the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP), which recently received attention for stimulating the development of bioenergy. However, critiques were also raised, concerning the possibility of intensifying the feedstock competition between bioenergy and forest products. This study, therefore, aimed at assessing the effects of BCAP on the forest product markets with the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM). Three alternative scenarios were designed to simulate three payments in BCAP. In the first scenario, the matching payment was simulated by adjusting the manufacturing cost of fuelwood and particleboard. In the second scenario, establishment payment was simulated by adjusting the supply rate of industrial roundwood. In the third scenario, the annual payment was simulated by linking the supply change rate with the soil rental rate for industrial roundwood. We found that, under the matching payment scenario, industrial roundwood and particleboard will experience a sharp decrease in production and an increase in price. For establishment payments, industrial roundwood will experience a continuous increase in production and a decrease in price. For annual payments, the industrial roundwood will experience a V-shape pattern production. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This review provides data on the possibilities for commercial use of algae of the green streptophyte genus Klebsormidium. It is one of the basal algal progenitors of land plants and shows many mechanisms and features which allow its adaptation to different environmental stresses associated with land colonization. This has led to formation of structures and compounds with countless possible applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology, starting from food to pharmaceuticals and biofuels. Therefore, the present work aims to provide: (1) a review on this yet neglected topic for the first time; (2) reliable identification using the polyphasic taxonomic approach of three local Klebsormidium strains isolated from soils of two protected areas in Bulgaria (Kresnendko Defile and National park Rila). It also outlines the cultivation advantages of Klebsormidium broad tolerance to harsh conditions and its reproductive features (easy disintegration and possibility to produce resting stages). The possibility to use inoculum of akinetes in soil algalization as biofertilizers is proposed. The results from standard microscopical identification and molecular data (ITS and rbcL, used separately and in combination), combined in the applied polyphasic approach led to distinguishing between geographically distinct strains collected at different altitudes. After identification of two strains (ACUS 00001 and ACUS 00014) as belonging to Klebsormidium dissectum and of ACUS 00207 as belonging to Klebsormidium klebsii, the similarity of the latter taxon with K. nitens is discussed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Miscanthus is a C 4 perennial energy crop distributed in various regions of China. Miscanthus sinensis has a high potential for biomass production, great adaptability to marginal land and tolerance to stress environmental. It's very important for the production and development of biofuel to review both the morphological and geographical traits on yield. However, the relevance of biomass yield and the geographical position of habitat are still not well known. In the present study, investigations of heading date, plant height, stem number and dry biomass per plant were carried out to calculate the influence of the morphological traits on yield. The investigation was based on 327 Miscanthus sinensis accessions collected from 21 provinces from all over China. The analysis was carried out on the basis of the two-year field experiment. The data for the second year was used to perform the analysis of variance and regression. Statistical data analysis was also performed on the variation of the biomass and morphological traits over successive period of study. The results showed that the growth included plant height and stem number in the following year was much better than the first year, particularly the biomass. Regression analysis revealed that latitude, plant height, and stem number were the key morphological traits that influence the biomass production. Also, heading date and elevation were found to be highly correlated to yield structure. These results demonstrated that the growth and yield were strongly influenced by geographical location, and apart from morphological traits, geographical traits were important factors that affect biomass. © 2017 United Arab Emirates University.

AB  - Biofuel production has received considerable attention as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating global energy problems. The expansion of biofuel production has benefited the environment, but rising feed prices have negatively affected the livelihood of livestock producers. This study examines the direct effects of corn-based ethanol expansion on beef producers' short-run resource transition and long-run productivity in the United States. Dynamic panel models are specified to measure farm productivity and to investigate the effects of ethanol expansion on input-use decisions and the productivity of individual beef producers. Analyses of farm-level panel data show that in the short run, ethanol expansion is associated with employment losses in the beef industry to compensate for increased costs of intermediate inputs used in the production process; however, in the long-run, it increases farm productivity. The productivity of surviving beef producers has improved because less efficient producers could not survive due to the drastic burden of rising feed prices. Given the interconnections between the agriculture and energy markets through the growth of biofuel production, our results provide important insights in developing sustainable energy policies that could harmonize both markets and reduce unintended negative effects of biofuel production. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The article deals with the past and present of Indonesian sugar industry. It clearly identifies the causes leading to the loss of the important position on the world sugar markets Indonesia used to hold in the past. The rigidity of local sugar industry combined with trade restrictions vis-à- vis foreign countries rather conserves the current status-quo. The reforms of the past decades described in the text have not led to a more radical change either. Therefore, the latest effort of local government to use outputs of Indonesian sugar industry for biofuels appears, due to the unsolved problems, rather unreal. © 2019, VUC Praha, a.s., All rights reserved.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emission reduction is strongly advocated within the European Union (EU). Biomass has emerged as a renewable energy source and as manufacturing raw material with ecological credentials to mitigate carbon imbalance. The EU has defined the bioeconomy encompassing these material sources as a basis for technological and economic development. Biocenology, describing the study of natural communities, however, additionally demands inclusion of a circular economy, in which it needs to be assumed that endless renewable products are kept in continuous circulation of use and reuse. Thus, there arises the question whether the bioeconomy route alone, promoted by the EU, is sustainable. Using research literature, based on the Delphi method, and EU documents, we discuss the importance of sustainable management of bioresources. Short term solutions may remain necessary to ensure economic stability but, without embracing the circular economy, only limited mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions can be expected. © 2019, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade.
Једна од најважнијих смерница Европске Уније је смањивање гасова који су узрок стварања ефекта „стаклене баште". Истраживање природних заједница и екосистема захтева примену система циркуларне економије у коме би сировине природног порекла биле у константној циркулацији ка поновном коришћењу отпада. С тим у вези поставља се питање да ли биоекономија као једна од важних грана реално води ка заштит животне средине. Питања која даље проистићу везана су за то да ли је пут ка биоекономији, који промовише Европска Унија заправо одржив. Коришћењем литературе, према Делфи методи, из докумената Европске Уније и научних публикација које су проистекле из истих, указујемо на значај одрживог управљања биоресурсима, јер делује да је само ограничено смањење емисија гасова са ефектом стаклене баште очекиване.

AB  - Density, viscosity and calorific values are important physical properties to affect the utilization of biofuel. In this work, mixtures of farnesane and a “jet fuel”, QAv-1, were used to study the variation of density and kinematic viscosity as a function of the volumetric fraction of farnesane and temperature. Experimental measurements were carried out for nineteen farnesane blends and pure farnesane and QAv-1, at four temperatures in the range of 293 - 323 K. Variation of high heating (HHV) and low heating (LHV) values were also determined for different blends of farnesane/QAv-1. Several empirical correlations were used to predict the density, the kinematic viscosity, HHV and LHV values. By using some of these empirical correlations, the estimated values of those three properties studied are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, with low absolute average prediction error. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a cool-season oil seed crop that has been proven to produce various biofuels. The present study investigated the technical possibilities of using whole camelina biomass as a model feedstock in a biorefinery. This investigation examined the possibilities of using camelina seeds as a source of oil for biodiesel, sugars for ethanol, and meal for oneportfolio products. The camelina harvest residues (straw) can serve as the main source for green sugars. This study found that the energy input for the whole biorefinery process was 25.1 MJ/L ethanol, while the energy output was 54.3 MJ/L ethanol. The net energy ratio of 2.16 MJ/L ethanol was found to be competitive with other energy crops. The process was environmentally friendly, and it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 40% if the produced biodiesel replaced petroleum diesel. The seed meals and glycerin were found to be a good source of revenue as high valueadded products and can provide an additional revenue of $1/kg of produced oil. © 2018, BioResources.

AB  - Since the beginning of written history, diverse texts have reported the use of enzymatic preparations in food processing and have described the medicinal properties of crude and fractionated venoms to treat various diseases and injuries. With the biochemical characterization of enzymes from distinct sources and bioactive polypeptides from animal venoms, the last sixty years have testified the advent of industrial enzymology and protein therapeutics, which are currently applicable in a wide variety of industrial processes, household products, and pharmaceuticals. Bioprospecting of novel biocatalysts and bioactive peptides is propelled by their unsurpassed properties that are applicable for current and future green industrial processes, biotechnology, and biomedicine. The demand for both novel enzymes with desired characteristics and novel peptides that lead to drug development, has experienced a steady increase in response to the expanding global market for industrial enzymes and peptidebased drugs. Moreover, although largely unexplored, oceans and marine realms, with their unique ecosystems inhabited by a large variety of species, including a considerable number of venomous animals, are recognized as untapped reservoirs of molecules and macromolecules (enzymes and bioactive venom-derived peptides) that can potentially be converted into highly valuable biopharmaceutical products. In this review, we have focused on enzymes and animal venom (poly)peptides that are presently in biotechnological use, and considering the state of prospection of marine resources, on the discovery of useful industrial biocatalysts and drug leads with novel structures exhibiting selectivity and improved performance. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Our objective was to estimate the impact of harvesting stover from agricultural crops to generate biofuels or electricity on the soil organic carbon levels of the Pampean Region in Argentina. For this purpose, a carbon balance methodology based on artificial neural networks was used. Contrasting soil carbon scenarios for different subregions were constructed using a current map of organic carbon and statistical data for crop rotations. Average yields were also estimated using this information. The neural network methodology allowed calculating the annual carbon balance as the difference between estimating the contribution of carbon in crop residues (stover + roots) to the soil and losses as heterotrophic respiration. The model was run for each level of residue input until the soil carbon attained a steady-state. Current rotations were modelled, with predominance of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and alternatives that included a greater proportion of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.). Only the stover of these latter two crops was considered to be partially harvested (30% and 60%). The input of carbon to soil was highly dependent on rotation, increasing as the proportion of wheat and corn in the rotation and the level of yield increased. In contrast, stover harvest had little impact on the carbon input due to the low proportion of both crops in the predominant current rotation. By increasing the proportion of cereal crops or the technological level and yield, it was possible to compensate for the effect of stover harvest on soil carbon. The carbon input from residue needed to maintain soil carbon ranged within 2.0-6.0 t C ha -1 year -1 depending on the initial soil carbon level. Retention efficiency of residue carbon was ∼30% across different management scenarios. It is not recommended to harvest more than 30% of the stover in order to maintain the level of carbon in the soil organic matter of many Pampean soils. © 2019 CSIRO.

AB  - The use of fossil fuels is unsustainable due to limited supply and also due to large emissions of Carbon dioxide due to the effect of global warming. Biofuel is a viable option but can, as produced today; only provide a limited amount of fuels needed. Biofuels are presently derived from terrestrial plants, which require large amounts of arable land. Biofuels from microalgae on the other hand do not necessarily require arable land and can theoretically replace fossil fuels absolutely. Biofuels from microalgae could use industry waste water as growth medium particularly paper industry waste water is an interesting potential provider due to its high nitrogen and phosphorus in waste water. In this research work marine microalgae Nannochloropsis Salina was cultivated using f/2 medium using modified air lift photo-bioreactor along with the paper industry effluent waste water, The doubling time calculated from optical density attained at 48 hrs the cell count almost doubled during this period. Since the marine species is sensitive to pH we need to maintain the pH at 7 below 7indicated the decreased biomass levels in culture. The lipid extraction was studied using solvent methods. The functional compounds in lipids FAME were studied using GC-MS analysis, the Nannochloropsis salina showed qualities of growing in fresh water and brackish water apart from the marine water which is a desirable characteristic for algal phycoremediation. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion has emerged as the preferred treatment for organic fraction of municipal solid waste. Digestate management strategies are devised not only for safe disposal but also to increase the value and marketability. Regulations and standards for digestate management are framed to address the pollution concerns, conserve vulnerable zones, prevent communicable diseases, and to educate on digestate storage and applications. Regulations and the desired end uses are the main drivers for the enhancement of digestate through pretreatment, in vessel cleaning, and post-digestion treatment technologies for solid and liquid fractions of digestate. The current management practice involves utilization of digestate for land application either as fertilizer or soil improver. Prospects are bright for alternative usage such as microalgal cultivation, biofuel and bioethanol production. Presently, the focus of optimization of the anaerobic digestion process is directed only towards enhancing biogas yield, ignoring the quality of digestate produced. A paradigm shift is needed in the approach from ‘biogas optimization’ to ‘integrated biogas–digestate optimization’. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is an important perennial, drought tolerant plant that has been identified as a potential biodiesel crop. We report here the hybrid de novo genome assembly of J. curcas generated using Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, and identification of quantitative loci for Jatropha Mosaic Virus (JMV) resistance. In this study, we generated scaffolds of 265.7 Mbp in length, which correspond to 84.8% of the gene space, using Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis. Additionally, 96.4% of predicted protein-coding genes were captured in RNA sequencing data, which reconfirms the accuracy of the assembled genome. The genome was utilized to identify 12,103 dinucleotide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, which were exploited in genetic diversity analysis to identify genetically distinct lines. A total of 207 polymorphic SSR markers were employed to construct a genetic linkage map for JMV resistance, using an interspecific F 2 mapping population involving susceptible J. curcas and resistant Jatropha integerrima as parents. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis led to the identification of three minor QTLs for JMV resistance, and the same has been validated in an alternate F 2 mapping population. These validated QTLs were utilized in marker-assisted breeding for JMV resistance. Comparative genomics of oil-producing genes across selected oil producing species revealed 27 conserved genes and 2986 orthologous protein clusters in Jatropha. This reference genome assembly gives an insight into the understanding of the complex genetic structure of Jatropha, and serves as source for the development of agronomically improved virus-resistant and oil-producing lines. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Green water-rainfall over land that eventually flows back to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration-is the main source of water to produce food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy. To understand how freshwater scarcity constrains production of these goods, we need to consider limits to the green water footprint (WF g ), the green water flow allocated to human society. However, research traditionally focuses on scarcity of blue water-groundwater and surface water. Here we expand the debate on water scarcity by considering green water scarcity (WS g ). At 5 × 5 arc-minute spatial resolution, we quantify WF g and the maximum sustainable level to this footprint (WF g,m ), while accounting for green water requirements to support biodiversity. We then estimate WSg per country as the ratio of the national aggregate WF g to the national aggregate WF g,m . We find that globally WFg amounts to 56% of WF g,m , and overshoots it in several places, for example in countries in Europe, Central America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The sustainably available green water flows in these countries are mostly or fully allocated to human activities (predominately agriculture and forestry), occasionally at the cost of green water flows earmarked for nature. By ignoring limits to the growing human WF g , we risk further loss of ecosystem values that depend on the remaining untouched green water flows. We emphasize that green water is a critical and limited resource that should explicitly be part of any assessment of water scarcity, food security, or bioenergy potential. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The substitution of cellulosic biofuel in place of conventional fuels could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. However, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health during biofuel crop production could have a major impact on the GHG balance of biofuels. We assessed temporal changes (10 yr) in SOC stocks to a 90 cm depth in Cumulic Hapludolls from central Kansas under perennial and annual cropping systems. The perennial crops were miscanthus (Miscan-thus sacchariflorus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). The annual cropping systems were continuous corn (Zea mays L.), and corn, dual purpose–grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sweet sorghum, and photoperiod-sensitive sorghum (PS) in rotation with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. All standing aboveground biomass was removed at harvest of corn, sorghum, and perennial crops. Stocks of SOC increased in the 0–15 cm depth under switchgrass and miscanthus by 0.8 and 1.3 Mg C ha –1 yr –1 , respectively. The SOC stocks did not change at the other depths or at any depth in the annual cropping systems nor throughout the soil profile under any crops. Root biomass measured in the seventh year of the study was 3.7 to 7.8 times greater in perennials than in annual crops. Increases on SOC were correlated with greater root biomass, abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizae and saprophytic fungi, and soil aggregate diameter. These results demonstrate the potential for perennial biofuel crops to enhance C sequestration and improve soil quality while providing feedstock for production of cellulosic biofuel. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - High water-use efficiency crops that can be used to produce bioenergy are needed in the 21st century. Previous research has focused on maize stover (Zea mays L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Miscanthus (Miscanthus ssp.), and sorghum [Sor-ghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. This list does not consider Virginia fanpetals (Sida hermaphrodita L. Rusby), which is a perennial plant that has high water efficiency. The objective of this study was to determine if Virginia fanpetals can be cultivated to produce bioenergy, including ethanol. In this study, the impact of K source and N rates on the suitability of Virginia fanpetals biomass for bioenergy production was investigated. The crop Virginia fanpetals (also known as Sida) is a plant that can be used to produce bioenergy. However, the fertilizer and cultivation requirements of this plant are largely unknown. In research conducted between 2005 and 2007, the influence of two sources of K and two N rates on biomass composition was investigated. Fertilizer was applied each year after the beginning of the growing season. The crop was harvested in November. This work suggests that Sida biomass can be used to produce high-quality pellets and second-generation ethanol, and can meet close to 99% of the requirements of the European standards for biofuels. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Emerging annual biofuel feedstock systems could impact the midwestern US marginal soils through soil C sequestration. Yet, the short-term impact by these potential cropping systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations is largely unknown. A two-site, 5-yr study was conducted to determine the effects on SOC pools by converting land use from a minimally managed perennial grassland on marginal lands to annual bioenergy feedstock production. Maize (Zea mays L.), sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and high biomass sorghum (HBS) were each grown in rotation with soybean (Glycine max L.) and soil samples were collected in the first, second, and fifth years, then analyzed for differences among the cropping systems in SOC and active carbon fraction (AC) concentrations. Additionally, in the fifth year, soil from the adjoining undisturbed grassland was analyzed against the cropping systems and C fraction stocks determined. Concentrations of SOC and AC decreased over the first 2 yr at both sites, but SOC concentrations rebounded near to initial levels after 5 yr. The central Missouri site maintained greater SOC and AC concentrations than the southwestern Missouri site. A slight increase in AC concentration occurred from year 2 to 5 at the southwestern Missouri site, suggesting beneficial effects from the biofuel feedstocks. In contrast, AC concentrations continued to decrease at the central Missouri site. Crop rotation treatments revealed that continued HBS–soybean rotation beyond the 5th yr has the potential to increase C concentrations and stocks at depth (10–20 cm) compared to a maize–soybean rotation. x00A9; 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop residue is an abundant resource for the potential production of biofuels, but a better understanding of its use on net carbon emissions must be developed to mitigate climate change. This analysis combines two established crop growth models (Hybrid-Maize and Soysim) with a simple soil and crop residue respiration model to estimate daily ecosystem respiration (ERe) from maize and soybean; ERe was estimated to be the sum of CO 2 emissions from the oxidation of the growing crop, crop residue, and soil organic carbon (SOC). Model-estimated CO 2 fluxes from irrigated continuous maize and irrigated maize– soybean cropping systems in eastern Nebraska were compared with tower eddy covariance measurements of CO 2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010 from those fields. Modeled C emissions closely estimated measured seasonal patterns of CO 2 dynamics and measured daily ERe (R 2 : 0.87, 0.84). Measured and modeled annual ERe values were also compared and better agreement was found in maize compared to soybean. As there are limited comparisons of modeled soil emissions with eddy covariance measured CO 2 fluxes, this study is important for the validation of these types of models and to support their potential use in quantifying emissions from crop residue for biofuels. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.

AB  - The amount of crop residues that can be sustainability removed is highly variable and is a function of many factors including the soil, climatic, and plant characteristics. For example, leaving an insufficient amount of crop residue on the soil surface can be detrimental for soil quality, result in loss of soil organic matter (SOM), and increase soil erosion, whereas leaving excessive amounts can impair soil-seed contact, immobilize N, and/or keep soils cool and wet. This special issue evolved as an outcome of, “Crop Residues for Advanced Biofuels: Effects on Soil Car-bon” workshop held in Sacramento, CA, in 2017. The goal of the special issue is to provide a forum for identifying knowledge gaps associated with crop residue management and to expand the discussion from a regional Midwestern U.S. to a global perspective. Several crop residue experiments as well as simulation modeling studies are included to examine effects of tillage, crop rotation, livestock grazing, and cover crops on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, crop yield, and soil or plant health. The special issue is divided into 4 sections that include (i) Estimating Crop Residue Removal and Modeling; (ii) Cultural Practice Impact on Soil Health; (iii) Residue Removal Impact on Soil and Plant Health; and (iv) Cultural Practice Impact on Carbon Storage and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop residues like corn (Zea mays L) stover are potential feedstock for production of advanced biofuels (e.g., cellulosic ethanol). Utilization of residue like stover for biofuel feedstock may provide economic and greenhouse gas mitigation benefits; however, harvesting these materials must be done in a manner that protects the soil. This paper summarizes an introductory overview presented at the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) workshop in Sacramento, CA, on crop residue removal for advanced biofuel production. Corn stover has been identified as an advanced biofuel feedstock, which could provide agronomic, economic and greenhouse gas mitigation benefits. However, stover harvest may result in soil exposed to erosive forces, and inadequate residue input for sustaining soil organic matter, resulting in soil degradation and other negative environmental consequences. Thus, strategies to protect the soil resource to balance current and future societal needs are required. Returning adequate residue and/or adding cover crops can mitigate or reduce risks to soil properties, which may be adversely impacted by harvesting crop residue. It is paramount to safeguard the soil so this indispensable resource continues providing a wide range of services including feeding and clothing a growing population. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Burning of fossil fuels in the transportation sector accounts for 28% of US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Substitution of cellulosic biofuel in place of conventional gasoline or diesel could reduce GHG emissions from transportation; however, the effectiveness of cellulosic biofuel in reducing emissions depends on emissions during the growth of biofuel crops. The objectives of this study were (i) to measure N 2 O emissions of potential cellulosic biofuel cropping systems, and (ii) to characterize the temporal variations in N 2 O emissions in these cropping systems. Annual N 2 O emissions were measured in corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and photoperiod-sensitive sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]–soybean rotations as well as in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) from 2011–2013 in Manhattan, KS, using static chambers. No consistent significant differences were found in N 2 O emissions among crop species, though miscanthus tended to have the least emissions. Most N 2 O was emitted during large events of short duration (1–3 d) that occurred after substantial rainfall events with high soil NO 3 − . In 2011 and 2012, most N 2 O was emitted during the growing season. In 2013, 30–50% of the N 2 O emissions were emitted after September which was attributed to freeze–thaw cycles. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Crop residues protect soil resources, sustain soil organic carbon (SOC), cycle nutrients, support microbial communities, and provide bioenergy feedstock. Herein we (i) summarize the origin of the “Crop Residues for Advanced Biofuels: Effects on Soil Carbon” workshop; (ii) review the workshop structure; and (iii) present consensus points, unanswered questions, and outcomes of the workshop. Initiated by a farmer/ethanol investor’s letter to the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) President, an ASA Working Group (WG) was established to make a recommendation to the ASA Board on how to respond. The WG concluded a Tri-Society sponsored workshop involving farmers, ethanol production and marketing groups, agronomists, crop scientists, soil scientists, engineers, non-governmental organizations, life cycle analysis (LCA) experts, and regulatory personnel was needed to address the complex question that had been posed and to ensure all viewpoints were fully represented. The WG was expanded to an ASA Task Force who organized the workshop in Sacramento, CA. Eighty workshop attendees identified four consensus areas (crop residue management [CRM]; severity of soil erosion; tillage, CRM and erosion linkages; and the importance of simulation [LCA] models) and four unresolved themes (carbon sequestration, CRM effects on SOC stocks, changing climate effects, and the need to focus on ecosystem services rather than single end-points). The workshop resulted in three direct outcomes: (i) development of a stakeholder funded SOC database, (ii) LCA and SOC model improvements, and (iii) development of this special section in Agronomy Journal. Dale and Ong (2014) concluded that large scale, renewable energy systems are no longer just a “good idea”; but essential, and during the next few decades society must develop systems capable of producing clean energy at the multi-terawatt scale. Crop residues such as corn (Zea mays L.) stover, and other cellulosic materials were identified as potential feedstocks to meet this demand and have been rigorously evaluated for the past decade (e.g., Perlack et al., 2005; U.S. Department of Energy, 2011 and 2016). However, it is also well established that crop residues have important ecosystem service and productivity functions (Larson, 1979; Johnson, 2018; Ibrahim et al., 2018). © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - The impact of anaerobic digestion of animal waste on the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics is not widely studied. Two identical, 800-L digesters seeded with swine slurry were followed up to 100 d in three separate trials. The trials received varying amounts of antibiotic-free corn (Zea mays L.) mixed with water to maintain the digestion process. Biogas production, seven tetracycline resistance (tet) genes, and three tetracyclines and their transformation products were measured. Biogas production proportionally increased as the feeding loads increased between trials. In Trial 1, log10 tet gene copies showed small but statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) increases during digestion. In Trial 2, anaerobic digestion did not have a significant (P &gt; 0.05) effect except for significant reductions in tetB (P &lt; 0.0001) and tetG (P = 0.0335) log10 gene copies. In Trial 3, which received the highest amount of corn mix, log10 copies of the 16S ribosomal RNA and the tet genes significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) reduced over time during digestion. Up to 36 mg L−1 tetracycline, 112 mg L−1 chlortetracycline, 11.9 mg L−1 isochlortetracycline, and 30 mg L−1 4-epitetracycline were detected both in the liquid and solid digestates. Results of this study revealed that although anaerobic digestion of swine waste can produce useful biogas, it does not result in complete removal of bacteria, ARGs, and antibiotics regardless of differences in the feeding loads between trials. Further effluent and sludge treatments are required prior to their downstream use in crop production to minimize emergence and environmental dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through animal manure.

AB  - This research aims to promote the use of second-generation biofuels based mainly on Castor oil, which is not adequate for food use, and Sunflower oil as a standard reference for recycled oils. They have been applied in the production of Ecodiesel, a biofuel that integrates glycerol as monoglyceride, employing sodium methoxide as homogeneous catalyst and ethanol as solvent, but operating in milder conditions than in the synthesis of conventional biodiesel in order to obtain a kinetic control of the selective transesterification. The behavior of biofuels has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The contamination degree was also evaluated from the opacity values of the generated smokes. The different biofuels here studied have practically no differences in the behavior with respect to the power generated, although a small increase in the fuel consumption was obtained in some cases. However, with the biofuels employed, a significant reduction, up to 40%, in the emission of pollutants is obtained, mainly with the blend diesel/castor oil/alcohol. Besides, it is found that pure Castor oil can be employed directly as biofuel in triple blends diesel/biofuel/alcohol, exhibiting results that are very close to those obtained using biodiesel or Ecodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The present study aimed to develop an integrated treatment of agro-industrial waste for biofuel (biogas and syngas) production and for phosphorus recovery. In the first step, an anaerobic digestion (AD) process was carried out on two different mixtures of raw agro-industrial residues. Specifically, a mixture of asparagus and tomato wastes (mixture-1) and a mixture of potatoes and kiwifruit residues (mixture-2) were investigated. The results proved that the properties of mixtures notably affect the evolution of the digestion process. Indeed, despite the lower organic load, the maximum biogas yield, of about 0.44 L/gCODremoved, was obtained for mixture-1. For mixture-2, the digestion process was hindered by the accumulation of acidity due to the lack of alkalinity in respect to the amount of volatile fatty acids. In the second step, the digestates from AD were utilized for syngas production using supercritical water gasification (SCWG) at 450 °C and 250 bar. Both the digestates were rapidly converted into syngas, which was mainly composed of H2, CO2, CH4, and CO. The maximum values of global gasification efficiency, equal to 56.5 g/kgCOD, and gas yield, equal to 1.8 mol/kgTS, were detected for mixture-2. The last step of the integrated treatment aimed to recover the phosphorus content, in the form of MgKPO4·6H2O, from the residual liquid fraction of SCWG. The experimental results proved that at pH = 10 and Mg/P = 1 it is possible to obtain almost complete phosphorus removal. Moreover, by using the scanning electronic microscopy, it was demonstrated that the produced precipitate was effectively composed of magnesium potassium phosphate crystals. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - New models for renewable energy production are needed to simultaneously decrease greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, use land more efficiently and replace large amounts of fossil fuel. Ethanol production and livestock feed integration as practiced in the United States (USA) is one model for ethanol production combined with animal feed production. Brazil, the second largest ethanol and beef cattle producer in the world, can adapt the USA model of corn ethanol and cattle integration considering its local characteristics. This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of sugarcane ethanol and cattle integration, thereby avoiding pasture displacement into forests or other sensitive lands. Cattle can be fattened in feedlots using some sugarcane ethanol byproducts. Intensification of cattle production by integration with sugarcane production releases pasture area to produce more biofuels, without needing more land for cattle production. The release of pasture land to produce more sugarcane results in what we call “avoided ILUC” the resultant reduced GHG emissions compared to conventional sugarcane ethanol, because no additional land is needed to accommodate an additional sugarcane ethanol production. Simulations were performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) model developed by the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE). We calculated as economic parameters the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and payback time. Climate impacts were assessed via Life Cycle Assessment. Sugarcane and cattle integration decreases overall climate impacts compared to non-integrated systems. Techno-economic feasibility is achieved by additional land rental revenues for released pasture area and by carbon credits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a considerable literature on the influence of farming characteristics on the farmers’ intention to supply agricultural and forestry residues. However, the most of the studies focused on the direct causal-effect relationship between farming characteristic variables and the farmers’ intention to supply residues. Different considerations regarding the different farming characteristics segment remain unanswered. Moreover, farming characteristics with insignificant results can be misinterpreted as unimportant by policy makers and biofuel producers, and therefore they can misjudge the influence of the overall farming characteristics. Supported by an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, this study used the PLS-MGA to demonstrate the moderation effect of the four farming characteristics - dependency on the FFB collectors, landownership status, plantation size, and plantation experience - on smallholder planters’ intentions to supply palm residues for biofuel production. The results show that smallholder planters from each farming characteristic group consider supplying palm residues differently, compared to the other groups of planters. Clarifying the different considerations accordingly can provide an insight into formulating an effective engagement strategy to foster the involvement of smallholder planters providing feedstock for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy crop production can enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, whilst producing feedstocks for energy generation. However, the GHG balance of these ecosystems is intimately linked to crop selection, previous and current land management and the effects of land conversion. This study aims to quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the early stage of land-use change (LUC) from perennial grassland to two perennial rhizomatous grasses in a temperate climate: Miscanthus and reed canary grass (RCG) in the south of Ireland. Emissions of N2O were measured during the first two years of RCG and Miscanthus establishment. Miscanthus stands emitted 7.7 ± 1.6 and 2.3 ± 0.2 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 in the first and the second year, respectively, while RCG produced 1.1 ± 0.2 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 in the first year following LUC. Temporal fluxes of N2O were generally low, however peak emissions observed in the first year contributed approximately 83% of annual N2O in the Miscanthus treatment. This peak occurred in wet (50 mm rainfall in the week preceding the peak) and warm (&gt;18.5 °C in the top 5 cm of soil) weather conditions and was significantly affected (R2 = 0.77) by the soil moisture deficit. However large, annual N2O losses from Miscanthus and RCG found in this study are well within the range of those from grassland soils in temperate climate, drawing conclusions that any short-term increases in N2O production will soon be offset by the reduced future fertilisation, carbon sequestration and produced bioenergy feedstock. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Paris Agreement brings countries together in a combined effort to combat climate change and its effects. A key target is the reduction of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Providing biogas from biomass is one option to provide renewable and less carbon intensive fuels. When upgraded to biomethane it may be a substitute for natural gas and thus may have many application pathways. Recognising this potential many European countries installed governmental support programmes to stimulate market growth over the last decade. However, most of the installed schemes in Europe are time-limited. Besides being time-limited most of the schemes include a degression of compensation over time, resulting in many having limited success over longer time frames. This study questions the feasibility of near-term business cases for biomethane plants and analyses options for making them less dependent on governmental support programmes. Currently a market potential is seen in the utilization of process carbon dioxide in carbon capture and utilization or carbon capture and storage pathways, because it is a widely available side product from biogas upgrading. Therefore, we examined three business cases for its utilization in across sectors. To answer the research question we use a previously developed biomethane market simulation model and added an extension for new business cases. Results indicate that there are specific business options in the field of 2160 m³ h−1 to 20,840 m³ h−1 that are economical feasible under certain circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil salinization is one of the major threats affecting crop production, in particular in the Mediterranean basin where over 1 Mha are salt-affected. Growing lignocellulosic crops, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), in marginal saline soils could represent a valuable opportunity to mitigate land abandonment while producing feedstock for biofuels. However, little is still known about salt tolerance of upland and lowland switchgrass cultivars. This study addressed the morphological and physiological responses of Shawnee (upland) and Alamo (lowland) to a range of salinity levels from 0 to 14 dS m−1. Two consecutive experiments were carried out: one in petri dish to test the response to salinity at germination and early growth stages, the other in pot to evaluate the response to salinity until flowering stage (full-grown plants). Both upland and lowland cultivars were able to grow until “critical” salinity levels (14 dS m−1) but their tolerance differed depending on growth stage. Alamo showed a higher tolerance to salinity than Shawnee at very early growth stages (germination/emergence), presenting a germination rate more than double that of Shawnee (60 vs. 19%, main effect cultivar). Nevertheless, Shawnee resulted in a higher tolerance at a full-grown stage likely due to a more efficient salt exclusion capacity, as indicated by the higher residual soil electric conductivity at the end of the experiment detected in Shawnee pots. Final biomass production was anyhow considerably significantly higher in Alamo than Shawnee under any tested salinity level, which demonstrated the improved ability of lowland cultivar to produce biomass compared to Shawnee which otherwise might have invested resources into exclusion mechanisms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae is a promising feedstock for biofuels. Because scaling up the production of algae-based biofuels consumes a significant amount of water, it is important to consider the impact it has on water stress. This study evaluates the potential for algae-derived biofuel production in the United States (US) and considers regional water stress. We used the Biomass Assessment Tool (BAT) to identify potential sites in the US that meet land, biomass productivity, and CO2 co-locating criteria. We quantify the water stress impacts of algal biofuel production in terms of water scarcity footprint using water consumption from BAT, and the water stress indicator from Available Water Remaining for the US (AWARE-US) system. We assess long-term (20 billion gal per year [BGY]) and near-term (5 BGY by 2030) renewable diesel (RD) production targets. To select suitable algae sites, we consider biomass yield and water use with and without water stress constraints. We found that ranking sites based on biomass yield results in a high water stress impact (24.5 × 103 US equivalent BGY [BGYe]) for the long-term RD target. If we instead rank sites on water use efficiency, water consumption decreases on average by 62%, with an average reduction in biomass yield of 25%. To reconcile tradeoffs between biomass yield and water stress impacts, water stress indicator (AWARE-US) that represents relative water availability by region can be applied while considering biomass yield. This strategy removes sites located in water-stressed areas and keeps high-productivity sites. For the long-term RD target, this reduces water stress impacts by 55% (13.8 BGYe) without lowering yield or 97% (24.2 BGYe) with moderately lower (4%) yield, compared to the sites ranked by biomass yield alone. The results demonstrate that incorporating water stress into energy-scale algae biofuel production planning is key to achieving synergies between biofuel yield and fresh water stress impacts. © 2018

AB  - The effect of genetic markers and reference databases on analyses of fungal communities were estimated using fungal large subunit (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon datasets in consecutive years of rhizosphere samples from three candidate biofuel crops, corn (Zea mays), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus). These two marker genes were selected to contrast possible differences in biological conclusions. In addition, two ITS schemes based on two ITS reference databases were used to assess differences due to reference database composition. A taxonomy-supervised method was invoked using the Ribosomal Database Project naïve Bayesian classifier that accesses all three databases. The UNITE classification scheme had the highest number of classified taxa in the raw classification result; however, it also had the highest proportion of unknown taxa (sequences that were classified to “unclassified,” “unidentified,” incertae sedis or, in the case of Warcup, to matches containing two unique names). After removal of these unknown taxa, LSU had the highest classification rate followed by Warcup and UNITE. As expected, the communities resolved using the two ITS databases, based on the same sequences, were relatively more similar than those from the lower-coverage LSU classification scheme. The choice of marker gene or even the same reads with different classification databases revealed different community patterns due to database coverage, e.g., the relative abundance of the most abundant groups changed or were only detected in one or two of the classification schemes, such as for Mortierella, Fusarium, and Phoma. No marked difference in fungal beta-diversity was identified among the three methods. Differentiation between the three biofuel crops and between the drought and normal rainfall years was apparent, regardless of method. Though classification rates, taxonomic conflicts, and coverage differences within the high-abundance fungal groups varied according to classification scheme, there was no overall impact on beta diversity among the three methods. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Acid-hydrolysis residual (AHR) offers significant potential for harvesting chemical energy with simultaneous reduction of environmental pollution, providing carbon neutral (or even carbon negative) sustained energy production, energy security and alleviating social concerns associated with the wastes. In this study, the different effects of intrinsic and extrinsic K and Na were compared firstly. In addition, the effect of different content of alkali metal chlorides doped into AHR and temperature on pyrolysis products were investigated, especially for the phenolic products in bio-oil, along with the grey relational analysis. The results showed that KCl and NaCl promoted the generation of char and gas at the expense of the bio-oil yield. While, addition of KCl and NaCl could increase the yields of total phenolic species. Specifically, the yields of phenols and hydroxy phenols increased, while the guaiacols and syringols content decreased. The effect of KCl on the distribution of pyrolysis products and phenolic species was somewhat greater than NaCl, especially for bio-oil yield. The increasing of pyrolysis temperature would increase gas yield and reduce the char yield. While the bio-oil yield was peaked at 650 ℃. Besides, higher temperature restrained the generation of syringols and promoted the generation of phenols and hydroxy phenols. The grey relational analysis of KCl and temperature showed that KCl content was the major factor in the generation of bio-oil in pyrolysis process, while temperature played more notable role on the yields of total phenolic species, phenols, hydroxy phenols, guaiacols and syringols. The addition of alkali metal chlorides could promote the pyrolysis process and enhance the maximum lower heating value (LHV) of pyrolysis gas, especially the addition of NaCl. The optimal value of addition amount of KCl and NaCl was found to be 2 wt.% and 0.5 wt.%, respectively. Besides, the addition of KCl and NaCl could improve pore quality and activation of AHR pyrolysis char. Based on the pyrolysis products from cellulose, it can be proposed that cellulose has two main pathway depending on the alkali metal chlorides content. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growth of biomass-based markets for transport fuel is an expanding geographical process driven by regulation in the European Union (EU). Based on a certification scheme that illustrates the regulatory mechanisms in the EU's liquid biofuel market, this article explains how larger processes of territorialisation and uneven development interact with specific processes of commodity production and flexing in this expansion. The study combines a content analysis of certification standards with a spatio-temporal analysis of data from certificates distributed 2010–2017. It shows that certification standards mirror EU regulation and, importantly, how the activities of firms extend EU rule beyond its territory. It suggests that the regulatory mechanisms seem to promote vertical integration, encourage large-scale production via horizontal integration of several different industries, and exclude small-scale production. Hence, it argues that the EU-based territorialisation re-produces historical patterns of territorial accumulation of land-based resources, wherein agro-industrial economic clusters in the global North accumulate value by exploiting biomass producers in the global South. © 2018 The Author

AB  - This paper is an evidenced-based analysis of sustainability (based on carbon, energy, blue-water, labour and economic footprints) of crude palm oil (CPO) production in Pará Brazil. It includes cradle to gate value/supply chain-based life cycle analysis (LCA), a socio-economic analysis of small holder farmers in Para; and a discussion on how operational and supply chain management (SCM) methods can assist practical application of LCA results. The LCA consists of 4 stages: nursery; plantation management; harvesting and transport of fresh fruits; and, extraction of CPO. The analysis was based on direct data obtained between November 2014 and August 2015. The total carbon footprint (CFP) was 1.5 kgCO2eq /L CPO and the total energy footprint (EFP) was 5.1 MJ/L CPO. The life cycle based cost is US$ 0.7/L of CPO and the largest cost comes from harvesting and transport (45%). The study uncovered many sustainability hotspots. The carbon hotspots were: methane emissions from waste water at the Oil Extraction stage, and fertilizer use from the Plantation Management stage. Fertilizer use is a key hotspot in all 3 areas: carbon, energy and economic cost. Given the plantation is only 5 years old, high consumption of fertilizer is expected. However, reducing N-fertilizers will help lower all three footprints. A sensitivity analysis shows that if the direct N2O emission factor was doubled, the CFP value at plantation stage could go as high as 49%, and the total CFP value could increase by 18%. If fertilizers were produced using modern technology, the total CFP value could go down by 13%, while the value at the plantation would go down by 29%. For methane emissions, the use of modern technologies to capture biogas from waste water has potential to reduce emissions significantly. Biofuel use at the Extraction stage is a win–win outcome with regard to carbon emissions, energy use and economic cost. However, biofuel use causes significant local environmental pollution and human health risks such as dark smoke and particulate matter. The blue-water footprint was 6.8 per L of CPO. Reduction of water consumption by increasing water efficiency at the extraction mills is important, because water extraction by mills is a serious threat to the local river basin. As a fraction of the total number of employees in the entire system, the highest labour use (68%) is at the Plantation Management stage. The analysis of smallholder farmers raises questions about the popular justification of palm oil plantations as a provider of rural employer and argues that indicators like community welfare and income inequality must be evaluated, because the extent to which the industry will enhance sustainable development depend on the way they combine with local communities, directly and indirectly. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of different N fertilizer application methods on N2O and CH4 emissions and on sugarcane biomass yields over two successive growing seasons. Treatments included three methods of N fertilizer (120 kg ha−1 N) application: 1) above the straw layer; 2) below the straw layer; 3) incorporated into the soil (at 0.1-m soil depth) below the straw layer; and 4) no N application (control). Sugarcane yield for the above straw treatment was, on average, 12% and 15% lower than below the straw and incorporated into the soil, respectively. Emissions of CH4 were very low and unaffected by N fertilizer placement. The method and timing of N application influenced N2O emissions. For both years, higher N2O emissions were observed from the above straw, followed by below straw and incorporated treatments. Except for the above straw treatment during the wet season, the N2O emission factors ranged from 0.08 to 0.62 and were lower than the IPCC default value (1%). The intensity of N2O emissions was, on average, 7.45, 3.97 and 3.3 kg CO2eq Mg stalk−1 for N applied above straw, below straw and incorporated into the soil, respectively. Changes in the N fertilizer placement method and on the timing of application can significantly reduce GHG emissions during sugarcane production, making a significant contribution toward a cleaner production of sugarcane ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) an important non-edible oilseed crop, is a prominent feed stock towards the generation of renewable materials for industrial production which has multiple applications ranging from cosmetics to biofuels industry. India accounts for 76% of the total world production of castor oil seed. However, major concern for developing countries like India where expanding economy led to rapid increases in gases like NOx, CO and VOCs photochemically form ozone. Ozone is strong oxidant that damages agriculture, ecosystems, and materials with considerable reduction in crop yields and crop quality. One way to reduce ozone induced loss is to focus on the adapting crops to ozone exposure by selecting cultivars with demonstrated ozone resistance. An experiment was conducted for ozone risk assessment of castor cultivars to select cultivar with demonstrated resistance against ozone pollution. This study comprise an open top chamber experiment with three treatments viz. (i) control (ambient ozone concentration), (ii) enhanced ozone (average 75 ppb for 4 h daily throughout the growing season), and (iii) EDU application. Results suggested that the ozone pollution substantially affected growth and physiology of castor cultivars. Crop biomass and yield was also negatively influenced by ozone pollution. Developed defence provided strength to withstand against ozone pollution to the experimental crop cultivars. However, developed defence is cultivar specific and positively correlated with the resistance against ozone pollution. Study concluded that the damage to ozone is directly dependent on the antioxidative potential of plant species. However, ozone adaptability is based on the genetic makeup of the cultivar and yield related loss to ozone can be minimizing by selecting ozone tolerant variety as seen in cultivar Nidhi-999. Tropospheric ozone is detrimental for crop yield and yield related loss to ozone can be minimize by selecting ozone tolerant variety. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial lipids have potential applications in energy, and food industry, because most of those lipids are triacylglycerol with long-chain fatty-acids that are comparable to conventional vegetable oils and can be obtained without arable land requirement. Rhodosporidium toruloides is a strictly aerobic strain, where oxygen plays a crucial role in growth, maintenance, and metabolite production, such as lipids and carotenoids. Dissolved oxygen concentration is one of the major factors affecting yeast physiological and biochemical characteristics. In this context, different approaches have been developed to increase available oxygen by the increasing the aeration and the addition of an oxygen-vector. The growth of R. toruloides in 2-L mechanical stirred tank reactor equipped with 1 or 2 porous spargers and a 70 C/N ratio, revealed a lipid content of 0.47 and 0.52 g/g and a lipidic productivity of 0.16 and 0.17 g/L day, respectively. The oxygen-vector addition, increased the lipidic productivity for 0.20 g/L day and a lipid contend of 0.51 g of lipids/g of biomass. The combined approach, combining high aeration (AA), and 1% of n-dodecane addition (DA), produced a significant improvement in the lipid accumulation (62%, w/w), when compared with the DA (51%, w/w) and the AA (52%, w/w) approaches. The increasing of lipids accumulation and smaller culture time are key factors for the success of scale-up and profitability of a bioprocess. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study presents an extensive systems-level multi-pathway sustainability assessment of algae biofuel production that demonstrates the necessity of high-value co-products, examines the impact of public policy scenarios, and identifies improvements and pathway directions required for economic viability. Engineering process models for several fuel and co-product pathways were leveraged to perform high fidelity techno-economic analysis. These pathways included: baseline hydrothermal liquefaction; protein extraction followed by hydrothermal liquefaction; fractionation into high-value chemicals with fermentation followed by hydrothermal liquefaction for fuels; and a small-scale first-of-a-kind plant coupled with a wastewater treatment facility. From these models, it was shown that hydrothermal liquefaction as a fuel-only pathway is not economically viable. Likewise, the benefits of coupling with wastewater water treatment are insignificant compared to the impact of reduced facility size resulting in increased capital costs. These models were also used to examine public policy scenarios, uniquely presenting their impact on the breakeven cost of fuel production and sensitivity to scenario assumptions. Specifically, depreciation type was shown to be irrelevant for writeoffs faster than 10 years. Due to discounting, short-term subsidies were found to capture 50% of the subsidy value in 6 years with an additional 24 years required for full subsidy valuation. Integration of a carbon economy was shown to decrease biofuel production costs, particularly for the protein pathway due to the co-product accounting. Finally, a metric of normalized costs was used to compare algal biorefineries to corn and cellulosic ethanol production, showing that algal systems are uniquely different due to significantly higher capital costs, though operational costs are comparable. This work demonstrates that, to reach economic viability, algal biofuel production must either utilize higher value non-fuel co-products or achieve drastic reductions in capital costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Average diets in the European Union are not in line with the dietary recommendations of the World Health Organization. Too little plant-based and too much livestock-based food is consumed. Livestock production requires substantial resources and causes considerable greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), especially methane from enteric fermentation in ruminant animals. The livestock sector produces 18% of GHGE worldwide and uses 52% of the crops supplied in dry matter within the EU. Most livestock species are relatively poor feed converters. They require multiple units of feed to produce a unit of meat, milk, or eggs. The EU-average for this food conversion ratio ranges from 1.1 for milk to 34.2 for lamb meat on a dry-matter basis (Wilkinson, 2011). In addition to the impacts on the ecosystem, excess consumption of meat is also associated with substantial health risks. Large parts of the agricultural production capacity are used for a product that leads to high GHGE and even health risks, when consumed at current levels. This work therefore attempts to quantify the technical potential to repurpose feed crops for biofuel production, if healthy, low-meat diets were adopted. The reduction of agricultural GHGE and additional GHG mitigation from using the biofuels are examined as well. The analysis is performed with a modified version of the EUFASOM model. Trade volumes between EU and non-EU regions are fixed at observed levels to assess intra-EU potentials. Consumer preferences are considered in the examined diets. Average supply and demand quantities from 2007 to 2011 serve as the reference. If healthy diets were adopted and meat intake halved from about 200 to 100 g per day and capita, biofuel production could be increased 7.7 fold. With this, 16.1% of all the EU's fossil transport fuels could be displaced. Agricultural GHGE could be reduced by 24% and 14% of GHGE in the EU's transport sector could be additionally mitigated through the increased biofuel production. The adoption of healthy diets with reduced meat consumption can hence lead to large potentials for GHG mitigation in the EU. This holds however only if lower consumption of livestock products is mirrored by lower production as well. Mitigating GHGE by reducing livestock and displacing fossil fuels, is the “double dividend” of lower meat consumption. Furthermore, no innovations or high investments are needed, and substantial health costs can be saved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The co-digestion of pretreated sugarcane lignocelluloses with dairy cow manure (DCM) as a bioenergy production and waste management strategy, for intensive livestock farms located in sugarcane regions, was investigated. Ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) increased the nitrogen content and accelerated the biodegradability of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and cane leaf matter (CLM) through the cleavage of lignin carbohydrate crosslinks, resulting in the highest specific methane yields (292–299 L CH4/kg VSadded), biogas methane content (57–59% v/v) and biodegradation rates, with or without co-digestion with DCM. To obtain comparable methane yields, untreated and steam exploded (StEx) SCB and CLM had to be co-digested with DCM, at mass ratios providing initial C/N ratios in the range of 18 to 35. Co-digestion with DCM improved the nutrient content of the solid digestates, providing digestates that could be used as biofertilizer to replace CLM that is removed from sugarcane fields during green harvesting. © 2018

AB  - Bioenergy cropping systems have the potential to supply plant biomass as lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels and bioproducts that will reduce reliance on fossil energy. Identifying the effects of alternative bioenergy cropping systems on soil carbon (C) is necessary to assess the sustainability of renewable fuels. We measured the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools to four bioenergy cropping systems using soils collected at the establishment of the field trials and after five years in two soils of contrasting texture: a fine-textured silt loam (Mollisol) in south central Wisconsin and a coarse-textured sandy loam (Alfisol) in southwestern Michigan, USA. Crop management followed region-specific practices with no till with the intention of reducing soil C losses from cultivation. Cropping systems included an annual monoculture (continuous corn), two perennial monocultures (switchgrass and hybrid poplar), and a perennial polyculture (restored native prairie). Using a 365-d laboratory soil incubation and a three-pool model, we estimated sizes and turnover times of SOC in surface (0–10 cm) and deeper soils (25–50 cm). After five years, all soils had less bioavailable C as measured by microbial respiration. To determine potential differences in soil C turnover under annual and perennial monocultures, we measured radiocarbon abundance (14C) of bulk soils and respired CO2 under corn and switchgrass. Respired-CO2 was more depleted in 14C over time, indicating preferential respiration of relatively “old C” after five years. Decreased microbial respiration rates after five years of bioenergy cropping systems offer the potential for the eventual reduction of soil C losses after conversion to no till. However, the 14C-CO2 data suggest that previously-protected C pools may become depleted over time, especially with continued removal of plant inputs. Results show that conversion of conventional field-crop agriculture to bioenergy cropping systems may not provide belowground C benefits in the short term, as indicated by reductions in the size of the active pool. Reduced total soil respiration over the length of the study, as well as system-specific differences in soil respiration (monoculture annuals &lt; monoculture perennial &lt; polyculture perennials), suggest C loss may decline in perennial polyculture systems as they age. SOM pools responded differently to bioenergy crop management on soils with contrasting texture, highlighting the importance of geography in predicting belowground consequences of intensified agricultural production. © 2018

AB  - Promoting biofuel to replace fossil fuels and alternative utilization schemes to replace conventional measures of biomass waste disposal have been considered a priority to mitigate CO2 emissions. Despite fewer land resources and higher reliance on imported energy and raw material resources, the potential for bioenergy supply in a place like Taiwan should be fully investigated. This paper presents a case study regarding the utilization of waste biomass derived from an enhanced production of rice paddy and from the forest sector in Taiwan for biofuel production. In this study, the carbon balance for the two aforementioned bioenergy production scenarios was calculated. The amount of biomass waste expected to be derived from rice husk and rice straw produced from currently planted paddy and from reactivated fallow rice paddy was estimated. Forest sector wastes consist of biomass derived from processing domestically harvested and post-consumer harvested wood products. The projection was made up to 2065. The overall annual bioenergy providing potential of the biomass, estimated by this study, to replace gasoline through bioethanol production and residual combustion and to substitute coal for power generation via combustion were approximately 222.37 PJ and 206.77 PJ, respectively. These values represent 332.56% and 323.24% of the current level of bioenergy supplies, compared to the 76.4 PJ from biomass and waste incineration in 2016. This is the first time the bioenergy potential of post-consumer harvested wood products is being identified. © 2018

AB  - Improving soil fertility is a critical component of abandoned rare-earth mine land (ARL) revegetation. To study the effects of sewage sludge (SS), earthworms, and Jatropha curcas in ARL revegetation, SS (40% in mass ratio) and earthworms (0, 40, 60, and 80 individual adult Eisenia fetida kg−1) were applied to abandoned rare-earth mine land soil (ARLS) and then J. curcas was grown in a potting experiment. The organic carbon, nutrients (N, P, K) and heavy metals (HMs; Cd, Cu, Zn) contents in ARLS and the biomass and nutrients uptake in J. curcas were significantly increased by SS amendment. Application of 80 individual E. fetida kg−1 significantly increased availability of P and K in SS-amended ARLS relative to other treatments. Earthworms increased the height, ground diameter and biomass of J. curcas, but the promotion of biomass became weaker as earthworm density increased. After J. curcas harvest, the contents of Cd, Cu and Zn in SS-amended ARLS were reduced by 15%, 23%, and 19%, respectively. With the joint application of J. curcas and earthworms, a much larger decrease in contents of Cd (34–40%), Cu (31–44%) and Zn (24–29%) in SS-amended ARLS were observed, and the HMs ecological risks were reduced from “moderate potential” to “low potential”. Moreover, J. curcas and earthworms together exerted more reduction in the exchangeable fraction HMs in SS-amended ARLS than J. curcas alone. Our results suggest that the integrated application of SS, earthworms and J. curcas is an effective approach for ARL revegetation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We evaluate the potential economic availability of willow (Salix spp.) short-rotation woody crops in the Northeast USA. Based on results from a 20-year agronomic simulation, the Northeast USA could potentially provide between 2.1 and 9.7 million dry Mg year−1, depending on farmgate price and competition with other energy crops. In a diversified biomass energy-crop scenario, willow outperforms other lignocellulosic energy crops in planted area and production at 91% of supply and 83% of planted area in a low-price scenario in the Northeast USA. In a high-price scenario, willow also outperforms competing energy crops at 47% of production and 51% of planted area. In contrast with the rest of the USA, willow comprises the greatest portion of energy crop potential in the Northeast. These results suggest that willow has an agronomic comparative advantage in this region as compared to herbaceous energy crops, with great potential to increase production given adequate market prices. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Biofuel derived from microalgae have several advantages over other oleaginous crops, however, still needs to be improved with its cost aspect and can be achieved by developing of a strain with improved lipid productivity. In this study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was incorporated to carry out a target-specific knockout of the phospholipase A2 gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The targeted gene encodes a key enzyme in the Lands cycle. As a result, the mutants showed a characteristic of increased diacylglycerol pool, followed by a higher accumulation of triacylglycerol without being significantly compensated with the cell growth. As a result, the overall lipid productivities of phospholipase A2 knockout mutants have increased by up to 64.25% (to 80.92 g L−1 d−1). This study can provide crucial information for the biodiesel industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Integrating conservation practices with bioenergy has been recommended as a promising strategy to improve bioeconomy and water quality but the literature on the economics of this strategy is limited. This study evaluated the value proposition of reducing nutrient loss from cropland by implementing switchgrass riparian buffers in the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB). Nutrient loss was simulated by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The value proposition of nutrient abatement was quantified by estimating (1) value of trapped nutrients as fertilizer and (2) potential net returns of harvesting switchgrass as bioenergy feedstock at different farm-gate prices. Results suggest that switchgrass buffers may reduce mean annual total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads from cropland in the LMRB by 23% and 31%, respectively. The value of trapped nutrients is considerable (mean = $69 ha−1 year−1) but far less than the cost of implementing a switchgrass buffer (mean = $163 ha−1 year−1). At biomass prices of $20, $40, $60, and $80 per dry-ton, mean net returns of switchgrass buffers (without considering land-use change from cropland to buffers) were estimated to be around −$66, $199, $463, and $727 ha−1 year−1, respectively. Total net returns for the LMRB may be reduced by 20% if switchgrass is grown without the addition of commercial fertilizer. The results highlight the potential of switchgrass buffers for improving water sustainability of both agricultural and bioenergy production. The value proposition of switchgrass buffers is nevertheless sensitive to future feedstock price. The impact of fertilizer prices change and forgone income on benefit analysis is also presented. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - In this work, energy analysis is carried out to account for inputs and outputs of energy and GHG emissions associated with the biodiesel production system. Jojoba oil is obtained by cultivation of the jojoba plant, harvesting of seeds followed by extraction of oil, which is then converted to biodiesel by the process of transesterification. Energy efficiency is expressed in terms of the net energy balance (NEB) and the net energy ratio (NER). The use of the byproducts (husk, cake or meal, waste residues and glycerin) are also included as a part of the system boundary. The results show that the NEB and NER values are calculated at 46724.1 MJ/ha (28.9 MJ/L biodiesel produced) and 2.16, respectively. At the same time, the total amount of GHG emissions are estimated at 2.28 kg-CO2eq/L biodiesel produced (66.0 g CO2eq/MJ biodiesel produced). Nevertheless, if manure is used as fertilizer for jojoba plant cultivation, the primary energy input will fall by 9.52% (to 22.49 MJ/L of biodiesel). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microalgae are among the most promising options for renewable fuel production in the future. Translating high laboratory yields to outdoor productivity has been a major challenge. Outdoor sunlight intensity is much greater than the saturation light intensities of algae. An open outdoor growth system design has been developed based on systematic distribution of sunlight to improve the productivity. RESULTS: The first stage of the light-distribution design (1800 L) yielded 1.5–2.0 times better productivity than a standard open system, and the next stage (630 L) yielded 2–3 times better productivity. Productivities up to 36–42 g m−2 day−1 were obtained in a region where the climatic conditions are mostly adverse for algal growth. Comparison with other similar climatic conditions validated the performance improvement of the growth system over a wide range. Light distribution profiles illustrated the distribution patterns and gave cues for further improvement. Cost comparison of light distribution against the additional land and infrastructure indicates promising reductions. CONCLUSION: The performance improvement shown by the designed growth system is significant and shows good potential for advancement of outdoor algal production for biofuels and related products. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - In the last decades, the use of biofuels as a mitigation measure for carbon emissions has led to land use and land cover changes in southeastern Brazil, especially in Paulista Peripheral Depression – Paraná Sedimentary Basin. Considering the human-landscape system associated with energy policy, these changes can affect landscape and natural resources over a range of temporal and special scales. Thus, the aim of study was on how human-landscape interactions have influenced the geomorphological dynamics in a São Paulo region that contains sugar cane crops associated with soils derived from sandstones and mudstones. The use of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in three different scenarios from land use changes allowed verifying how they have affected soil loss: natural conditions (savannah), current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops. In addition, the total sediment transported, the sediment delivery ratio and the rate of soil removal were measured, considering the current land use. The land use scenarios pointed out that the land use change is directly related to increasing rates of soil loss, i.e. 0.03, 3.5 and 12.6 t ha−1 yr−1 for the natural conditions, current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops, respectively. These rates in the current land use and with continuous expansion of sugar cane crops are higher than the tolerable erosion limits in 17 and 57% of the study area, respectively. The suspended sediment concentration increases with increasing Cachoeirinha Stream discharge, with a specific daily flux of 88 kg km−2 day−1. The mean monthly flux in 2014 was 32 t month−1, with varying from 3.1 (August) to 144 (January) t month−1. The wet period was responsible for ca. 90% (436 t) of the total solids transported in 2014. The sediment delivery ratio was 9% of the total soil loss. The current rate of soil removal of 25.8 m Myr−1 is almost 3-fold higher than the long-term denudation rates suggested for the Peripheral Depression (9 m Myr−1). With the continuous expansion of sugar cane crops, the rate of soil removal probably will be higher than that obtained in the current scenario and, consequently, the current denudation rates should increase further. Thus, this study reinforce that the human-landscape systems in São Paulo State associated with energy policy are complex and increase the natural processes of soil removal and, consequently, affect the landscape evolution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic ethanol represents a renewable alternative to petrol. Miscanthus, a perennial plant that grows on marginal land, is characterized by efficient use of resources and is considered a promising source of lignocellulosic biomass. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to determine the environmental impacts of ethanol production from miscanthus grown on marginal land in Great Britain (Aberystwyth) and an average-yield site in Germany (Stuttgart; functional unit: 1 GJ). As the conversion process has substantial influence on the overall environmental performance, the comparison examined three pretreatment options for miscanthus. Overall, results indicate lower impacts for the production in Stuttgart in comparison with the corresponding pathways in Aberystwyth across the analysed categories. Disparities between the sites were mainly attributed to differences in biomass yield. When comparing the conversion options, liquid hot water treatment resulted in the lowest impacts, followed by dilute sulphuric acid. Dilute sodium hydroxide pretreatment represented the least favourable option. Site-dependent variation in biomass composition and degradability did not have substantial influence on the environmental performance of the analysed pathways. Additionally, implications of replacing petrol with miscanthus ethanol were examined. Ethanol derived from miscanthus resulted in lower impacts with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, fossil resource depletion, natural land transformation and ozone depletion. However, for other categories, including toxicity, eutrophication and agricultural land occupation, net scores were substantially higher than for the fossil reference. Nevertheless, the results indicate that miscanthus ethanol produced via dilute acid and liquid hot water treatment at the site in Stuttgart has the potential to comply with the requirements of the European Renewable energy directive for greenhouse gas emission reduction. For ethanol production at the marginal site, carbon sequestration needs to be considered in order to meet the requirements for greenhouse gas mitigation. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - We investigate intrinsic correlations between Brazilian energy (ethanol) and food market (sugar) by applying recently introduced method Detrended partial cross correlation analysis (DPCCA) on returns and volatility series of sugar, ethanol and crude oil prices. The results show that intrinsic cross-correlations between ethanol and sugar are positive and increase with time scale for both returns and volatility, indicating that the diversion of sugar cane for biofuel production (due to the variations in ethanol prices), affects more sugar prices than the price movements in external energy market. Ethanol/oil volatility series and sugar/oil return series do not show correlations for small scales, while at larger scales intrinsic correlations become negative. The intrinsic correlations in oil/ethanol return series and oil/sugar volatility series show similar behavior as corresponding ethanol/sugar series, indicating the existence of strong correlations between sugar and ethanol price variations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study demonstrates innovative and industrially viable in-situ biodiesel production process using coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Reactive extraction process has been carried out by mixing grinded castor seeds with methanol in the presence of base catalyst (KOH). Response surface methodology coupled with central composite design has been applied for process optimization to achieve maximum yield. The result shows that maximum biodiesel yield of 93.5 ± 0.76% was obtained under favorable conditions of: molar ratio (350:1), catalyst (w/w) (1.74%), reaction temperature (43 °C) and reaction time (30 min). Regression equation obtained for the model having (R2), and (R2 adj) equal to 0.9737 and 0.9507 respectively shows goodness of fit. First time reaction kinetics as well as oil extraction kinetics studies have been performed on coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Assuming pseudo first order reaction activation energy was found to be 28.27 kJ·mol−1 and activation energy for oil extraction was observed to be 9.11 kJ mol−1. Estimated activation energy for the reaction kinetics and extraction kinetics was reduced by 27%, reaction rate constants were eight to ten times higher and diffusion coefficient was found to be two times higher in case of hybrid system as compared to conventional mechanical stirring technique. Estimated thermo-physical properties of biodiesel were found in agreement with ASTM and DIN standards in comparison to gasoline diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural professionals play an important role in informing and educating farmers about biofuel through teaching or extension work. One of the questions commonly asked is if they are knowledgeable and possess positive attitude towards renewable energy sources. The aim of this article is to investigate Agricultural professionals' attitude and willingness towards biofuel using a random sample of professionals (n = 180) in a survey conducted in Zanjan province in Iran. Structural equation modeling showed that “Outcome efficacy”, “problem perception” and “perceived benefits” can significantly predict just about 38% variance of Agricultural professionals' personal norm. In turn, personal norm can predict 35% variance of Agricultural professionals' willingness. The findings yield public policy recommendations for stimulating biofuel extension and deployment among Agricultural professionals. © 2018

AB  - A Jatropha-biofuel chain was organized in the north-west of Cameroon. The aim of the project was to implement an integrated biofuel chain, based on nontoxic Jatropha cultivation, which could provide vegetable oil for energy use instead of fossil fuel and, contemporary supply cake protein for the rural population. The main objective of this study was to quantify the cumulative energy demand (CED) and global warming potential (GHG) in obtaining Jatropha vegetable oil (JVO) as biofuel in comparison with conventional diesel fuel adopting the Life Cycle Analysis method (ISO 14040, ISO 14044). Adopting both Well-to-Wheel or Well-to-Tank value of diesel fossil fuel as reference, a significant reduction in energy required and greenhouse gas emissions would be obtained by JVO utilization with respect to the fossil fuel. The utilization of a nontoxic Jatropha curcas accession is very positive, as it ensures greater protection of human health with respect to the toxic accessions. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 305–314, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can cause severe global climatic changes, which may include an increase in the global temperature, rise of the sea level, increase in wildfire, floods, and storms, in addition to changes in the amount of rain and snow. The global mitigation strategies that can be envisioned to reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere include retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient systems, increasing the dependency on renewable energy sources in lieu of fossil fuels, increasing the use of sustainable transportation systems that rely on electricity and biofuels, and adopting globally more sustainable uses of land and forests. To reduce global climatic changes, the excess amount of carbon dioxide in the environment needs to be captured and stored in deep underground sedimentary reservoirs. The sedimentary reservoirs that contain water in the rock matrix provide a more secure CO 2 sequestration medium. The injection of carbon dioxide causes a huge increase in the reservoir pore pressure and provokes the subsequent ground uplift. The excessive increase in pore pressure may also cause leakage of carbon dioxide into the potable water layers and to the atmosphere, thus leading to severe global climatic changes. In order to maintain the integrity of the sequestration process, it is crucial to inject a safe quantity of carbon dioxide into the sequestration site. Accordingly, the injection period and the safe values of injection parameters, like flow rate and injection pressure, need to be calculated a priori to ensure that the stored carbon dioxide will not leak into the atmosphere and jeopardize the climate mitigation strategy. To model carbon dioxide injection in reservoirs having a base fluid, such as water, one has to perform a two-phase flow modeling for both the injected and base fluids. In the present investigation, carbon dioxide is injected into Biyadh reservoir, wherein the two-phase flow through the reservoir structure is taken into account. This investigation aims to estimate the safe parameter values for carbon dioxide injection into the Biyadh reservoir, in order to avoid leakage of carbon dioxide through the caprock. In this context, the two cases of a fractured and non-fractured caprock are considered. To ensure a safe sequestration mechanism, the coupled reservoir stability analysis is performed to estimate the safe values of the injection parameters, thus furnishing data for a reliable global climate change mitigation strategy. The obtained results demonstrated that the injection of carbon dioxide has caused a maximum pore pressure increase of 25 MPa and a ground uplift of 35 mm. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Driven by biofuel policies, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase domestic energy supply, global production and consumption of bioethanol have doubled between 2007 and 2016, with rapid growth in corn-based bioethanol in the U.S. and sugar cane-based bioethanol in Brazil. Advances in crop yields, energy use efficiency in fertilizer production, biomass-to-ethanol conversion rates, and energy efficiency in ethanol production have improved the energy balance and GHG emission reduction potential of bioethanol. In the current study, the water, energy, and carbon footprints of bioethanol from corn in the U.S. and sugar cane in Brazil were assessed. The results show that U.S. corn bioethanol has a smaller water footprint (541 L water/L bioethanol) than Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol (1115 L water/L bioethanol). Brazilian sugar cane bioethanol has, however, a better energy balance (17.7 MJ/L bioethanol) and smaller carbon footprint (38.5 g CO2e/MJ) than U.S. bioethanol, which has an energy balance of 11.2 MJ/L bioethanol and carbon footprint of 44.9 g CO2e/MJ. The results show regional differences in the three footprints and highlight the need to take these differences into consideration to understand the implications of biofuel production for local water resources, net energy production, and climate change mitigation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study reports on a comparative analysis of the influence of linseed oil-derived biodiesel on a compression ignition engine combustion and performance. New findings on particle emission and size distribution are presented and discussed. A low-sulfur commercial diesel fuel and soybean biodiesel were used as a reference. Engine feeding with biodiesel blends leads to slight increase (5–15%) in the maximal pressure rise rate compared to the diesel fuel accompanied by a minor rise in coefficient of variation at low loads. Combustion duration of all studied biodiesel blends is longer compared to the diesel fuel under all operating modes. At low-load operating modes, reduction in particle number concentrations under feeding with blends of the diesel fuel with soybean and linseed-derived biofuels (in 1:1 ratio by volume) is observed in the entire range of measured particle sizes. At high loads, the opposite trend is revealed: in the ultrafine particles size range (<90 nm), the measured particle number concentration for the biodiesel blends is substantially higher compared to diesel fuel. In contrast to soybean biodiesel, the linseed-derived blends demonstrated a trend of reduction in nitrogen oxides emission as compared to diesel at higher engine loads. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - During the last decades, the use of biomass has increased considerably for the production of chemicals, biofuels, and direct bioenergy, among others. However, the use of first and second-generation biomass has been raising concerns about the possibilities of threatening food security and to compete for the use of productive land. Biomass is a versatile feedstock based on different compounds with the potential to obtain a considerable spectrum of products. However, it is still necessary to look for cheap raw materials that might have high availability and with the potential for obtaining added-value products without risking food security and decreasing the environmental impact. Cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) is a plant grown extensively in tropical regions and mainly used as a source of starch and animal feed. It consists of three parts: leaves, which have a high protein and fiber content; stem, composed of lignocellulose; and a corm, with a starch content similar to that of cassava and potatoes. Nigeria, China and Ghana produce around 1.3, 1.18 and 0.9 million tonnes/year, respectively. In Colombia, they are not technified crops, but it is used mainly as animal feed. Cocoyam use is generally limited to the leaves, discarding the other parts. Based on the potential use of these discarded parts, this work proposed a biorefinery using cocoyam as feedstock to obtain different products: a feed (animal consumption), a biofuel (ethanol), a bioproduct used as food preservative (lactic acid) and food for direct human consumption (starch). The assessment of the potential of the biorefinery included an experimental stage to obtain the products, a simulation stage of techno-economic and environmental assessment and an analysis of the scale to determine minimum processing scale of feedstock at which the biorefinery is economically feasible. The obtained results showed that exploiting the compositional diversity of an unused raw material, it is possible to efficiently produce chemicals, food, feed and biofuels under a biorefinery scheme. The obtained yields for the feed additive, ethanol, lactic acid and starch were 0.147, 0.062, 0.110 and 0.192 kg/kg of feedstock, respectively. Starch, lactic acid and the feed additive are the products that have a higher contribution to the incomes of the process. The minimum processing scale for economic feasibility of the biorefinery was 880 ton/day, which is in the order of commercial scale production plants. The proposed process integrally uses a raw material and does not threaten food security. © 2018

AB  - The interesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) and ethyl acetate (ETA) are investigated in homogeneous catalyst system using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). Later on, the subsequent biofuel has been investigated for the combustion characteristics, gaseous and particulate matter related emissions in a single-cylinder agricultural diesel engine. In the reaction, fatty acid ethyl esters were the main product whereas triacetin by-product was formulated in a single phase biofuel. The parameters affected the free fatty acid (FFA) conversion were studied such as catalyst system, molar ratio of ETA:WCO, molar ratio of catalyst:WCO, reaction time, and temperature. The experimental results revealed that NaOH was more favorable than the acid catalyst counterpart. The 92% biofuel yield was reached from the optimization at the NaOH:WCO of 0.015:1 M ratio and the ETA:WCO of 30:1 M ratio at 80 °C in 3 h. In the engine validation at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, 1700 rpm speed, the results from the combustion analysis using an indicating system reveal that the WCO biofuel initiates the combustion faster with pronounce premixed combustion regime than that of diesel fuel. The specific fuel consumption of WCO biofuel was greater, leading to a slight reduction in brake thermal efficiency by 4% and 10% at 3.4 and 6.6 bar IMEP loads, respectively compared with diesel fuel. The nano-particle emissions was characterized by an electrical mobility spectrometer and analyzed in terms of particle number. The total particle number increased with smaller size when fueling with WCO biofuel. In comparison over the loads tested, the total particle number concentrations were in the ranges of 8.1 × 1011 to 1.1 × 1012 m−3 for WCO biofuel and 4.8 × 1011 to 5.7 × 1011 m−3 for diesel fuel. Meanwhile, the particle sizes were in the ranges of 182–251 nm for WCO biofuel and 279–402 nm for diesel fuel. Summarily, for the biofuel production, this homogeneous process is beneficial in terms of low-cost feedstock, glycerol-free and mild reaction condition. © 2018

AB  - Agricultural biogas facilities are usually combined with animal husbandry. Their siting near residential areas can lead to odour complaints by residents. The aim of this study was to identify relevant odour sources, to record odour impact, and to determine the main variables influencing odour impact. Therefore, a combined approach was designed to account for individual odour sources as well as the farms as a whole. On eight farms with cattle husbandry and biogas facilities, two of which kept pigs and poultry, the odour-relevant area sources ranged between 475 and 1810 m2. Solid manure from poultry, cattle and horses as well as grass cuttings, vegetable peelings, liquid-silage effluent and fermentation residues figured among the odour-intensive sources, in addition to biogas. Odour-plume inspections were performed at various distances from the farm, and assessors determined their odour perception and -intensities. The odour intensity in the downwind plume axis was explainable in a linear mixed-effects model by distance (p &lt; 0.001), emitting surface area (p = 0.002) and wind speed (p = 0.018). As distance increased, odour intensity decreased by a factor of two per 50 m. Higher odour intensities resulted from larger surface areas in the animal enclosure, substrate storage, or especially odour-relevant sources. A mixture of odours was frequently perceived in the odour plume. If biogas escaped, an increase in odour impact was recognisable (p = 0.021). Biogas leakage should be avoided with a sufficiently large storage capacity, process optimisation, and regular servicing. In summary, animal husbandry and biogas facilities are to be viewed as an entire plant in terms of downwind odour perception. In planning processes for biogas facilities with animal husbandry, great care in the choice of site is called for, as are structural-technical and organisational measures for abatement. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A recent development in the representation of aerosols in climate models is the realization that some components of organic aerosol (OA), emitted from biomass and biofuel burning, can have a significant contribution to shortwave radiation absorption in the atmosphere. The absorbing fraction of OA is referred to as brown carbon (BrC). This study introduces one of the first implementations of BrC into the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), using a parameterization for BrC absorptivity described in Saleh et al. (2014). Nine-year experiments are run (2003-2011) with prescribed emissions and sea surface temperatures to analyze the effect of BrC in the atmosphere. Model validation is conducted via model comparison to single-scatter albedo and aerosol optical depth from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This comparison reveals a model underestimation of single scattering albedo (SSA) in biomass burning regions for both default and BrC model runs, while a comparison between AERONET and the model absorption Ångström exponent shows a marked improvement with BrC implementation. Global annual average radiative effects are calculated due to aerosol-radiation interaction (REari; 0:13±0:01Wm -2 ) and aerosol-cloud interaction (REaci; 0:01±0:04Wm -2 ). REari is similar to other studies' estimations of BrC direct radiative effect, while REaci indicates a global reduction in low clouds due to the BrC semidirect effect. The mechanisms for these physical changes are investigated and found to correspond with changes in global circulation patterns. Comparisons of BrC implementation approaches find that this implementation predicts a lower BrC REari in the Arctic regions than previous studies with CAM5. Implementation of BrC bleaching effect shows a significant reduction in REari (0:06±0:008Wm -2 ). Also, variations in OA density can lead to differences in REari and REaci, indicating the importance of specifying this property when estimating the BrC radiative effects and when comparing similar studies. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The world today is facing challenging crises like depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Biofuels can be an alternative solution to fossil fuels. Iran hosts a variety of weather conditions and its soil can grow different types of plants suitable for production of liquid biofuels. In this regard, the present research is an in-depth attempt to explore the potentials of Khuzestan Province as an agriculture hub of Iran to produce liquid biofuels. The studied biodiesel sources included oilseeds, animal fats and fish wastes, and the sources of bioethanol were wheat, sugarcane, sugar beet, rice, barley, maize, alfalfa, potato, grapes, apple, date and other local citrus fruits including orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon, sour lemon and sour orange. Results showed that the province's production potential was 1.04 Gl of bioethanol. A 5% addition of ethanol to gasoline (i.e. E5) can save 63.5 Ml of gasoline throughout the province. The estimated biodiesel production from animal fat- and oil-containing products and fish wastes is about 56 Ml in this province that can supply 2% of its total diesel fuel requirement. The estimated fat-based biodiesel production of Iran is 332.56 million liters. By adding the biodiesel production from oilseeds, Iran can produce 1.27 Gl of biodiesel fuel. This amount can supply 4.2% of the country's total diesel fuel consumption. The results for bioethanol and biodiesel production show promising alternatives. As a result of sound management of agricultural residues, E5 (5% ethanol, 95% gasoline) for SI engines and B2 (2% biodiesel and 98% diesel fuel) for diesel engines can be commercially produced as they impose no modifications to these engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 2016, the global environmental impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionswas 49.3 gigatons CO2 equivalent. Worldwide, the transportation sector is responsible for 14% of GHG. Electric vehicles (EV) powered by less-polluting energy sources are one way to reduce the environmental impact of the transportation sector, but immediate transportation demands cannot be met by existing EV technology. Use of less polluting biofuel in place of petroleum-based gasoline or diesel fuel to power the existing transportation fleet is a widely accepted transitional solution, including in the Republic of Korea. The purpose of this research is to investigate approaches to biofuels in the US and the UK in order to evaluate Korea's current energy policies related to use of biofuels and to make recommendations for strengthening Korea's energy policy. This article addresses only policies for use of biodiesel rather than ethanol (widely used in the US) because ethanol is not used in Korea. This research shows that Korea calculates GHG using the principle that biofuel is carbon neutral, but energy policies in the US and the UK treat biofuel as not entirely carbon neutral. Korea should examine how to calculate GHG from biodiesel according to the standard set by the UK in order to work toward a more environmentally sustainable energy policy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study spatially estimated degraded lands in Indonesia that have limited functions for food production, carbon storage, and conservation of biodiversity and native vegetation and examined their suitability to grow biodiesel species (Calophyllum inophyllum, Pongamia pinnata, and Reutealis trisperma) and biomass species (Calliandra calothyrsus and Gliricidia sepium). Results showed ~3.5 million ha of degraded lands potentially suitable for these species in Indonesia. With the all-five-species scenario, these lands had the potential to produce 1105 PJ year-1 of biomass and 3 PJ year-1 of biodiesel. With the biodiesel-only-species scenario, these lands showed the potential to produce 10 PJ year-1 of biodiesel. Despite this energy potential, however, the land sizes were too small to support economies of scale for biofuel production. The study findings contribute to identifying lands with limited functions, modeling the growth of biofuel species on regional lands, and estimating carbon stocks of restored degraded lands in Indonesia. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation is one of the most important environmental benefits of using bioenergy replacing fossil fuels. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important GHGs and have drawn extra attention for their roles in global warming. Although there have been many works of soil emissions of N2O and CH4 from bioenergy crops in the field scale, GHG emissions in large area of marginal lands are rather sparse and how soil temperature and moisture affect the emission potential remains unknown. Therefore, we sought to estimate the regional GHG emission based on N2O and CH4 releases from the energy crop fields. Results: Here we sampled the top soils from two Miscanthus fields and incubated them using a short-term laboratory microcosm approach under different conditions of typical soil temperatures and moistures. Based on the emission measurements of N2O and CH4, we developed a model to estimate annual regional GHG emission of Miscanthus production in the infertile Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that the N2O emission potential was 0.27 kg N ha-1 year-1 and clearly lower than that of croplands and grasslands. The CH4 uptake potential was 1.06 kg C ha-1 year-1 and was slightly higher than that of croplands. Integrated with our previous study on the emission of CO2, the net greenhouse effect of three major GHGs (N2O, CH4 and CO2) from Miscanthus fields was 4.08 t CO2eq ha-1 year-1 in the Loess Plateau, which was lower than that of croplands, grasslands and shrub lands. Conclusions: Our study revealed that Miscanthus production may hold a great potential for GHG mitigation in the vast infertile land in the Loess Plateau of China and could contribute to the sustainable energy utilization and have positive environmental impact on the region. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study compares the use of three low boiling point polar aprotic solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, and 1,4-dioxane, for extracting biomass sugars in ethanol biorefineries. The techno-economic analysis employs experimental data to build a chemical process model and estimate capital and operating costs of a commercial-scale biorefinery. The biomass solvent liquefaction in a 2000 metric tonne per day sugar fermentation biorefinery yields ethanol at minimum fuel-selling prices (MFSP) of $2.98 to $4.06 per gallon. THF achieves the lowest MFSP. Uncertainty analysis indicates that solvent to biomass ratio, glucose and xylose yields, feedstock price, and capital costs are the primary drivers of the ethanol MFSP. The 10% to 90% percentile for THF-based ethanol MFSP are estimated to be $2.31 and $3.21 per gallon. Life cycle analysis shows that with a lower solvent to biomass ratio as suggested by previous studies, our process could achieve GHG emissions reduction of 25% and 45% for THF and acetone cases, respectively. Further optimization of the process could lead to significant reductions in ethanol costs, commercialization risks, and GHG emissions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - One of the main issues that the world is facing is population growth. One of the critical issues would be providing accessible, safe and reliable energy for the current population and the next generation. To provide for the growing population’s needs under the umbrella of sustainable development, one of the vital factors is energy supply. Providing safe, clean and affordable energy for the current population and the next generation is one of the highest priorities. The need for everyone to have access to affordable energy sources, a great dependence on fossil fuels, the depletion of finite resources, as well as the critiques of the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment are the most notable barriers that incite states to search for new options. In this context, Biofuel is among those renewable energies that can be a substitute for fossil fuels. The bioethanol is the most consumed worldwide biofuel; it can be produced from several other substrates rich in fermentable sugars, namely cellulosic biomass, energy crops and organic waste. This study provides an analysis of the production of bioethanol made from common dates of low commercial value. These represent an excellent material for the production of bioethanol since it is rich in sugar, economic, abundant, and there is no competition with food crops. © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - Rising level of CO2, increasing demands and price of fossil fuel, generation of waste are the major challenges of the modern society. Biorefinery approach for production of biodiesel using waste as feedstock could be an alternative of these problems. The present research demonstrates the use of municipal secondary sludge as growth media for production of biodiesel by chemolithotrophic, oleaginous bacteria Serratia sp. ISTD04. The characterization of bacteria and biodiesel was performed by TEM and GC–MS, NMR respectively. The hydrocarbon range, C-7 to C-25 and suitable saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition, makes it an impending fuel. Optimization of in-situ transesterification process parameters increased the yield by 25% and similarly increases in transesterification efficiency from 74% to 94%. The fuel properties (Total acid value, Cetane number, Cloud point, Pour point, Heating value, Kinematic viscosity) of 5% blended biodiesel was analyzed by ASTM standard methods and its shows good fuel behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The order Methylococcales constitutes the methanotrophs – bacteria that can metabolize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole source of energy. These bacteria are significant players in the global carbon cycle and can produce value-added products from methane, such as biopolymers, biofuels, and single-cell proteins for animal feed, among others. Previous studies using single-gene phylogenies have shown inconsistencies in the currently established taxonomic structure of this group. This study aimed to determine and resolve these issues by using whole-genome sequence analyses. Phylogenomic analysis and the use of similarity indexes for genomic comparisons – average amino acid identity, digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH), and average nucleotide identity (ANI) – were performed on 91 Methylococcales genomes. Results suggest the reclassification of members at the genus and species levels. Firstly, to resolve polyphyly of the genus Methylomicrobium, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum, “Methylomicrobium buryatense,” Methylomicrobium japanense, Methylomicrobium kenyense, and Methylomicrobium pelagicum are reclassified to a newly proposed genus, Methylotuvimicrobium gen. nov.; they are therefore renamed to Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum comb. nov., “Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense” comb. nov., Methylotuvimicrobium japanense comb. nov., Methylotuvimicrobium kenyense comb. nov., and Methylotuvimicrobium pelagicum comb. nov., respectively. Secondly, due to the phylogenetic affinity and phenotypic similarities of Methylosarcina lacus with Methylomicrobium agile and Methylomicrobium album, the reclassification of the former species to Methylomicrobium lacus comb. nov. is proposed. Thirdly, using established same-species delineation thresholds (70% dDDH and 95% ANI), Methylobacter whittenburyi is proposed to be a later heterotypic synonym of Methylobacter marinus (89% dDDH and 99% ANI). Also, the effectively but not validly published “Methylomonas denitrificans” was identified as Methylomonas methanica (92% dDDH and 100% ANI), indicating that the former is a later heterotypic synonym of the latter. Lastly, strains MC09, R-45363, and R-45371, currently identified as M. methanica, each represent a putative novel species of the genus Methylomonas (21–35% dDDH and 74–88% ANI against M. methanica) and were reclassified as Methylomonas sp. strains. It is imperative to resolve taxonomic inconsistencies within this group, first and foremost, to avoid confusion with ecological and evolutionary interpretations in subsequent studies. © 2018 Orata, Meier-Kolthoﬀ, Sauvageauand Stein.

AB  - Mali has introduced a program to produce biodiesel using jatropha, a shrub widely available throughout the country. The aim of the program is to partially substitute diesel, which is entirely supplied through imports, with domestically produced biodiesel. In this paper, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a microsimulation model to analyze macroeconomic and distributional impact of a hypothetical expansion of jatropha based biodiesel industry in Mali. We find that the expansion of biodiesel industry (i.e., both jatropha farming and oil conversion), would increase GDP, though slightly, if idle lands are utilized for jatropha cultivation. However, the expansion of jatropha would cause slight loss in GDP if the existing agriculture land is used for jatropha cultivation. The distributional results are slightly different. We find that rural poverty would decrease no matter whether idle lands or existing agricultural lands are used for jatropha plantation, although the percentage reductions in rural poverty are higher in the former compared to the latter case. Our results indicate that if governments plan to promote jatropha biodiesel they should not allow jatropha to compete with food staples on the existing land. Policies should be targeted to utilize the idle lands which have not been used for any productive use. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study simulated the effect of time on bioenergy production from dairy manure and associated variation in energy demand and GHG emission in Ohio and Hawaii. Increasing the residence-time (RT) decreases the bioenergy-production in a nonlinear-fashion, for both the states (Ohio and Hawaii). Using the main scenario in Hawaii, the highest bioenergy production for 30 days RT was 11.2 × 104 GJ. Life-cycle-assessment of produced bioenergy showed that energy requirement and GHG emission of the produced-bioenergy (GJ) varied from 0.65 to 0.67 and 28–35 kg CO2/GJ bioenergy respectively. Year-round bioenergy production through main scenario was more advantageous with respect to bioenergy production and GHG emission. Decreasing nitrogen concentration for algal biomass production increased the bioenergy production significantly with a reduced energy demand and marginally increased GHG emission. Hence, the LCA model predicted that running a biorefinery for short residence time, and using diluted waste, could provide bioenergy with reduced energy requirement and GHG-emission. © 2018

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) initially set ambitious goals for US cellulosic biofuel production and, although the total renewable fuel volume reached 80% of the established target for 2017, the cellulosic fuel volume reached just 5% of the original goal. This shortfall has, in part, been ascribed to the hesitance of farmers to plant the high-yielding, low-input perennial biomass crops identified as otherwise ideal feedstocks. Policy and market uncertainty also hinder investment in capital-intensive new cellulosic biorefineries. This study combines remote sensing land use data, yield predictions, a fine-resolution geospatial modeling framework, and a novel facility siting algorithm to evaluate the potential for near-term scale-up of cellulosic fuel production using a combination of lower-risk annual feedstocks more familiar to US farmers: corn stover and biomass sorghum. Potential strategies include expansion or retrofitting of existing corn ethanol facilities and targeted construction of new facilities in resource-rich areas. The results indicate that, with a maximum 10% conversion of pastureland and cropland to sorghum in suitable regions, more than 80 of the 214 existing corn ethanol biorefineries could be retrofitted or expanded to accept cellulosic feedstocks and an additional 71 new biorefineries could be built. The resulting land conversion for bioenergy sorghum totals to 4.5% of US cropland and 3.7% of pastureland. If this biomass is converted to ethanol, the total increase in annual production could be 17 billion gallons, just over the original RFS 2022 cellulosic biofuel production target and equivalent to 12% of US gasoline consumption. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biomass is a crucial option of substituting fossil fuels to reduce emissions, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) allows for obtaining net-negative emissions. We explore the role of biomass in China's long-term mitigation toward the Paris climate goals in light of three narratives and five mitigation scenarios, modeling by a refined Global Change Assessment Model. While presenting a limited contribution to achieving China's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), biomass plays an important role in China's post-NDC mitigation toward the Paris climate goals. All the assessed scenarios call for extensive biomass use, accounting for 6.5%-28% of China's 2100 primary energy in our three 2 °C scenarios and 15%-30% in our two 1.5 °C scenarios. The exact biomass deployment trajectories tend to depend greatly on how China envisages national mitigation paces and BECCS strategies. For either 2 °C or 1.5 °C, a smaller negative-emission narrative, which means a more rapid immediate decarbonization of the energy system toward mid-century, depends on larger bioenergy in medium-to-long-term. Delaying short- and medium-term ambition delays bioenergy applications but requires far more in the second half of the century to create greater negative emissions via BECCS. Moving from 2 °C toward 1.5 °C features higher and earlier bioenergy deployments and meaningfully increasing BECCS volumes and biofuel shares in China's energy system. Consequently, the Chinese stockholders might be ready to make a decision on to what degree biomass and BECCS enter the sphere of China's energy and climate policies, which will greatly influence not only national biomass roadmap but also mid-century mitigation targets. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Conflict over natural resources is a widespread phenomenon in the global south. Trends in consumption, demographics, environmental degradation, and socio-political dynamics are exerting significant pressure on the availability and accessibility of natural resources. In many countries, the governance of land for commercial agricultural investment leads to conflict. Such conflicts are complex, and the drivers extend beyond resource scarcity to issues of access and competition. This paper is based on the results of field research on investments in large-scale Jatropha plantations for biofuel production in Ethiopia. A case study of a large-scale Jatropha plantation in eastern–central Ethiopia is used to reconstruct the history of a short-lived, large-scale biofuel development in Ethiopia, and to examine the processes and the reasons for its failure. Between 2006 and 2009, more than 400,000 ha of land were acquired for industrial biofuel development. Given the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and the global rush for alternative energy sources, the Ethiopian government, not surprisingly, gave emphasis to investment in biofuel development, mainly through Jatropha plantation. However, after costly experimentation, the “miracle crop” did not deliver what had been promised. Instead, it dispossessed and displaced thousands of marginalized local smallholder agropastoralists, created conflict over water and land resources, and kept thousands of hectares of land out of production. In the end, the rhetoric of “Jatropha revolution” and promises of local and national development were never materialized; the government’s ambitious biofuel strategy also failed to achieve its objectives. The main argument of this paper is that the failure of large-scale biofuel companies to fulfill their ambitious promises in Ethiopia is part of the general failure in the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture and misleading views toward, and unrealistic promises of, Jatropha investments. These negatively affected the livelihood of the local agropastoralists and their interactions with the companies, which caused instabilities and conflicts in the area. It is hoped that the findings of this research will contribute to knowledge production and policies on the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture. © 2018 by the author(s).

The paper focuses on the nexus of agri-food and energy markets in U.S. and investigates the interrelationships between the biofuel prices and prices of soybean oil, corn and wheat. Co-integration analysis and vector error correction model are carried out in order to investigate the relationship between the price series. The results show that biofuels and food price levels are co-integrated in the long run. These links show that food prices increment with a rise in biofuels prices. Additionally, not only food prices are determined by biofuels prices, but also vice versa. © 2018 Faculty of Economics and Management.

AB  - Paddy and wheat cropping is a widespread farming practice in northwestern parts of India, primarily in the riverine plains of Haryana and Punjab. These fertile lands are well known for extensive agricultural fields; however, they are equally infamous for the burning of paddy and wheat straw and stubble by farmers after the harvesting season. In India, it is reckoned that 22,289 gigagrams (Gg) of paddy stubble biomass is generated annually, and of this 13,915 Gg (62.42%) is set ablaze in the agricultural fields. Haryana and Punjab alone produce 48% of the whole straw production in India, which is openly burned in situ. Burning of farm residue emits various trace gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), nitrogen oxides (NO X ), and sulfur oxides (SO X ), as well as huge quantities of particulate matter (PM), including PM of 10 microns or less (PM 10 ) and 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5 ), into the atmosphere, causing negative impacts on human health and exacerbating global warming. It is estimated that the burning of one metric tonne (2,204.6 pounds) of straw releases 3 kilograms (kg) of PM, 60 kg of CO, 1,460 kg of CO 2 , 199 kg of ash, and 2 kg of SO 2 , causing significant global warming and acid rain. The major problems faced by the local people are eye irritation, dryness of eyes, lung diseases, and chest congestion. The National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab faced a disastrous smog impact during October 2016, and November 2017. These incidents led to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, bronchitis, cataract, corneal opacity, blindness, and air pollution (smog), especially indoor air pollution, which is also a risk factor for developing pulmonary tuberculosis. Because of severe air pollution, Delhi NCR alone experiences approximately 20,000 premature deaths annually. Cases of road accidents also increase during periods of stubble burning due to poor visibility. The emissions also contribute to haze, global warming, and climate change. In India, the National Green Tribunal prohibited this antediluvian farm practice of straw burning in the pollution-racked city of New Delhi and the adjacent state of Haryana and, just to the northwest, Punjab. One of the methods that can be used to reduce this menace is incorporation of the straw into the soil, which eventually enhances soil fertility. The crop residue material can also be used for compost formation as a traditional approach. In addition, alternate energy resources can be generated from this agro-biomass. Further, over the past decades, many conversion processes were developed to produce alternate biofuels in different forms (pellets, briquettes) from crop residues. An integrated crop residue management approach is the need of the hour to control this human-induced catastrophe. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Biomass obtained from cultivated energy crops is one of the raw materials with the highest potential in renewable energy production. Although such biomass can be used in production of lignocellulose bioethanol, it is currently mostly used as solid fuel for generating heat and/or electric energy via combustion processes. Calorific values, proximate and ultimate analysis, cell structure and micro- and macro-elements data are considered as basic parameters in the valorization of fuel properties during biomass combustion processes. Energy crops are cultivated with the aim to produce the largest possible quantity of biomass with minimal agro-technical inputs. One of these crops is Sida hermaphrodita (L.) Rusby. Given the fact that the chemical composition of biomass is influenced by a number of agro-ecological and agro-technical factors, the aim of this work was to determine the fuel properties of Sida hermaphrodita biomass obtained from three different harvest seasons (autumn, winter and spring) and cultivated in the area of the Republic of Croatia. On the basis of these investigations it was possible to conclude that harvest delaying towards spring season had a positive impact on suitability of using biomass of Sida hermaphrodita in the combustion process, which primarily means significant lowering the contents of moisture (18.64%), ash (1.94%), and nitrogen (0.65%), but also means increasing the contents of fixed carbon (6.21%) and lignin (25.45%). © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Large areas of deforested and degraded land, particularly degraded peatlands, need a viable long-term solution for restoration, ideally one that ensures energy security without compromising food security or biodiversity conversation. To address a knowledge gap on the most adaptive bioenergy crop(s) for degraded lands, this research project assessed the survival and growth performance of potential bioenergy crops to restore burned and degraded peatlands. Our methodology compared the bioenergy species with the potential to survive in extreme environments, i.e., gamal [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], kaliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner), kemiri sunan [Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) Airy Shaw], and nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). Observed parameters are plant survival rates, tree height, and circular stem growth. The experiment was conducted between March 2016 to February 2017 in a two-hectare demonstration plot on burned and degraded peatland in Buntoi village, Pulang Pisau, Central Kalimantan province. Using a split plot design, two treatments were given to each species, i.e., monoculture plantation and agroforestry (intercropped with Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.); with each treatment, the species were replicated on two separate plots. Results indicate that nyamplung is the most adoptable species followed by kemiri sunan, however both species performed very well under agroforestry treatment when compared with monoculture. Further study is needed to assess the productivity and associate biofuel yield. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the role of biofuel production on deforestation in low- and middle-income countries. Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production. © 2018 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå

AB  - In this study, the evaluation of the catalytic behavior of several wild bacterial strains in the 1,3-selective ethanolysis of triglycerides with ethanol to produce a new type of biodiesel (Ecodiesel) that integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols was carried out. The Ecodiesel production not only avoids the elimination of glycerol, which is largely generated as a by-product in the biodiesel industry, but also results in an increase in the biofuel yield. The wild microbial strain samples were obtained from several lipophilic organisms. In addition to evaluate the enzymatic extracts, the minimum grade of purification of the strains, necessary to obtain similar results to those attained with commercial lipases was studied. This purification treatment included a dialysis followed by a lyophilization process. Such extracts were directly used as biocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, attaining much better results (yield close to 100%) than those obtained with strains which were not submitted to the purification process (yields lower than 10%). Furthermore, the results here obtained are similar to those obtained with commercial lipases but were achieved under mild conditions and lower reaction time (2 h). In addition, the stability of the enzymatic extracts was corroborated by subsequent reactions, showing no loss of activity. Thus, this study brings to light that enzymatic extracts obtained by a very simple purification process can be economically competitive with the conventional biodiesel production methods. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A comparative life cycle assessment of the sugarcane biorefinery in different conceptual arrangements was conducted considering four different alternatives with increasing utilization of byproducts. The first alternative with the least use of byproducts was taken as the base case and the fourth alternative was a completely integrated plant with gradually enhanced and efficient use of byproducts. The functional unit was defined as the production of 1 t of sugar in the biorefinery complex. The calculations were performed for the eight most relevant impact categories including global warming, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, mineral resource scarcity, and fossil resource scarcity. Overall, it was observed that for most of the impact categories, the values were progressively reduced with an increased use of byproducts (i.e., prevention of cane burning and its recovery; filter cake, ash, wastewater, and sludge as fertilizer; bagasse and cane trash for high-pressure cogeneration; ethanol as biofuel and recovery of CO2; biogas for waste to energy production). In general, it could be concluded that an enhanced and efficient use of byproducts would significantly improve the environmental performance of the biorefinery complex. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The emergence of second generation biofuel industries will be heavily dependent on future prices of ethanol, which could incent landowners to switch land uses from agriculture to growing biofuel feedstocks. In this study, we investigate price levels of ethanol that will be necessary for landowners to grow hybrid poplar. In such an emerging industry, landowners will face a great deal of uncertainty and will consider options to change their production decisions over time. To address this uncertainty, we construct a real options model that considers the dynamic option for Canadian landowners to switch from agriculture to poplar plantations, and also the option to sell poplar plantations for ethanol or pulpwood. The uncertainty in prices for poplar is characterized by time series models of prices for ethanol and pulpwood that characterize price variability as a GARCH process, and reversion to the long term mean average prices. Uncertainty for the value of land allocated to agriculture is characterised by a geometric random walk. Given these price processes, the real options models suggest that current average price levels would have to increase by approximately 35% (i.e. by 0.21 $/L) if only ethanol is considered as an end product, but this increase may be reduced to 32% (i.e., to 0.19 $/L) if the landowner has options to sell the poplar to either ethanol or pulpwood producers. On low value agriculture lands, estimates suggest that an 18% increase relative to current ethanol prices (i.e., of 0.11 $/L) would be needed, which is approximately equal to the current second generation subsidies in Alberta. © 2018

AB  - Valuable biomass conversion processes are highly dependent on the use of effective pretreatments for lignocellulose degradation and enzymes for saccharification. Among the nowadays available treatments, chemical delignification represents a promising alternative to physical-mechanical treatments. Banana is one of the most important fruit crops around the world. After harvesting, it generates large amounts of rachis, a lignocellulosic residue, that could be used for second generation ethanol production, via saccharification and fermentation. In the present study, eight chemical pretreatments for lignin degradation (organosolv based on organic solvents, sodium hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen peroxide, alkaline hydrogen peroxide, and some combinations thereof) have been tested on banana rachis and the effects evaluated in terms of lignin removal, material losses, and chemical composition of pretreated material. Pretreatment based on lignin oxidation have demonstrated to reach the highest delignification yield, also in terms of monosaccharides recovery. In fact, all the delignified samples were then saccharified with enzymes (cellulase and beta-glucosidase) and hydrolysis efficiency was evaluated in terms of final sugars recovery before fermentation. Analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) has been carried out on treated samples, in order to better understand the structural effects of delignification on lignocellulose. Active chlorine oxidations, hypochlorous acid in particular, were the best effective for lignin removal obtaining in the meanwhile the most promising cellulose-to-glucose conversion. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Crop rotation between paddy rice and maize is of increasing relevance because of ecological and economic reasons. The cultivation of maize in paddy soils during the dry season reduces water consumption and methane emissions, while fulfilling the increasing demand of maize for biofuel production and poultry fattening. However, introduction of upland crops in paddy fields often leads to carbon and nitrogen loss due to desiccation crack formation. Straw application can reduce crack formation and acts as fertilizer. The temporal dynamics of straw degradation under oxic conditions in paddy soils undergoing crop rotation have been scarcely studied. We identified the straw degrading microorganisms comparatively in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of maize by DNA-stable isotope probing with 13C-labelled rice straw and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 region. Moreover, the degradation process in bulk soil was investigated over time. Straw degradation was performed by aerobic microorganisms and showed a clear temporal succession. In the initial phase, fast growing bacteria became labelled, followed by the labelling of fungi, known to degrade more complex carbon compounds. In the rhizosphere, partly different microorganisms were identified as labelled than in bulk soil, indicating that the microbial straw degradation process differs to some extent between these two compartments. The size of the labelled microbial population was smaller in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil, pointing to a preferential utilization of plant root derived carbon by microorganisms in the rhizosphere. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewed interest in non-native Eucalyptus species for planting in the southern US has been spurred by projections suggesting they are more productive than the widely cultured Pinus species, by warming temperatures, and by attempts to identify frost-tolerant species as well as developing genetically modified Eucalyptus for frost tolerance. In addition to questions of environmental suitability, the economic viability of Eucalyptus is a significant hurdle to widespread adoption for commercial plantings. We sought to assess the potential obtainable yields and economic feasibility of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex. Maiden and E. benthamii Maiden et Cambage, two species suitable for the southern United States. Using the process-based growth model 3PG, we projected potential yields at the sub-county level for E. grandis in Florida where it is operationally grown and E. benthamii in USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 8a and 8b where it has shown tolerance to occasional low temperatures. The 3PG model estimated mean annual volume increment, inside bark (MAI) that was used to estimate land expectation value (LEV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The MAI of E. grandis ranged from 18 to 119 m3 ha−1year−1 (9 to 59.5 dry Mg ha−1 year−1) with a mean of 42.6 m3 ha−1year−1 (20.8 dry Mg ha−1 year−1) for sites in peninsular Florida. The lower growth projections came from north Florida areas where annual frosts occur. Excluding urban areas, the LEV of E. grandis ranged from $-1264 to $1710 ha−1 with a mean of $424 ha−1. The estimated IRR ranged from −9.7% to 16.9% with a mean of 8.2%. Eucalyptus benthamii MAI ranged from 3.3 to 76 m3 ha−1year−1 (1.8 to 41.8 Mg ha−1year−1), with a mean of 21.9 m3 ha−1year−1 (11.9 Mg ha−1year−1). The higher yields were primarily located in coastal regions of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b. Excluding urban areas, LEV ranged from $-2707 ha−1 to $1532 ha−1. The maximum estimated IRR was 15.9%. Our results show that Eucalyptus is potentially profitable as a bioenergy crop in the southern USA, but potential profitability of E. benthamii was limited by low temperature; positive LEV was obtained where productivity was 30 m3 ha−1year−1 or more. Profitability was restricted to a small percentage (12%) of sites theoretically within the operational range in the southern U.S. indicating that a wholesale conversion of Pinus taeda plantations is unlikely. © 2018

AB  - The surface and surroundings of microalgal cells (phycosphere) are critical interaction zones but have been difficult to functionally interrogate due to methodological limitations. We examined effects of phycosphere-associated bacteria for two biofuel-relevant microalgal species (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis salina) using stable isotope tracing and high spatial resolution mass spectrometry imaging (NanoSIMS) to quantify elemental exchanges at the single-cell level. Each algal species responded differently to bacterial attachment. In P. tricornutum, a high percentage of cells had attached bacteria (92%–98%, up to eight bacteria per alga) and fixed 64% more carbon with attached bacteria compared to axenic cells. In contrast, N. salina cells were less commonly associated with bacteria (42%–63%), harboured fewer bacteria per alga, and fixed 10% more carbon without attached bacteria compared to axenic cells. An uncultivated bacterium related to Haliscomenobacter sp. was identified as an effective mutualist; it increased carbon fixation when attached to P. tricornutum and incorporated 71% more algal-fixed carbon relative to other bacteria. Our results illustrate how phylogenetic identity and physical location of bacteria and algae facilitate diverse metabolic responses. Phycosphere-mediated, mutualistic chemical exchanges between autotrophs and heterotrophs may be a fruitful means to increase microalgal productivity for applied engineering efforts. © 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the status of Jatropha plants farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda. A total of 73 Jatropha farmers from five sectors namely, Kigarama, Kigina, Kirehe, Mahama and Nyamugali in Kirehe district, Eastern Province, were selected. The study examined eight key parameters that determine the status of Jatropha plants farming. These parameters are classification of Jatropha farmers, methods for Jatropha plants growing, government strategy on providing Jatropha quality seeds or seedlings to farmers, government involvement to initiate local farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production, knowledge level of the farmers on Jatropha plants farming, Jatropha seeds yield, perception level of investing on Jatropha plants farming and opinions of the key players in the biodiesel project. Through interviews and questionnaires, information was gathered and analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Result indicates that majority of the farmers (82%) in the five sectors reported that they were farming Jatropha plants as individual farmers while about 18% indicated that they were cultivating Jatropha plants as cooperatives. Majority of the farmers (70%) used agro-forestry farming technique due to shortage of farm lands. It was also revealed that most of the farmers (55%) have little knowledge on growing Jatropha plants. With regards to farmers using quality Jatropha seeds or seedlings, most farmers (93%) indicated that the government has not provided Jatropha seeds or seedlings. On the other hand, majority of the farmers (80%) stated that there have been very low involvements of the government to initiate farmers to cultivate Jatropha plants for biodiesel production project. In terms of Jatropha seeds yield, majority of the farmers (63%) in the five sectors rated Jatropha seed production level as low (between 1.1 and 2.9 t/ha/year) while about 33% stated that it was very low (between 0 and 1 t/ha/year). This was attributed to lack of reliable markets, low level of sensitisation, lack of preliminary studies on suitable areas for Jatropha plantation, lack of policy and institutional framework on biofuels, shortage of farm lands for intensification of Jatropha framing and low soil adaptation of the Jatropha plants. Due to low production level and lack of reliable markets, 71% of the total respondents considered Jatropha plants farming as a very low investment. Since there is no biodiesel production at the moment which would have created a reliable market for Jatropha seeds, Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Rwanda is not viable. It is recommended that the government should carry out a feasibility study to generate knowledge on growth performance of various Jatropha species under the prevailing environmental conditions. In addition, due to shortage of land farms, the government should undertake economic assessment of growing Jatropha trees as hedges. © 2018 International Energy Initiative

AB  - The Nigerian government plans to produce bioethanol from its staple food crops to increase transport fuel supply, reduce imported motors fuels, create jobs and diversify its oil-dependent economy. However, the conflicts between the benefits of biofuels and the potential impacts on food security requires analysis to quantify fuel, food, economy and employment metrics to inform policy decision making. Drawing upon a bespoke partial equilibrium model, the Nigerian Energy-Food Model (NEFM), regionalised into the existing six geo-political zones of Nigeria: North-West, North-East, North-Central, South-West, South-South and South-East to ensure conformity with the existing administrative and economic units of Nigeria and facilitate quicker adoption and implementation of achieved results, was developed, populated using secondary data from different data sources and personal research visits to the Nigerian government agencies, and implemented via General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). Ethanol production analysis result from the model indicates that cassava is the economically ‘optimal’ feedstock, followed by sugarcane, in all six geo-political zones of Nigeria. The results demonstrate that Nigeria has the potential to produce sufficient feedstock and food crops to meet the current domestic ethanol, crop export and crop consumption demands, without affecting domestic food security in the short-run, due to availability of vast fertile uncultivated arable land and unemployed labour, providing positive energy, economic and employment benefits in the short term. Nevertheless, future expansion of the bioethanol programme to double current national ethanol and food consumption demands, would result in significant impacts on national land-use change, negatively impacting on domestic food production and increasing food prices. It is recommended that Nigeria's future biofuels’ policy requires a carefully-articulated land-use policy to ensure that land allocation to bioethanol feedstock production is tempered by the need to allocate arable land to food production, in order to avoid consequential adverse impacts on its food security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) is envisioned as a framework that combines the technological richness of attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) with basic economic intuition to assess the potential environmental impact of an innovation. However, despite a growing literature, CLCA still lacks general guidelines for system boundary definition. Toward filling this gap, this article invents a new index of vulnerability of the life cycle impact of a product (or activity) to emissions arising from the impact of its large-scale adoption on market prices. Using corn ethanol as an example, it is illustrated how such an index might aid in the selection of a small set of affected activities for formal consideration in a CLCA. The application to corn ethanol reveals that in addition to land-cover change, there exist other sources of vulnerability that have not received attention in the context of biofuels. A general procedure for utilizing the vulnerability index as a screening aid for CLCA is outlined. The utility of the vulnerability index is independent of the type of modeling framework (such as multimarket partial equilibrium or computable general equilibrium) that might be employed for a formal CLCA. Finally, this work illustrates how the vulnerability index approach bridges ALCA and CLCA. © 2017 by Yale University

AB  - Domestic and imported biomass or biofuels used for energy purposes play an important role in many future energy scenarios and national policies. But both the realizable potential for biomass and the environmental consequences of its deployment for energy can be controversial. The aim of this study is to identify environmentally-optimal strategies for bioenergy, considering domestic biomass resource availability, the full energy system context, and a consequential life cycle perspective. We apply our approach to the case of Switzerland and three alternative energy scenarios for the year 2035, and compare the environmentally-optimal strategies obtained over several single-issue and one fully-aggregated impact indicator. From the optimal solutions, we analyze substrate-specific (i.e., per biomass resource type) marginal impacts of biomass supply and the influences of boundary conditions imposed on biomass use by the different future energy scenarios. Minimizing impacts on global warming, cumulative fossil energy demand, and the Swiss ecological scarcity method leads to near-complete utilization of sustainably-available biomass resources, whereas less biomass is deployed when optimizing for particulate matter formation, land use (biodiversity loss), and water footprint. The results suggest that increased deployment of energy wood (excluding forest wood apt for material applications) and manures would be environmentally beneficial. In contrast, substrates suitable for animal feeding should not be used for energy purposes due to the burdens associated with increasing the demand for conventional feedstuffs. The findings and case-specific recommendations illustrate the importance of considering a holistic environmental perspective, alongside techno-economic restrictions to the physical biomass potential, when establishing national (bio-)energy policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Duckweeds, quick-growing aquatic plants, have been recently recognized as promising hosts for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and as an ideal biomass feedstock for biofuel production. These possible wide-spread industrial uses of duckweeds intensified research aimed at understanding the mechanisms that control duckweed growth. Here, we describe how the hormone cytokinin affects growth. We performed a number of standard cytokinin growth- and physiological-response assays using sterile-grown colonies of Lemna gibba and Spirodela polyrhiza. Similar to land plants, cytokinin inhibited root elongation in duckweeds. Surprisingly, and in contrast to land plants, cytokinin promoted growth of aerial organs in both duckweed species, suggesting that the cytokinin growth response fundamentally differs between aquatic and land plants. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Agroclimatic aptitude can provide information on regions with less impact to the environment for sugarcane growth to ethanol production. In this study, agroclimatic aptitude maps are generated for the region encompassing the Paranaíba river basin in central-western Brazil, which has presented suitable conditions for sugarcane expansion. Considering a rainfed framework, the hydrological requirements were estimated using meteorological station data; numerical integrations of climate change projections, from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Earth System Models under two climate change scenarios; and the crop model, CROPWAT 8.0, from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The resulting agroclimatic aptitude maps exhibit areas of sugarcane vulnerability to climate change, as well as potential regions for its expansion. None of the performed analyses indicate the increase in temperature as a limiting factor for sugarcane production in that region. Considering thermal and hydric aptitudes, the water deficit is the only limiting factor in the study area, therefore sugarcane production would require irrigation. This study presents the southwestern region of the river basin as more suitable to the expansion of sugarcane, because the lower risk of water deficit, under different climate paths with distinctive El Niño Southern Oscillation variability conditions. Additionally, the southwestern part of the Paranaíba river basin has fewer environmental conservation units, as well as a vast pastureland. Cattle herd can be reallocated toward degraded pasturelands, which in turn can be recovered. Therefore, sugarcane expansion to the southwestern region of the Paranaíba river basin would affect less the environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hybrid poplar has potential as feedstock for the production of bioenergy and bio-based products. Planning effective placement of hybrid poplar based biorefinery facilities takes tremendous time and financial resources. A hybrid poplar based biorefinery siting application (HP-BiSWA), a web-enabled refinery siting application, was developed so that potential stakeholders may quickly assess available resources at selected locations and provide information relating to the economic competitiveness and financial risks associated with construction and operation. At present, the tool supports evaluation of the potential for hybrid poplar based jet fuel and acetic acid production based on user-specified conditions. The application is generally expandable to other feedstock, technology, and product types. HP-BiSWA uses various modules (i.e. 3PG-crop growth model and farm budget application) and services (i.e. parcel service, transportation routing service, crop service, soil and weather services) to retrieve and estimate information to optimize and select potential parcels for poplar cultivation, and ultimately determine net revenue for biofuel production under selected decision options. To demonstrate the utility of HP-BiSWA, a case study analysis was performed for Centralia, WA based on a 380 ML/yr (100 MGY) jet fuel biorefinery using two scenarios: (1) a 175 km feedstock supply radius with 50% pastureland use, and (2) a 225 km feedstock supply radius with 25% pastureland use. The case study captures the interactive effects on biorefinery performance with changes in feedstock supply area and available water, power, and other resources for operation of the biorefinery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Compared to traditional arable crops, second-generation perennial energy crops (PECs) are generally associated with increased biodiversity and ecosystem services, but robust experimental studies on this subject are few. Consequently, the potential for PEC cultivation to contribute to enhanced pollination processes in adjacent farmland remains unclear. In a 4-year field study across multiple sites and two PECs (Miscanthus x giganteus and willow short-rotation coppice), we examine whether pollinator visits to crop margin wildflowers were augmented by PEC cultivation. Each field was paired with two cereal fields, one adjacent to the PEC and one distant, and we recorded wildflower visits to crop margins by three pollinator groups: hoverflies, bumblebees and butterflies/moths. We also quantified floral resources, since crop-specific management seemed a likely means of influencing margin wildflowers and thus pollinator activity. Our results add quantitative support to the suggestion that PECs should enhance ecosystem processes in agri-landscapes. However, benefits were highly context-dependent. Consistent enhancement of pollinator activity in margins of PEC fields was only apparent for willow where the relative frequency of flower visitation was higher for all three pollinator groups compared to adjacent or distant cereals. This distribution was most likely positively associated with the increased availability of preferred food plants in willow margins. In Miscanthus, by contrast, opposing trends arose for different pollinator taxa: Lepidoptera were the only pollinator group more frequently associated with PEC margins; bumblebees showed no variation while hoverflies were comparatively more abundant in distant cereal margins than in other crop types. Future land-use practices should consider how PEC identity affects both target species and ecosystem processes. Tackling anthropogenic climate change through cultivation of willow, in particular, may yield local conservation benefits for both wildflowers and pollinators, although strategic cultivation of PECs to enhance pollination processes in the wider agri-environment may not be achievable. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The Brazilian government aims to increase the share of biofuels in the energy mix to around 18% by 2030, which implies an increase of ethanol production from currently 27 bln liters to over 50 bln liters per year. Biofuel policies play an important role in ethanol production, consumption, and investment in processing capacity. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of how current policies affect the evolution of the market is lacking. We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model to analyze the impact of different blend mandates and taxes levied on gasoline, hydrous, and anhydrous ethanol on investment in processing capacity and on production and consumption of ethanol. The model uses land use projections by the PCRaster Land Use Change model and incorporates the institutions governing the actors’ strategic decision making with regard to production and consumption of ethanol, and the institutions governing the interaction among actors. From the investigated mix of policy measures, we find that an increase of the gasoline tax leads to the highest increased investments in sugarcane processing capacity. We also find that a gasoline tax above 1.23 R$/l and a tax exemption for hydrous ethanol may lead to doubling the production of ethanol by 2030 (relative to 2016). © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Biomass is the bioenergy carrier and can be converted to solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. Miscanthus, a plant type with high biomass yield potential, is a promising feedstock source for bioenergy production. However, the current expansion of miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) production is constrained by a shortage of commercial varieties, especially those suitable for different energy usages and cultivation under adverse environmental conditions. Therefore, breeding or selecting high-biomass-yielding, high quality and stress tolerant miscanthus varieties is essential for the extension of miscanthus for bioenergy production. To effectively select elite germplasms and breed new varieties of miscanthus, it is necessary to establish a scientific evaluation method for analysing their energy potential. In this study, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model was designed to evaluate the potential of miscanthus germplasms as feedstock in four energy usages including combustion for power generation (CPG), pyrolysis for bio-oil production (PBP), fermentation for ethanol production (FEP) and fermentation for biogas production (FBP). The MCDM model was constructed based on 11 sub-criteria indices, which were grouped into agronomic-related and quality-related criteria indices. The agronomic-related criteria indices include dry matter yield, canopy height, stem diameter, tiller number and base diameter/canopy diameter ratio. The quality-related criteria indices include the leaf/stem ratio, moisture content, ash content, cellulose content, hemicellulose content and lignin content. Thirty-eight representative germplasms of miscanthus were evaluated. The MCDM analysis results showed that Miscanthus lutarioriparius (especially the XiangNanDi no. 1 variety) and Miscanthus floridulus (especially A0521) are the best species for CPG/PBP and FEP/FBP, respectively. These results are superior to those calculated by the traditional energy potential assessment method, which showed that Miscanthus floridulus was the most suitable species for CPG, FEP and FBP, especially A0521 and D0624. Moreover, the analysis also indicated that D0505 (M. floridulus) can be used as a suitable parent together with XiangNanDi no. 1 to breed new varieties for CPG and PBP; XiangNanDi no. 1 can be used as an alternative parent for breeding to improve A0521 for use in FEP and FBP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Napiergrass (Cenchrus purpureus Schumach) is a tropical forage grass and a promising lignocellulosic biofuel feedstock due to its high biomass yield, persistence, and nutritive value. However, its utilization for breeding has lagged behind other crops due to limited genetic and genomic resources. In this study, next-generation sequencing was first used to survey the genome of napiergrass. Napiergrass sequences displayed high synteny to the pearl millet genome and showed expansions in the pearl millet genome along with genomic rearrangements between the two genomes. An average repeat content of 27.5% was observed in napiergrass including 5,339 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Furthermore, to construct a high-density genetic map of napiergrass, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was employed in a bi-parental population of 185 F1 hybrids. A total of 512 million high quality reads were generated and 287,093 SNPs were called by using multiple de-novo and reference-based SNP callers. Single dose SNPs were used to construct the first high-density linkage map that resulted in 1,913 SNPs mapped to 14 linkage groups, spanning a length of 1,410 cM and a density of 1 marker per 0.73 cM. This map can be used for many further genetic and genomic studies in napiergrass and related species. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The environmental consequences of residue removal practices to support cellulosic biofuel production remain poorly understood. In the U.S. Midwest, corn (Zea mays L.) stover removal combined with no-till practices may increase or decrease soil N2O emissions by influencing soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient dynamics, yet empirical evidence from long-term field experiments is inconsistent. We investigated the effects of residue management (residue retained or removed) and tillage (chisel-till or no-till) on cumulative soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, grain yield, and yield-scaled N2O emissions in a 3-year study initiated 10 years after treatment implementation in a long-term, continuous corn experiment in Illinois, United States. Crop yields were affected by treatment in only one of three study years, with the combination of residue removal and no-till reducing yields compared to both chisel-till treatments. Cumulative N2O emissions, soil inorganic N concentrations, and yield-scaled N2O emissions differed over the 3-year period and were significantly affected by tillage, with no response to residue management. In 2 years, no-till decreased cumulative N2O emissions and yield-scaled N2O emissions by an average of 64% and 60%, respectively. Correlations between daily N2O fluxes and soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N concentrations suggested that the relative importance of these variables changed depending on year and treatment. While more research across a range of sites and management practices is needed, our findings support previous studies which have challenged IPCC methodology assumptions regarding the effects of residue removal on N2O emissions. We conclude there is inherent difficulty in predicting the impacts of residue removal due to the complexity of soil processes underlying N2O emissions coupled with inter-annual weather variability in this rainfed continuous corn system. Future efforts to evaluate the net greenhouse gas emissions of cellulosic biofuel production may benefit from accounting for this uncertainty. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The 450 Scenario, which limits the increase in global average temperature to 2 °C, makes it necessary to take steps towards a low-carbon economy. Since the energy sector is a major contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the production of biofuels can play a key role in strategies aimed at climate change mitigation. In this regard, the oil derived from macauba palm (Acrocomia aculeata), mainly constituted of saturated organic chains, has been claimed to hold promise for the production of liquid fuels. The high potential yield, diversity of co-products and various positive features of this emerging energy crop make it an interesting option both from a social and an environmental point of view. Nonetheless, a full environmental evaluation is still missing. In the study presented herein, the impacts produced in its plantation, cultivation and harvesting phases and the associated cumulative energy demand have been determined using a life cycle analysis methodology, in addition to shedding some light on its GHG intensity relative to the other energy crops it can displace. Excluding land use changes and biogenic CO2 fixed by the crop, it was concluded that to produce one ton of macauba fruit in Brazil, the system would absorb 1810.21 MJ, with GHG emissions of 158.69 kg CO2eq in the 20-year timeframe, and of 140.04 kg CO2eq in the 100-year timeframe (comparable to those of African oil palm). Damage to human health, ecosystem quality, and resources would add up to 16 Pt·t−1 according to Eco-indicator 99 methodology. In order to account for the uncertainty derived from improvement and domestication programs, which should affect current production levels, a sensitivity analysis for different productivities was performed. In all analyses, fertilization was found to be responsible for ca. 90% of the impacts, and hence special attention should be paid to the development of alternative fertilizer management schemes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To avoid competition with food crops, biofuel feedstocks may need to be produced on economically marginal lands where yields are limited and replacement of existing vegetation will reduce soil C, foregoing some CO2 emission savings. Therefore, our first goal was to determine whether biochar application to marginal lands could improve switchgrass yield while sequestering sufficient soil C to eliminate the negative impact of cultivation. Because it may be difficult to obtain large quantities of biochar, our second goal was to compare small, incremental and large, all-at-once biochar applications. Our third goal was to determine whether biochar had any negative effects on earthworms, mycorrhizal fungi, soil bacteria, soil fungi, and soil enzyme activity. We grew switchgrass at two sites with poorly drained soils and two sites with excessively drained soils. Irrespective of site, biochar significantly increased yield when we rototilled in the entire amount before planting but not when we applied it incrementally between crop rows using a chisel plow. Biochar increased soil C stocks, in some cases increasing it beyond that found in soils of intact marginal land vegetation. Nevertheless, mixing biochar with soil had little or no impact on earthworm activity, mycorrhizal colonization, soil bacterial and fungal communities, and soil enzyme activities. We conclude that biochar may be part of an effective strategy for producing switchgrass on marginal lands, but the choice of application method depends on the relative importance of several considerations including biochar availability, switchgrass yield, C sequestration, soil erosion, and ease of application. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article provides a sectorial input-output resource assessment and spatial distribution for wastes and residues that could be used as feedstock for bio-SNG production, in the case of the Republic of Ireland (ROI). European and national policies that regulate the use of agricultural and forestry residues, and tertiary waste are reviewed. Geospatial distribution of the available sustainable potential of each feedstock are computed and shown in maps with the existing gas network. Results show that bio-SNG has the potential to provide 10.18 PJ a-1, of which 7.16 PJ a-1 is supplied by dry mixed municipal solid waste, 2.5 PJ a-1 by forestry residues and 0.52 PJ a-1 by sewage sludge, agricultural residues, and digestate. The total amount of potential energy is equivalent to 5.90% of renewable energy supply for heating (RES-H) or 6.62% of RES for transport (RES-T) based on the 2020 energy total final consumption projections in the ROI. Although these results represent the upper sustainable limit of bio-SNG feedstock potential, they represent the first step towards informing gas transmission system operators and policymakers of the decarbonisation potential of bio-SNG. The next stages of this work will optimise the bio-SNG supply chain and conduct a full system life cycle assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the effects of reaction temperature and catalyst loading on product yields and fuel properties of produced slurry during the alkali catalyzed hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of pine sawdust. The yield of the liquid fraction, or the aqueous product (AP), at process temperatures of 180–260 °C obtained after solid/liquid separation of the slurry ranged from 11.1 to 34.3 wt% on a dry, ash free basis. The fuel quality of the produced slurry, such as the elemental composition and the higher heating value (HHV), was mainly affected by the catalyst loading. An increase in the catalyst loading caused the ash content to increase. Although the increase in temperature leads to a higher liquid fraction in the slurry making it more homogeneous, its contribution to the elemental composition of the whole slurry was limited. HHV of the produced slurry ranged from 12.0 to 16.4 MJ/kg. These values are comparable to that of black liquor (BL), which has previously been shown to be a promising feedstock for gasification in a pilot scale entrained flow gasifier. These results imply the possibility of a fuel switch from BL to the HTT slurry for entrained flow gasification though its gasification reactivity and conversion characteristics must be investigated further. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sustainability of biofuels depends on considering the environmental consequences of using water and land resources for bioenergy production. The objective of this study was to assess the potential for biofuel crop expansion by combining water footprint, water availability, and land availability in the last agricultural frontier region of Brazil using the Corrente Basin as a case study. Results show that the water footprint (ratio of water consumption to biomass or energy production) of sugarcane is low (114–190 m3 Mg−1) reflecting high water consumption (∼9000 m3 ha−1) divided by high crop yield (∼50–80 Mg ha−1), including millable stalks. However, water consumption for sugarcane grown in this area (9370 m3 ha−1) exceeds water availability in much of the basin (90th percentile of streamflow), which limits sugarcane expansion. In contrast, the water footprint of soybeans (900–2600 m3 Mg−1) is 8–14 times higher than that of sugarcane, reflecting much lower water consumption (∼1500–3800 m3 Mg−1) and even lower crop yield (0.7–4.3 Mg ha−1), limited to grains, relative to sugarcane. The low water consumption of soybeans allows expansion under rainfed agriculture during the wet 1st harvest season over 22% of the region and under irrigation during the dry 2nd harvest season over 13% of the region, without the need for deforestation of the Cerrado biome. This soybean expansion represents ∼20 × 106 GJ of energy supply per year, ∼4 times current production. Surface water availability for irrigation extends into the dry season because of substantial groundwater discharge to streams during the dry season. Irrigation increases biofuel crop yield of sugarcane and soybeans, reducing land area required to produce an equivalent amount of biomass by 2 to 4 times relative to rainfed management. Therefore, water can be traded for land by expanding irrigated biofuel production, conserving more native Cerrado vegetation. Considering water and land requirements relative to availability for bioenergy crops provides data on potential increases in bioenergy production while minimizing clearing of native vegetation in the Brazilian agricultural frontier. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, four agro-industrial substrates, chicken litter (CL), food waste (FW), wheat straw (WS) and hay grass (HG) were assessed as feedstock for anaerobic digestion (AD) under semi-continuous conditions at organic loading rates (OLRs) of 2.0–3.0 g TS/L.d and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days. Six different substrate mixtures were prepared such that the C/N ratio of each was 20 or more. Using principal component analysis 68.1% of data variability was explained. Biogas production from CL, as a single substrate, was 181.3 ± 9.8 mL N biogas/g VS added at OLR of 2.0 gTS/L.d. The optimum substrates mixture was CL:FW:WS 60:20:20, where 73.0%, 167.2% and 116.9% increase in total biogas production at OLR of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 gTS/L.d, respectively, compared to that from CL, was obtained. Digestate sequential fractionation revealed carbohydrate degradation is an important factor that can explain the variation in performance and production of biogas for feedstocks of balanced C/N ratio. © 2018

AB  - Biochar and biogas slurry have been proved to improve the quality of some soil types, but the long-term effects on fluvo-aquic soil are not fully understood. This study aimed to compare the continuity effects of peanut-shell biochar and biogas slurry on the physicochemical properties, microbial population size, and enzyme activities of fluvo-aquic soil. We conducted a four-year field experiment of winter wheat-summer maize rotation in the North China Plain. Along with equal nitrogen inputs, three treatments were applied—conventional fertilizers, peanut-shell biochar, and hoggery biogas slurry—after which various soil quality indicators were compared. Compared with those of control, both biochar and biogas slurry increased the soil total nitrogen and organic matter content, and improved soil aggregation, microbial biomass, and actinomycetes. Biogas slurry decreased soil pH and improved urease and protease activities. With biochar and biogas slurry treatments, wheat yield increased by 8.46% and 23.47%, and maize yield by 18% and 15.46%, respectively. Biogas slurry increased the content of crude protein and starch in the grains. Both biogas slurry and peanut-shell biochar improved fluvo-aquic soil nutrient content, water-stable macroaggregates, and microbial population, which might be related to their high nutrient content, large specific surface area, adsorption capacity, and functional groups. Biogas slurry generally exhibited stronger effects than biochar probably because of its richness in nutrients and bioactive substances. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) is a fast-growing, drought tolerant tree which has recently been identified as one of the prospective sources of biodiesel and one of the plants which can play a prominent role in the fight against desertification. In order to accelerate the commercialization of M. oleifera-based biodiesel, this paper develops a two-stage optimization model for the design of an efficient M. oleifera biomass to biodiesel supply chain. In the first stage, a common weight data envelopment analysis (CWDEA) model is utilized to rank locations threatened by desertification and land degradation. The locations with high vulnerability are introduced as candidate locations into the second stage in which a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to systematically design and optimize the entire supply chain and determine the optimal strategic and tactical supply chain decisions. To illustrate the application of the developed model, a case study in semi-arid lands of Iran is conducted. The results indicate that M. oleifera biodiesel production is not competitive with petroleum-based fuels but there is considerable room for cost reduction through improvement in M. oleifera productivity and oil conversion rate. Moreover, the areas at risk of desertification can be reclaimed by an increase of only 5% in the total supply chain cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impact of torrefaction on the NO and SO2 emissions from combustion of biomass was investigated. Combustion experiments were carried out with two torrefied biomass fuels, i.e., poultry litter and olive tree pruning and their blends with lignite using a bench scale single particle reactor. For comparison, NO and SO2 emissions from tests with untorrefied biomasses and their blends with lignite were also investigated. The total release of SO2 and NO for each fuel was determined at three different temperatures: 900, 1000, and 1100 °C. The NO release from the untorrefied biomasses was found to be lower than those from torrefied biomasses, despite their higher fuel- N content. In case of co-combustion of both raw and torrefied biomass with lignite, the NO release was lower than the anticipated one. On the other hand, in the co-combustion experiments, blends with torrefied biomass showed a larger reduction in SO2 release than the blends with raw biomass. The study revealed that the SO2 emissions from blends are not proportional to the mixing ratio of the fuels and to the emissions properties of the respective fuels. No clear correlation was detected between the NOx emissions and fuel-N content. In addition to the NO and SO2 emissions, the sintering propensity of the ash residue were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the potential application of defatted algal biomass (DAB) residue as a resource for biobased product synthesis in the biorefinery framework. Acid-catalyzed pretreatment of DAB residue resulted in higher reducing sugars (RS) solubilization (0.26 g RS/g DAB) than corresponding base method (0.19 g RS/g DAB). Subsequently, resulting RS were acidogenically fermented for the production of Bio-H2 and short chain carboxylic acids (SCA)/volatile fatty acids (VFA) at varying redox conditions (pH: 6, 7 and 10). Biosystem with pH-6 resulted in higher SCA (0.54 g SCA/g RS) and Bio-H2 production (0.83 l) followed by pH-10 (0.43 g SCA/g RS, 0.71 l) and pH-7 (0.27 g SCA/g RS, 0.48 l). Higher SCA production in pH-6 system resulted in maximum acidification (23%). Algal biomass majorly derived from CO2 and its residues after lipids extraction accounted as major feedstock for acidogenic product synthesis. Evaluation of these studies using DAB residues offers sustainability to algal refineries on its entirety use. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perennial grasses have received particular attention as bioenergy crops in recent years due to their high biomass productivity and environmental benefits. The objective of the present study was to compare four perennial grasses: miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Keng), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), giant reed (Arundo donax L.), and bulbous canary grass (Phalaris aquatica L.) in terms of biomass yield, energy balance, and biomass quality under four nitrogen fertilization rates (0, 100, 150, 200 kg ha–1y–1) and 2 harvest times (autumn, winter) over three growing seasons in the Mediterranean environment of Turkey. The crop biomass and net energy yields were optimized with none or 100 kg ha–1 y–1 N input in the study. Although the winter harvest resulted in significant yield reductions in all of the grass species, it improved the biomass quality of miscanthus, switchgrass, and giant reed due to reduced moisture and ash contents. On the contrary, the autumn harvest resulted in a considerably lower moisture and ash contents in bulbous canary grass, mainly because of leaf defoliation the during summer dormancy period. Giant reed produced the highest average biomass yield (between 12.86 and 36.78 t ha–1) over the three years, followed by miscanthus (between 12.75 and 23.54 t ha–1), switchgrass (between 11.88 and 18.91 t ha–1), and bulbous canary grass (between 5.21 and 10.83 t ha–1). On the other hand, bulbous canary grass provided the highest average energy ratio (19.7–64.5) over the three years, due mainly to a lack of energy input for irrigation. These results suggest that satisfactory biomass production can be achievable from miscanthus, switchgrass, and giant reed in the semi-arid Mediterranean environment under adequate moist conditions, but the irrigation requirement increases the energy cost, thus decreasing the energy ratio. In this respect, bulbous canary grass may be evaluated as an alternative bioenergy crop in the dry marginal lands of Mediterranean for sustainable biomass production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Throwing longstanding habits over the pile may be necessary to improve biogas production, in particular when it comes to the process temperature. Its effect on biogas production was investigated with lab-scale reactors operated in fed-batch mode (cattle slurry and maize straw) at 10–55 °C over six months. Biochemical and microbial changes were comprehensively investigated. Production was highest and most efficient at 45 °C with an average methane yield of 166 NL kg−1 VS, and thus 12.8% and 9.6% higher than at 37 and 55 °C. Temperature significantly affected the microbiota and higher temperature provoked a shift from Bacteroidetes/Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. A transition from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic methanogenesis was observed from 10 to 45 °C, while the trend was reversed at 55 °C. The results contest the textbook notion of preferred and most efficient temperatures for AD and suggest reconsideration of the temperature range around 45 °C for efficient manure-based co-fermentation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decarbonization of the world's energy supply is essential to meet the targets of the 2016 Paris climate change agreement. One promising opportunity is the utilization of second generation, low input bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow. Research has previously been carried out on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of growing these feedstocks and land-use changes involved in converting conventional cropland to their production; however, there is almost no body of work understanding the costs associated with their end of life transitions back to conventional crops. It is likely that it is during crop interventions and land-use transitions that significant GHG fluxes might occur. Therefore, in this study, we investigated soil GHG fluxes over 82 weeks during transition from Miscanthus and SRC willow into perennial ryegrass in west Wales, UK. This study captured soil GHG fluxes at a weekly time step, alongside monthly changes in soil nitrogen and labile carbon and reports the results of regression modelling of suspected drivers. Methane fluxes were typically trivial; however, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were notably affected, reverted plots produced significantly more N2O than retained controls and Miscanthus produced significantly higher fluxes overall than willow plots. N2O costs of reversion appeared to be contained within the first year of reversion when the Miscanthus plots produced an average pregrass flux of 0.13 mg N2O m−2 hr−1 while for willow, this was 0.03 mg N2O m−2 hr−1. Total N2O emission from reversion increased the carbon cost over the lifetime of the Miscanthus from 6.50 to 9.91 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 while for the willow, this increase was from 9.61 to 10.42 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1. Despite these significant increases, the carbon cost of energy contained in these perennial crops remained far lower than the equivalent carbon cost of energy in coal. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The ability to accurately predict changes of the carbon and energy balance on a regional scale is of great importance for assessing the effect of land use changes on carbon sequestration under future climate conditions. Here, a suite of land cover-specific Distributed Time Delay Neural Networks with a parameter adoption algorithm optimized through Bayesian regularization was used to model the statewide atmospheric exchange of CO2, water vapor, and energy in Oregon with its strong spatial gradients of climate and land cover. The network models were trained with eddy covariance data from 9 atmospheric flux towers. Compared to results derived with more common regression networks utilizing non-delayed input vectors, the performance of the DTDNN models was significantly improved with an average increase of the coefficients of determination of 64%. The optimized models were applied in combination with downscaled climate projections of the CMIP5 project to calculate future changes in the cycle of carbon, associated with a prescribed conversion of conventional grass-crops to hybrid poplar plantations for biofuel production in Oregon. The results show that under future RCP8.5 climate conditions the total statewide NEP increases by 0.87 TgC per decade until 2050 without any land use changes. With all non-forage grass completely converted to hybrid poplar the NEP averages 32.9 TgC in 2046–2050, an increase of 9%. Through comparisons with the results of a Bayesians inversion study, the results presented demonstrate that DTDNN models are a specifically well-suited approach to use the available data from flux networks to assess changes in biosphere–atmosphere exchange triggered by massive land use conversion superimposed on a changing climate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Numerous studies predict a short-term important decrease in fossil resources and stress the need to develop alternative renewable energies, thus European countries aim at increasing biomass production for energetic purposes. One such source of bioenergy could be obtained from forest biomass pools by exporting logging residues, yet this practice would have strong impacts on forest ecosystems (e.g. disturbance of soil biodiversity and chemical properties). Most studies on biomass removal effects focused on boreal forests but responses in temperate forests are still scarcely studied. Soil macrofauna is involved in forest ecosystem functioning through numerous chemical, physical and biological processes and multiple interactions with other organisms. A disturbance of the soil macrofauna community can thus lead to a response of the forest ecosystem as a whole. Experimental plots were set up in 6 northern France forests (either dominated by oak or beech), with a treatment corresponding to Whole Tree Harvesting (WTH) practices compared to control, in order to characterize the response of soil macrofaunal communities to organic matter (OM) export. Our study showed that OM export leads to a short-term loss of abundance in macrofaunal communities in temperate deciduous forest soils that can also lead to an alteration of soil OM cycle, and revealed that the breadth of this negative impact is modulated by tree species and faunal trophic groups. Furthermore, some results of community responses were directly applicable to forest management as marked responses of several taxa revealed four bioindicators of OM disturbance. Therefore, the level of disturbance related to new forest management practices, such as WTH to increase forest biofuel yields, (i) could be characterized by surveying either total soil macrofauna or using tools such as bioindicator taxa and (ii) should be assessed regarding tree stand identity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We analyze the costs of CO2 emissions mitigation measures available to aviation using a global aviation systems model. In that context, we discuss the relationship between mitigation potential and scenario characteristics, and how these interact with policy measures that increase the effective price of fuel, for example, ICAO’s CORSIA emissions offset scheme. We find that global fuel lifecycle CO2 emissions per revenue passenger km could be reduced by 1.9% to 3.0% per year on average by the use of a combination of cost-effective measures, for oil prices which reach $75 to $185 per barrel by 2050. Smaller additional emissions reductions, of the order of 0.1% per year, are possible if carbon prices of $50 to $150/tCO2 are assumed by 2050. These outcomes strongly depend on assumptions about biofuels, which account for about half of the reduction potential by 2050. Absolute reductions in emissions are limited by the relative lack of mitigation options for long-haul flights, coupled with strong demand growth. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.

AB  - Low-carbon transitions in whole systems (in energy, mobility, agro-food) are an important, yet understudied topic in socio-technical transition research. To address this topic, the paper builds on the Multi-Level Perspective, but stretches it to address developments in multiple regimes and multiple niche-innovations. This ‘zooming out’ strategy changes the conceptualisation of transition dynamics from bottom-up disruption (driven by singular niche-innovations) to gradual system reconfiguration, which represents a more distributed, multi-source view of change that includes cumulative incremental regime change, shifts in relative sizes of regimes, regime alignments, component substitution, and symbiotic adoption. To illustrate the reconfiguration approach and empirically explore the topic of whole system change, the paper investigates unfolding trajectories in UK passenger mobility. This analysis, which addresses developments in auto-mobility, train, bus and cycling regimes and five niche-innovations (biofuels, electric vehicles, smart cards, compact cities, home working), aims to assess if and how the mobility system is reconfiguring in low-carbon directions. It also aims to provide an interpretive assessment of the 12.7% decrease in domestic transport-related CO2-emissions between 2007 and 2013. This decrease is attributed to reduced auto-mobility (due to the financial-economic crisis), incremental engine efficiency improvements in new cars, some modal shift from cars to trains, and biofuels. Radical niche-innovations (smart cards, compact cities, electric vehicles) did not (yet) greatly contribute to emission reductions. CO2-emissions increased again since 2014, which suggests that further low-carbon transitions require deeper system reconfiguration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Duckweed is a valuable feedstock for bioethanol production due to its high biomass and starch accumulation. In our preliminary experiment, we found that abscisic acid (ABA) could simultaneously increase starch and biomass accumulation of duckweed, but the mechanisms are still unclear. The results showed that the biomass production of duckweed reached up to 59.70 and 63.93 g m-2 in 6 days, respectively, with an increase of 7% (P &lt; 0.05) compared to the control. The starch percentage increased from 2.29% up to 46.18% after 14 days of treatment, with a total of starch level 2.6-fold higher than that of the control. Moreover, the level of endogenous ABA, zeatin-riboside (ZR) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) increased, while gibberellins (GAs) decreased. Notably, ABA content in treated samples reached 336.5 mg/kg (fresh weight), which was 7.5-fold greater than that of the control. Importantly, the enzyme activities involved in starch biosynthesis increased while those catalyzing starch degradation decreased after ABA application. Taken together, these results indicated that ABA can promote biomass and starch accumulation by regulating endogenous hormone levels and the activity of starch metabolism related key enzymes. These results will provide an operable method for high starch accumulation in duckweed for biofuels production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Non-food biomass production is developing rapidly to fuel the bioenergy sector and substitute dwindling fossil resources, which is likely to impact land-use patterns worldwide. Recent publications attempting to factor this effect into the climate mitigation potential of bioenergy chains have come to widely variable conclusions depending on their scope, data sources or methodology. Here, we conducted a first of its kind, systematic review of scientific literature on this topic and derived quantitative trends through a meta-analysis. We showed that second-generation biofuels and bioelectricity have a larger greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement potential than first generation biofuels, and stand the best chances (with a 80 to 90% probability range) of achieving a 50% reduction compared to fossil fuels. Conversely, directly converting forest ecosystems to produce bioenergy feedstock appeared as the worst-case scenario, systematically leading to negative GHG savings. On the other hand, converting grassland appeared to be a better option and entailed a 60% chance of halving GHG emissions compared to fossil energy sources. Since most climate mitigation scenarios assume still larger savings, it is critical to gain better insight into land-use change effects to provide a more realistic estimate of the mitigation potential associated with bioenergy. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In Minnesota, technological and economic shifts in the grain supply chain have altered the way grain producers and sellers navigate their local freight network. In particular, many producers have been increasing their personal trucking capacity and taking longer trips to intermodal and domestic market options. This logistical reshaping of local grain supply chains pressure transportation officials to reconsider the consequences for road infrastructure and congested freight corridors. Studies are discussing the potential of disaggregated commodity flow survey (CFS) data as a critical tool in understanding small-scale freight movement and informing infrastructural investment decisions. Utilizing ArcGIS’s Network Analyst and Hot spot tools to analyze inter-county grain trucking, our study effectively differentiates highly active freight corridors. The model is used to further inform an ongoing infrastructure development project in the Twin Cities metro area by contextualizing road usage within the economic framework of the grain supply chain. However, this study finds CFS data alone fails to account for shifting supply chain conditions, and their consequent impact on the road network. Employing United States Department of Agriculture crop production and cropland data, this study additionally builds an original, computational model that simulates corn producer shipment reaction to market price competition within two key grain-producing counties. Results visualize how producers, during spot months, may be incentivized to haul longer distances to more competitive markets—especially emerging biofuel industries. This lesson proves crucial for state and local transportation officials who wish to identify freight infrastructure development opportunities that invigorate and accommodate growth in Minnesota’s expanding agricultural industry cluster. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.

AB  - This work was focused on evaluating two mixtures of lignocellulosic feedstock, forest and marginal land resources, in order to co-produce solid biofuel, oligosaccharides, and glucose under a biorefinery concept. The selection of renewable bio-mixtures was based on different criteria, namely, territorial distribution, fire risk during summer months and total sugar content. The two mixtures were submitted to autohydrolysis pretreatment under non-isothermal conditions (in the range of 190 °C - 240 °C corresponding to severity of 3.71–4.82). Both mixtures were compared in terms of fractionation (cellulose and lignin recoveries and hemicellulose solubilization), analyzed for thermal properties (high heating values) and for enzymatic susceptibility of cellulose. The highest xylan recoveries (62 and 69%), as xylose and xylooligosaccharides, were achieved for both mixtures in the liquid phase at 206 °C. Autohydrolysis pretreatment increased the high heating values of the two mixtures presenting an alternative use of solid fraction as solid biofuel. Moreover, enzymatic susceptibility of these pretreated mixtures was also improved from 45 to 90% of glucose yield by increasing pretreatment severity. This comparative study of autohydrolysis showed a suitable process for the valorization of both mixtures within a biorefinery concept. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ability of thermophilic microorganisms and their enzymes to decompose biomass have attracted attention due to their quick reaction time, thermostability, and decreased risk of contamination. Exploitation of efficient thermostable glycoside hydrolases (GHs) could accelerate the industrialization of biofuels and biochemicals. However, the full spectrum of thermophiles and their enzymes that are important for biomass degradation at high temperatures have not yet been thoroughly studied. We examined a Malaysian Y-shaped Sungai Klah hot spring located within a wooded area. The fallen foliage that formed a thick layer of biomass bed under the heated water of the Y-shaped Sungai Klah hot spring was an ideal environment for the discovery and analysis of microbial biomass decay communities. We sequenced the hypervariable regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes using total community DNA extracted from the hot spring. Data suggested that 25 phyla, 58 classes, 110 orders, 171 families, and 328 genera inhabited this hot spring. Among the detected genera, members of Acidimicrobium, Aeropyrum, Caldilinea, Caldisphaera, Chloracidobacterium, Chloroflexus, Desulfurobacterium, Fervidobacterium, Geobacillus, Meiothermus, Melioribacter, Methanothermococcus, Methanotorris, Roseiflexus, Thermoanaerobacter, Thermoanaerobacterium, Thermoanaerobaculum, and Thermosipho were the main thermophiles containing various GHs that play an important role in cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown. Collectively, the results suggest that the microbial community in this hot spring represents a good source for isolating efficient biomass degrading thermophiles and thermozymes. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Xylanase with a high thermostability will satisfy the needs of raising the temperature of hydrolysis to improve the rheology of the broth in industry of biomass conversion. In this study, a xylanase gene (xyn10A), predicted to encode a hydrolase domain of GH10, a linker region and a CBM1 domain, was cloned from a superior lignocellulose degrading strain Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. Xyn10A has a specific xylanase activity of 34.4 U mg−1, and is optimally active at 90 °C and pH 6.0. Xyn10A shows quite stable at pHs ranging from 3.0 to 11.0, and keeps over 40% of xylanase activity after incubation at 70 °C for 1 h. Removal of CBM1 domain has a slight negative effect on its thermostability, but the further cleavage of linker region significantly decreased its stability at high temperature. The transfer of CBM1 and linker region to another GH10 xylanase can help to increase the thermostability. In addition, hydrolase domains between the two Xyn10A proteins naturally formed a dimer structure, which became more thermostable after removing the CBM1 or/and linker region. This thermostable Xyn10A is a suitable candidate for the highly efficient fungal enzyme cocktails for biomass conversion. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The Kashmir Valley in India is one of the world's major tourist attractions and perceived as a pristine environment. Long term monitoring of fine particulate matter, PM2.5 (particles having aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less), responsible for deteriorating human health, has been done for the period 2013-14. Results indicate that air quality of the capital city Srinagar (34.1°N, 74.8°E) deteriorates significantly in particular during winter, where level of PM2.5 touches a peak value of 348 μg/m3 against the Indian permissible limit of 60 μg/m3. The emissions due to domestic coal usage are found to be 1246.4 tons/yr, which accounts for 84% of the total annual emissions. The on-line high-resolution weather research and forecasting model with embedded chemistry module (WRF-Chem), which accounts for emission inventory developed in this region reproduced the seasonal variability reasonably well. Cold temperatures with dry conditions along with elevated level of biofuel emissions from domestic sector are found to be the major processes responsible for winter period particulate pollution. The back trajectories show that westerly winds originating from Afghanistan and surrounding areas also contribute to the high PM2.5 levels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels vary greatly in their carbon intensity, depending on the specifics of how they are produced. Policy frameworks are needed to ensure that biofuels actually achieve intended reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Current approaches do not account for important variables during cultivation that influence emissions. Estimating emissions based on biogeochemical models would allow accounting of farm-specific conditions, which in turn provides an incentive for producers to adopt low emissions practices. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the application of biogeochemical models. This paper proposes a policy framework that manages this uncertainty while retaining the ability of the models to account for (and hence incentivize) low emissions practices. The proposed framework is demonstrated on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the cultivation of winter barley. The framework aggregates uncertainties over time, which (1) avoids penalizing producers for uncertainty in weather, (2) allows for a high degree of confidence in the emissions reductions achieved, and (3) attenuates the uncertainty penalties borne by producers within a timescale of several years. Results indicate that with effective management, N2O emissions from feedstock cultivation may be &lt; 5% of the carbon intensity of gasoline, whereas the existing policy approach estimates emissions &gt; 20% of the carbon intensity of gasoline. If these emissions reductions are monetized, the framework can provide up to $0.002 per liter credits (0.8 cents per gallon) to fuel producers, which could incentivize emissions mitigation practices by biofuel feedstock suppliers, such as avoiding fall N application on silty clay loam soils. The conservatism in the current approach fails to incentivize the adoption of biofuels, while the lack of specificity fails to incentivize site-level mitigation practices. Improved uncertainty accounting and consideration of farm-level practices will incentivize mitigation efforts at landscape to global scales. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.

AB  - Several global narratives around resource insecurities have reached the Mekong Region. In the latest reincarnation, experts, bureaucrats and businesses have called for greater attention to a water-energy-food nexus. It is not clear however, if they are talking about the same thing, with the same purpose or that decision-makers are listening. The purpose of this study was to identify the key features of nexus narratives globally, and then analyze how they are being used in the Mekong Region. We used the Narrative Policy Framework to explore narrative content and strategies, and Cultural Theory to help identify policy beliefs of competing coalitions in a mixed-methods analysis. Increasing resource scarcity, which undermines security, was a shared setting in all nexus narratives. Individualist and Hierarchist narratives tend to de-politicize the nexus by promising solutions from innovative businesses and free markets, or through technocratic and managerial control of resources and the environment by bureaucrats. Egalitarian narratives identify victims and villains to re-politicize the nexus around themes of justice and human security. Nexus narratives were used to support and oppose hydropower, irrigation and biofuel development, with Individualist narratives consistently being the most pro-development. Nexus narratives have been widely adopted by international organizations and foreign experts working in the Mekong Region; however, with a few exceptions, they have as of yet had little direct influence on national policy or plans. Several possible reasons are discussed, including limitations of the concept itself. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Power generation from biomass is mentioned as a means to make our society more sustainable as it decreases greenhouse gas emissions of fossil origin and reduces the dependency on finite energy carriers, such as coal, oil and natural gas. When assessing the sustainability of power generation from biomass, it is important to consider the supply chain of the used biofuel by conducting a life cycle assessment of the system. Besides regular sustainability assessments, such as the calculation of the environmental sustainability, attention should be paid to exergy losses, i.e. the loss of ‘energy quality’ caused by the system as a whole, because every process and activity is accompanied with the loss of exergy and because the amount of exergy on earth can only be replenished by capturing new exergy from solar and tidal energy. This research compares the use of livestock manure and verge grass for power generation by assessing the systems from an environmental as well as an exergetic life cycle point of view. The assessed systems are the following: combustion of bioethanol from the fermentation of verge grass, combustion of substitute natural gas from anaerobic digestion of cow and pig manure and combustion of substitute natural gas from supercritical water gasification of cow and pig manure. The environmental sustainability is assessed by calculating ReCiPe endpoint indicators and the exergetic sustainability is assessed by applying the relatively new Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method. The TCExL method considers all exergy losses caused by a technological system during its life cycle, i.e. the internal exergy loss caused by the conversion of materials and energy, the abatement of emissions and the exergy loss related to land use. In addition to comparing the three systems as well as both assessment methods, the influence of taking into account the system's by-products as ‘avoided products’ and via ‘allocation’ on the assessment results is investigated. The bioethanol system appears more sustainable from an environmental sustainability point of view, while the bioethanol and supercritical water gasification systems are preferred from an exergetic sustainability point of view. The indicator of the environmental sustainability assessment is highly influenced by the way of taking into account by-products, while the exergetic sustainability indicator is not. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The paper presents the methodology and the case studies for condition of the Czech Republic of BICOM - BIomass COmpetitiveness Model. The model consists of the following modules: (1) the identification of a biomass potential in a given area using GIS modelling (based on climate and soil conditions), (2) modelling the biomass price (using the methodology of the minimum price from the producer's point of view and evaluating the opportunity cost of conventional agriculture production), (3) modelling the biomass processing and logistics, (4) modelling economic competitiveness of the biomass and coal utilization. Typical price range (without VAT) is 6.9–9.8 EUR/GJ for pellets produced from residual biomass and 7.6–12.4 EUR/GJ for pellets produced from energy crops based on our calculations. Typical price range of coal suitable for local heating is 4.8–5.5 EUR/GJ (without VAT). To reach competitiveness of locally produced solid biofuels introduction would be needed of combination of measures aimed at reduction of minimum price of produced pellets (e.g. subsidies for pelleting technology, improved yields and lower losses) and some measures aimed at restrictions imposed on brown coal (e.g. increase of ecological tax). Saved carbon is calculated for replacement of brown coal by pellets from local biomass, which could be used as argument and benchmark for subsidies targeted on the solid biofuels production from local biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sugarcane sector in Brazil has undergone a major modernization in the last thirty years. Embracing the biorefinery concept, this sector is investigating bioproduct diversification and mostly putting a lot of effort and investment on second generation ethanol production. In this context, the investigation of the integration of a third generation biofuel production using microalgae to the sugarcane biorefinery seems an important starting point. This study evaluates the integration of microalgae growth and processing to a sugarcane biorefinery producing first and second generation ethanol using process simulation tools. Microalgae are cultivated using CO2 produced during fermentation of ethanol and it is processed using supercritical fluid extraction technology in order to obtain lipids rich in high added-value compounds, carotenoids. The results showed that the integration of microalgae biomass processing without previously drying with the sugarcane biorefinery is not attractive from the thermo-economic point. When considering the extraction of dried microalgae the extraction process could be thermal integrated to the sugarcane biorefinery producing ethanol without the need of buying external fuel. The amount of CO2 used as solvent to the supercritical fluid extraction was the main factor that influenced the economic viability of the process. When microalgae pretreatment by cell disruption or co-solvent extraction was considered, it was possible to decrease the amount of CO2 used in the process and an increase in process yields was consequently achieved. The use of a co-solvent in the extraction increased in 1.4 and 2.4 times lipids and carotenoids extraction, respectively, and presented a lower investment when comparing with microalgae extraction without cell disruption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In arid and semi-arid climates, Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) is a potential plant to produce oilseed-based biofuels. In this paper an optimization model for a wild biomass supply chain is presented. The model was developed to identify the optimal organization of the supply network that minimizes the cost of supplying the feedstock. It was applied to a case study on a B. aegyptiaca seed supply chain in Burkina Faso. Considering different means of transport and different pre-processing locations, the results show that in contexts such as Burkina Faso's, the most efficient option for the supply of B. aegyptiaca seeds is using animal drawn carts to transport the biomass from the harvest sites to the collection points. Feedstock pre-processing should take place before transport and an improvement in pre-processing operations by mechanical de-hulling could help reduce the cost price of the seeds. The results also show that more than 35% of the cost price of B. aegyptiaca seed is accounted for by transport costs. Pre-processing, handling, and storage costs account for about 50% of the cost of the seeds. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgal biomass is currently recognized as a promising sustainable source for biofuel production and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration. Utilization of biophysical models are emerging to access the real-time feasibility of microalgal technology. In this present work, a comprehensive mathematical model based on the site-specific meteorological variables is formulated using MATLAB ODE 45 s solver to estimate the microalgal productivity. The predictive model framework utilized material balance equations with basic laws of physics, known constants and conservative assumptions to evaluate the water temperature that influences the microalgal viability. The dynamic behaviour of algal ponds considering the operating variables like light intensity (including the effects of photoinhibition), water temperature, and design criteria like pond depth, microalgal concentration, was used to estimate the performance of T. pseudonana in open ponds. Maximum growth was projected in September accounting to the biomass and lipid productivity of 170.28 kg (dry mass) ha−1 d−1 and 39.42 l ha−1 d−1 respectively with a CO2 capture potential of 224.77 kg (CO2) ha−1 d−1 based on the influence of water temperature. Optimal pond depth and operational conditions to achieve the desired productivity for the specific site were estimated. The maximum annual areal productivity dropped by 19% from 62.18 tons (dry mass) ha−1 yr−1 due to photoinhibition. The simulated biophysical model as a tool could be used to evaluate the biokinetic processes affecting the algal pond performance for further facilitation of effective decision making on scaling up of microalgae cultivation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Acetogenic bacteria constitute promising biocatalysts for the conversion of CO 2 /H 2 or synthesis gas (H 2 /CO/CO 2 ) into biofuels and value-added biochemicals. These microorganisms are naturally capable of autotrophic growth via unique acetogenesis metabolism. Despite their biosynthetic potential for commercial applications, a systemic understanding of the transcriptional and translational regulation of the acetogenesis metabolism remains unclear. Results: By integrating genome-scale transcriptomic and translatomic data, we explored the regulatory logic of the acetogenesis to convert CO 2 into biomass and metabolites in Eubacterium limosum. The results indicate that majority of genes associated with autotrophic growth including the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, the reduction of electron carriers, the energy conservation system, and gluconeogenesis were transcriptionally upregulated. The translation efficiency of genes in cellular respiration and electron bifurcation was also highly enhanced. In contrast, the transcriptionally abundant genes involved in the carbonyl branch of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, as well as the ion-translocating complex and ATP synthase complex in the energy conservation system, showed decreased translation efficiency. The translation efficiencies of genes were regulated by 5′UTR secondary structure under the autotrophic growth condition. Conclusions: The results illustrated that the acetogenic bacteria reallocate protein synthesis, focusing more on the translation of genes for the generation of reduced electron carriers via electron bifurcation, rather than on those for carbon metabolism under autotrophic growth. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Metabolic engineering has emerged as a potential strategy for improving microalgal lipid content through targeted changes to lipid metabolic networks. However, the intricate nature of lipogenesis has impeded metabolic engineering. Therefore, it is very important to identify the crucial metabolic nodes and develop strategies to exploit multiple genes for transgenesis. In an attempt to unravel the microalgal triacylglycerol (TAG) pathway, we overexpressed two key lipogenic genes, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT1) and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT1), in oleaginous Phaeodactylum tricornutum and determined their roles in microalgal lipogenesis. Results: Engineered P. tricornutum strains showed enhanced growth and photosynthetic efficiency compared with that of the wild-type during the growth phase of the cultivation period. However, both the cell types reached stationary phase on day 7. Overexpression of GPAT1 and LPAT1 increased the TAG content by 2.3-fold under nitrogen-replete conditions without compromising cell growth, and they also orchestrated the expression of other key genes involved in TAG synthesis. The transgenic expression of GPAT1 and LPAT1 influenced the expression of malic enzyme and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which enhanced the levels of lipogenic NADPH in the transgenic lines. In addition, GPAT1 and LPAT1 preferred C16 over C18 at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. Conclusion: Overexpression of GPAT1 together with LPAT1 significantly enhanced lipid content without affecting growth and photosynthetic efficiency, and they orchestrated the expression of other key photosynthetic and lipogenic genes. The lipid profile for elevated fatty acid content (C16-CoA) demonstrated the involvement of the prokaryotic TAG pathway in marine diatoms. The results suggested that engineering dual metabolic nodes should be possible in microalgal lipid metabolism. This study also provides the first demonstration of the role of the prokaryotic TAG biosynthetic pathway in lipid overproduction and indicates that the fatty acid profile can be tailored to improve lipid production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In the present work, we report a greener and efficient process of hydrothermal conversion of rice straw (Cd low accumulated crop) and Elsholtzia splendens (Cu accumulated plant) to recover the metals and simultaneously produce biofuel for harmless treatment and resource reuse. The impacts of different types of additives, raw materials/solvent ratios, reaction times, and temperatures are investigated, and the composition of solid phase left is also studied for future efficient use. As the results suggest, almost all enriched metals (95 ± 2% of Cu in E. splendens and almost all Cd in rice straw) are concentrated in solid phase after hydrothermal conversion with a considerable amount of carbohydrates contained, making the solid residue an excellent material for producing metal carbide catalysts. During the hydrothermal conversion, the additives have little impact on the metals recovery, and higher raw material/solvent ratios have higher yields of Cu/Cd. Finally, 22.0-25.0% yields of bio-oils without any metals are achieved with a high heating value (≥35.2 MJ/kg) for both types of plants. This work creates new opportunities for the full utilization of heavy metal accumulated plants to remediate heavy metal contaminated land without any waste and pollution.

AB  - Depleting fossil fuel, soaring prices, growing demand, and global climate change concerns have driven the research for finding an alternative source of sustainable fuel. Microalgae have emerged as a potential feedstock for biofuel production as many strains accumulate higher amounts of lipid, with faster biomass growth and higher photosynthetic yield than their land plant counterparts. In addition to this, microalgae can be cultured without needing agricultural land or ecological landscapes and offer opportunities for mitigating global climate change, allowing waste water treatment and carbon dioxide sequestration. Despite these benefits, microalgae pose many challenges, including low lipid yield under limiting growth conditions and slow growth in high lipid content strains. Biotechnological interventions can make major advances in strain improvement for the commercial scale production of biofuel. We discuss various strategies, including efficient transformation toolbox, to increase lipid accumulation and its quality through the regulation of key enzymes involved in lipid production, by blocking the competing pathways, pyramiding genes, enabling high cell biomass under nutrient-deprived conditions and other environmental stresses, and controlling the upstream regulators of targets, the transcription factors, and microRNAs. We highlight the opportunities emerging from the current progress in the application of genome editing in microalgae for accelerating the strain improvement program. © 2018 Sharma, Saharia, Srivstava, Kumar and Sahoo.

AB  - As the lignocellulosic biofuels industry is still developing, reducing operational, and capital costs along the supply chain can increase the competitiveness of the final fuel price and investor willingness to commit funds. Capital cost savings may be realized through co-locating depots with active biomass processing plants, such as saw mills, and through repurposing existing industrial facilities, such as pulp mills, into a biorefinery. Operational cost savings may be gained through the selective siting of depots and biorefineries based on operational cost components that vary geospatially, such as energy rates and feedstock availability. Utilizing depots in a biofuel supply chain to procure and preprocess feedstock has additionally been found to mitigate supply risk in regions of low biomass availability, as well as reduce the biorefinery footprint. A multi-criteria decision support tool (DST) is utilized to assess existing industrial facilities for their potential role in a wood-based depot-and-biorefinery supply chain. Geospatial cost components are identified through techno-economic analyses for use as siting criteria for the depots and biorefinery. The "repurpose potential" of industrial facilities is assessed as a siting criterion for candidate biorefinery locations. A case study is presented in the Inland Northwest region of the United States to assess the usefulness of the tool in selecting industrial facilities for a configured depot-and-biorefinery supply chain. The results are compared against optimization runs of the candidate facilities to validate the depots selected by the DST. In two of the three supply chains, the DST selected the same or similar facilities as the optimization run for no net increase in annual cost. The third supply chain showed an ~1% increase in annual cost over the optimized facilities selected. © 2018 Martinkus, Latta, Brandt and Wolcott.

AB  - Conversion of agricultural fields to bioenergy crops can affect greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Soil GHG emissions were measured seasonally in poplar bioenergy and agricultural fields at three Northwestern US locations. A forest stand was also used at one location for comparison. A portable gas analyzer was used to measure CO2 efflux and CH4 and N2O fluxes were first measured with chambers and later with gradients. Agricultural soil had 17% larger CO2 efflux rates than poplar soil. Chamber fluxes showed no differences in CH4 uptake but did show higher N2O fluxes in poplar than agricultural soil. Gradient CH4 uptake rates were highest in agricultural soil in the summer but showed no N2O flux differences. Forest soils had smaller quarterly CO2 efflux rates than agricultural soils and greater CH4 uptake rates than poplar soils. The largest GHG contributor to soil GHG flux was CO2, with those being ∼1000 times larger than CH4 flux rates and ∼500 times larger than N2O flux rates based on CO2 equivalences. Converting conventional agricultural cropland to poplar bioenergy production does not have adverse effects on soil greenhouse gas flux and these results could be useful for modeling or life cycle analysis of land use conversion. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using the pruning residues of woody crops can be beneficial in many ways (e.g., excellent energy balance, a net reduction in pollutant emission and a positive contribution to global warming control). This article describes the background work and development of a new support tool that will allow the user to know the amount and quality of pruning residue required to meet the energy requirements to heat both residential and agro-industrial buildings (e.g., greenhouses). Knowing the average amount of pruned biomass (t d.m. ha-1), the average lower heating value of wood (4.00 kWh kg-1) and the average efficiency of a woody biomass boiler (90%) enabled the overall available net energy yearly amount (kWh year-1) to be determined. This was compared to the overall energy requirements (kWh year-1) of agro-industrial buildings, which are a result of their main features (e.g., maximum heatable surface, building energy classification and the climatic zone). Depending on user needs, the tool suggests the amount of required biomass and, if not entirely available, what amount of fossil fuels are required to fulfill the energy requirement. The algorithm output was compared with the results of two case studies carried out on seven farm buildings and nine greenhouses. Knowing the amount and energy potential of the available biomass allows for planning and evaluation of the planned benefits. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is recognized as one of the important non-edible tree borne oilseeds (TBOs) in India and many other tropical countries. J. curcas is a promising bioenergy crop as its seed oil is a suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. This study focused on a total of 19 J. curcas accessions for seed oil extraction, oil quality analysis and fatty acid composition. Most of the accessions showed more than 30% oil content with free fatty acid content ranging from 0.21 to 1.82%. The oil samples were transesterified efficiently to fatty acid methyl esters as evident from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra. As revealed by gas chromatography, the contents of the four major fatty acids were found to significantly vary in the seed oils viz Palmitic acid (8.64–17.05%), stearic acid (4.34–7.94%), oleic acid (26.26–46.36%) and linoleic acid (28.72–53.78%). A number of seed oils showed high level of oleic acid (40.02–46.36%), and some other oil samples were rich in linoleic acid (∼45%). These J. curcas accessions appeared to be promising with regard to clonal propagation, field trials, large-scale plantations for biodiesel feedstocks, other industrial applications, and also as prebreeding materials in crop improvement programs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although mustards are ideal rotational crops in moisture-limited environments, biofuels production from mustard seed isn't economically feasible unless the de-oiled seed meal is used to generate co-products. 4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) derived from Sinapis alba (yellow mustard) seed meal is a potentially high value co-product that acts as a skin lightening agent. With increasing demand for skin lightening agents, there is need for the development of alternative products preferably derived from what are perceived as renewable, safer natural materials. Although HBA is known to have inhibitory activity on the tyrosinase reaction by reducing melanin production, the use of HBA from S. alba, a widely grown agricultural crop, has not been described. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of an HBA-containing S. alba extract to act as an inhibitor for the tyrosinase reaction by 1) optimizing the conditions for production and recovery of HBA from S. alba seed meal and 2) quantifying the inhibitory effect of S. alba seed meal extracts on the tyrosinase-activated reaction of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). The optimized procedure to produce an S. alba mustard seed meal extract with an HBA concentration of 2 mM included using ground mustard meal, 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 3.8), and a 24-h incubation. The calculated IC50 value for the S. alba extract is equivalent to 6.0 μM demonstrating that potency of the extract is comparable to that achieved using standard skin lightening agents. The procedure for HBA extraction from seed meal is relatively rapid and does not require sophisticated equipment or solvent systems, making it easily adapted to large scale industrial processing facilities. The potential thus exists to use a feedstock that is readily available from an agriculturally important oilseed crop to produce HBA as a natural tyrosinase inhibitor. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) can be used to recover nutrients from waste streams by isolating its phases. Here, we present a phase-restricted AD system (phase I only) for Phosphorus (P) release, production of Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA), ammonia (as NH4+) and biogas by digesting Chlorella vulgaris grown on agricultural waste-water using sewage sludge as inoculum. In our phase I AD system, we observed that changing the digester hydraulic retention time (HRT) altered the P, NH4+ and VFA concentrations in the effluent and biogas production. The reactor operated at 10 days HRT released maximum inorganic P (orthophosphate) in the effluent with a value of 199 ± 1 mg/L, the highest amongst considered HRTs. Maximum N in the phase-restricted AD system was observed at 14 days HRT with a final concentration of 118 ± 1 mg NH4+/L. However, the value was exceeded by a single-stage two-phase positive control batch reactor with a value of 350 ± 0.2 mg NH4+/L. The Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis indicated that VFA were present in all phase I AD reactors, with the 10 days HRT digester featuring the highest concentration at 233 mg/L. Furthermore, the phase-restricted AD approach had a positive impact on biogas generation. The 14 days HRT digester exhibited the greatest biogas production at 522 ± 1 mL in the digester's headspace, followed by the 10 days HRT. The results of the study have established that anaerobic digesters operated at phase I with microalgae could be a promising approach for harvesting nutrients and generating biofuels in a green bioremediation system. © 2018

AB  - 454-Pyrosequencing and lipid fingerprinting were used to link anaerobic digestion (AD) process parameters (pH, alkalinity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biogas production and methane content) with the reactor microbial community structure and composition. AD microbial communities underwent stress conditions after changes in organic loading rate and digestion substrates. 454-Pyrosequencing analysis showed that, irrespectively of the substrate digested, methane content and pH were always significantly, and positively, correlated with community evenness. In AD, microbial communities with more even distributions of diversity are able to use parallel metabolic pathways and have greater functional stability; hence, they are capable of adapting and responding to disturbances. In all reactors, a decrease in methane content to <30% was always correlated with a 50% increase of Firmicutes sequences (particularly in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to Ruminococcaceae and Veillonellaceae). Whereas digesters producing higher methane content (above 60%), contained a high number of sequences related to Synergistetes and unidentified bacterial OTUs. Finally, lipid fingerprinting demonstrated that, under stress, the decrease in archaeal biomass was higher than the bacterial one, and that archaeal Phospholipid etherlipids (PLEL) levels were correlated to reactor performances. These results demonstrate that, across a number of parameters such as lipids, alpha and beta diversity, and OTUs, knowledge of the microbial community structure can be used to predict, monitor, or optimise AD performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents a thermoeconomic and environmental assessment of the extraction of lipids and proteins from wet microalgal biomass in a 3G biorefinery by two different technologies: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE). Simulation tools were used to study a sugarcane biorefinery producing ethanol from sugarcane juice (1G) and bagasse (2G); the microalgal growth in an open pond; and the processing of microalgal biomass into lipids, proteins and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of microalgal biomass enables an increase in biofuel production of 10.2% MJ when no extraction process is considered and of 1.9% MJ when LPSE is considered. The heat demand of the proposed biorefinery with LPSE was increased by 87.8% compared with the demand of the sugarcane biorefinery without microalgal growth and processing. When the SFE process is considered, the heat demand of the overall process increased 3.2 times. SFE for wet microalgae processing is not economically attractive, as it increases the total investment by 71%. The CO2 flow used in the SFE process demonstrated to be a key factor in the thermoeconomic viability of the process. Regarding the wet processing of microalgae prior to SCWG, the best alternative studied was the use of LPSE technology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This contribution examines two large-scale land acquisitions on Peru’s northern coast, using a ‘land–water nexus’ approach. The establishment of large sugarcane monocultures resulted in a massive transfer of land and water rights from smallholders to biofuel companies. Using Ribot and Peluso’s theory of access, we demonstrate that this transfer of rights was enabled by the convergence of neoliberal land and water reforms and the presence of the two investors. This constellation (1) altered smallholders’ bundles of rights; and (2) created sharp imbalances that radically changed access to land and water, not only through changing bundles of rights, but also, and maybe more significantly, through widening the gaps between smallholders’ and biofuel companies’ bundles of powers. Using Hall et al.’s powers of exclusion approach, we identify the processes both underpinning and resulting out of the changing access relations analyzed in this study. Changes to Peru’s water governance may accentuate power asymmetries between investors and smallholders, constraining locals’ access to increasingly scarce water. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The European Union (EU) stands at a crossroads regarding its biofuel policies. For more than a decade, the EU sought to create a market for and govern sustainable biofuels for the transport sector, even as debates over sustainability escalated. It did so by devising novel hybrid (public and private) governance arrangements. We took stock of the nature and outcomes of this experiment in hybrid biofuel governance. We relied on qualitative methods of analysis, whereby we reviewed and synthesized the evolution of EU biofuel governance arrangements over time, through detailed document analysis of secondary and primary literature, including EU and related policy documents and private certification scheme websites. Our analysis reveals that, instead of yielding an increasingly stringent sustainability framework, the hybrid EU governance arrangements resulted in a proliferation of relatively lax, industry-driven, sustainability standards, even as the notion of "sustainable biofuels" remained contested in public and political debate. These findings contribute to an ongoing debate about the merits of hybrid (public-private) governance arrangements, and whether a hybrid approach helps strengthen or weaken sustainability objectives. We conclude that a more stringent EU meta-standard on sustainability needs to be developed, to underpin future governance arrangements. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process is a method for the conversion of alcohols to an alternative jet fuel blendstock based on catalytic steps historically utilized by the petroleum refining and petrochemical industry. This pathway provides a means for producing a sustainable alternative jet fuel (SAJF) from a wide variety of resources and offers a near-term opportunity for alcohol producers to enter the SAJF market and for the aviation sector to meet growing SAJF demand. Herein, the technical background is reviewed and selected variations of ATJ processes evaluated. Simulation and modeling were employed to assess some ATJ conversion schemes, with a particular focus on comparisons between the use of an ethanol or isobutanol intermediate. Although the utilization of isobutanol offers a 34 % lower conversion cost for the catalytic upgrading process, the cost of alcohol production is estimated to contribute more than 80 % of the total cost at the refinery. The cost of feedstock and alcohol production has a dominant effect on the overall process economics. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This work proposes a multiobjective robust possibilistic programming (MORPP) model for the design and planning of a multiperiod multifeedstock lignocellulosic biofuel supply chain (LBSC) network under the epistemic uncertainty of the input data. The objective simultaneously considers economic, environmental, and social aspects. The proposed model determines the optimal location, capacity, and conversion technology of biorefineries, appropriate transportation modes, material flow, and production planning. In order to deal with the inherent uncertainty of input parameters, a hybrid robust possibilistic programming (HRPP) approach is applied. A real case study located in Iran is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the model. On the basis of the DMs' preferences HRPP-I(c) version of the robust model is recognized as the most suitable one. Also, a number of scenarios are defined, and some valuable managerial implications are drawn. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The international market of woody biomass for bioenergy is expected to have a major role in future global scenarios aligning with a 2 or 1.5 °C target. However, the quantification of the environmental impacts of energy and transportation services from novel technologies and biomass production systems are yet to be extensively studied on a case-specific basis. We use a life cycle assessment approach to quantify environmental impacts of four bioenergy systems based on eucalyptus plantations established in abandoned pastureland in Brazil. The alternative bioenergy systems deliver energy and transportation services in Europe (cradle-to-gate analysis), including modern technologies for production of heat, electricity (with and without carbon capture and storage), and advanced liquid biofuels. We find that all bioenergy systems can achieve sizeable climate benefits, but in some cases at increased pressure in other impact categories. The most impacting activities are biomass transport stages, followed by eucalyptus stand establishment, and pellet production. An estimate of the potential large-scale bioenergy deployment of eucalyptus established in marginal areas in Brazil shows that up to 7 EJ of heat, 2.5 EJ of electricity, or 5 EJ of transportation biofuels per year can be delivered. This corresponds to a climate mitigation potential between 0.9% and 2.4% (0.29 and 0.83 GtCO2 per year) of the global anthropogenic emissions in 2015, and between 5.7% and 16% of European emissions, depending on the specific bioenergy system considered. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the best environmental performance is achieved with on-site biomass storage, transportation of wood chips with trucks, pellets as energy carrier, and larger ship sizes. Our quantitative environmental analysis contributes to increased understanding of the potential benefits and tradeoffs of large-scale supply of biomass resources, and additional research can further improve resolution and integrate environmental impact indicators within a broader sustainability perspective, as indicated by the recently established sustainable development goals. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Algal systems have emerged as a promising strategy for simultaneous treatment and valorization of wastewater. However, further advancement and real-world implementation are hindered by the limited knowledge on the full energetic and nutrient product potentials of such systems and the corresponding value of these products. In this work, an aqueous-based system for the conversion of wastewater-derived algae and upgrading of crude products was designed and demonstrated. Bio-oil, fuel gas, and fertilizer products were generated from algal biomass harvested from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. Experiments showed that 68% of chemical energy contained in the algal biomass could be recovered with 44% in upgraded bio-oil and 23% in fuel gas (calculated as higher heating values), and 44% and 91% of nitrogen and phosphorus element contents in the original feedstock could be recovered as fertilizer products (ammonium sulfate and struvite), respectively. For 1,000 kg of such dry algal biomass, these products had an estimated total value of $427 (in 2014 U.S. dollars). For the first time, experiment-based energy and nutrient recovery potentials of wastewater-derived algae were presented in an integrated manner. Findings also revealed critical research needs and suggested strategies to further improve resource recovery and waste valorization in these systems. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this article, we compare three bioenergy scenarios that use woody biomass from US Inland Northwest forests. The scenarios are based on current bioenergy research, development efforts, and stakeholder input. They include a small-scale system that produces drop-in transportation biofuel and biochar, a large, regional system that produces bio-aviation fuel, and a midsized pellet production system. We modeled woody biomass harvest, processing, and transportation, and then evaluated profitability and potential socioeconomic impacts to determine the overall viability of each strategy. Through interviews, we found widespread stakeholder support for all three scenarios. Woodpellet production was profitable and feasible with current prices and conditions, whereas liquid biofuel production was profitable only at levels that greatly exceed current prices. © 2018 Society of American Foresters.

AB  - In this article, we explore the opportunities and challenges of landscape approaches through the lens of responsible research and innovation (RRI).We use the case of transport biofuels to reflect on the capacity of landscape approaches to support the governance of emerging technologies. The case study, developed in the region of Sardinia, Italy, consists of a landscape design process for the implementation of biofuel technologies that rely on the use of non-food dedicated crops and agricultural residues. By using non-food feedstocks, the biofuel project aims to avoid competition with food production and achieve sustainability goals. Through the discussion of key dimensions of RRI in relation to this case, the article puts forward a set of critical aspects of landscape design processes that require further attention from theorists and practitioners in the field of landscape-based planning. These include the power imbalance that exists between the diverse actors involved in project activities, a need for improving the flexibility of the configuration of socio-technical systems, revising assumptions on 'valid' knowledge, and improving the deliberative component of planning processes. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Algae can use excessive nutrients from wastewater effluent to generate beneficial products such as biofuels. However, fluctuation of wastewater characteristics could hinder the implementation of tertiary algal treatment. This study aims to identify the impact of nutrient availability on Chlorella vulgaris’s ability to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, and its potential as a biofuel feedstock. Experiments using synthetic wastewater with varying concentrations of nitrate and phosphate showed C. vulgaris continued to remove either nutrient when the other was exhausted. Nitrogen starvation led the algae to accumulate the highest amount of neutral lipid; however, the exhaustion of phosphorus did not produce such impact. Synergistic effect was also observed between C. vulgaris and indigenous microorganisms in nutrient removal from real wastewater effluent. The results showed C. vulgaris can survive in a range of nutrient-limiting conditions, making tertiary algal treatment applicable following various secondary treatment regimes. Water Environ.

AB  - Today, traditional biomass contributes 75% to total bioenergy use, but the share of modern biomass, e.g., for biofuels or electricity, increases. Bioenergy derives from first (food crops), second (energy crops or agricultural residues) and third (algae) generation feedstocks. There is an ongoing debate about the competition between energy and food crops. Energy crops do not compete with food directly, but indirectly, using the same natural resources like freshwater. Instead of food or energy crops, crop residues can also be used for bioenergy supply. This paper uses the water footprint (WF) concept and compares WFs of first, second and third generation bioenergy (m3/GJ). Next, it compares WFs of future bioenergy demand based on different bioenergy feedstocks. WFs of energy from residues is smallest, WFs of energy crops largest. Bioenergy from algae has the largest blue WF (surface and groundwater). From a resource-use perspective, environmental impacts of green WFs (precipitation) are smaller than impacts of blue WFs. If bioenergy production rises, impacts on freshwater also go up. Increased production of first generation biofuels and energy crops contributes to global water scarcity. Third generation bioenergy, substantially increases the global blue WF. Comparing feedstocks in the IEA 450 scenario shows that all feedstocks, except residues, generate WFs larger than the global WF over the period 1996–2005. Technology to convert residues into bioenergy is developing, e.g., thermochemical or biochemical conversions. There is large potential for residues, but new possibilities to convert residues into bioenergy need to be explored, combined with possible residue use elsewhere. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - A collection of lipase-producing microorganisms was isolated from sludge derived from an urban wastewater treatment plant. The microorganisms with the highest levels of lipase activity were selected in order to use triglycerides present in the sludge effectively and were then transformed with pdc:adhB genes for the production of ethanol. The transgenic strains showed high growth rates in diluted sludge and produced lipase protein in order to utilize fat present in the sludge, which provides an abundant source of carbon. Using sludge derived from treated wastewater as nutrient source, ethanol was produced by certain transgenic species belonging to the genera Proteus. Different forms of sludge were tested for maximal ethanol production, with dehydrated sludge being found to produce the best performance.

AB  - Oilseed crops, including several mustards, are cultivated as biofuel sources worldwide. However, common mustard crops (e.g., the rapeseed Brassica napus) grow naturally in mesic temperate regions, which are expected to be impaired by global warming and increased aridity. In particular, increased aridity is predicted to reduce the oil concentration and seed yield of rapeseed crops. There is therefore an urgent need to identify alternative bioenergy crops that are preadapted to future climatic conditions. An alternative to conventional Brassica species for biodiesel production is the white mustard Sinapis alba, which is native to the circum-Mediterranean region and has a high seed lipid content. S. alba grows spontaneously in olive groves and other widespread Mediterranean crops; accordingly, it could be easily cultivated by companion planting to improve ecosystem function by decreasing soil loss, controlling microbial disease, and assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity. In this study, using species distribution modeling, we predicted climatically suitable areas for the cultivation of S. alba in Western Europe across the Mediterranean Basin under present climatic conditions and several climate change scenarios. We show that current climatically suitable areas for S. alba cultivation do not overlap with those for B. napus. Unlike B. napus, S. alba could be cultivated throughout most of the circum-Mediterranean region. According to our models, increases in aridity and annual mean temperatures will expand the climatically suitable areas for S. alba in the Mediterranean Basin. However, suitable areas for the cultivation of B. napus will decrease significantly in Western Europe. Our results indicate that S. alba is a strong, environmentally safe candidate for biofuel production throughout the Mediterranean Basin and other Western European countries, especially under climate change scenarios that are expected to impair current oilseed crops. © 2018 Jaime et al.

AB  - The potential benefits of biofuels depend on the environmental impacts of biomass production. High-diversity mixtures of grassland species grown on abandoned agricultural lands have been proposed as enhancing climate mitigation potential, but can have low yields. Intensification might increase productivity, but might also cause negative environmental impacts. Here, we show that, compared with more intensive treatments, moderate intensification of high-diversity grasslands had as great or greater biomass yields, soil carbon stores and root mass, and had negligible effects on grassland stability, diversity and nitrate leaching. In particular, compared with untreated plots, the moderate treatment of irrigation and addition of 70 kgN ha−1 yr−1 resulted in 89% more yield, 61% more root carbon, 187% more soil carbon storage and, if biomass were used for bioenergy, twice the greenhouse gas reductions. Irrigation and 140 kgN ha−1 yr−1 had 32% lower greenhouse gas benefits, 10 times greater nitrate leaching and 121% greater loss of plant diversity than the moderate treatment. These results suggest that optimizing multiple environmental benefits requires sustainable intensification practices appropriate for the soils, climate and plant species of a region. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Brassica carinata A. Braun seeds contain high erucic and linolenic acids that are desirable for biofuel and biopolymer products. However, key agronomic practices to maximize carinata productivity on the Northern Great Plains are not well known. Here, we investigated the response of seed yield and quality to three key agronomic factors—herbicide, seeding rate, and N. The factorial experiment, conducted in nine environments (site-years) on the Canadian prairies from 2014 to 2016, included two weed control options (weedy vs. weed-controlled), three levels of N application (low = 32–97 kg N ha−1, medium = 75–198 kg N ha−1, and high = 117–297 kg N ha−1), and five seeding rates (50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 seeds m−2). On average, weed biomass with the herbicide-applied treatment was 245 kg dry matter ha−1, significantly lower than the 1338 kg dry matter ha−1 with the non-herbicide treatment, leading to 37% greater seed yield. In four of the nine environments, medium and high N fertilizer rates increased seed yield by 29 and 45%, respectively, compared with the low-N treatment, but N fertilizer did not affect yield in the remaining five environments. Increasing seeding rates decreased weed biomass and increased seed yield. Seed oil and protein contents ranged from 37.2 to 48.5% and 22.6 to 36.3%, respectively, and these two traits had an inverse linear relationship. These results demonstrate that carinata may be well adapted to the Northern Great Plains as an alternative oilseed crop, and that seed yield and quality responses to key agronomic factors can vary with environmental conditions. © Crop Science Society of America | 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.

AB  - Commercial biocatalysis requires robust enzymes that can withstand elevated temperatures and long incubations. Ancestral reconstruction has shown that pre-Cambrian enzymes were often much more thermostable than extant forms. Here, we resurrect ancestral enzymes that withstand ~30 °C higher temperatures and ≥100 times longer incubations than their extant forms. This is demonstrated on animal cytochromes P450 that stereo- and regioselectively functionalize unactivated C–H bonds for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, and bacterial ketol-acid reductoisomerases that are used to make butanol-based biofuels. The vertebrate CYP3 P450 ancestor showed a 60T50 of 66 °C and enhanced solvent tolerance compared with the human drug-metabolizing CYP3A4, yet comparable activity towards a similarly broad range of substrates. The ancestral ketol-acid reductoisomerase showed an eight-fold higher specific activity than the cognate Escherichia coli form at 25 °C, which increased 3.5-fold at 50 °C. Thus, thermostable proteins can be devised using sequence data alone from even recent ancestors. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - We estimate U.S. corn and soybean supply responses by exploiting the large exogenous price variations associated with implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard. We focus on recent years and on the 12 U.S. midwestern states and estimate a system of dynamic equations that is consistent with the role of crop rotation. Corn and soybean acreages respond more in the short run than in the long run. Cross-price elasticities of acreage responses are negative and fairly large in absolute value such that, when corn and soybean prices move together, the response of total acreage allocated to these two crops is extremely inelastic. © 2018 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Due to the unique Entner-Doudoroff pathway, Zymomonas mobilis has been acknowledged as a potential host to be engineered for biorefinery to produce biofuels and biobased chemicals. The self-flocculation of Z. mobilis can make the bacterial cells self-immobilized within bioreactors for high density to improve product productivities, and in the meantime enhance their tolerance to stresses, particularly product inhibition and the toxicity of byproducts released during the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. In this work, we explored mechanism underlying such a phenotype with the self-flocculating strain ZM401 developed from the regular non-flocculating strain ZM4. Cellulase de-flocculation and the restoration of the self-flocculating phenotype for the de-flocculated bacterial cells subjected to culture confirmed the essential role of cellulose biosynthesis in the self-flocculation of ZM401. Furthermore, the deactivation of both Type I and Type IV restriction-modification systems was performed for ZM4 and ZM401 to improve their transformation efficiencies. Comparative genome analysis detected the deletion of a thymine from ZMO1082 in ZM401, leading to a frame-shift mutation for the putative gene to be integrated into the neighboring downstream gene ZMO1083 encoding the catalytic subunit A of cellulose synthase, and consequently created a new gene to encode a larger transmembrane protein BcsA_401 for more efficient synthesis of cellulose as well as the development of cellulose fibrils and their entanglement for the self-flocculation of the mutant. These speculations were confirmed by the morphological observation of the bacterial cells under scanning electron microscopy, the impact of the gene deletion on the self-flocculation of ZM401, and the restoration of the self-flocculating phenotype of ZM401 ΔbcsA by the gene complementation. The progress will lay a foundation not only for fundamental research in deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying the self-flocculation of Z. mobilis and stress tolerance associated with the morphological change but also for technological innovations in engineering non-flocculating Z. mobilis and other bacterial species with the self-flocculating phenotype. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - While renewable biofuels can reduce negative effects of fossil fuel energy consumption, the magnitude of their benefits depends on the magnitude of N2O emissions. High variability of N2O emissions overpowers efforts to curb uncertainties in estimating N2O fluxes from biofuel systems. In this study, we explored (a) N2O production via bacterial denitrification and (b) N2O emissions from soils under several contrasting bioenergy cropping systems, with specific focus on explaining N2O variations by accounting for soil pore characteristics. Intact soil samples were collected after 9 years of implementing five biofuel systems: continuous corn with and without winter cover crop, monoculture switchgrass, poplars, and early-successional vegetation. After incubation, N2O emissions were measured and bacterial denitrification was determined based on the site-preference method. Soil pore characteristics were quantified using X-ray computed microtomography. Three bioenergy systems with low plant diversity, that is, corn and switchgrass systems, had low porosities, low organic carbon contents, and large volumes of poorly aerated soil. In these systems, greater volumes of poorly aerated soil were associated with greater bacterial denitrification, which in turn was associated with greater N2O emissions (R2 = 0.52, p &lt; 0.05). However, the two systems with high plant diversity, that is, poplars and early-successional vegetation, over the 9 years of implementation had developed higher porosities and organic carbon contents. In these systems, volumes of poorly aerated soil were positively associated with N2O emissions without a concomitant increase in bacterial denitrification. Our results suggest that changes in soil pore architecture generated by long-term implementation of contrasting bioenergy systems may affect the pathways of N2O production, thus, change associations between N2O emissions and other soil properties. Plant diversity appears as one of the factors determining which microscale soil characteristics will influence the amounts of N2O emitted into the atmosphere and, thus, which can be used as effective empirical predictors. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Corn kernel fiber ethanol that can be produced concurrently with corn starch ethanol has recently been approved as cellulosic biofuel in the USA, suggesting that fiber ethanol could be eligible for a higher credit price than conventional starch ethanol due to its anticipated lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A life-cycle analysis was conducted to quantify ethanol's GHG emissions. Here we show that fiber ethanol's life-cycle GHG emissions (36–39 g CO2e MJ−1) are close to meeting the US cellulosic biofuel's legislative mandate of 60% GHG emissions reduction relative to gasoline (~94 g CO2e MJ−1), with slightly lower emissions under the nth plant mature fiber technology than under the state of technology (SOT). The co-product, distiller's grain with solubles (DGS), can notably affect fiber ethanol's GHG emissions, and this impact may need to be further examined when evidence of DGS market impacts becomes available. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is expected to play an important role in decarbonizing our economy. In this modeling study, we assessed the future role of biobased chemicals and energy from this resource in the EU up to 2030. The study's general outcomes indicate that biobased heat remains the largest biobased sector over this period, and biobased chemicals remain the smallest. A significant share of EU-domestic lignocellulosic biomass potential remains unutilized, even when feedstock availability is restricted. The technology mix for biobased heat, power, biofuels, and chemicals remains relatively stable in all cases, with a strong role for biobased combined heat and power (CHP). Several specific ‘what if’ analyses were done. These show that both restriction of feedstock potential and active mobilization of available potential affect overall costs of biobased options, illustrating the relevance of specific policies in bringing biomass potentials to the market. In feedstock-restricted scenarios, specific attention to advanced lignocellulose-based fuel technologies is essential to meet biofuel ambitions. Another analysis indicates that both competition and synergy effects occur between energy and chemical applications of biomass. This illustrates that biorefining and co-production of biobased chemicals and energy in integrated biorefineries is a better and more robust business than separated production. Finally, an analysis of the dynamics between lignocellulosic and crop-based biofuels reveals that the current capacity of the latter creates a need for a specific subtarget for lignocellulose-based biofuels before they can enter the market, and that crop-based biofuels may be gradually phased out, but with significant additional costs. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Sustainable integration of biofuel (primarily bioethanol) and highly digestible livestock feed in production systems is a potential way to increase the economic returns to agriculture and simultaneously promote energy security, particularly in developing countries. In this work we evaluated the efficacy of steam explosion (StEx) and ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX™) as potential processes for improving the in vitro rumen digestibility, metabolizable energy, and ethanol yields from sugarcane crop residues (bagasse and cane leaf matter, CLM). Ammonia fiber expansion pretreatment enhanced the in vitro true digestibility and metabolizable energy content of sugarcane crop residues by 69% and 26%, respectively compared to untreated controls. On the other hand, StEx increased the true digestibility and metabolizable energy content of the sugarcane residues by 54% and 7%, respectively. Ammonia fiber expansion also increased the total nitrogen content of both sugarcane bagasse and CLM to more than 20.2 g kg−1 dry forage, a more than 230% improvement relative to untreated controls. High solid-loading enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of StEx- and AFEX™-pretreated sugarcane crop residues generated yields of up to 3368 and 4360 L of ethanol per hectare of sugarcane cultivated, respectively, at a biomass-degrading enzyme dosage of 20 mg protein per gram glucan. This research strongly suggests that the use of suitably pretreated sugarcane crop residues in integrated sugarcane biofuel-livestock production systems can increase the total per hectare agricultural output without increasing the area of sugarcane cultivated. In effect, this integrated approach promotes more sustainable biofuel production and increased food production while avoiding the potential for indirect land use change. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The increasing global demand for diverse biomass-based products such as food, feed and fuel can transform African agriculture from a food-supplying to a biomass-supplying and processing sector in the growing international bioeconomy. This study addresses the requisite policy and institutional environment needed to foster the development of a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy in Africa. The paper uses the case of cassava in Ghana for an empirical case study. The novel concept of biomass-based value webs, that is, interlinked agricultural value chains, is combined with Porter's Diamond model to analyse the extent to which Ghana is positioned to develop a competitive cassava value web. Empirical data collection involved mapping the physical biomass flows, applying the ‘Net-Map’ tool to identify all the actors in the emerging value web and their linkages, as well as in-depth interviews with the identified actors. The study finds that despite the huge opportunities for cassava biomass in Ghana, there are coordination problems between farmers, processors and industrial end-users. This has hindered the potential for increased cassava production, processing and utilisation. There is also generally a lack of private sector initiatives in the development of new cassava based products. Accordingly, industrial end-users tend to depend on imported alternatives. Unsuccessful government initiatives and the absence of legislation such as a composite flour policy or a biofuel blend policy have also been major contributing factors to the unrealised industrial potential of cassava in Ghana. The findings therefore suggest that competitive cassava utilisation in the emerging bioeconomy hinges on stronger institutional linkages between value web actors and government support mainly in the form of local content policies that encourage the use of cassava based products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fractional catalytic pyrolysis is an updated pyrolysis method, in which the biomass can be converted into higher quality bio-oil by upgrading the pyrolysis vapor in fluidized bed. In this study, the fast pyrolysis of tulip tree (Liriodendron) was performed in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor under various reaction conditions (pyrolysis temperature, flow rate of fluidizing medium, and biomass particle size) to investigate the effects of these parameters on product yield and bio-oil quality. The system used silica sand and dolomite as the fluidizing bed material, and nitrogen as the fluidizing medium. When the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 °C to 550 °C, the bio-oil yield was between 40.07 wt% and 49.03 wt% compared to those of 28.38 and 44.83 wt% using dolomite catalyst. Deoxygenation of bio-oil mostly produced water, and produced lower amounts of CO and CO2, but higher amounts of H2 and hydrocarbons gas. The catalytic process obtaineda high ratio of H2/CO in the gas product. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Effluents containing great amounts of oxidized sulfur compounds, such as sulfate or sulfite, can be valorized as elemental sulfur from a sequential reduction-oxidation biological process. However, the most important, challenging step to be optimized is the reduction of sulfate. The present study aimed at seeking out the optimal conditions to promote sulfidogenesis instead of methanogenesis using waste carbon sources and a methanogenic granular sludge. Crude glycerol showed better results in terms of the consumed COD/S-Sulfate ratio compared with acetate, cheese whey, pig slurry, and vinasse. Then, the screening of several conditions (T, pH, and COD/S-Sulfate ratio) and the effects of air presence and dissolved sulfide inhibition on sulfate reduction was carried out. Sulfidogenesis was promoted at 35 °C, pH = 8.5, COD/S-Sulfate ratio above 7.0 g O2 g−1 S, microaerophilic conditions, and dissolved sulfide concentrations below 250 mg S2− L−1. These conditions were tested for nearly 3 months in the startup and operation of a 2 L UASB reactor. An inlet sulfate concentration of 220 mg S L−1 and an HRT of 2 h were set. Removal efficiencies of approximately 90% were obtained with less than 20% of organic matter destined for biogas production. © 2018

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum is a potentially useful organism for the production of lignocellulosic biofuels because of its ability to directly deconstruct cellulose and convert it into ethanol. Previously engineered C. thermocellum strains have achieved higher yields and titers of ethanol. These strains often initially grow more poorly than the wild type. Adaptive laboratory evolution and medium supplementation have been used to improve growth, but the mechanism(s) by which growth improves remain(s) unclear. Here, we studied (1) wild-type C. thermocellum, (2) the slow-growing and high-ethanol-yielding mutant AG553, and (3) the faster-growing evolved mutant AG601, each grown with and without added formate. We used a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics to understand the physiological impact of the metabolic engineering, evolution, and medium supplementation. Medium supplementation with formate improved growth in both AG553 and AG601. Expression of C1 metabolism genes varied with formate addition, supporting the hypothesis that the primary benefit of added formate is the supply of C1 units for biosynthesis. Expression of stress response genes such as those involved in the sporulation cascade was dramatically over-represented in AG553, even after the addition of formate, suggesting that the source of the stress may be other issues such as redox imbalances. The sporulation response is absent in evolved strain AG601, suggesting that sporulation limits the growth of engineered strain AG553. A better understanding of the stress response and mechanisms of improved growth hold promise for informing rational improvement of C. thermocellum for lignocellulosic biofuel production. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, series of sequential acid-alkaline and enzymatic saccharification treatments were applied on lignocellulosic biomass of Agave salmiana leaves in order to evaluate its conversion into simple sugars. The effects of a catalytic reagent and residence time were evaluated on lignocellulosic biomass. Also, several levels of FPU and cellulose loadings on the treated biomass were applied in the enzymatic saccharification. Upon completion of an acid-alkaline pretreatment, the resulting hemicellulose was completely hydrolyzed, whereas that lignin removed and the remaining cellulose reached values of 91 and 84% (w/w) respectively. The liquid by-product after acid pretreatment had a content of 0.50 g/L of glucose, 1.87 ± 0.045 g/L of arabinose, 21.35 g/L of xylose, and 39.15 g/L of reducing sugars. The saccharification process reached yields of 93.11% of conversion and glucose concentrations of 49.76 g/L. The sequential process was highly efficient in releasing simple sugars with concentrations of up to 88.91 g/L. This study provides data to improve the conversion processes of lignocellulosic components A. salmiana leaves into simple sugars, and illustrates the potential of using this crop's residue as a feedstock for biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sustainable use of forest resources is an intensively debated topic, raising environmental, socio-cultural and economic concerns. The debate culminates around forest bioenergy. The bioenergy debate has been characterized by a strong polarisation between different perspectives on environmental impacts. In particular, the claims about carbon sequestration have been contrasted with other ecological impacts. This article focuses on the debate over the use of tree stumps as a relatively novel source of forest bioenergy. To shed light on the constellation of the different arguments and actors in the debate on the sustainability of forest bioenergy, we conducted an empirical qualitative analysis of Finnish argumentation on tree stump removal, using media and interview data and relating the emerging sustainability arguments to the dimensions debated in the EU biofuel sustainability policy. The analysis shows the variation of views across Finnish expert stakeholders and the fora where the arguments are made. Climate impacts dominate the media discussion, while other sustainability dimensions are covered in expert discussion. Our findings have implications for the interpretation and use of scientific arguments in energy debates, in particular regarding environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a herbaceous cellulosic biofuel plant with broad adaptability. However, the intrinsic recalcitrance of biomass and limited land for switchgrass planting hinder its utilization as feedstock for biofuel ethanol production. The OsPIL1 (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 1) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Its expression is induced by light, which facilitated the expression of cell wall-related genes, promoted cell elongation and resulted in longer internode in rice. Here, we introduced the OsPIL1 gene into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the aim of improving biomass yield of transgenic switchgrass plants. The transgenic plants were verified by PCR, Southern-blotting, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR tests, respectively. The transgenic plants overexpression of OsPIL1 showed increased plant height and biomass yield. Microscopy analysis showed that the length of epidermal cells of transgenic plants was longer than that of wild type. OsPIL1 overexpressed transgenic switchgrass plants also released more soluble sugar after enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating improved saccharification efficiency. The results suggest OsPIL1 can be used as a useful molecular tool in improving plant biomass and saccharification efficiency with the purpose of plant fiber biofuel ethanol production. © 2018

AB  - The objective of this two-year study (2016–2017 spring) carried out at the University of Nevada, Reno Main Station Field Laboratory, Reno, NV, was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen source, rate, and camelina cultivar on grain yield and potential biodiesel production irrigated with reclaimed water. Treatments were two sources of urea fertilizer [conventional urea (CU) and polymer-coated urea (PCU)], four N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha–1), and two cultivars of camelina (“Blaine Creek” and “Pronghorn”) arranged in a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial combinations with four replications each in a RCBD experiment. Plot size was 7.6 m long × 1.8 m wide, and camelina was seeded at a rate of 5 kg PLS seed ha-1. The quantity of light intercepted increased linearly from 44.9% to 65.9% as N application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha–1, and it was greater for CU (59.6%) compared to PCU (54.0%) fertilized plots. There was a linear increased in grain yield ranging from 534 to 1,010 kg/ha as N application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha-1. In Year 2, grain yield of Blaine Creek (898 kg/ha) was greater than that of Pronghorn (464 kg/ha). Also, there was a linear increase in estimated biodiesel from 51.2 to 94.2 L/ha as N application rate increased. For both grain and biodiesel production, there was no advantage of using controlled-release PCU fertilizer and 80 to 120 kg N ha–1 is sufficient for the cultivation of camelina in this environment. Based on the range of grain yield obtained in this study, camelina can be a potential alternative crop to integrate into the annual crop production cycle in water-limited environments like Nevada. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Reducing dependence on fossil-based energy has raised interest in biofuels as a potential energy source, but concerns have been raised about potential implications for water quality. These effects may vary regionally depending on the biomass feedstocks and changes in land management. Here, we focused on the Tennessee River Basin (TRB), USA. According to the recent 2016 Billion-Ton Report (BT16) by the US Department of Energy, under two future scenarios (base-case and high-yield), three perennial feedstocks show high potential for growing profitably in the TRB: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), and willow (Salix spp.). We used the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to compare hydrology and water quality for a current landscape with those simulated for two future BT16 landscapes. We combined publicly available temporal and geospatial datasets with local land and water management information to realistically represent physical characteristics of the watershed. We developed a new autocalibration tool (SWATopt) to calibrate and evaluate SWAT in the TRB with reservoir operations, including comparison against synthetic and intermediate response variables derived from gage measurements. Our spatiotemporal evaluation enables to more realistically simulate the current situation, which gives us more confidence to project the effects of land-use changes on water quality. Under both future BT16 scenarios, simulated nitrate and total nitrogen loadings and concentrations were greatly reduced relative to the current landscape, whereas runoff, sediment, and phosphorus showed only small changes. Difference between simulated water results for the two future scenarios was small. The influence of biomass production on water quantity and quality depended on the crop, area planted, and management practices, as well as on site-specific characteristics. These results offer hope that bioenergy production in the TRB could help to protect the region's rivers from nitrogen pollution by providing a market for perennial crops with low nutrient input requirements. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Many of the sustainability concerns of bioenergy are related to direct or indirect land use change (LUC) resulting from bioenergy feedstock production. The environmental and socio-economic impacts of LUC highly depend on the site-specific biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second-generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS-based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26 × 109 L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon. The related losses of above and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon result in the average emission of 26 g CO2-eq/MJ bioethanol. All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%–96%) as well as the LUC-related GHG emissions (7%–60%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC-related emissions of bioethanol. However, an integrated approach targeting all land uses is required to obtain substantial and sustained LUC-related GHG emission reductions in general. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Interest in the use of wastewaters of different origins for the industrial production of microalgal biomass for biofuels and bioproducts has stimulated studies on the influence of a variety of compounds in wastewaters on algal physiology. Following the previously published work on the impact of four single phytohormones on the physiology of the microalga Scenedesmus quadricauda (CPCC-158), we investigated the combined effect of the 24‑epibrassinolide (EBL) and 3‑indoleacetic acid (IAA) on S. quadricauda biosynthesis and biomass production. Synergistic increases in S. quadricauda biomass production, chlorophyll-a accumulation, total carotenoid accumulation, as well as total and major neutral lipid (triacylglyceride) accumulation were observed for most of the mixed hormone trials. Mixed hormones had stimulatory effects on growth and biosynthesis of S. quadricauda, but the influence of mixed hormones on algae growth (maximum 1.6-times greater) was less than their influence on algal biosynthesis (maximum 1.7-, 2.7-, and 3.3-fold for chlorophyll-a, total carotenoids, and fatty acids, respectively) compared with single hormone treatments. The mechanism of EBL and IAA cross-talk is likely specific to targeted biosynthetic pathways. The type of relationship between two mixed phytohormones was assessed with Ting-Chao Chou Test. Our results highlight the need for further research on the combined influence of phytohormones on algae physiology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper assesses the sustainability of bioenergy production under a nexus perspective through a new efficiency type index. The index describes 1st generation biofuel production under the perspective of the implied consumption of natural resources. We consider the sustainability of energy production as a sequence of steps, each characterised by its efficiency, and propose an index which returns an overall efficiency value describing the adequacy or inadequacy of the considered processes under a nexus perspective. The direct application of the nexus index entails an indication of the possible improvements needed to move production towards most sustainable processes or places. Moreover, it allows evaluating the efficiency of the main crops currently used in biofuel production with respect to the water–food–energy nexus. The results depict countries presently capable of performing sustainable production of 1st generation biofuel from particular crops. Furthermore, the analysis of the single components of the nexus index allows understanding the effects of possible improvements (e.g. soil and water management, new generation biofuels) on the overall production efficiency under a nexus perspective. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Given the accelerating worldwide expansion of agriculture, biofuel production and managed forest plantations, the future of many tropical mammals depends on understanding why or when some species successfully survive in anthropogenically modified habitats, while others do not. Armadillos are potentially able to adapt to agricultural landscapes and play a key role as ecosystem engineers. However, it is not clear how dependent armadillos are on natural areas in agricultural landscapes and, more specifically, how or if armadillos can use sugar cane or managed forests as alternative habitats. Here, we assessed the relative effects of landscape features, composition and configuration, anthropogenic impacts and degree of protection, as potential predictors of landscape occupancy of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). We deployed 203 camera trap stations in three agricultural landscapes of the Brazilian Cerrado, where sugar cane or managed forest cover most (>50%) of the landscape. We found that cover by native forests and proximity to watercourses strongly and positively affect the occupancy of nine-banded armadillo. In contrast, managed forests mostly composed of Eucalyptus spp. had a negative effect on this armadillo's landscape occupancy. We did not detect the effect of sugar cane, although this particular result might be biased due to our sampling design. Overall, our findings indicate that even disturbed native forest strips, particularly those close to watercourses, are important habitats for this armadillo in agricultural matrices, demonstrating the utmost importance of native forests existing both within and outside protected areas. The Brazilian Forest Code protects native vegetation existing in rural private properties in Brazil, but adherence to this law by rural owners is still weak. Therefore, our study supports the strategic role this law plays in conservation in Brazil. Although not endangered by extinction, maintaining the nine-banded armadillo is important for a broader biota because of its putative role as an ecosystem engineer. The effective implementation of the Forest Code is therefore key not only to maintain this armadillos’ populations but also to increase ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural land use is a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functions in tallgrass prairies. However, there are proposed bioenergy systems that can use biomass harvested from restored tallgrass prairie, creating a potential free market incentive for landowners to restore prairies. These alternative management practices may alter associated soil microbial communities and their ecosystem services. We examined changes in soil microbial community structure, function, and resiliency to drought following two prairie restorations from row-crop agriculture and through subsequent succession in a fertilized and unfertilized tallgrass prairie. The soil microbial community structure was assessed through amplicon (16S and ITS) sequencing, function through potential extracellular enzyme activity, and resiliency indices were calculated for both microbial diversity measures and extracellular enzyme activity. We hypothesized that 1) distinct soil microbial communities in each management system will continue to develop over time reflecting the extent of divergence between the plant communities, due to the strong selective forces plant communities have on the soil microbiome. 2) Microbial extracellular enzymatic function will continue to diverge between the management systems across sampling years. 3) We will see increased resiliency to drought in the prairies potentially due to the greater diversity in this management system for the microbial and plant community, creating a possible enhancement in functional redundancy. Our experiment demonstrates that soil microbial communities continue to diverge from row-crop agriculture as prairie restoration progresses. Planted prairie bioenergy systems with higher plant diversity supported greater microbial diversity than corn systems. Corn monocultures were less resistant to drought stress, as evidenced by decreased microbial activity and richness. Prairies with increased microbial diversity exhibited increased functional resiliency than corn systems, as measured by cellulose-degrading enzyme activity. Prairies that received nitrogen fertilization maintained high microbial diversity and activity, even under drought. Our study demonstrates that diverse cropping systems may benefit from nitrogen fertilization to confer resiliency to disturbance events. Increasing resiliency, while maintaining productivity, is key to managing alternative crops that are sustainable systems for biofuel uses. Our multi-year study reveals the benefits of long-term experiments for capturing the dynamic range of microbial mediation of soil carbon and nutrients and the importance of resiliency in both developing sustainable management systems and modeling predictive biogeochemical models. © 2018

AB  - Mitigation of CO2 emissions is the greatest task of this century. It requires the abandonment of fossil fuels and the complete restructuring of industrial processes. Earlier concepts for CO2 mitigation focused exclusively on emission control. Here, a system of resource control is proposed that limits the extraction of fossil fuels and abiotic resources, as well as the use of land. Efforts in the reduction of resource consumption are often accompanied by switching to other resources as the replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels shows. For preventing this shift, a global system of resource control is desirable. For this purpose, resource shares are generated and distributed to the world's population for purchasing products made by virgin resources. These shares are handed from merchants via manufacturers to resource producers, who return them to an administrative body as an extraction fee. Trading between individuals allows persons with low resource consumption to achieve an additional income, while high resource consumption results in higher expenditures. A specified inflation rate on resource prices reduces consumption over the years to a sustainable limit. This proposal focuses particularly on fossil fuel extraction, which represents about 75% of all resources covered by this scheme. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sucrose contained in sugarcane is the main input for sugar production in Mexico. It is thus necessary to examine the ability of Mexican sugarcane farms to provide raw material in order to achieve a better sustainability and competiveness of sugar industry. Therefore, area expansion for sugar, bioenergy and biofuels will depend on weather and soil conditions, production cost changes, land tenure and plot size and the level of continued investment by stakeholders for innovations. Sugarcane cultivation is mainly located in the rainfed cultivation system; accordingly, crop fields have heterogeneous productivity, with a decrease of 11% in the last decade, and high vulnerability to weather effects. Therefore, requires a multidisciplinary approach, as Precision Agriculture (PA), Remotely Sensed yield estimation and Agro Ecological Zoning (AEZ), focused at regional and local scale, considering the biophysical constraints to improve the sustainable sugarcane production. The main findings of this study, with the application of AEZ and PA tools, showed that Mexican sugarcane crop fields have a differentiated land suitability into four levels: 20.07% of the total planted area is classified as high aptitude, 56.34% as medium, and 23.59% as low with high vulnerability to climate variability; We also determined that total potential sugarcane yield is 78.11 t ha−1, but actual yield is 68.60 t ha−1 (12% lower) because in 777,078 ha for the 2016/2017 harvest season; 13 sugar mills (25.5%) produced cane yield below 60 t ha−1, 21 between 60 and 80 t ha−1 (41.2%) and 17 above 80 t ha−1 (33.3%). Therefore, the unsuitable areas must be converted to agroecological management practices in combination with conventional approaches to increase yields. The Mexican sugar industry requires public policies differentiated by agro-ecological zone for yield and productivity optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In an effort to meet energy demands while reducing carbon emissions, crop residues, such as wheat straw, have been investigated for their use as feedstock for biofuel production. In order to identify the feasibility of utilising crop residues as bioenergy feedstock, a postal survey was conducted to determine current farm business wheat straw use, destination and potential future supply. The survey responses showed a bias towards larger, more commercially-minded farms, therefore capturing a large area of straw production. Results demonstrated a wide range of responses to both current straw use and potential for the supply of straw to different markets in the future. Interestingly, even for a very generous payment for straw, 28.5% of straw currently chopped and incorporated would not be sold, suggesting that straw supply for bioenergy feedstock is likely to be more limited than previously assumed. However, higher prices for straw would encourage farmers to explore ways of increasing straw yield. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing the diversity of lignocellulosic feedstocks accepted by a regional biorefinery has the potential to improve the environmental footprint of the facility; harvest, storage, and transportation logistics; and biorefinery economics. However, feedstocks can vary widely in terms of their biomass yields and quality characteristics (chemical composition, moisture content, etc.). To investigate how the diversity of potential biofuel cropping systems and feedstock supply might affect process and field-scale ethanol yields, we processed and experimentally quantified ethanol production from five different herbaceous feedstocks: two annuals (corn stover and energy sorghum) and three perennials (switchgrass, miscanthus, and mixed prairie). The feedstocks were pretreated using ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX), hydrolyzed at high solid loading (~17%–20% solids, depending on the feedstock), and fermented separately using microbes engineered to utilize xylose: yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiaeY128) or bacteria (Zymomonas mobilis8b). The field-scale ethanol yield from each feedstock was dependent on biomass quality and cropping system productivity; however, biomass yield had a greater influence on the ethanol yield for low-productivity crops, while biomass quality was the main driver for ethanol yields from high-yielding crops. The process ethanol yield showed similar variability across years and feedstocks. A low process yield for corn stover was determined to result from inhibition of xylose utilization by unusually elevated levels of hydroxycinnamates (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) in the untreated biomass and their acid and amide derivatives in the resulting hydrolyzate. This finding highlights the need to better understand factors that influence process ethanol yield and biomass quality. Ultimately we provide evidence that most feedstocks fall within a similar range of process ethanol yield, particularly for the more resistant strain Z. mobilis8b. This supports the claim that the refinery can successfully diversify its feedstock supply, enabling many social and environmental benefits that can accrue due to landscape diversification. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Co-hydrothermal carbonization of food waste-woody biomass blend was conducted to enhance the pelletization and hydrochar-fuel properties. The hydrochar was characterized by proximate, elemental analysis and HHVs, whilst energy consumption of pelletization, tensile strength, and combustion characteristics of hydrochar pellets were evaluated. Results showed that food waste (FW) blended with 0–50% mainly decreased H/C of hydrochar, while blend ratio from 75% to 100% mainly decreased O/C. When FW blended from 0% to 75%, the energy consumption for hydrochar palletization decreased about 12–17 J, whereas tensile strength of pellets increased about 2.4–5.5 MPa by formation of solid bridge when woody biomass (WS) ratio was increased. The hydrochar pellets from high ratio FW had decreased ignition temperature and maximum weight loss rate with wider temperature range, indicating the increased flammability and moderate combustion. These findings demonstrate that HTC of food waste-woody biomass blend was suitable for pelletization towards solid biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Maize silage contributes to biogas production in Lombardy Region (400 anaerobic digestion plants) employing 47,000 Ha (Production Model – PM1). Reducing the area devoted to this energy crop is a goal to free soil for food production. Double cropping (PM2) and Arundo donax L. (PM3) have been proposed and tested to measure the impacts for the three Production Models by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The impact category related to Climate Change remained stable for PM2 while it decreased by 17% for Arundo donax L. (PM3) in comparison with PM1. Impact categories related to nutrient management (acidification, particulate matter eutrophication) showed an increase in the range of 3–5% for PM2 in comparison with PM1, while Arundo donax L. allowed the same impact categories to be reduced by 31%, 24%, 17% and 33%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas residue and organic manure are frequently used for crop planting. However, the evaluation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial community before their applications to fields is still lacking. This study monitored the variations of bacteria resistant to sulfadiazine, tetracycline and norfloxacin, 57 resistance genes for sulfonamides, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones as well as the bacterial community during the 28-day aerobic storage of biogas residue and organic manure by using viable plate counts, high-throughput qPCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing methods. Then two storage conditions, incubator (25 °C) and natural environment, were used to assess the responses of ARB and ARGs to the environmental factors. Results showed that a total of 35 and 21 ARGs were detected in biogas residue and organic manure, respectively. ARB and ARGs were enriched up to 8.01-fold in biogas residue after the 28-day storage, but varied in a narrow range during the storage of organic manure. Compared with the incubator condition, the proliferation of ARB and ARGs in biogas residue under the natural condition was relatively inhibited by the varied and complicated environmental factors. However, we found that there was no significant difference of ARB and ARGs in organic manure between the incubator and natural conditions. Bacterial community was also shifted during the storage of biogas residue, especially Bacteroidetes_VC2.1_Bac22, Aequorivita, Luteimonas and Arenimonas. Network analysis revealed that the relationship in biogas residue was much more complicated than that in organic manure, which ultimately resulted in large successions of ARB and ARGs during the short-term storage of biogas residue. Therefore, we suggest that further measures should be taken before the application of biogas residue to fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green macroalgae Ulva lactuca could be a potential marine biomass feedstock for the production of biofuel and biochemicals. However, the high moisture content makes long-term preservation of fresh Ulva biomass a challenge. Ensilage has been suggested as a green approach to preserving and pretreating fresh biomass without intensive energy input. In this study, silage additives including cellulase complex and inoculum of Lactobacillus plantarum were tested and applied to circumvent the difficulties associated with ensilage of the Ulva species, such as insufficient water-soluble carbohydrate and low lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count. The experimental results with statistical analysis indicated that the addition of both cellulase complex at 10 carboxymethyl cellulose unit (CMCU)/g dry biomass and inoculum of Lactobacillus plantarum at 106 cfu/g dry biomass was necessary to drop silage pH value to lower than 4 in 15 days. The successful preparation of Ulva silage could retain around 92% solid and most of the carbohydrates and the ensiled Ulva biomass could produce more reducing sugar than fresh biomass by dilute acid hydrolysis at high solid content and moderate temperature. Moreover, with further enzymatic hydrolysis, the Ulva silage proved to be fermentable by LAB for lactic acid production. The results suggested that ensilage could be a useful process for simultaneous preservation and pretreatment of Ulva biomass for fermentable sugar production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The composition in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) of the biogas produced by seven landfills of Giugliano (Naples, Campania, Italy) was determined and VOC emission rates assessed to verify if these compounds represent a potential threat to the population living nearby. VOC composition in the biogas could not be predicted, as heterogeneous waste was dumped from the late 1980s to the early 2000s and then underwent biological degradation. No data are available on the amount and composition of VOC in the biogas before the landfills closure as no operational biogas collection system was present. In this study, VOC composition was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), after collecting samples from collection pipes and from soil fractures in cover soil or capping. Individual VOC were quantified and data compared with those collected at two landfills in Latium, when they were still in operation. Relevant differences were observed, mainly due to waste aging, but no specific VOC revealing toxic waste dumping was found, although the concurrent presence of certain compounds suggested that dumping of industrial wastes might have occurred. The average VOC emission was assessed and a dispersion model was run to find out if the emitted plume could affect the health of population. The results suggested that fugitive emissions did not represent a serious danger, since the concentrations simulated at the neighboring cities were below the threshold limits for acute and chronic diseases. However, VOC plume could cause annoyance at night when the steady state conditions of the atmosphere enhance pollutants accumulation in the lower layers. In addition, some of the emitted VOC, such as alkylbenzenes and monoterpenes, can contribute to tropospheric ozone formation. © 2018

AB  - Regardless of fragile biodiesel market of the present day, it is foreseen that biodiesel will draw a lot of public interest throughout the world in the not too distant future. Among different feed stocks available for biodiesel production, waste cooking oil is under a major prospective for large-scale biodiesel production as it can cut down the fuel costs than other alternative feed stocks. However, there are several barriers that hinder large-scale biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. Also, there might be contextual relationships among those barriers. In this perspective, this paper aspires to identify the most influential barrier and to describe the interactions among different barriers influencing biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. For this reason, an interpretive structural modeling approach is employed to determine relationships among barriers. MICMAC analysis has additionally been carried out to classify the barriers based on dependence and driving power. The results indicate that vehicle access problem, lack of processing technology, inconsistent supply quantity and inadequate production facilities are the top-level barriers. Also, the results show that lack of political will, lack of incentives and lack of policy implementation play a very important role in the effective implementation of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: To promote eco-efficient sugarcane products, there is a need for life cycle assessment (LCA) methods that enable rapid assessment of the environmental implications of alternative agricultural practices. In response, a customised LCA method for sugarcane growing was developed and operationalized in the CaneLCA tool. The aim of the paper was to describe the CaneLCA method in detail and to test the effectiveness of the tool’s parameterisation for evaluating the environmental implications of cane growing practice alternatives. Methods: CaneLCA (Version 1.03) was developed over 6 years (2011–2017) in conjunction with the Australian sugarcane sector. The LCA process was customised for sugarcane growing by focusing on ‘cradle to farm gate’ operations and relevant impact categories, and by parameterising practice variables. To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, we used it to assess a case study of actual practice changes in the Wet Tropics region of Australia, in terms of the scope of practice variables and environmental implications that can be accounted for. Results and discussion: The case study results generated by CaneLCA were consistent with those generated by past studies using LCA software. The parameterisation of practice variables allowed for all the practice changes represented in the case study to be assessed. It is suitable for evaluating such known practice alternatives, but less suited to evaluating very innovative practice alternatives, as it is constrained by the underlying algorithms and factors. Most of the environmental implications could be considered, except for effects on soil quality. This will be an area for future tool development to understand the full implications of agricultural practice change, along with the introduction of dynamic models to better estimate emissions. Conclusions: CaneLCA makes the LCA process more rapid for evaluating alternative sugarcane growing practices, thereby speeding up progress towards devising more eco-efficient sugarcane products. It provides a model that could be adapted for other sugarcane growing regions, and for other perennial cropping systems. The novelty of the method is the detailed parameterisation of practice variables so that a wide range of alternative practices can be evaluated. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Production of biofuels from farm animal waste represents a promising approach to diversifying green energy production and reducing competition for cultivable lands between fuel and food-oriented crops. This work was aimed to define the technical feasibility and the specific suitability of cattle, swine and poultry manure to integrating bioethanol and biomethane production, using the biorefinery concept. Saccharification obtained by dilute acid pretreatment (3.5% H2SO4, 121 °C, 30 min) followed by enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in total sugar recovery of 230.16, 160.40, and 98.40 mg g−1 (of dry matter) for cattle, pig, and poultry manure respectively. The sugar was then fermented using free yeast co-cultures. The ethanol obtained was 56.32 mg g−1 of dry matter for cattle (about 52.59% of the theoretical ethanol yield); 27.98 mg g−1 for swine (about 88.66% of the theoretical ethanol yield); 12.69 mg g−1 for poultry (about 31.32% of the theoretical ethanol yield). Methane production from distillation waste was 72.95 mg g−1 from dry raw faeces for cattle, 126.48 mg g−1 for swine and 119.03 mg g−1 for poultry. Cattle manure showed the best energy balance in terms of ethanol production with about 824.16 kJ kg−1 of dry faeces, but the two integrated processes generated a net energy balance of 1.28 MJ kg−1 for cattle, 4.57 MJ kg−1 for swine and 4.79 MJ kg−1 for poultry. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The current study aims to investigate the implications of amending a soil contaminated with Cd with peanut residues biochar (BP) solely or in combination with cow manure (CMPB) at different rates on phytotoxicity of Cd for wheat plants and its distribution in a mine contaminated soil. Soil pH and EC increased progressively in soils amended with either PB or CMPB. Exchangeable Cd was decreased while its non-exchangeable fractions were increased. Dry weights of wheat straw, roots and grains increased when soils amended with either PB or CMPB, especially at the higher application rate. Such increases were correlated significantly with the extractable soil-Cd. Concentrations of Cd in roots were higher than those in straw; whereas, the concentrations in grains seemed to be the lowest. Generally, values of bio-concentration and translocation factors did not exceed “1” and decreased with application of either PB or CMPB. In conclusion, enriching biochar with cow manure is a recommended strategy to reduce Cd uptake and translocation to straw and seeds. Moreover, Concentrations of Cd did not exceed the permissible levels in grains when soils amended with the highest rate of CMPB. © 2018

AB  - Advanced Hardwood Biofuels Northwest (AHB), a USDA NIFA-funded consortium of university and industry partners, identified southwestern Washington as a potential location for a regional bioproducts industry using poplar trees (Populus spp.) as the feedstock. In this qualitative case study, we present the results of an exploratory feasibility investigation based on conversations with agricultural and natural resources stakeholders. This research complements a techno-economic modelling of a hypothetical biorefinery near Centralia, WA, USA. Interviews and group discussions explored the feasibility of a poplar-based bioproducts industry in southwestern WA, especially as it relates to converting land to poplar farms and the potential for poplar to provide ecosystem services. Stakeholders revealed challenges to local agriculture, past failures to profit from poplar (for pulp/sawlogs), land-use planning efforts for flood mitigation and salmon conservation, questions about biorefinery operations, and a need for a new economic opportunity that "pencils out". Overall, if the business model is convincing, participants see chances for win-win situations where landowners could profit growing poplar on otherwise low-value acreage and achieve ecosystem services for wastewater or floodplain management. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Toxic compounds present in both the hydrolysate and pyrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass severely hinder the further conversion of lignocellulose-derived fermentable sugars into useful chemicals by common biocatalysts like Zymomonas mobilis, which has remarkable advantages over yeast. Although the extra detoxification treatment prior to fermentation process can help biocatalysts to eliminate the inhibitory environment, it is not environment friendly and cost effective for industrial application. As also reported by previous studies, an ideal and holistic approach to solve this issue is to develop microbial strains with inhibitor tolerance. However, previously engineered strains had the limitation that they could not cope well with the synergistic effect of multiple inhibitors as they are resistant only to a single inhibitor. Hence, understanding the universal cellular responses of Z. mobilis to various inhibitors may guide the designing of rational strategies to obtain more robust engineered strains for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. Results: Quantitative proteomics and metabolomics approaches were used to determine the cellular responses of Z. mobilis ZM4 to representative biomass-derived inhibitors like formic acid, acetic acid, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and phenol. The differentially expressed proteins identified under the challenge of single and combined inhibitors were involved in cell wall/membrane biogenesis, energy production, DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, DNA transcription, RNA translation, posttranslational modification, biosynthesis of amino acids, central carbon metabolism, etc. Metabolomics analysis showed that the up- or down-regulation pattern of metabolites was changed consistently with that of relevant proteins. Conclusion: Fifteen up-regulated proteins (e.g., Isopropylmalate isomerase LeuC, transcription-repair-coupling factor Mfd, and phosphoglucose isomerase PGI) and thirteen down-regulated proteins (e.g., TonB-dependent transporter ZMO1522, transcription termination factor Rho, and S1/P1 nuclease ZMO0127) were identified as candidate proteins related to all the stress conditions, implying that these proteins are potential biomarkers for the improvement of Z. mobilis ZM4 to resist complex biomass-derived inhibitors. These data can be used to generate a database of inhibitor-tolerance biomarkers, which could provide a basis for engineering Z. mobilis that would be able to grow in the presence of multiple inhibitors and directly ferment the biomass-derived sugars into biofuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Peatlands, in their pristine state, are important long-term sinks of carbon. The extraction of peat for horticultural purposes or for biofuel however, may lead to a shift in the carbon dynamics. Additionally, the change in environmental conditions after extraction could allow for invasive species to establish and spread across the peatland. While the benefits and advantages of various restoration management practices have been identified, there has been less attention paid to the carbon exchange from unrestored peatlands at the ecosystem level. This study analyzed the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a post-extraction, unrestored peatland in Eastern Québec at both the plant community level, using chamber methods, and at the ecosystem level, using eddy covariance techniques for two successive years. Methane flux at the plant community level was also measured. The site is an overall source of CO2, releasing a cumulative annual total of 173 and 259 g C m−2 for 2014 and 2015, respectively and a small source of methane, releasing an average annual cumulative total of 1 g C m−2. Results from this study will help managers assess the importance of post-extraction peatland restoration, by comparing the differences in CO2 exchange between restored and unrestored peatlands. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel prepared from animal fat has been gaining increasing interest in the last few years. The main drawback of biodiesel is its poor low-temperature performance, which limits its use in cold climates. This study proposes a method of improving the low-temperature properties of young Camelus dromedaries (Hachi) fat biodiesel (HB) and improving select fuel properties [e.g., the cetane number (CN) and oxidative stability (OS)] of Citrullus colocynthis biodiesel (CCB), which has a high iodine value (IV). HB and CCB were blended in different volume ratios (100:0; 80:20; 60:40; 40:60; 20:80, and 0:100) and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition and fuel properties of the biodiesel blends were evaluated according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods The correlation of the cloud point (CP), pour point (PP), cold filter plugging point (CFPP), kinematic viscosity (KV), CN, IV, and OS with the ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAMEs was determined. HB improved all the studied fuel parameters of CCB, and the international standards (ASTM D-6751 and EN 14214) were met. It is shown that the fuel properties of the biodiesel blends can be predicted using the FAME composition. The results of our study demonstrate that blending the biodiesel from Hachi fat and C. colocynthis seed oil provides a suitable alternative to biodiesel prepared using food crops. © 2018

AB  - The effect of mechanical pre-treatment of nine different agricultural substrates minced to particle sizes of 1.5 mm, 5mmand 10mmon biogas and methane yields and fermentation kinetics was investigated. The results showed, that for five of the nine tested substrates (grass, Progas rye, Palazzo rye, tall wheatgrass, beet), a higher biogas production was obtained for the degree of fragmentation of 10 mm compared to fragmentation of 5 mm and 1.5 mm. For fragmentation of 5 mm, the highest biogas production was achieved for sorghum silage, Atletico maize and Cannavaro maize-649.80, 735.59 and 671.83 Nm3/Mg VS, respectively. However, for the degree of fragmentation of 1.5 mm, the highest biogas production (510.43 Nm3/Mg volatile solid (VS)) was obtained with Topinambur silage. The modified Gompertz model fitted well the kinetics of anaerobic digestion of substrates and show a significant dependence of the model parameters Hmax (biogas production potential) and Rmax (maximum rate of biogas production) on the degree of substrate fragmentation. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In the US, renewable energy policy has largely followed a regional approach; 29 states are currently implementing Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) at varying levels of stringency, while the other states have no renewable energy policy. Requiring individual states to achieve given targets is likely to be less efficient and lead to different levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement than a national RPS that achieves the same national share of renewable electricity generation since the latter allows more flexibility in the regional shares based on their relative costs of renewable electricity generation. RPSs are also likely to be less efficient than a national GHG cap and trade (GHG Cap) policy which allow flexibility in achieving GHG abatement through a variety of approaches. We examine the welfare costs and GHG abatement achieved by the existing state RPSs relative to a hypothetical national RPS and a national GHG Cap policy. We undertake this analysis using a dynamic, multi-region, partial-equilibrium, price-endogenous model of the US electricity, agricultural, and transportation sectors, called the Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM-E). Our results show that a hypothetical national RPS and can induce an equivalent share of renewable-based electricity generation as the state RPSs but at a $61 billion lower welfare cost over the 2007–2030 period. The national RPS would also achieve greater GHG reductions than the state-level RPSs, as it induces a larger decrease in coal generation. We find that the national RPS and national GHG Cap are 55 and 74% more cost-effective in reducing GHG emissions than the state RPSs. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Current EU directives demand increased use of renewable fuels in the transportation sector but restrict governmental support for production of biofuels produced from crops. The use of intercropped lucerne and wheat may comply with the directives. In the current study, the combination of ensiled lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and wheat straw as substrate for hydrogen and methane production was investigated. Steam-pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed wheat straw [WSH, 76% of total chemical oxygen demand (COD)] and ensiled lucerne (LH, 24% of total COD) were used for sequential hydrogen production through dark fermentation and methane production through anaerobic digestion and directly for anaerobic digestion. Synthetic co-cultures of extreme thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor species adapted to elevated osmolalities were used for dark fermentation. Results: Based on 6 tested steam pretreatment conditions, 5 min at 200 °C was chosen for the ensiled lucerne. The same conditions as applied for wheat straw (10 min at 200 °C with 1% acetic acid) would give similar sugar yields. Volumetric hydrogen productivities of 6.7 and 4.3 mmol/L/h and hydrogen yields of 1.9 and 1.8 mol/mol hexose were observed using WSH and the combination of WSH and LH, respectively, which were relatively low compared to those of the wild-type strains. The combinations of WSH plus LH and the effluent from dark fermentation of WSH plus LH were efficiently converted to methane in anaerobic digestion with COD removal of 85-89% at organic loading rates of COD 5.4 and 8.5 g/L/day, respectively, in UASB reactors. The nutrients in the combined hydrolysates could support this conversion. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the water addition to WSH by 26% and the phosphorus addition by 80% in dark fermentation with Caldicellulosiruptor species, compared to previous reports. WSH and combined WSH and LH were well tolerated by osmotolerant co-cultures. The yield was not significantly different when using defined media or hydrolysates with the same concentrations of sugars. However, the sugar concentration was negatively correlated with the hydrogen yield when comparing the results to previous reports. Hydrolysates and effluents from dark fermentation can be efficiently converted to methane. Lucerne can serve as macronutrient provider in anaerobic digestion. Intercropping with wheat is promising. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In order to minimize the environmental impacts of growing population, progressive exploitation of fossil resources and negative consequences of climate change the politically intended goal is to successively transform our primarily oil-based into a bio-based economy. Hence, one goal is to significantly reduce the utilization of fossil resources by increasing the use of renewable energy and resources (i.e. biomass) and the efficiency of their conversion processes. Including existing technologies into the development of future concepts could accelerate the transition to a bio-economy. As one solution integrated biorefinery concepts based on agricultural biogas plants are discussed, which convert biomass with minimal energy consumption to a multitude of products without generating waste. However, they still have huge potential in terms of increased biomass utilization. In that context, catch crops offer interesting opportunities as a substrate for those biorefineries, since they support soil regeneration while generating additional products for the bio-economy without increasing land use. In this study a selection of significant indicators was chosen in order to determine the environmental effectivity and economic efficiency of these biorefinery concepts by a systematic assessment of possible process schemes. Thus within this study the usability of the chosen indicators and the potential of catch crops in advanced biorefineries is assessed. © 2018

AB  - Background: Duckweeds (Lemnaceae) are efficient aquatic plants for wastewater treatment due to their high nutrient-uptake capabilities and resilience to severe environmental conditions. Combined with their rapid growth rates, high starch, and low lignin contents, duckweeds have also gained popularity as a biofuel feedstock for thermochemical conversion and alcohol fermentation. However, studies on the acidogenic anaerobic digestion of duckweed into carboxylic acids, another group of chemicals which are precursors of higher-value chemicals and biofuels, are lacking. In this study, a series of laboratory batch experiments were performed to determine the favorable operating conditions (i.e., temperature and pH) to maximize carboxylic acid production from wastewater-derived duckweed during acidogenic digestion. Batch reactors with 25 g/l solid loading were operated anaerobically for 21 days under mesophilic (35 °C) or thermophilic (55 °C) conditions at an acidic (5.3) or basic (9.2) pH. At the conclusion of the experiment, the dominant microbial communities under various operating conditions were assessed using high-throughput sequencing. Results: The highest duckweed-carboxylic acid conversion of 388 ± 28 mg acetic acid equivalent per gram volatile solids was observed under mesophilic and basic conditions, with an average production rate of 0.59 g/l/day. This result is comparable to those reported for acidogenic digestion of other organics such as food waste. The superior performance observed under these conditions was attributed to both chemical treatment and microbial bioconversion. Hydrogen recovery was only observed under acidic thermophilic conditions, as 23.5 ± 0.5 ml/g of duckweed volatile solids added. More than temperature, pH controlled the overall structure of the microbial communities. For instance, differentially abundant enrichments of Veillonellaceae acidaminococcus were observed in acidic samples, whereas enrichments of Clostridiaceae alkaliphilus were found in the basic samples. Acidic mesophilic conditions were found to enrich acetoclastic methanogenic populations over processing times longer than 10 days. Conclusions: Operating conditions have a significant effect on the yield and composition of the end products resulting from acidogenic digestion of duckweed. Wastewater-derived duckweed is a technically feasible alternative feedstock for the production of advanced biofuel precursors; however, techno-economic analysis is needed to determine integrated full-scale system feasibility and economic viability. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - European Commission is promoting the usage of renewable energy and the replacement of fossil fuels with biomass. Two-thirds of renewable energy will be derived by biomass by 2020 (European Commission. 2012. Roadmap 2050. DOI: 10.2833/10759). However, increasing need for biomass generates sustainability issues by land-use change. Biomass waste as biofuels do not affect land-use, therefore the sustainability potential is improved (Searchinger T, Heimlich R, Houghton RA, Dong F, Elobeid A, Fabiosa J, Tokgoz S, Hayes D, Yu T-H. 2008. Use of U.S. croplands for biofuels increases greenhouse gases through emissions from land-use change. Science. 319:1238–1240). However, biomass waste contaminates could release toxic VOCs, and also particulates and ash may contain non-VOCs such as heavy metals (Pitman RM. 2006. Wood ash use in forestry-a review of environmental impacts. Forestry. 79(5):563–588). This study investigates the VOC combustion emissions of low-grade lignocellulosic waste to determine the suitability wood wastes as bio-fuel. © 2018, © 2018 IWSc, The Wood Technology Society of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

AB  - Microalgal biofuels and biomass have ecofriendly advantages as feedstocks. Improved understanding and utilization of microalgae require large-scale analysis of the morphological and metabolic heterogeneity within populations. Here, with Euglena gracilis as a model microalgal species, we evaluate how fluorescence- and brightfield-derived-image-based descriptors vary during environmental stress at the single-cell level. This is achieved with a new multiparameter fluorescence-imaging cytometric technique that allows the assaying of thousands of cells per experiment. We track morphological changes, including the intensity and distribution of intracellular lipid droplets, and pigment autofluorescence. The combined fluorescence-morphological analysis identifies new metrics not accessible with traditional flow cytometry, including the lipid-to-cell-area ratio (LCAR), which shows promise as an indicator of oil productivity per biomass. Single-cell metrics of lipid productivity were highly correlated (R2 &gt; 0.90, p &lt; 0.005) with bulk oil extraction. Such chemomorphological atlases of algal species can help optimize growth conditions and selection approaches for large-scale biomass production. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fuels obtained from renewable resources have merited a lot of enthusiasm amid the previous decades mostly because of worries about fossil fuel depletion and climate change. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Prosopis juliflora pods mash for bio-ethanol production and its hydrolysis solid waste for solid fuel. Parameters such as acid concentration (0.5-3 molar), hydrolysis times (5-30 min), fermentation times (6-72h), fermentation temperature (25O C-40O C) and pH (4-8) on bio-ethanol production using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast were evaluated. Results show that the content of sugar increases as the acid concentration (H2SO4) increase up to 1 molar and decreases beyond 1 molar. A maximum sugar content of 96.13 %v/v was obtained at 1 molar of H2SO4 concentration. The optimum conditions for bio-ethanol production were found at 1 molar of H2SO4 concentration (4.2 %v/v), 48 h fermentation time (5.1%v/v), 20 min hydrolysis time (5.57 %v/v), 30O C fermentation temperature (5.57 %v/v) and pH 5 (6.01 %v/v). Under these optimum conditions, the maximum yield of bio-ethanol (6.01%v/v) was obtained. Furthermore, the solid waste remaining after bio-ethanol production was evaluated for solid fuel application (18.22 MJ/kg). Hence, the results show that Prosopis juliflora pods mash has the potential to produce bio-ethanol. The preliminary analysis of solid waste after hydrolysis suggests the possibility to use it as a solid fuel, implying its potential for alleviating major disposal problems. © IJRED.

AB  - Alginate lyases (endo and exo-lyases) are required for the degradation of alginate into its constituting monomers. Efficient bioethanol production and extraction of bioactives from brown algae requires intensive use of these enzymes. Nonetheless, there are few commercial alginate lyase preparations, and their costs make them unsuitable for large scale experiments. A recombinant expression protocol has been developed in this study for producing seven endo-lyases and three exo-lyases as soluble and highly active preparations. Saccharification of alginate using 21 different endo/exo-lyase combinations shows that there is complementary enzymatic activity between some of the endo/exo pairs. This is probably due to favorable matching of their substrate biases for the different glycosidic bonds in the alginate molecule. Therefore, selection of enzymes for the best saccharification results for a given biomass should be based on screens comprising both types of lyases. Additionally, different incubation temperatures, enzyme load ratios, and enzyme loading strategies were assessed using the best four enzyme combinations for treating Macrocystis pyrifera biomass. It was shown that 30°C with a 1:3 endo/exo loading ratio was suitable for all four combinations. Moreover, simultaneous loading of endo-and exo-lyases at the beginning of the reaction allowed maximum alginate saccharification in half the time than when the exo-lyases were added sequentially. © 2018 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - As a kind of new-fashionable biomass material, microalgae has the advantages of large amount, fast-growing, high efficiency of photosynthesis, and less land for cultivating. Biomass fast pyrolysis technology is a promising technology to convert low-grade microalgae into high value-added advanced liquid bio-fuels and bio-chemicals. In this paper, a systematical comparison of components' content, pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics, and evolved gas components, was carried out among 3 types of microalgae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, and Microcystis aeruginosa) using thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FTIR), pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS), and distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The result showed that: (1) Based on the TGA analysis, the thermal degradation process of microalgae was composed of 3 stages, namely drying stage (temperature range of 30-150℃), fast pyrolysis stage (temperature range of 150-550℃), and carbonization stage (temperature range of 550- 800℃), and the maximum weight loss rate was observed for Microcystis aeruginosa with a value of 17.34 wt.%/min; the TG/DTG (thermogravimetry/differential thermogravimetry) curves moved to the side of high temperature and the weightlessness rate unit time (wt.%/min) gradually increased as the heating rate increased. (2) The FTIR analysis indicated that there were 6 strong infrared characteristic absorption bands from microalgae pyrolysis, which located at 3734 cm- 1 (-OH), 2 938 cm- 1 (-CH3), 2 360 cm- 1 (-C=O), 1 770 cm- 1 (C=O), 950 cm- 1 (P-O-P) and 667 cm- 1 (CO2). These characteristic functional groups represented the main evolved gas components were CH4, CO2, compounds containing C=O bond, compounds containing N-H and C-N bonds, in which the maximum content of CH4 was evolved from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the maximum content of compounds containing C=O bond was evolved from Microcystis aeruginosa. (3) Based on DAEM analysis, as conversion rate increased, the activation energy values of 3 types of microalgae increased. The activation energy of Microcystis aeruginosa increased from 100 to 680 kJ/mol, the activation energy of Chlorella vulgaris increased from 40 to 265 kJ/mol, and the activation energy of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii increased from 20 to 250 kJ/mol. Among the 3 types of microalgae, Microcystis aeruginosa had the maximum value of activation energy. (4) Based on the Py-GC/MS analysis, the whole components in the bio-oil could be divided into the following categories, such as alkanes, olefins, benzene series, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, furans, indoles, and acids. Among them, long-chain alkanes, olefins, aldehydes and ketones, fatty acids and esters were mainly derived from pyrolysis of lipids and carbohydrate, while phenols, aromatics, amines and amides, heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen were mainly derived from pyrolysis of protein. Chlorella vulgaris produced the maximum content of oxygenates compounds reaching up to 30.89%, while Microcystis aeruginosa produced the maximum contents of phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, amines and amides, and other compounds containing nitrogen reaching up to 10.41%, 13.46%, 13.87% and 14.27%, respectively. In summary, this paper would be useful to supply scientific and basic data for industrial application of microalgae. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - In recent decades, soy has emerged as one of the world's most significant food-related commodities and is strongly linked to deforestation and habitat loss, especially in Latin America. However, only a very small proportion of soy is consumed directly as food by humans with the rest crushed to produce animal feed, oils, biofuel and other industrial products. We argue that the peculiar (but not necessarily unique) structural and institutional characteristics of the soy supply chain raises crucial questions about the promotion of sustainability in complex, non-consumer facing global value chains (GVCs). The particular way that soy is ‘embedded’ in the food system has meant that consumer-facing firms have been shielded from the externalities of its production and trade to a much larger degree than is the case for comparable food commodities. This, in turn, helps to explain the widely perceived inadequacies of the private certification of ‘sustainable soy’ – and ongoing and wider political struggles around land, labour and the environment – for more comprehensive and inclusive forms of governance. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Current EU policy calls for decreased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by i.e., replacing fossil fuel in the transportation sector with sustainable biofuels. To avoid indirect land use change (iLUC), the EU at the same time strives to limit the use of crops and to increase the use of residues. In this study we compare climate impact and production cost for biogas and ethanol based on wheat grain and straw, respectively, in a Swedish context. The economic competitiveness for ethanol from straw vs. grain is evaluated based on the mandatory emission reduction for fossil vehicle fuels implemented since July 2018 in Sweden. The result of this study clearly shows that biogas and ethanol from straw have the lowest GHG emissions regardless of the calculation method used, although biofuels from grain also fulfill EU GHG reduction criteria even when suggested iLUC factors are included. It was also shown that the cost of producing straw-based biofuels was higher, thus there is a trade-off between climate impact and costs. The GHG reduction mandate adopted in Sweden partly compensates for this, but is not enough to make ethanol from straw competitive from an economic perspective. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Mesquite trees continue to invade forests and range lands in many countries across the world. The cost to remove these trees is staggering. In Texas, landowners spent $25 million over a 10-year period to clear 300.000 ha of mesquite trees, a fraction of the 22 million ha of Texas land affected by this invasion. Estimates are that the mesquite continues to negatively impact one to two percent of additional land in selected counties each year in Texas. However, the problem is not unique to Texas, but rather to the 44 species of mesquite trees, belonging to the genus Prosopis found in the pea family (Fabaceae), introduced across the southern United States, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America, and the Caribbean. In response, researchers are searching for economically viable uses for harvested trees and seeds to provide an alternative to the high cost of removal. If viable uses for harvested mesquite trees and seeds are found, then sustained pressure will limit and ultimately reduce the negative impact from these invasive trees. One key factor to controlling this invasive species is to find economically and environmentally sustainable uses to help pay the costs of removal or perhaps make removal less necessary. Traditional uses of mesquite are as a building material, as a source of food for both animals and humans and as wood for charcoal. Emerging uses of mesquite are new applications as a biofuel and as a bio-filter medium for water. Moreover, forestry land management of mesquite has adapted to include the tree as a component of hunting lands. New control methodologies and technologies are based on an increased understanding of mesquite growth patterns, using recommended practices that reduce control and eradication costs while improving the efficiency of land management. Previous land management practices have proven that excessive application of herbicides, physical removal of mesquite trees, or human-induced brush fires, if not carefully planned, only worsen mesquite infestations. The growing problem of mesquite land management provides an opportunity for continued research into novel ways to utilize mesquite biomass, of both wood and seed pods. © SISEF.

AB  - Deforestation has been widespread in the Northern Albertine Rift Landscape in rural Western Uganda. In this paper, we present perceptions from local residents and narratives from key informants on causes of forest loss during a 30-year period between 1985 and 2014. While the generic drivers we find are consistent with previous literature, we suggest that the specific context in which forest cover is lost in rural areas is path dependent, and this is vital for adequate management. In the Ugandan case, the history of the sugar industry and its relation to local political drivers and international considerations (e.g. biofuel) are prominent. Global drivers of forest loss therefore mask local-level complexities, but an amalgamation of local-level dynamics does not necessarily sum up to larger-scale manifestations (in a linear manner): striking a balance between understanding local-level and large-scale dynamics could be key in addressing the deforestation conundrum. We surveyed 263 households in 7 parishes around Budongo and Bugoma forests, and conducted 22 key informant interviews. Our findings indicate that the drivers and mechanisms of deforestation are local; they also vary between Budongo and Bugoma. Key amongst these include: agricultural expansion (28%–58.5% of the responses)—with large-scale commercial and small-scale subsistence farming significant around Budongo and Bugoma respectively; “poverty” (26%–76%) often alluding to heavy dependence on forests for livelihoods. Others include: population growth driven by dissimilar migratory patterns; and moving protected forest boundaries. Our data suggest that a combination of both local and key informant perceptions is instrumental in filling data gaps where a dearth of information is prevalent (especially around Bugoma forest), and is important for corroboration of other scientific data (e.g. remote sensing). However, a survey of wider literature indicates that there are significant issues missing from their stated views. While the continued expansion of cash-crop farming and lack of inclusion of local people in forest policy continues to raise concern, the stability of protected forest (i.e. Budongo and Bugoma) is encouraging and suggests a refocusing of the forest debate on practical working schemes for forest preservation and recovery might be the way forward for sustainable forestry and livelihoods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ecological restoration and revegetation efforts entail the translocation of native plant populations. Risks associated with these efforts include failure of translocated populations to establish or, conversely, such strong establishment that they excessively dominate the recipient community. The role that selective breeding plays in mediating these risks is unclear but of increasing importance as efforts to restore and establish multifunctional grasslands also increase. In a three-year, spatially replicated study, we seeded experimental prairie communities with either domesticated (cultivar) or undomesticated strains of Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), a North American C4 species under development as a biomass crop. We evaluated the composition, performance, and diversity of the recipient plant communities and compared the performance of cultivar and undomesticated switchgrass in those communities. We found little evidence that switchgrass population source affected community response. Switchgrass cultivars modestly exceeded undomesticated strains with respect to stand establishment, third-year stand density, and aboveground biomass; effect size and significance differed among sites. Our results suggest that including cultivars in ecological restorations and multifunctional grasslands may enhance success of switchgrass establishment with little risk of impairing the composition or diversity of plant communities for up to three years, as reflected in the measures used here. However, the incorporation of undomesticated switchgrass into multifunctional grasslands may enhance landscape-scale genetic variation and mitigate risks associated with gene flow between translocated and local wild switchgrass populations; more research on these dynamics is needed. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - This study describes a model-based method for real-time optimization of the key filtration parameters in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating urban wastewater (UWW) and UWW mixed with domestic food waste (FW). The method consists of an initial screening to find out adequate filtration conditions and a real-time optimizer applied to a periodically calibrated filtration model for minimizing the operating costs. The initial screening consists of two statistical analyses: (1) Morris screening method to identify the key filtration parameters; (2) Monte Carlo method to establish suitable initial control inputs values. The operating filtration cost after implementing the control methodology was €0.047 per m3 (59.6% corresponding to energy costs) when treating UWW and €0.067 per m3 when adding FW due to higher fouling rates. However, FW increased the biogas productivities, reducing the total costs to €0.035 per m3. Average downtimes for reversible fouling removal of 0.4% and 1.6% were obtained, respectively. The results confirm the capability of the proposed control system for optimizing the AnMBR performance when treating both substrates. © 2018

AB  - Road transport in Fiji is fully dependent on petroleum fuels. This study is a first for Fiji where fuel demand for land transport is studied under some clean transportation strategies. Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) tool is used with 2016 as the base year and 2040 as the end year. In 2016, approximately 337 million litres of fuel was used with an associated GHG emission of around 864 Gg of CO2e, which increases to 1158.4 Gg by 2040 in Business as usual (BAU) scenario.

AB  - Sorghum is a crop plant that is grown for seeds, sucrose, forage and biofuel production. In all these applications, lignin is a superfluous component that decreases the efficiency of technological processes. Caffeoyl-coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is an enzyme involved in monolignol synthesis that affects the efficiency of lignification and lignin composition. The sorghum genome harbors one CCoAOMT gene and six closely related CCoAOMT-like genes. The structures of four sorghum CCoAOMT-like enzymes suggest that these proteins might methylate caffeoyl coenzyme A and contribute to monolignol synthesis. In this study, two sorghum genes, CCoAOMT and one CCoAOMT-like, were found to be highly expressed in leaves, stems and immature seeds. The promoters of these genes possess clusters of transcription factor-binding sites specific for lignification, and this suggests that they are important for lignification. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one sorghum CCoAOMT-like enzyme is closely related to ancestral cyanobacterial CCoAOMT-like proteins. The remaining CCoAOMT-like enzymes, including the one highly expressed in the leaves and stem, are closely related to CCoAOMT. Genes from these two groups possess different, evolutionarily conserved gene structures. The structure of the sorghum CCoAOMT-like protein from the ancestral clade was modeled and differences between enzymes from the two clades were analyzed. These results facilitate a better understanding of the evolution of genes involved in lignification, and provide valuable data for sorghum improvement through traditional breeding or molecular genetic techniques. The findings suggest that CCoAOMT-like genes might be recruited in lignification and raise questions of the frequency of such functional shifts. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Modern bioenergy is being recognized as an increasingly important low-carbon resource by policy-makers around the world to meet climate policy targets. In India also, there is a clear recognition of the significant role of bioenergy in electricity generation as well as in other applications. In this study, a preliminary attempt has been made to assess the techno-economic feasibility of biomass pellets-based power (BPBP) generation in India. Surplus availability of biomass feedstock from agriculture and forestry/wasteland sector is estimated at 242 million tonnes (Mt) for 2010–11 and is expected to rise to 281 Mt in 2030–31 due to increased crop production and associated waste/residue availability. In terms of related capacity, the potential of BPBP projects is estimated at 35 GW for 2030–31. The associated carbon dioxide mitigation potential resulting from the substitution of coal is estimated at 205 Mt in 2030–31 if the entire biomass surplus is to be diverted for power generation. The levelized cost of electricity is estimated at €0.12 per kWh for BPBP projects as compared to €0.10 per kWh for imported coal based power plants. For states with the lower tariff for biomass power, the break-even price of carbon for BPBP projects is estimated at €18 per tonne. Additionally, BPBP projects will generate employment of more than 5 million person-months in the construction of biomass power plants and over 200,000 full-time employments in the operation of BPBP plants and in the production of biomass pellets. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - For algal biofuels to become a commercially viable and sustainable means of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, growers are going to need to design feedstocks that achieve at least three characteristics simultaneously as follows: attain high yields; produce high quality biomass; and remain stable through time. These three qualities have proven difficult to achieve simultaneously under the ideal conditions of the laboratory, much less under field conditions (e.g., outdoor culture ponds) where feedstocks are exposed to highly variable conditions and the crop is vulnerable to invasive species, disease, and grazers. Here, we show that principles from ecology can be used to improve the design of feedstocks and to optimize their potential for “multifunctionality.” We performed a replicated experiment to test these predictions under outdoor conditions. Using 80 ponds of 1,100 L each, we tested the hypotheses that polycultures would outperform monocultures in terms of the following functions: biomass production, yield of biocrude from biomass, temporal stability, resisting population crashes, and resisting invasions by unwanted species. Overall, species richness improved stability, biocrude yield, and resistance to invasion. While this suggests that polycultures could outperform monocultures on average, invasion resistance was the only function where polycultures outperformed the best single species in the experiment. Due to tradeoffs among different functions that we measured, no species or polyculture was able to maximize all functions simultaneously. However, diversity did enhance the potential for multifunctionality—the most diverse polyculture performed more functions at higher levels than could any of the monocultures. These results are a key finding for ecological design of sustainable biofuel systems because they show that while a monoculture may be the optimal choice for maximizing short-term biomass production, polycultures can offer a more stable crop of the desired species over longer periods of time. © 2018 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Ammonium (NH4 +) in biogas slurries is readily nitrified into very mobile soil nitrate (NO3 −) to promote nitrogen (N) leaching concerning which a few studies, however, have been reported. These slurries are regularly applied through irrigation to purple soil in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and therefore we explored the consequent N leaching there with a plot experiment. Biogas slurry irrigation was carried out with nitrogen application rates of 0, 48, 144, 240, 336, and 480 kg N/ha. As a result, the last two rates have triggered N leaching being detrimental to groundwater safety. In addition, N leaching was negatively correlated with soil microbial biomass, diversity, and respiration, indicating a potential technique to prevent it with soil heterotrophs activated by increased ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) in biogas slurries. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste Opuntia is an abundant source of biomass to produce biogas and biofertilizer in a small and commercial scale. This crop has a high biomass yield, wide adaptation to diverse climatic zones, rapid growth, and low input requirements. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effect of adjusting C/N ratio and an alkaline pretreatment (AP) of waste Opuntia heliabravoana Scheinvar in the production of biogas and biofertilizer in anaerobic reactors. AP bioreactors produced more biogas than the control (C, without the combined effect of AP); besides, in this process, it was not necessary to use additional water due to the high content of water that is present in the tissue of this crop. On the other hand, both biofertilizers (C and AP) had enssential microbial groups that help to enhance plant nutrition as S-reducers, S-oxidizers, amylolytic, cellulolytic bacteria, anaerobic S-mineralizers, cellulolytic fungi, and P-solubilizers. Also, the AP treatment to help to increase 1.5:1 total nitrogen (TN) concentration decreased the pathogenic microorganisms in the biofertilizer compared to the C treatment. For this reason, Opuntia spp. is a good substrate for production of biogas and biofertilizer with essential nutrients for many crops in area with water scarcity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Black Carbon (BC) has been widely recognized as the second largest source of territorial and global climate change as well as a threat to human health. There has been serious concern of BC emission and its impact in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) due to the use of biomass and fossil fuels for cooking, transportation and industrial activities. An attempt has been made to study indoor (Liquefied Petroleum Gas- LPG &amp; Traditional cookstoves users households) and outdoor concentrations; seasonal characteristics; radiative forcing and source of apportionment of BC in three districts (Sitapur, Patna and Murshidabad) of IGP during January to December 2016. The seasonal concentrations of BC in LPG (traditional cookstoves) users households were 3.79 ± 0.77 μgm−3 (25.36 ± 5.01 μgm−3) during the winter; 2.62 ± 0.60 μgm−3 (16.36 ± 3.68 μgm−3) during the pre-monsoon; 2.02 ± 0.355 μgm−3 (8.92 ± 1.98 μgm−3) during the monsoon and 2.19 ± 0.47 μgm−3 (15.17 ± 3.31 μgm−3) during the post-monsoon seasons. However, the outdoor BC concentrations were 24.20 ± 4.46, 19.80 ± 4.34, 8.87 ± 1.83, and 9.14 ± 1.84 μgm−3 during winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively. The negative radiative forcing (RF) at the surface suggests a cooling effect while a warming effect appears to be occurring at the top of the atmosphere. The atmospheric forcing of BC and aerosols also show a net warming effect in the selected study areas. The analysis of BC concentrations and fire episodes indicated that the emissions from biomass burning increases the pollution concentration. The backward trajectory analysis through the HYSPLIT model also suggests an additional source of pollutants during winter and pre-monsoon seasons from the northwest and northern region in the IGP. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Short-rotation woody crops in the southeastern United States will make a significant contribution to the growing renewable energy supply over the 21st century; however, there are few studies that investigate how species selection may affect water yield. Here we assessed the impact of species selection on annual and seasonal water budgets in unvegetated plots and late-rotation 14–15-year-old intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) stands in South Carolina USA. We found that while annual aboveground net primary productivity and bioenergy produced was similar between species, sweetgum transpiration was 53% higher than loblolly pine annually and 92% greater during the growing season. Canopy interception was 10.5% of annual precipitation and was not significantly different between the two species. Soil evaporation was less than 1.3% of annual precipitation and did not differ between species, but was 26% of precipitation in unvegetated plots. Annual water yield was 69% lower for sweetgum than loblolly pine, with water yield to precipitation ratios of 0.13 and 0.39 for sweetgum and loblolly pine, respectively. If planted at a large scale, the high transpiration and low water yield in sweetgum could result in declines in downstream water availability relative to loblolly pine by the end of the growing season when storage in groundwater, streams, and water supply reservoirs are typically at their lowest. Our results suggest that species selection is of critical importance when establishing forest plantations for woody bioenergy production due to potential impacts on downstream water yield. © 2018

AB  - In order to reduce economic and national security risks, U.S. energy policy, in 2005 and 2007, mandated production of renewable biofuels. By 2010, the renewable biofuel industry was consuming approximately one-third of domestic corn and soybean production. To meet this growing demand, conservation and pastureland has been cultivated with corn and soybean, resulting in a reduction in ecosystem services. Perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., switchgrass) offer a more sustainable alternative. However, unlike annual crops, farmers and landowners have little experience with perennial bioenergy crop production. Uncertainty in production and prices may impact the supply of these novel crops into an emerging market. Using a contingent supply method, we show that agricultural landowners are willing to produce perennial bioenergy crops, given competitive returns, but only on a portion of their land. © 2018

AB  - Shrub willow has potential to be a substantial source of renewable biomass for production of bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. At the same time, scientists and land managers are increasingly challenged to achieve multiple ecosystem functions in bioenergy plantings. Due to willow's early-season bloom period, a time when natural forage for bees can be limited, biomass plantings offer a potential benefit of floral resources for pollinators, some of which are known to be experiencing recent declines. To assess which willow cultivars and sex may provide the most benefit to pollinators, we conducted a common-garden experiment (Northeast U.S.) comparing bee (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) visitation among seven pedigrees and both sexes of short rotation coppice willow. We quantified abundance, richness, diversity, evenness, and species composition in plots planted with each pedigree and sex. Over seven sampling dates, we found an abundant and diverse bee assemblage comprised of 4675 individuals representing >56 species, at least 10 of which are rare or in decline in the northeastern United States. Willow sex was an important factor in bee visitation differences, with male willows supporting 39% greater abundance, 20% greater richness, and 9% greater diversity of bee visitors. Greater bee richness and diversity on male willows was due to an abundance-driven accumulation of species, as determined via rarefaction. Ordination analyses indicated composition of bee species assemblages differed among both willow pedigree and sex. Thus, our findings suggest male willow of varying pedigrees may be optimal for strategic plantings intended to meet bioenergy goals while also benefiting pollinators. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urban vegetation is a critical element to achieve sustainable development of highly populated cities. Plants can fix and store carbon in the biomass, and can also be used as an energy source in substituting fossil fuels. In this study, we introduced a new dynamic model to simulate the carbon sequestration potential of urban greening facilities. This model was developed using plant-specific data measured from a typical urban rain garden. Field data and biomass samples were analyzed to calculate the carbon stocks of 7 herb, 7 shrub and 6 tree species. Biomass samples of representative tree species were collected for measurement of tree height, trunk diameter, and total biomass for validating the needed simulation coefficients. The new parameters obtained from chemical composition analyses were included in the model to better describe the bioenergy potentials of various plants species. The proposed model provides a general algorithm which is universally applicable for simulating plant growth and carbon sequestration potential for different plant spices combinations and management practices. The best management practices can be achieved through maximization of growing capacity of plants and bioenergy harvesting. The simulation results suggested that the maximum carbon sequestration potential of the studied urban rain garden can increase from 6.7 kg m−2 to 14.7 kg m−2 through harvesting and converting the plant-derived biomass into biofuels. © 2018

AB  - The current debate on corporate social responsibility was triggered by the understanding that companies should be responsible for mitigating the impacts of their activities on the society and the environment. In this paper, drawing on the structural power of business, we examine the rule-setting power in which sugarcane ethanol companies engage, and then discuss why these companies develop and use institutions to promote sustainability. We use a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, to identify companies’ commitment to sustainability and business-led governance by analyzing a large volume of data from public corporate documents. The results reveal 36 main themes that demonstrate the rule-setting power of the sugarcane ethanol industry through voluntary standards, codes of conduct, and corporate social responsibility these companies use as indicators of superior social and environmental performance and to show sustainability is embedded in companies’ priorities. However, the results also show critical issues of unsustainable production practices can affect industry image and stress socio-environmental relationships. These issues can be ameliorated with integrative governance that considers the independence of the sectors involved in ethanol production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using lignocellulosic residues for bioethanol production could provide an alternative solution to current approaches at competitive costs once challenges related to substrate recalcitrance, process complexity and limited knowledge are overcome. Thus, the impact of different process variables on the ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the hemicellulosic fraction extracted through the steam-treatment of softwood chips mixed with construction and demolition residues was assessed. A statistical design of experiments approach was developed and implemented in order to identify the influencing factors (various nutrient addition sources as well as yeast inoculum growth conditions and inoculation strategies) relevant for enhancing the ethanol production potential and substrate uptake. Ethanol yields of 74.12% and monomeric sugar uptakes of 82.12 g/L were predicted and experimentally confirmed in bench and bioreactor systems. This innovative approach revealed the factors impacting the ethanol yields and carbohydrate consumption allowing powerful behavioral predictions spanning different process inputs and outputs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The suitability of the co-digestion of feedstock-mixtures (by-products and agricultural residues) depends on their ability to produce biogas. In this study, the effects of mixing five feedstocks (citrus pulp, olive pomace, poultry manure, Italian sainfoin silage and opuntia fresh cladodes) on anaerobic digestion for biogas production have been investigated by carrying out biomethane potential (BMP) tests on six different mixing ratios of the selected five biomasses. The BMP test results demonstrated that all the six studied feedstock-mixtures could be potentially used for renewable energy generation by biogas plants. More in detail, two mixing ratios of the studied feedstock-mixtures showed the best biomethane potential of 249.9 and 260.1 Nm3CH4/tVS, respectively. Since this research study made it possible to screen the suitability and technical feasibility of the feedstock-mixtures analysed, the results provide the basis for subsequent pilot scale evaluation of anaerobic digestion in Mediterranean area, where by-products and agricultural residues are profuse and necessary to produce advanced biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, Jerusalem artichoke has received widespread attention as a novel source of sugar, biofuel, and animal feed. Currently, only few gDNA-SSRs derived from sunflower were verified in the Jerusalem artichoke; therefore, it is particularly important to develop SSR primer markers that belonged to Jerusalem artichoke resources. Using EST data to develop EST-SSR markers is simple and effective. In order to understand the general characteristics of SSR markers in Jerusalem artichoke EST sequences and accelerate the use of SSR markers in Jerusalem artichoke research. This study used 40,370 sequenced unigene fragments and MISA software to identify SSR loci. The 48 pairs of EST-SSR primers assessed for the identification of 45 varieties of Jerusalem artichoke. Cluster, genetic diversity parameters and AMOVA analysis was conducted using the genetic similarity coefficient, revealing genetic differences between 48 genetic material. A total of 1204 SSR loci were identified with 13 different types of repeats, distributed among 1020 EST sequences, of which trinucleotide repeats were the most common, accounting for 38.21% of the total SSR loci. Among the 44 repeat motifs, AG/CT, AAG/CTT, and ATC/ATG motifs had the highest frequencies, accounting for 22.45, 14.71, and 7.84% of all motifs, respectively. From these sequences, 48 pairs of EST-SSR primers were designed, and 22 primer pairs for loci with high polymorphism were selected to analyze the genetic diversity of 45 Jerusalem artichoke germplasm sources. The results indicated that the variation range of the effective number of alleles for 22 primers ranged between 1.7502 and 4.5660. The Shannon’s information index ranged between 0.6200 and 1.6423. The variation range of PIC ranged between 0.3121 and 0.6662 with an average of 0.5184. Cluster analysis was conducted using the genetic similarity coefficient, revealing significant genetic differences between Asian and European genetic material. Cluster analysis revealed a relationship between the genotypes and geographic origins of the Jerusalem artichoke. The results of AMOVA as well as the genetic identity and genetic distance in the Jerusalem artichoke population showed that there presented certain genetic heterogeneity in Jerusalem artichoke genetic structure of 45 samples from seven different geographic populations. The Jerusalem artichoke EST-SSR marker system established in this study provides an effective molecular marker system for future research focused on Jerusalem artichoke genetic diversity and the breeding of new varieties. © 2018, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Confronted with negative environmental impacts, rising fuel costs and increasing congestion, many cities are implementing sustainable mobility measures to improve the flow of passenger and goods. Examples of these measures are use of public transport, cycling, walking, energy efficient vehicles, biofuels. The challenge before transport decision makers is which one(s) to choose for implementation as often there is no or limited quantitative data available on the subject. Moreover, the context of each city, its geographic and transport conditions restrict the generalization of results obtained in experienced cities. In this paper, we are investigating application of ideal solution based multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques namely fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy VIKOR, and fuzzy GRA for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects. A real application for city of Luxembourg is provided. Three projects are evaluated namely implementation of a new tramway in the city center of Luxembourg, re-organization of existing bus lines in the city to perform optimized service, and implementation of electric vehicle car-sharing stations in the city. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of input parameters on modeling results. The proposed work is one of the first few works to investigate application of ideal-solution based multicriteria decision making techniques for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects under uncertainty. Besides, the best alternative is selected using veto thereby overcoming the limitations of single MCDM methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, carbon nitride/titania nanotubes (C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 NTs) composites were synthesized for the enhanced visible light mediated photocatalytic degradation and pre-treatment of wastewater sludge for enhanced biogas production. The co-existence of C 3 N 4 and TiO2 NTs and visible light activity was confirmed by XRD, TEM, UV–visible and PL spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 NTs with 2% of melamine (precursor of C 3 N 4 ), enhanced the degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) (k = 0.0176 min −1 ), where 96.6% removal was achieved at optimum pH 7.0 and 2-CP concentration of 30 mg/L. On the other hand, the application of C 3 N 4 /TiO 2 NTs for solubilization of the rigid structure of sludge by photocatalysis released the soluble organics showing an improvement in sCOD production (4587 mg/L). Subsequently, anaerobic digestion of solubilized sludge has improved the methane production (723.4 ml kg −1 VS) by 1.37 and 1.6 times compared to that in anaerobic digestion with photolytic and raw sludge, thus showing a promising applicability for biogas production from sludge and wastewater treatment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Trace metals play a very important role on the performance and stability of agricultural biogas digesters. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodological approach to quickly detect limiting conditions due to Trace Elements (TE) concentration in full-scale biogas plants. The work was based on long-term process monitoring in two full-scale agricultural biogas plants and on the correlation between their performance and TE concentration in the digesters. Monitoring and analysis of data from two different case studies allowed to understand the effect of the TE added on biogas plant performance. Furthermore, over-dosage has been avoided, minimizing the risk of biological inhibition and excess of heavy metal concentration in the effluent digestate according to regulation for land fertilization. TE supplementation has been successfully applied to optimize the biogas production, when a slight volatile organic acid accumulation has been detected (from about 3515 mg CH3COOHeq L−1 to 4530 mg CH3COOHeq L−1), and to recover the biogas production after a strong organic acid accumulation (up to 7779 mgCH3COOHeq L−1). Molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, and selenium concentrations above the stimulatory level identified in this study showed similar effects in both case studies: a temporary increase of the methane content in the biogas by 15 – 20% and a provisional improvement of the specific methane production. This allowed to decrease the organic loading rate by 10 – 20%, due to rapid degradation of accumulated volatile organic acids. Further, the residual methane potential of the biogas plant in TE limiting conditions reached values up to 4.8% in comparison to the 1.3% residual methane potential achieved when TE concentration was not a limiting factor, proving that a proper use of TE could help in reducing greenhouse gases emission. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change has the potential to affect crop prices and price volatility. However, the economic models used in prior assessments largely do not include known, automatic, stabilizing factors. Crop storage can stabilize prices and U.S. crop policy tends to provide support that moves opposite prices. We quantify effects of circa 2050 climate forcing on the inter-annual variability of U.S. Corn Belt corn and soybean yields using statistical crop models and climate scenarios from regional and global climate models. Climate change generally reduces mean yields and increases the inter-annual variability of yields in the Midwestern U.S. Using these yield impacts and an economic model with automatic market stabilizers, we find only modest increases in price volatility. Although individual producers and states are negatively affected by the yield reductions, the aggregate effect for all corn and soybean producer returns can be positive because of price increases. Moreover, agricultural policies based on price levels or revenue variation offset some of the impacts of market variation on farm income. Our results differ from other recent results and temper concerns that increasing climate instability necessarily translates to greater uncertainty about agricultural commodity uses, including as food and biofuels, in the near future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the most widely used method of sewage sludge treatment (SS) before its agricultural use. AD achieves the required “sterilisation” of pathogens and is able to cover the energy required by the process, reducing pre-treatment costs, thanks to the production of biogas. The SS agronomic (fertilizer properties), environmental (pollutants contents) characteristics and nuisance to people (odours and pathogens) need to be evaluated together for the safe and useful deployment of SS in agriculture. To evaluate SS properties an unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis) and a supervised (K nearest neighbours) chemometric approach was applied to rank digested SS for agronomic and environmental properties in comparison with other organic matrices for which the agronomic and/or environmental properties are well known or expected. To do so, complete chemical, biological and “impact on people” characterization was carried out on SS ingestate (SS-ing.) and SS digestate (SS-dig.) and another 10 biomasses. The SS-AD process enhanced the agronomic properties of sewage sludge and did not lead to a substantial concentration of pollutants because of the low degradation of organic matter. The best PCA performances were reached for amendment and fertilizer modules but the results found for the environment and nuisance to inhabitants were not satisfactory. The KNN approach proposed to evaluate the suitability of a biomass for agricultural purposes, represents a win-win approach as it allows one to avoid time-consuming and costly full field studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to significant human activity, road dust is becoming contaminated by heavy metals in many cities. To comprehensively investigate the variation of contamination level and sources of heavy metals in road dust, 10 heavy metals in road dust samples from Beijing, China, in both summer and winter, were evaluated by spatial analysis using geographic information system (GIS) mapping technology and the positive matrix factorization (PMF) Model. Although the concentrations of some heavy metals between summer and winter had similarities, the differences of others and spatial distributions of heavy metals between summer and winter were considerable. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Fe were lower in winter, while those of Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were higher. According to the values of the Pollution Index (PI) and Nemerow Integrated Pollution Index (NIPI), there were no obvious differences between summer and winter, but the range between different sites in winter was nearly twice that of summer. Based on the PMF model, four sources of heavy metals in the dust samples were identified. Although the types of sources were consistent, the relative contributions of each source differed between summer and winter. Non-exhaust vehicle emissions was the most important source in summer (34.47 wt%), while fuel combustion contributed the largest proportion to the total heavy metals in winter (32.40 wt%). The impact of each source also showed spatial variation different trends in summer and winter. With the alteration of seasons, intensity of human activities also changed, such as the number of tourists, energy needs for building temperature regulation, construction, and the amount of pesticides and fertilizer. That might be the reason for the variation of heavy metal concentrations and relative contribution of their sources between summer and winter. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To increase the understanding of poplar and willow perennial woody crops and facilitate their deployment for the production of biofuels, bioproducts, and bioenergy, there is a need for broadscale yield maps. For national analysis of woody and herbaceous crops production potential, biomass feedstock yield maps should be developed using a common framework. This study developed willow and poplar potential yield maps by combining data from a network of willow and poplar field trials and the modeling power of PRISM-ELM. Yields of the top three willow cultivars across 17 sites ranged from 3.60 to 14.6 Mg ha−1 yr−1 dry weight, while the yields from 17 poplar trials ranged from 7.5 to 15.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Relationships between the environmental suitability estimates from the PRISM-ELM model and results from field trials had an R2 of 0.60 for poplar and 0.81 for willow. The resulting potential yield maps reflected the range of poplar and willow yields that have been reported in the literature. Poplar covered a larger geographic range than willow, which likely reflects the poplar breeding efforts that have occurred for many more decades using genotypes from a broader range of environments than willow. While the field trial data sets used to develop these models represent the most complete information at the time, there is a need to expand and improve the model by monitoring trials over multiple cutting cycles and across a broader range of environmental gradients. Despite some limitations, the results of these models represent a dramatic improvement in projections of potential yield of poplar and willow crops across the United States. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - A methane fermentation digested slurry (MFDS) was evaluated as a substitute for the commercial nutrient, yeast extract (YE), in ethanol production from glycerol by Klebsiella variicola strain TB-83D. In pH-controlled fed-batch cultures, partial replacement of YE by MFDS did not reduce ethanol productivity significantly. However, non-sterilized MFDS had negative effects on glycerol fermentation by this strain. Although ethanol production decreased when YE was completely replaced by sterilized MFDS, the use of crude glycerol and sterilized MFDS achieved a yield of 14.6 g/L ethanol. This is the first study to report the use of MFDS as the sole nutrient for ethanol production from glycerol, which contributes to the development of a low-cost glycerol biorefinery derived from the biodiesel fuel industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An unknown interspecies Saccharomyces hybrid, "Muri," was recently isolated from a "kveik' culture, a traditional Norwegian farmhouse brewing yeast culture (Preiss et al., 2018). Here we used whole genome sequencing to reveal the strain as an allodiploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae × Saccharomyces uvarum hybrid. Phylogenetic analysis of its sub-genomes revealed that the S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum parent strains of Muri appear to be most closely related to English ale and Central European cider and wine strains, respectively. We then performed phenotypic analysis on a number of brewing-relevant traits in a range of S. cerevisiae, S. uvarum and hybrid strains closely related to the Muri hybrid. The Muri strain possesses a range of industrially desirable phenotypic properties, including broad temperature tolerance, good ethanol tolerance, and efficient carbohydrate use, therefore making it an interesting candidate for not only brewing applications, but potentially various other industrial fermentations, such as biofuel production and distilling. We identified the two S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum strains that were genetically and phenotypically most similar to the Muri hybrid, and then attempted to reconstruct the Muri hybrid by generating de novo interspecific hybrids between these two strains. The de novo hybrids were compared with the original Muri hybrid, and many appeared phenotypically more similar to Muri than either of the parent strains. This study introduces a novel approach to studying hybrid strains and strain development by combining genomic and phenotypic analysis to identify closely related parent strains for construction of de novo hybrids. © 2018 Krogerus, Preiss and Gibson.

AB  - Bioenergy can produce at least 25% of the global energy demand to combat climate change through reducing emissions in the energy sector. However, information on the bioenergy production potential of woody species and their suitability for silviculture on various soils in the humid tropics is limited. This review aims to identify tree species suitable for bioenergy production under these conditions. Data were compiled from 241 publications and nine freely available databases to assess environmental and silvicultural information on tropical tree species. Energy outputs were derived from the estimated productivity of the reviewed species and ranged from 0.2 to 24.0 Mg biomass ha-1 yr-1, 0.1 to 9.0 Mg bio-oil ha-1 yr-1, and 0.2 to 20.0 Mg sugar ha-1 yr-1, equivalent to an energy yield between 2 and 444 GJ ha-1 yr-1. As such, these bioenergy yields are within the range reported for the lignocellulosic biomass of energy crops cultivated in Europe, the USA, and Brazil. Our review identified some high-yielding species (e.g., Dyera polyphylla (Miq.) Steenis, Metroxylon sagu (Rottb.), Pongamia pinnata (L.)) and leguminous species that could be beneficial in mixed stands (e.g., Elaeis oleifera (Kunth) and Pongamia pinnata) or are suitable species to grow on wet or re-wetted peatland (Dyera polyphylla). However, there are limitations to cultivate woody bioenergy species on wet peatland. Sustainable methods for managing and harvesting forests, particularly on wet or re-wetted peatland, need to be developed. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Douglas-fir forestry residues are a potential feedstock for saccharification-based biofuels, and condensed tannins are expected to make up ∼3% of the dry mass of this feedstock. Condensed tannins are well-known for their ability to interact with proteins and can bind and inhibit cellulase enzymes used in saccharification. In this study, we use molecular docking and classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how a characterized condensed tannin from Douglas-fir bark binds to the exoglucanase Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei. Through looking at the "occupancy" and "residency" of specific amino acid residue-tannin interactions, we find that the binding sites are characterized by many simultaneous tannin-enzyme interactions with the strongest occurring on the catalytic module as opposed to the carbohydrate-binding module. The simulations indicate that tannin inhibition can result from binding at or near the catalytic tunnel's entrance and exit. The analyzed tannin further prefers to bind to loops around the catalytic region and has affinity for aromatic and charged amino acid residues. These insights provide direction for the rational design of tannin-resistant cellulases. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Applying very high gravity (VHG) fermentation conditions to the sugarcane juice (SCJ) bioethanol industry would improve its environmental and economic sustainability without the need for major infrastructure changes or investments. It could enable a decrease in the consumption of biological and natural resources (cane/land, water and energy) while maintaining acceptable production parameters. The present study attempts to demonstrate and characterise an effective industrially relevant SCJ-VHG fermentation process. Results: An industry-like SCJ-VHG bioethanol production process with 30 and 35 °Bx broth was employed to investigate the effects of both the yeast strain used and nitrogen source supplementation on process yield, process productivity, biomass viability, glycerol concentration and retention-associated gene expression. Process performance was shown to be variably affected by the different process conditions investigated. Highest process efficiency, with a 17% (w/v) ethanol yield and only 0.2% (w/v) sugar remaining unfermented, was observed with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae industrial strain CAT-1 in 30 °Bx broth with urea supplementation. In addition, efficient retention of glycerol by the yeast strain was identified as a requisite for better fermentation and was consistent with a higher expression of glycerol permease STL1 and channel FPS1. Urea was shown to promote the deregulation of STL1 expression, overcoming glucose repression. The consistency between Fps1-mediated ethanol secretion and ethanol in the extracellular media reinforces previous suggestions that ethanol might exit the cell through the Fps1 channel. Conclusions: This work brings solid evidence in favour of the utilisation of VHG conditions in SCJ fermentations, bringing it a step closer to industrial application. SCJ concentrated up to 30 °Bx maintains industrially relevant ethanol production yield and productivity, provided the broth is supplemented with a suitable nitrogen source and an appropriate industrial bioethanol-producing yeast strain is used. In addition, the work contributes to a better understanding of the VHG-SCJ process and the variable effects of process parameters on process efficiency and yeast strain response.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States’ carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented. This represents an opportunity to considerably increase CCUS in the near-term and develop long-term transport infrastructure facilitating future growth. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The continuing dependence on fossil fuels and the rising energy use in the transport sector have resulted in increased research into viable transport biofuels to mitigate climate change and improve energy security. As transport biofuels now only have a small share of the transport sector energy supply and the complexity in providing the fuels because of issues related to available land and food security, this paper develops conversion path solutions for transport biofuel development based on a technological paradigm study. A data-driven approaches system (DAS) that combines visualization analyses with technological paradigm theory is proposed to reveal the key areas and trends in transport biofuels. Timeline, timezones, and cluster visualizations identified the transport biofuel technological paradigm (TBTP) from current transport biofuel developments; a pre-shift phase (including TBTP competition and TBTP diffusion) and a shift phase (TBTP shift), which respectively relate to conventional biofuels, advanced biofuels, and biofuel cells. However, from further DAS trend analyses and the practical findings, electric energy trends were revealed, indicating that there was a paradigm shift from the biofuel paradigm to a bio-electric energy paradigm. From the developed bio-electric energy framework, both indirect and direct methods were found to have led to an this electric energy conversion to an e-bio fuel cell vehicle for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and bioelectricity for electric vehicles (EV), both of which can contribute to a low-carbon, sustainable transportation future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental load of continuous bioenergy production from palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) included with a proposed 10 ha of microalgae production system were assessed to be implemented in Indonesia. Material and energy balances, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, nutrient requirement and also water scarcity during bioenergy production cycle were evaluated. The integrated system was developed for 60 tons h−1 of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processing capacity of a conventional mill. Aggregate of energy-profit ratio from the proposed system was 5.20, which indicates a positive balance. The total water footprint for each palm oil and microalgae cultivation was 3.18 and 2.85 m3 kg−1 of biodiesel production, respectively. Microalgae mix-culture has the potential to treat organic compounds from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and combined with flue gases from biomass and biogas power plant as the alternative nutrient sources contributed to net-reduction of GHG emission for 158.8 tons ha−1 of microalgae culture, annually. The integrated system produced 26,471 tons of biodiesel that included 223 tons from microalgae and contribute to 39.90% of total GHG emission reduction from diesel fuel substitute. Additional co-product of 520.33 tons year−1 of animal feed from defatted biomass also possible to be produced and have potential for environmental benefits. © 2018

AB  - The increasing regional and global impact of wildfires on the environment, and particularly on the human population, is becoming a focus of the research community. Both fire behaviour and smoke dispersion models are now underpinning strategic and tactical fire management by many government agencies and therefore model accuracy at regional and local scales is increasingly important. This demands accuracy of all the components of the model systems, biomass fuel loads being among the more significant. Validation of spatial fuels maps at a regional scale is uncommon; in part due to the limited availability of independent observations of fuel loads, and in part due to a focus on the impact of model outputs. In this study we evaluate two approaches for estimating fuel loads at a regional scale and test their accuracy against an extensive set of field observations for the State of Victoria, Australia. The first approach, which assumes that fuel accumulation is an attribute of the vegetation class, was developed for the fire behaviour model Phoenix Rapid-Fire, with apparent success; the second approach applies the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) process-based terrestrial biosphere model, implemented at high resolution across the Australian continent. We show that while neither model is accurate over the full range of fine and coarse fuel loads, CABLE biases can be corrected for the full regional domain with a single linear correction, however the classification based Phoenix requires a matrix of factors to correct its bias. We conclude that these examples illustrate that the benefits of simplicity and resolution inherent in classification-based models do not compensate for their lack of accuracy, and that lower resolution but inherently more accurate carbon-cycle models may be preferable for estimating fuel loads for input into smoke dispersion models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is a rapidly evolving social impact assessment tool that allows users to identify the social impacts of products along with their life cycles. In recent years, S-LCA methodologies have been increasingly applied to energy systems and resources with notable success yet with limited reliability and even less flexibility or geographic specificity. In response, this study develops a novel assessment tool, named the GreenZee model, to reflect the social impacts of products and their sustainability using local currency units. The model is developed through evaluating both qualitative and quantitative inputs that capture the perceived monetary value of social impacts. To demonstrate the operationalization of the model, we explore a hypothetical case study of the biodiesel industry in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Results indicate that biodiesel production in NL would have positive socio-cultural impacts, high cultural values, and would create employment opportunities for locals. Overall, the GreenZee model provides users with a relatively simple approach to translate a variety of qualitative and quantitative social impact inputs (as importance levels) into meaningful and understandable financial outputs (as strength levels). We argue that building and testing models such as the GreenZee are crucial to supporting more flexible approaches to life cycle assessments that need to address increasingly complex social categories, cultural values, and geographic specificity. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The peanut (Arachys hypogaea) is a plant of the Fabaceae family (legumes), as are chickpeas, lentils, beans, and peas. It is originally from South America and is used mainly for culinary purposes, in confectionery products, or as a nut as well as for the production of biscuits, breads, sweets, cereals, and salads. Also, due to its high percentage of fat, peanuts are used for industrialized products such as oils, flours, inks, creams, lipsticks, etc. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistical yearbook in 2016, the production of peanuts was 43,982,066 t, produced in 27,660,802 hectares. Peanuts are grown mainly in Asia, with a global production rate of 65.3%, followed by Africa with 26.2%, the Americas with 8.4%, and Oceania with 0.1%. The peanut industry is one of the main generators of agroindustrial waste (shells). This residual biomass (25-30% of the total weight) has a high energy content that is worth exploring. The main objectives of this study are, firstly, to evaluate the energy parameters of peanut shells as a possible solid biofuel applied as an energy source in residential and industrial heating installations. Secondly, different models are analysed to estimate the higher heating value (HHV) for biomass proposed by different scientists and to determine which most accurately fits the determination of this value for peanut shells. Thirdly, we evaluate the reduction in global CO2 emissions that would result from the use of peanut shells as biofuel. The obtained HHV of peanut shells (18.547 MJ/kg) is higher than other biomass sources evaluated, such as olive stones (17.884 MJ/kg) or almond shells (18.200 MJ/kg), and similar to other sources of biomass used at present for home and industrial heating applications. Different prediction models of the HHV value proposed by scientists for different types of biomass have been analysed and the one that best fits the calculation for the peanut shell has been determined. The CO2 reduction that would result from the use of peanut shells as an energy source has been evaluated in all production countries, obtaining values above 0.5h of their total emissions. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Crude rubber seed oil (CRSO) is a promising but currently underutilized biodiesel feedstock alternative, extracted by pressing the seeds of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Rubber trees are cultivated across more than 11.4 million hectares worldwide, mainly in Southeast Asia. Despite their suitability as a biodiesel feedstock source, rubber seeds are currently treated as waste in the monocultural plantation system. To date, no assessments have been performed to examine the potential impact of rubber seed-based biodiesel production on GHG emissions. This study analyses the global warming potential of rubber seed methyl ester (RSME) production in Southeast Asia. The functional unit used is 1 MJ of biodiesel. A sensitivity analysis assesses the influence of key parameters (e.g., rubber seed yield) on the GHG mitigation potential. A scenario analysis evaluates the effect of using RSME by-products for energy generation. In comparison to fossil diesel, RSME has a carbon mitigation potential of 67 g CO2.eq. MJ-1, based on allocation by mass. On the condition of compliance with international sustainability standards that call for deforestation-free value chains, the generation of RSME biodiesel on rubber tree plantations in Southeast Asia would have a total mitigation potential of around 2.8 million tonnes of CO2 eq. per year. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a promising bioenergy feedstock because it can be grown on marginal land and produces abundant biomass. Recalcitrance of the lignocellulosic components of the switchgrass cell wall to enzymatic degradation into simple sugars impedes efficient biofuel production. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of OsAT10, a BAHD acyltransferase gene, enhances saccharification efficiency in rice. Results: Here we show that overexpression of the rice OsAT10 gene in switchgrass decreased the levels of cell wall-bound ferulic acid (FA) in green leaf tissues and to a lesser extent in senesced tissues, and significantly increased levels of cell wall-bound p-coumaric acid (p-CA) in green leaves but decreased its level in senesced tissues of the T 0 plants under greenhouse conditions. The engineered switchgrass lines exhibit an approximate 40% increase in saccharification efficiency in green tissues and a 30% increase in senesced tissues. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that overexpression of OsAT10, a rice BAHD acyltransferase gene, enhances saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass in switchgrass. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, we develop an alternative Fuel-based Oil and Gas inventory (FOG) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from oil and gas production using publicly available fuel use records and emission factors reported in the literature. FOG is compared with the Environmental Protection Agency's 2014 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and with new top-down estimates of NOx emissions derived from aircraft and ground-based field measurement campaigns. Compared to our top-down estimates derived in four oil and gas basins (Uinta, UT, Haynesville, TX/LA, Marcellus, PA, and Fayetteville, AR), the NEI overestimates NOx by over a factor of 2 in three out of four basins, while FOG is generally consistent with atmospheric observations. Challenges in estimating oil and gas engine activity, rather than uncertainties in NOx emission factors, may explain gaps between the NEI and top-down emission estimates. Lastly, we find a consistent relationship between reactive odd nitrogen species (NOy) and ambient methane (CH4) across basins with different geological characteristics and in different stages of production. Future work could leverage this relationship as an additional constraint on CH4 emissions from oil and gas basins. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study assesses Japan's emission pathways aimed at net-zero emissions by 2050, as implied by the Paris Agreement's global climate goal of pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 °C. Based on a scenario analysis performed using AIM/Enduse [Japan], Japan's energy supply sector requires a radical transformation, including reliance on carbon dioxide removal options such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to attain net-zero emissions by 2050 without substantial social changes. By contrast, the gap between the 1.5 and 2 °C scenarios is relatively moderate in demand sectors. The building sector may need to be decarbonized even in the 2 °C case, whereas the transportation sector will face additional challenges, such as electrification and penetration of biofuel, in the 1.5 °C case. Reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a huge challenge, since the price of carbon in the net-zero emissions case increases by a factor of four or five over that in the 2 °C case. Moreover, the absence of early action as well as limited use of low-carbon energies would considerably add to the burden. Given these challenges and uncertainties, the potential of other mitigation options, such as drastic social change, large-scale afforestation and international emissions trading, merits consideration. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and industrial processes accounted for approximately 78% of the total increase in greenhouse gas emissions from 1970–2010. The economic advantages of reducing fossil fuel combustion and improving air quality, including a reduction in chronic diseases and their associated health care costs, and the economic opportunities associated with the development of alternative energy sources are undoubtedly one of the main initiatives to be defined by governments in the sphere of public health. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of the addition of different levels of biodiesel to diesel for automotive use on public health, considering changes in the ambient concentration of fine particles. Considering the two most populous metropolitan areas in Brazil, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, for a period of 11 years (2015–2025), by increasing the percentage of biodiesel to 20% (B20), it is estimated that there would be 13,000 fewer deaths and a gain generated from the avoided lost productivity of more than US$ 816 million. A total of 28,000 hospitalizations through the public health system would be avoided, generating a cost savings of US$ 25 million. Against the backdrop of a lack of policies and initiatives to combat air pollution, the magnitude of the results points to the importance of such a study in guiding the decisions of government officials with regard to how a city intervention—the addition of biodiesel to improve air quality—will bring a consequent benefit in the area of health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monocrop has increased worldwide. Plantations have had an impact on tropical landscapes decreasing natural vegetation or replacing other crops. The cultivation of oil palm in Mexico increased and this trend will likely continue. However, there are no documents about the regions where this crop has increased and its impact on the local land use dynamics. This information would help guide public policies. This study had the following objectives: 1) to analyze the trend in the change in the surface where oil palm has been cultivated in Mexico over the last 30 years; and 2) to evaluate changes to land use in municipalities with extensive cultivation surfaces. For this, government data was analyzed and palm plantations in four of the municipalities with major palm plantations were identified. Additionally, Geographic Information Systems were used to conduct a preliminary analysis of the area and of the covers that were replaced. In Mexico, the area in which palm is cultivated has increased seventyfold (from 1318 to 90 118 ha) from 1985 to 2016. Most of those plantations are located in Chiapas, Campeche, Tabasco, and Veracruz. Overall, palm plantations replaced other agricultural systems. In some municipalities, this area exceeded or was the same as the area used for corn (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghumn spp.) crops. This might have repercussions on food security. Although on a smaller scale, the expansion of palm crops also boosted the loss and transformation of natural vegetation in some of the municipalities that were part of this study. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.
El monocultivo de la palma de aceite (Elaeis guineensis) muestra incremento en el mundo. Las plantaciones han impactado los paisajes tropicales por la disminución de la vegetación natural o el remplazo de otros cultivos. La expansión del cultivo de la palma de aceite en México aumentó y se prevé que esta tendencia continúe. No se han documentado las regiones donde este cultivo ha incrementado y cómo ha impactado en la dinámica de uso de suelo. Esta información es necesaria para orientar políticas públicas. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron 1) analizar la tendencia de cambio en la superficie sembrada con palma de aceite en México en los últimos 30 años, y 2) evaluar el cambio de uso del suelo en municipios con superficies extensas del cultivo. Para esto, analizamos datos gubernamentales e identificamos las plantaciones de palma en cuatro de los principales municipios donde se cultiva. Además, con herramientas de Sistemas de Información Geográfica, analizamos de forma preliminar el área y las coberturas que se remplazaron. En México, el área dedicada a este cultivo aumentó más de 70 veces (de 1318 a 90 118 ha) entre 1985 y 2016; en Chiapas, Campeche, Tabasco y Veracruz se localizan mayormente estas plantaciones. Las plantaciones de la palma se localizan en superficie en la que se remplazaron otros sistemas agropecuarios. En algunos municipios, esa área superó o igualó la de cultivos con maíz (Zea mays) y sorgo (Sorghum spp.), lo que podría repercutir en la seguridad alimentaria. Aunque en menor escala, la expansión del cultivo de la palma también fomentó la pérdida y transformación de vegetación natural de algunos de los municipios estudiados. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.

AB  - Canadian ethanol production is currently derived from grain. Ethanol is criticized for displacing food production and not significantly reducing greenhouse gases. Second-generation ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as fast-growing trees, are promoted as being more effective at reducing greenhouse gases without compromising food supplies. However, a second-generation ethanol industry may not be costeffective with regard to greenhouse gas reduction. This study examines obstacles to a commercial secondgeneration ethanol industry, the potential for success, and the policy implications of promoting Canadian second-generation ethanol production. © 2018 Canadian Public Policy.

AB  - Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot crops, such as maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic stress resilience. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of stress-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to ent-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and ent-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified syn-CPP and ent-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13E-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and ent-neo-cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and ent-neo-CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of ent-CPP, ent-LPP, syn-CPP, and ent-neo-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-syn-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative stress and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic stress adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot crops toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving stress resilience traits in crop species. © 2018 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - This study develops life cycle water footprints for the production of fuels and chemicals via thermochemical conversion of algae biomass. This study is based on two methods of feedstock production – ponds and photobioreactors (PBRs) – and four conversion pathways – fast pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), conventional gasification, and hydrothermal gasification (HTG). The results show the high fresh water requirement for algae production and the necessity to recycle harvested water or use alternative water sources. To produce 1 kg of algae through ponds, 1564 L of water are required. When PBRs are used, only 372 L water are required; however, the energy requirements for PBRs are about 30 times higher than for ponds. From a final product perspective, the pathway based on the gasification of algae biomass was the thermochemical conversion method that required the highest amount of water per MJ produced (mainly due to its low hydrogen yield), followed by fast pyrolysis and HTL. On the other hand, HTG has the lowest water footprint, mainly because the large amount of electricity generated as part of the process compensates for the electricity used by the system. Performance in all pathways can be improved through recycling channels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels policies induce land use changes (LUC), including cropland expansion and crop switching, and this in turn alters water and soil management practices. Policies differ in the extent and type of land use changes they induce and therefore in their impact on water resources. We quantify and compare the spatially varying water impacts of biofuel crops stemming from LUC induced by two different biofuels policies by coupling a biophysical model with an economic model to simulate the economically viable mix of crops, land uses, and crop management choices under alternative policy scenarios. We assess the outputs of an economic model with a high-resolution crop-water model for major agricultural crops and potential cellulosic feedstocks in the US to analyze the impacts of three alternative policy scenarios on water balances: a counterfactual ‘no-biofuels policy’ (BAU) scenario, a volumetric mandate (Mandate) scenario, and a clean fuel-intensity standard (CFS) scenario incentivizing fuels based on their carbon intensities. While both biofuel policies incentivize more biofuels than in the counterfactual, they differ in the mix of corn ethanol and advanced biofuels from miscanthus and switchgrass (more corn ethanol in Mandate and more cellulosic biofuels in CFS). The two policies differ in their impact on irrigated acreage, irrigation demand, groundwater use and runoff. Net irrigation requirements increase 0.7% in Mandate and decrease 3.8% in CFS, but in both scenarios increases are concentrated in regions of Kansas and Nebraska that rely upon the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation water. Our study illustrates the importance of accounting for the overall LUC and shifts in agricultural production and management practices in response to policies when assessing the water impacts of biofuels. © 2018 Teter et al.

AB  - The Cauca River Valley region has traditionally been the main sugarcane production area for the sugar and ethanol industries in Colombia. This area is not expected to expand its agricultural frontiers, mainly due to social, geographic, and water limitations. This study is part of the Bioenergy Contribution of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa to the Global Sustainable Bioenergy Initiative (LACAf) project, which assessed potential regions for the expansion of ethanol production in Colombia and Mozambique. Studies linked to the LACAf project have identified the Llanos Orientales (eastern savannas) region as the most appropriate option for sugarcane expansion in Colombia, due to its favorable climate and a significant amount of arable land available for agriculture. The main goal of this study was to assess the economic benefits and environmental impacts of several simulated ethanol biorefineries in the Llanos Orientales region. The study was performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery, which allows the evaluation of integrated new alternatives for sugarcane and ethanol production. The results of this research showed that all the first- and second-generation biorefineries assessed were profitable and attractive. Furthermore, the results of the simulations for the Lanos Orientales region have shown great potential for reducing environmental impacts compared to the current production in the Cauca River Valley. Consequently, the ethanol produced could qualify as ‘advanced’ in terms of the US Environmental Protection Agency criteria, and it meets the requirements of the European Parliament, representing a business opportunity to enter into the largest ethanol markets, and increasing biofuel production in Colombia. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The membrane process had been applied for the advanced treatment of pig farm biogas slurry. As studied, this physical pretreatment, with low cost and high efficiency of the suspended solids removal and nutrient retention, is required to control membrane fouling. The combined process of paper filtration and ultrafiltration in a pilot scale was applied in the present study. The main objective was to explore and identify the feasibility of the new process for the pretreatment of the separation liquid of pig farm biogas slurry. A precision identification experiment of paper filtration and the multi-batch repetitive experiments of the combined process were designed. The results showed, at the identified paper filtration precision of 50µm and an operating pressure of 0.3 bar of the ultrafiltration process, that the flux rate at the stable stage of the multi-batch operation was around 295.00 L/h. The combined process achieved an overall processing rate of 345.41 ± 18.81 L/h and a volume permeation proportion of 82.45% ± 0.85%. The TSS was removed by 95.71%, but total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) were retained by 76.29% ± 2.04% and 73.74% ± 2.10%, respectively. Comprehensively, the requirement for the pretreatment was obtained. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Imidazolium ionic liquids (IILs) have a range of biotechnological applications, including as pretreatment solvents that extract cellulose from plant biomass for microbial fermentation into sustainable bioenergy. However, residual levels of IILs, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C2C1im]Cl), are toxic to biofuel-producing microbes, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae strains isolated from diverse ecological niches differ in genomic sequence and in phenotypes potentially beneficial for industrial applications, including tolerance to inhibitory compounds present in hydrolyzed plant feedstocks. We evaluated &gt;100 genome-sequenced S. cerevisiae strains for tolerance to [C2C1im]Cl and identified one strain with exceptional tolerance. By screening a library of genomic DNA fragments from the [C2C1im]Cl-tolerant strain for improved IIL tolerance, we identified SGE1, which encodes a plasma membrane multidrug efflux pump, and a previously uncharacterized gene that we named ionic liquid tolerance 1 (ILT1), which encodes a predicted membrane protein. Analyses of SGE1 sequences from our panel of S. cerevisiae strains together with growth phenotypes implicated two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associated with IIL tolerance and sensitivity. We confirmed these phenotypic effects by transferring the SGE1 SNPs into a [C2 C1 im]Cl-sensitive yeast strain using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Further studies indicated that these SNPs affect Sge1 protein stability and cell surface localization, influencing the amount of toxic IILs that cells can pump out of the cytoplasm. Our results highlight the general potential for discovering useful biotechnological functions from untapped natural sequence variation and provide functional insight into emergent SGE1 alleles with reduced capacities to protect against IIL toxicity. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - Todays, global warming and environmental issues are obvious and governments seek to alternative renewable fuels instead of fossil fuels. Among renewable fuels, biofuels because of the direct usable and easy production are highly interested. In this study, the biodiesel supply chain network is designed considering Jatropha, waste cooking oil and microalgae as feedstocks. The proposed model is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model which integrates all echelons of a biodiesel supply chain from raw material collection to biodiesel consumption stations in a multi-period condition. Also, different transportation modes for transporting different products are considered. The proposed model is applied in a real case in Iran. The achieved results indicate the applicability of the proposed model in optimum design of biodiesel supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-jet fuel is increasingly attracting attention in attempts to reduce the environmental impacts of aviation fuels. Feedstocks like camelina, jatropha and algae have been extensively studied, and exhibit fair performance in producing low-density hydrocarbon biofuels, mainly from triglyceride lipids. Grindelia squarrosa is a promising feedstock since the primary diterpenoid, grindelic acid with the branched tricyclic structure, is the major component in its biocrude. Herein, a heterogeneous bi-functional catalyst, palladium with the reductive properties supported on tungstate zirconia with acidic properties and good stability in hydrothermal media, was used for the conversion of Grindelia squarrosa biocrude to potential bio-jet fuels. Different solid acid catalyst supports and a variety of reaction conditions, such as temperature, catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time, were systematically investigated. At the optimum conditions, the oxygen content deceased from 18.1 % in the Grindelia squarrosa biocrude feedstock to 5.6 % in the final product, and is ready for further industrial treatment. The upgrading method utilized in this work can produce jet fuel precursors for synthesizing high-density cyclic hydrocarbons. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Bio-oil production from renewable sources has been seen as suitable alternative to supply future energy demand. Perennials grasses are currently being developed as a suitable second-generation biofuel feedstock. It has advantages such as rapid growth rate, easy to grow, minimal maintenance and utilise marginal land without competing with food supply. Taking into account of the various challenges attributed to the transformation of second-generation biomass for energy production, this work systematically looks at the ecological perspective and the availability for bioenergy production from Imperata Cylindrica in Brunei Darussalam. Biomass characterisation was carried out to determine the properties and energy content, meanwhile py-GC/MS study was conducted to identify building blocks of value-added chemical from I. cylindrica. The physicochemical properties of feedstock was thoroughly evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis, proximate analysis, elemental analysis, compositional analysis, calorific value, and analytical pyrolysis interfaced with gas chromatograph (Py-GC/MS). Characterisation results indicate that Imperata Cylindrica has a calorific value of 18.39 MJ/kg, with low ash content and high percentage of volatile matter. Py-GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of furfural, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, 4-vinylguaiacol, propenylguaiacol, guaiacol and 4-ethylphenol. The fixed-bed pyrolysis experiment of imperata cylindrica showed that the yield of bio-oil increases with the increase of temperature and it reached a peak of 37.16% at 500 °C. These results show that Imperata Cylindrica is suitable as feedstock for bio-oil production via pyrolysis process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spirulina platensis has been successfully commercialized as functional food ingredients, animal feed and medicine due to its high contents of protein, beta-carotene, vitamins, and minerals. In this study, we investigated the environmental performance (cradle-to-gate) of edible Spirulina tablets using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A comparative analysis with other three traditional foods or diets was conducted by using various nutrient values as functional units (e.g., protein content and a composite nutrient score) in the analysis. This research showed that Spirulina tablets production for protein caused environmental impacts mainly in fossil fuel use, acidification, climate change, smog formation, and eutrophication. The impact of the cultivation stage was the highest environmental impacts among all production stages resulting from the extensive use of chemicals, nutrients, and energy. The impacts of algae food production are around 2–5 times to algae production for biofuels which was also modeled in this study. In terms of protein production, algae tablet cause higher impacts than traditional terrestrial crops but lower impacts than protein from animal products. However, as the algae contain a wide variety of nutrients, especially high micronutrients such as the beta-carotene, the environmental impacts of producing the same nutrient combinations of protein and beta-carotene from carrot + tofu were higher than producing Spirulina tablets. The results in this work can be used to assess edible algae production inventories and provide reliable information for development of more sustainable products and processes. © 2018

AB  - Mariculture production has increased in the last decades, with untreated wastewater discharged directly into the sea, impacting coastal ecosystems. There is a need for mariculture wastewater treatment systems that are cost-effective. This can be met by the implementation of wastewater treatment systems that in addition to removing pollutants are capable of producing valuable by-products such as biomass for the biofuel industry. In this study, Dunaliella sp., Nannochloropsis sp. and Tetraselmis sp. microalgae were cultivated in controlled environments simulating mariculture wastewaters. Single stage culture systems were used to grow these microalgae, the growing conditions included inducing stress with different photon flux densities (900, 1500 and 2000 μmol m−2 s−1), and low carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations obtained at the stationary phase, in order to force these microalgae to increase their lipid content. The best results were obtained with Tetraselmis sp., which achieved 132.8 mg L−1 day−1 of biomass productivity at 900 μmol m−2 s−1. Nevertheless the best lipid productivity was reached at 1500 μmol m−2 s−1, also by Tetraselmis sp., being 29.5 mg L−1 day−1, where biomass productivity was of 124.5 mg L−1 day−1. All three microalgae species were able to remove &gt;90% of nitrogen and orthophosphates, and 80% of carbon, which makes them suitable for treating mariculture wastewater, and in addition, represent a valuable high lipid content biomass byproduct usable as raw material for biodiesel synthesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - First-generation bioethanol production from fermentation is a widely applied technology, with the United States of America and Brazil being the global leaders. However, several concerns regarding the widespread production of biofuels have arisen, particularly its environmental impacts. To address this issue, this study details the environmental impacts of the production of fist-generation bioethanol from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) in a pilot scale facility, using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Cultivation and transformation of sweet potato into bioethanol are considered in the system boundaries. The background data for the life cycle inventory were mainly obtained from the Ecoinvent 3.1 database and considered both literature and field data. The SimaPro software was used to perform the impact assessment considering the CML IA baseline 3.02 method. Three different agricultural waste scenarios are also considered and compared to evaluate the best-case scenarios. In addition, sensitivity analysis and comparison with other similar studies are thoroughly explored. Overall, the analyzed production system has lower impacts than indicated in similar studies, but considering its pilot scale, improvement of its environmental impacts is necessary, which might be addressed with larger scale and centralized support systems regarding transportation and other aspects. Based on the results, several recommendations to decrease environmental impacts are also listed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm perennial grass with valuable characteristics as a biofuel crop. To avoid competition with food crops, biofuel crops will be likely relegated to less productive soils such as marginal lands. Consequently, the salinity and water scarcity problems that commonly affect marginal lands compromise biofuel crop germination, emergence, and seedling establishment. The aims of this study were to study the germination and seedling growth of switchgrass under salinity and water stress and to describe the morpho-anatomical responses of the roots and leaves in the seedlings to these stress conditions. The effect of salt and water stress was assessed using sodium chloride (NaCl) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 at the same water potentials of − 0.8, − 1.0, and − 1.2 MPa. Seeds were moist prechilled for 7 days at 5 °C and germinated at 30/15 °C (8 h light/16 h dark). NaCl treatments (− 0.8 and − 1.0 MPa) delayed germination rates but did not reduce the final germination percentage, whereas at a lower potential (− 1.2 MPa), the final germination percentage was diminished. The effects of PEG (− 1.0 and − 1.2 MPa) on the germination rate and final percentage were more detrimental than those induced by isosmotic concentrations of NaCl. PEG and NaCl reduced significantly the vigor index of − 0.8 to − 1.2 MPa. The morpho-anatomical changes such as the reduction in the root cross-sectional area and the thickening of the endodermis walls for both stress conditions and aerenchyma formation in the cortex under salinity could significantly contribute in the survival and tolerance during the early seedling stages. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - For source identification, a field campaign involving simultaneous sampling of particulate matter (PM10) was conducted at eight sampling sites in the Indian mainland during winter 2014. The sampling sites include Delhi (upper IGP), Lucknow (middle IGP), and Kolkata (lower IGP) in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP); Mohal-Kullu and Darjeeling in the Indo-Himalayan Range (IHR). In addition, Ajmer, located upwind of the IGP in NW-India and Giridih and Bhubaneswar, in the downwind to the IGP has also been chosen. To characterize the sources of the ambient PM10, stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13CTC) and nitrogen (δ15NTN) for the total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) fractions have been considered. Ancillary chemical parameters, such as organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and water-soluble ionic components (WSIC) mass concentrations are also presented in this paper. There was very small variation in the daily average δ13CTC ratios (− 24.8 to − 25.9‰) among the sites. Comparison with end-member stable C isotopic signatures of major typical sources suggests that the PM10 at the sites was mainly from fossil fuel and biofuel and biomass combustion. Daily average δ15NTN ratios were not observed to vary much between sites either (8.3 to 11.0‰), and the low δ15NTN levels also indicate substantial contributions from biofuel and biomass burning of primarily C3 andC4 plant matter.

AB  - Producing biofuels from crops is controversial due to environmental issues and to food security threats linked with the dedication of land to energy crops rather than to food production. The 2009 European Renewable Energy Directive defined the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as an essential requirement for biofuels. Whatever their specific lifespans, energy crops have short- and long-term effects on the following crops, thus requiring assessment at cropping system level, which is rarely done in the literature. This study aimed at designing and assessing cropping system prototypes (CSP) that include energy crops and food/feed crops in Bourgogne (France), before being implemented in the field (i.e. ex ante). CSP were first designed, using a prototyping approach involving scientists and farm advisors, and then ex ante assessed, using indicators covering the environment, energy, economic and food issues. They were compared with two cropping systems based on food/feed crops. Lastly, we analyzed the sensitivity of the CSP profitability to several scenarios of crop yields and prices (i.e. grain and forage prices for food and feed crops respectively). CSP including Miscanthus x giganteus performed better in terms of GHG emissions, energy costs, nitrate losses and pesticide use than CSP that include only annual crops requiring more inputs, but achieved lower profitability and food production capacity. The cropping systems including only food/feed crops frequently achieved higher economic outcomes and food production capacity. Lastly, CSP combining pluriannual or annual energy crops and annual food/feed crops showed satisfactory trade-offs among environmental impacts and food production capacity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study is conducted to quantify the fossil energy input (FEI) and the global warming potential (GWP) of hydrogen production through iron-based chemical-looping process with CO2 capture using non-aqueous phase bio-oil (NAPB) from biomass fast pyrolysis as fuel. The eBalance software with Chinese Life Cycle Database is employed to implement this work based on the method of life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA results indicate NAPB production consumes the largest fossil energy and contributes the largest GWP while chemical-looping hydrogen production (CLHP) plays a critical role in lessening greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The net FEI and the net GWP of hydrogen production is, respectively, 0.597 MJ and −0.0767 kg CO2, eq. per MJ hydrogen gas via the proposed production pathway, far below those of the conventional hydrogen production via natural gas steam reforming and coal gasification. The sensitivity analysis shows the data uncertainty of the discussed parameters except the electricity consumption for NAPB production has no significant impact on the net GWP. The chemical-looping process with CO2 capture may be a more promising option to sustainably produce hydrogen gas especially using renewable biomass as fuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, there is a growing worldwide interest for the treatment of wastes, and especially farm wastes, by anaerobic digestion. Biochemical methane potential is a key parameter for the design, optimisation and monitoring of the anaerobic digestion process, but it is also time consuming (4–7 weeks). Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy seems a promising method to predict the biochemical methane potential of a wide range of organic substrates. This study compares a ‘global’ predictive model mainly built with biogas plant feedstocks, and a more ‘agricultural’ specific one built with farm wastes only (e.g. manures and crop residues). The global model was calibrated with 245 samples and the specific one with 171 samples. In parallel, validation sets composed of 36 farm wastes and eight other wastes (sludge, fruit residues and vegetables) were used to evaluate and compare both models. Satisfying results were obtained on the validation sets considering, respectively for the global and the specific models, a root mean square error of prediction of 44 and 34 NL CH4 kg−1 volatile solid, a coefficient of determination of 0.76 and 0.83, and a ratio of performance to deviation of 2.0 and 2.4. In general rules, the specific model was better than the global one in the prediction of farm wastes methane potential. However, thanks to its larger sample variability, the global one was more robust, especially towards the ‘other’ wastes, which can be introduced punctually in agricultural biogas plant. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuels are an important source of renewable biomass within the alternative energy portfolio. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial C4 grass native to North America, is widely studied as a biofuel feedstock for its consistently high yields and minimal input requirements. The influences of precipitation amount and temporal variability on the fertilizer response of switchgrass productivity are not fully understood. Moreover, global climate models predict changes in rainfall patterns towards lower and increasingly variable soil water availability in several productive areas worldwide, which may impact net primary production of biofuel crops. We conducted a meta-analysis of aboveground net primary production of switchgrass from 48 publications encompassing 82 different locations, 11 soil types, 52 switchgrass cultivars, fertilizer inputs between 0 to 896 kg N ha−1 year−1, and 1 to 6 years of annual productivity measures repeated on the same stand. Productivity of the lowland ecotype doubled with N rates &gt; 131 kg N ha−1 year−1, but upland ecotype productivity increased only by 50%. Results showed an optimum N rate of 30 to 60 kg N ha−1 year−1 for both ecotypes, after which biomass gain per unit of N added decreased. Growing season precipitation (GSPPT) and inter-annual precipitation variability (inter-PPTvar) affected both ecotypes similarly. Long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP) differentially affected lowland and upland productivity, depending on the N level. Productivity responses to MAP and GSPPT were similar for both upland and lowland ecotypes at none or low N rates. When N increased beyond 60 kg N ha−1 year−1, lowland cultivars had a greater growth response to MAP than uplands. Productivity increased with increasing GSPPT and MAP and had a positive linear response to MAP ranging from 600 to 1200 mm year−1. One third of the variability in switchgrass production was accounted for by inter-PPTvar. After accounting for MAP, sites with higher inter-PPTvar had lower switchgrass productivity than sites with lower inter-PPTvar. Increased inter-annual variation in precipitation reduced production of both ecotypes. Predicted changes in the amount and timing of precipitation thus likely will exert greater influence on production of upland than lowland ecotypes of switchgrass. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - A life cycle approach was used to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy balances of switchgrass pyrolysis in an auger reactor for biochar production, with bio-oil and syngas as co-products. The system boundaries included the cultivation of switchgrass on marginal lands, harvesting, transport, conditioning, pyrolysis, the amendment of biochar in soil to sequester carbon (C) and to reduce N2O emissions, and the valorisation of bio-oil and syngas as energy sources. Two pyrolysis scenarios were evaluated. Scenario A involves a lower pyrolysis temperature and a shorter solid residence in the reactor as compared to scenario B. A negative GHG emissions balance of −2110 and −2561 kg CO2e Mg−1 biochar was obtained for scenarios A and B, respectively. Biochar C sequestration contributed the most to the reduction of GHG emissions in scenario B due to the high C content and stability in biochar. However, scenario B resulted in a higher energy consumption (13,563 MJ Mg−1 biochar) than scenario A (2925 MJ Mg−1 biochar) due to a higher energy consumption of the pyrolysis unit. These results confirm that pyrolysis of switchgrass for biochar and bio-oil production can be a negative emission technology, but pyrolysis operating parameters should be selected carefully. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Micro-algae are photosynthetic organisms, which represent a promissory renewable raw material for biofuels production, since they can be cultivated in non-fertile lands, avoiding the competition with food crops for land use. From micro-algae, oil can be obtained oil that can be converted to biodiesel, green diesel and biojet fuel. In particular, the renewable aviation fuel is one of the less explored biofuels; nevertheless, for the aviation sector, this is the best alternative to reduce CO2 emissions, allowing its sustainable development. In order to produce hydrocarbons in the boiling point range of jet fuel, we need to transform the micro-algae oil. A number of research projects report the use of micro-algae oil for the production of biojet fuel through the hydrotreating process. However, the application of process intensification strategies for the hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil has not been reported. Therefore, in this work we propose the modeling, simulation and intensification of the hydrotreating process to produce biojet fuel, considering micro-algae oil as raw material. The hydroprocessing of micro-algae oil is modeled in Aspen Plus processes simulator, based on data from an experimental study recently reported. The produced renewable hydrocarbons are purified through conventional and intensified distillation sequences; thereby, conventional and intensified hydrotreating processes are defined and evaluated in terms of total annual costs, CO2 emissions and biojet fuel price. Simulation results show that the implementation of intensification strategies leads to the production of biojet fuel with reduced carbon dioxide emissions, 34% less, and a competitive price per liter, 78% cheaper than fossil jet fuel price. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The potential of liquid biofuels (like bioethanol and biodiesel) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector has generated a great deal of interest in the last few years, with particular attention being given to Jatropha methyl ester (JME). Jatropha curcas (Jc)—a species native to Mexico—shows some promise as a source of oil for biodiesel. A few studies on biodiesel production from Jc have been conducted in Mexico, but just one study involved a life cycle assessment (LCA) of JME. At the international level, most studies dealing with Jc focus on the biodiesel industrial process, while in this paper we also look in detail at the agricultural production phase. This case study provides preliminary results on GHG emissions and energy balances of JME production in Mexico, applying the LCA methodology recommended by the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED). Four production systems (JME 1–4) were studied, resulting in GHG mitigation of between 41 and 53% with regards to diesel if no direct land-use change (dLUC) change occurs. However, when accounting for GHG emissions arising from direct land-use change (dLUC), total emissions increase from 40 to 508 kg CO2e/GJ. The differences between dLUC on tropical dry forest and dLUC on grassland are of lesser importance than those between systems with and without dLUC. Using JME from plantations on lands, previously not cultivated, leads to GHG emissions three or six times higher than using fossil diesel. These results are an approximation to the environmental and energetic impacts of JME production in Mexico. Further studies should be performed before implementing more plantations to produce biofuel from J. curcas. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agave has recently shown its potential as a bioenergy feedstock with promising features such as higher biomass productivity than leading bioenergy feedstock while at the same time being drought-resistant with low water requirements and high sugar to ethanol conversion using ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment. IL pretreatment was studied to develop the first direct side-by-side comparative recalcitrance assessment of the agro-industrial residues from five Agave species [Agave americana (AME), A. angustifolia (ANG), A. fourcroydes (FOU), A. salmiana (SAL), and A. tequilana (TEQ)] using compositional analysis, X-ray diffraction, and the lignin syringyl/guaiacyl subunit ratio (S/G) by pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry (PyMBMS). Prominent calcium oxalate peaks were found only in unpretreated AME, SAL, and TEQ. The S/G ratios of all five unpretreated Agave species were between 1.27 and 1.57 while the IL-pretreated samples were from 1.39 to 1.72. The highest overall sugar production was obtained with IL-pretreated FOU with 492 mg glucose/g biomass and 157 mg xylose/g biomass at 120 °C and 3 h using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2C1Im][OAc]). An estimated theoretical ethanol yield from the studied agro-industrial residues from the five Agave species was in the range of 1060 to 5800 L ethanol/ha/year. These comparison results demonstrate the potential of the Agave spp. as a suitable biofuel feedstock which can be employed within a biorefinery scheme. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To improve the methane yield and digestate utilization of anaerobic digestion (AD), low-cost composited accelerants consisting of urea (0.2-0.5%), bentonite (0.5-0.8%), active carbon (0.6-0.9%), and plant ash (0.01-0.3%) were designed and tested in batch experiments. Total biogas yield (485.7-681.9 mL/g VS) and methane content (63.0-66.6%) were remarkably enhanced in AD systems by adding accelerants compared to those of control group (361.9 mL/g VS, 59.4%). Composited accelerant addition led to the highest methane yield (454.1 mL/g VS), more than double that of control group. The TS, VS, and CODt removal rates (29.7-55.3%, 50.9-63.0%, and 46.8-69.1%) for AD with accelerants were much higher than control group (26.2%, 37.1%, and 39.6%). The improved digestate stability and enhanced fertilizer nutrient content (4.95-5.66%) confirmed that the digestate of AD systems with composited accelerants could safely serve as a potential component of bioorganic fertilizer. These findings open innovative avenues in composited accelerant development and application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing concerns on environmental and economic issues linked to fossil fuel use has driven great interest in cyanobacteria as third-generation biofuel agents. In this study, the biodiesel potential of a model photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Fremyella diplosiphon, was identified by fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) via direct transesterification. Total lipids in wild type (Fd33) and halotolerant (HSF33-1 and HSF33-2) strains determined by gravimetric analysis yielded 19% cellular dry weight (CDW) for HSF33-1 and 20% CDW for HSF33-2, which were comparable to Fd33 (18% CDW). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detected a high ratio of saturated to unsaturated FAMEs (2.48–2.61) in transesterified lipids, with methyl palmitate being the most abundant (C16:0). While theoretical biodiesel properties revealed high cetane number and oxidative stability, high cloud and pour point values indicated that fuel blending could be a viable approach. Significantly high FAME abundance in total transesterified lipids of HSF33-1 (40.2%) and HSF33-2 (69.9%) relative to Fd33 (25.4%) was identified using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry, indicating that robust salt stress response corresponds to higher levels of extractable FAME. Alkanes, a key component in conventional fuels, were present in F. diplosiphon transesterified lipids across all strains confirming that natural synthesis of these hydrocarbons is not inhibited during biodiesel production. While analysis of photosynthetic pigments and phycobiliproteins did not reveal significant differences, FAME abundance varied significantly in wild type and halotolerant strains indicating that photosynthetic pathways are not the sole factors that determine fatty acid production. We characterize the potential of F. diplosiphon for biofuel production with FAME yields in halotolerant strains higher than the wild type with no loss in photosynthetic pigmentation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We aimed to use physical methods of microalgal biomass rupture to study saccharification strategies using free and immobilized amylolytic enzymes. The biomass of Spirulina platensis, which consists of 50-60% carbohydrates, was exposed to physical cell rupture treatments, with better results obtained using freeze/thaw cycles following by gelatinization. In saccharification tests, it was possible to hydrolyze Spirulina biomass with hydrolysis efficiencies above 99% and 83%, respectively, using 1% (v/v) of free enzymes or 1% (m/v) of amylolytic enzymes immobilized together. The use of free and immobilized enzymes yielded high levels of conversion of polysaccharides to simple sugars in Spirulina biomass, showing that these processes are promising for the advancement of bioethanol production using microalgal biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in corn ethanol production has raised concerns about its indirect impacts on the expansion of cropland and implications for the environment and continues to be a controversial issue. In particular, land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) declined by 7.2 million acres between 2007 and 2012 while corn ethanol production more than doubled. However, the extent to which this decline in CRP acres can be causally attributed to increased ethanol production is yet to be determined. Using a dynamic, partial equilibrium economic model for the US agricultural sector we find that doubling of corn ethanol production over the 2007-2012 period (holding all else constant) led to the conversion of 3.2 million acres of unused cropland, including 1 million acres in CRP, to crop production. While substantial in magnitude, we find that these land use changes due to biofuel production accounted for only 16% and 13% of the total reduction in unused cropland and in CRP acres, respectively, that occurred over the 2007-2012 period. We also find that the land use change per million gallons of corn ethanol has declined non-linearly over time from 453 acres to 112 acres over the 2007-2012 period. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decentralized anaerobic digestion (AD) of manure and organic residues is a possible strategy to improve carbon and nutrient cycling within agricultural regions, meanwhile generating renewable energy. To date, there has been limited adoption of decentralized AD technology in industrialized countries owing to low profitability for plant operators. There remains a need to demonstrate the wider sustainability of small-scale, decentralized AD in order to justify policy support for such a strategy. This study applies a multi-dimensional assessment of the environmental, economic and social sustainability of two scenarios of decentralized, farm-scale AD of pig slurry and organic residues in Southern Sweden. The environmental dimension was assessed by means of an expanded boundary life cycle assessment, in which trade-offs between fertilizer replacement, soil organic carbon accumulation, digestate/manure storage and application, transport and soil emissions were evaluated. The economic dimension was assessed through modelling of the net present value and internal rate of return. Finally, the social dimension was assessed by means of a stakeholder perception inquiry among key stakeholders in the field. It was concluded that the overall environmental balance of decentralized AD was favorable, while also the net present value could be positive. Fertilizer replacement, soil organic carbon and digestate storage effects were identified as important factors that should be accounted for in future life cycle assessments. A key issue for interviewed stakeholders was product quality assurance. Wider application of multi-dimensional sustainability assessment, capturing important nutrient cycling effects, could provide an evidence base for policy to support sustainable deployment of decentralized AD. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Livestock farming generates animal manure as a by-product. In comparison to in some countries, manure is hardly used for energy production in Switzerland. A growing awareness of renewable energy needs, resource depletion, and climate challenges make the huge untapped potential of livestock manure very attractive, particularly regarding biogas technology. Here, we assessed the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions benefits of using manure for biogas, considering its spatial distribution in Switzerland. First, laboratory measurements were conducted to compare the composition of fresh manure with values from literature. Then, detailed assessments of manure availability for biogas production were performed. Finally, the mitigation potential regarding GHG emissions was estimated for three scenarios. The new lab-scale values confirmed early storage as an important phase that is still not considered in practice. Under current farming practice, Swiss manure could produce 430 million m3 biogas or 15 PJ gross biogas yearly, mostly from cattle. However, only 6% of this manure is currently being used for anaerobic digestion. The manure is widely spread across the country in relatively small farms. Considering the spatial distribution of manure and Swiss agricultural structures, there is considerable potential for small-scale individual installations, with a peak of approximately 250 GJ gross biogas yearly, as well as for joint-farm installations. If the currently exploitable amount of manure were used for energy, the emission of 159 kt of CO2 equivalent could be prevented compared to emissions under current management practices. Thus, manure digestion could be promoted for its wide environmental and energetic benefits. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol is being promoted in Mexico to be used in a blend with gasoline. On the north of the Yucatan peninsula, bioethanol could be produced from sweet sorghum, as it can grow efficiently on this land; it can be harvested 2–3 times in a year and possesses a better agronomical stability than sugarcane with low nitrogen requirements and high productivity. In this work, the potential environmental impacts and energy efficiency of bioethanol production from sweet sorghum were evaluated using life-cycle assessment. Four scenarios were evaluated: scenario PI considered only bioethanol production from the stalk juice; scenarios PII and PIII added cogeneration from the dry-stalk biomass in single and combined cycle, respectively. Scenario PIV considered bioethanol production from both stalk juice and dry-stalk biomass. Scenario PI demanded more fossil energy than what was generated as bioethanol, while scenarios PII and PIII were fossil energy independent. Scenario PIII showed the higher net energy ratio (1.89) and a better environmental performance in all CML-IA baseline impact categories. In terms of global warming potential, the scenario PIII showed a mitigation potential of 16% with respect to the fossil reference. In the categories where the sweet sorghum scenarios represented larger emissions than the fossil reference, it was due mainly to the use of fertilizers and the conventional energy consumption in the various processing steps of the biomass. Scenario PIV showed the highest energy demand and worst environmental performance due to large demands of energy and chemicals in the bagasse pretreatment step. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Unlocking the potential and value of lignocellulosic residues is an important step in making biorefineries economically and environmentally promising. This calls for a holistic and systematic approach in designing sustainable industrial systems. In this work, biorefinery systems via biochemical route (acetone–butanol–ethanol or ABE system) and thermochemical route (gasification and mixed alcohols or GMA system) for converting corn stover into biofuels have been designed using a Sustainable Engineering Framework. The framework involves eight main steps: (1) design problem definition, (2) data collection, (3) process synthesis and simulation, (4) process integration, (5) resource recovery from residues, (6) utility system design, (7) economic and environmental modelling and (8) economic value and environmental impact margin analysis for decision making. Consideration of resource recovery from biorefinery waste streams has proven to be the key in making biorefineries self-sustaining and with low environmental impacts. Simultaneous economic and environmental feasibility assessment at the early stage of process design is highly envisaged. The cost of biofuel production in the ABE system has been found to be 49.2 US$/GJ and 69.9 US$/GJ in the GMA system. The greenhouse gas emissions are 46.2 g CO2-eq/GJ for ABE and 19.0 g CO2-eq/GJ for GMA, lower than gasoline (85 g CO2-eq/GJ). The GMA system is not economically compelling though with high environmental benefit, while the ABE system has shown to be both economically and environmentally feasible. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, water hyacinth was converted into highly flammable bio-oil via two-step catalytic pyrolysis. The upgradation of bio-oil was based on the pretreatment of biomass, second-step pyrolysis and use of clinkered material as a catalyst. This three-prong approach was found effective for improving the nature and yield of the oil by lowering the water and oxygen content in the product. The yield of oil was investigated as a function of pyrolysis temperature and weight of the catalyst in addition to pretreatment of biomass. Optimum time for the reaction was also investigated for all three types of biomass. In the preliminary pyrolysis, each of the sample was pyrolyzed into an aqueous liquid, gas, and solid residue fractions. The liquid fraction of each of the sample was separated into combustible and non-combustible liquids in addition to residue using fractional distillation. The residue of the fractional distillation for each of the fresh, putrefied, and microbe-treated biomass was re-pyrolyzed and the gas produced during 1st and 2nd steps of the pyrolysis was analyzed using chemical analysis. The upgraded oils were analyzed for their composition with GC-MS technique. The oil products of the tested samples were significantly differing from each other in terms of nature and number of the compounds. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1836–1844, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Purpose: Diminishing fossil resources and environmental concerns associated with their vast utilization have been in focus by energy policy makers and researchers. Among the different scenarios put forth to commercialize biofuels, various biorefinery concepts have aroused global interests because of their ability in converting biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and bioenergies. This study was aimed at developing different novel castor-based biorefinery scenarios for generating biodiesel and other co-products, i.e., ethanol and biogas. In these scenarios, glycerin, heat, and electricity were also considered as byproducts. Developed scenarios were also compared with a fossil reference system delivering the same amount of energy through the combustion of neat diesel. Materials and methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to investigate the environmental consequences of castor biodiesel production and consumption with a biorefinery approach. All the input and output flows from the cultivation stage to the combustion in diesel engines as well as changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) were taken into account. Impact 2002+ method was used to quantify the environmental consequences. Results and discussion: The LCA results demonstrated that in comparison with the fossil reference system, only one scenario (i.e., Sc-3 with co-production of significant amounts of biodiesel and biomethane) had 16% lower GHG emissions without even considering the improving effect of SOC. Moreover, resource damage category of this scenario was 50% lower than that of neat diesel combustion. The results proved that from a life cycle perspective, energy should be given priority in biorefineries because it is essential for a biorefinery to have a positive energy balance in order to be considered as a sustainable source of energy. Despite a positive effect on energy and GHG balances, these biorefineries had negative environmental impacts on the other damage categories like Human Health and Ecosystem Quality. Conclusions: Although biorefineries offer unique features as promising solutions for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the selection of biomass processing options and management decisions can affect the final results in terms of environmental evaluations and energy balance. Moreover, if biorefineries are focused on transportation fuel production, a great deal of effort should still be made to have better environmental performance in Human Health and Ecosystem Quality damage categories. This study highly recommends that future studies focus towards biomass processing options and process optimization to guarantee the future of the most sustainable biofuels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Biofuels have emerged as an attractive renewable alternative to satisfy the global energy demands. The large-scale production of biofuels requires the installation of biorefining systems that involve strategic decisions for the logistics and operation in the production of biofuels such as location, feedstock type(s), production capacities and interactions with the surrounding environment. This work proposes an optimization framework for the design of a biorefining system while accounting for the interactions with the surrounding watershed using a material flow analysis technique through the design of an efficient supply chain for the production and distribution of feedstocks, grains and biofuels considering the water and land requirements. The proposed model deals with the uncertainty involved in the project (e.g., prices of feedstocks and products, biofuel demands and precipitation in the watershed). A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to simultaneously consider the economic and environmental objectives. A case study located in Mexico is solved for a set of scenarios with the purpose of illustrating the capabilities of the proposed optimization approach. The results show strong trade-offs between the considered objectives and the impact of uncertainties. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) has been recognized as being a biomass crop for energy and livestock forage production. In this study, 26 Jerusalem artichoke clones previously collected from 24 provinces of China were grown under semiarid conditions in 2008 and 2011. At harvest, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations and accumulations were measured for all clones and levels of both were higher overall for 2008 than 2011, with statistically reasonable results for both years. Notably, N and K concentrations in aboveground parts were higher than in tubers for most clones, yet the tuber P concentration was consistently higher than in aboveground parts. Comparing with other forage and energy plants, it demonstrates that under optimal conditions, diverse Jerusalem artichoke clones could meet the requirements of either energy production or livestock forage feed. Based on N, P and K accumulation and concentration profiles, the 26 Jerusalem artichoke clones clustered into six groups. Three clones of one cluster, CQ-1, GZ-1 and HUN-3, are recommended for use as biomass energy materials due to the lower N concentration level in aboveground parts and higher N concentration level in tubers, while 16 clones are recommended for use as forage due to the higher N concentration level in aboveground parts. The phenotypic traits described in this work should facilitate quantitative trait locus mapping and the subsequent use of clone germplasms for development of improved varieties suited to specific growth conditions and applications. © T.

AB  - Broadband microwave spectra over the 2-18 GHz range have been recorded for the resonance-stabilized 2-furanyloxy radical, formed in the first step of pyrolysis of the second-generation biofuel 2-methoxyfuran by methyl loss. Using a flash pyrolysis source attached to a pulsed valve, a 0.7% mixture of 2-methoxyfuran in argon was pyrolyzed at a series of temperatures ranging from 300 to 1600 K. Subsequent cooling in a supersonic expansion produced rotational temperatures of ∼2 K in the interrogation region. Using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) methods, combined with strong-field coherence breaking (SFCB), a set of transitions due to the radical were identified and assigned. The experimental rotational constants (A = 8897.732(93), B = 4019.946(24), C = 2770.321(84)), centrifugal distortion constants, and spin-rotation coupling constants have been determined for the radical and compared with ab initio predictions at the CCSD(T) level of theory. Compared to the 2-methoxyfuran precursor, the 2-furanyloxy radical has allylic C-C bond lengths intermediate between single and double bonds, a shortened C(5)-O(6) bond characteristic of partial double-bond character, and an O(1)-C(5)-O(6) bond angle of 121°, which resembles the O-C-O angle of an ester. Atomic spin densities extracted from the calculations confirm that the 2-furanyloxy radical is best viewed as a carbon-centered allylic lactone radical, with 80% of the spin density on the two allylic carbons and 20% on the pendant O(6) atom. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The paper deals with the issue of greenhouse gas emissions that are produced by the road freight transport sector. These emissions affect the structure of the ozone layer and contribute to the greenhouse effect that causes global warming-issues that are closely associated with changing weather patterns and extreme weather events. Attention is drawn to the contradictions linked to FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) biofuels, namely the fact that although their use generates almost zero greenhouse gas emissions, their production requires high levels of energy consumption. The first part of the paper deals with the theoretical basis of the negative impacts of transport on the environment and the subsequent measurement of the extent of the harmful emissions generated by the road freight transport sector. In the methodical part of the paper, the calculation procedures and declared energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions generated by transport services are analyzed according to the EN 16258 standard. The experimental part of the paper focuses on the application of the methodology to a specific shipment on a specified transport route, where the total energy consumption and production of greenhouse gas emissions is determined. These calculations are based on comprehensive studies carried out for a particular transport company that assigned the authors the task of determining to what extent the declared energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions change when the type of fuel used is changed. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This article focuses on the analysis of the behavior patterns of the variables involved in the anaerobic digestion process. The objective is to predict the impact factor and the behavior pattern of the variables, i.e., temperature, pH, volatile solids (VS), total solids, volumetric load, and hydraulic residence time, considering that these are the control variables for the conservation of the different groups of anaerobic microorganisms. To conduct the research, samples of physicochemical sludge were taken from a water treatment plant in a poultry processing factory, and, then, the substrate was characterized, and a thermal pretreatment was used to accelerate the hydrolysis process. The anaerobic digestion process was analyzed in order to obtain experimental data of the control variables and observe their impact on the production of biogas. The results showed that the thermal pre-hydrolysis applied at 90°C for 90 min accelerated the hydrolysis phase, allowing a significant 52% increase in the volume of methane produced. An artificial neural network was developed, and it was trained with the database obtained by monitoring the anaerobic digestion process. The results obtained from the artificial neural network showed that there is an adjustment between the real values and the prediction of validation based on 60 samples with a 96.4% coefficient of determination, and it was observed that the variables with the major impact on the process were the loading rate and VS, with impact factors of 36% and 23%, respectively. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Reliable data on biomass produced by lignocellulosic bioenergy crops are essential to identify sustainable bioenergy sources. Field studies have been performed for decades on bioenergy crops, but only a small proportion of the available data is used to explore future land use scenarios including bioenergy crops. A global dataset of biomass production for key lignocellulosic bioenergy crops is thus needed to disentangle the factors impacting biomass production in different regions. Such dataset will be also useful to develop and assess bioenergy crop modelling in integrated assessment socio-economic models and global vegetation models. Here, we compiled and described a global biomass yield dataset based on field measurements. We extracted 5,088 entries of data from 257 published studies for five main lingocellulosic bioenergy crops: eucalypt, Miscanthus, poplar, switchgrass, and willow. Data are from 355 geographic sites in 31 countries around the world. We also documented the species, plantation practices, climate conditions, soil property, and managements. Our dataset can be used to identify productive bioenergy species over a large range of environments. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Mannitol-containing macro algae biomass, such as Ascophyllum nodosum and Laminaria digitata, are a potential feedstock for the production of biofuels such as bioethanol. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the ability of thermophilic anaerobes within Class Clostridia to ferment mannitol and mannitol-containing algal extracts. Screening of the type strains of six genera, Caldanaerobius, Caldanaerobacter, Caldicellulosiruptor, Thermoanaerobacter, Thermobrachium, and Thermoanaerobacterium) was conducted on 20 mM mannitol and revealed that 11 of 41 strains could utilize mannitol with ethanol being the dominant end-product. Mannitol utilization seems to be most common within the genus of Thermoanaerobacter (7 of 16 strains) with yields up to 88% of the theoretical yield in the case of Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus. Six selected mannitol-degrading strains (all Thermoanaerobacter species) were grown on mannitol extracts prepared from A. nodosum and L. digitata. Five of the strains produced similar amounts of ethanol as compared with ethanol yields from mannitol only. Finally, T. pseudoethanolicus was kinetically monitored using mannitol and mannitol extracts made from two macro algae species, A. nodosum and L. digitata for end-product formation. © 2018 Chades, Scully, Ingvadottir and Orlygsson.

AB  - The thermodynamic implications of different bioethanol production routes from wheat straw (a cellulosic co-product or ‘waste’ stream) have been evaluated. Comparative thermodynamic (energy and exergy) analysis gives rise to alternative insights into the relative performance of various process chains. Energy analysis of four different production paths were firstly analysed via the consideration of mechanical work, temperature changes and separating techniques. The Net Energy Value (NEV) of each production path or route was then evaluated, including the effect of system boundary expansion. In contrast, the thermodynamic property known as ‘exergy’ reflects the ability of undertake ‘useful work’ but does not represent well heating processes. Exergetic efficiencies were consequently obtained via chemical and physical exergy calculations, along with some of the electrical inputs to the different processes. The exergetic ’improvement potentials’ of the process stages were then determined using the exergetic efficiencies and irreversibility values respectively. These estimates will enable industrialists and policy makers to take account of some of the ramifications of alternative bioethanol production routes in a low carbon future. © 2018

AB  - Biofuels and the oleochemical industry are highly dependent on plant oils for the generation of renewable product lines. Consequently, production of plant lipids, such as palm and rapeseed oil, for industrial applications competes with agricultural activity and is associated with a negative environmental impact. Additionally, established chemical routes for upgrading bio-lipids to renewable products depend on metal-containing catalysts. Metal leaching during oil processing results in heavy metal contaminated process wastewater. This water is difficult to remediate and leads to the loss of precious metals. Therefore, the biofuels and chemical industry requires sustainable solutions for production and upgrading of bio-lipids. With regard to the former, a promising approach is the fermentative conversion of abundant, low-value biomass into microbial, particularly yeast-based lipids. This study describes the holistic, value-adding conversion of underexploited, macroalgae feedstocks into yeast oil, animal feed and biosorbents for metal-based detoxification of process wastewater. The initial step comprises a selective enzymatic liquefaction step that yields a supernatant containing 62.5% and 59.3% (w/dwbiomass) fermentable sugars from L. digitata and U. lactuca, respectively. By dispensing with chemical pretreatment constraints, we achieved a 95% (w/w) glucose recovery. Therefore, the supernatant was qualified as a cultivation media without any detoxification step or nutrition addition. Additionally, the hydrolysis step provided 27-33% (w/dwbiomass) of a solid residue, which was qualified as a metal biosorbent. Cultivation of the oleaginous yeast C. oleaginosus on the unprocessed hydrolysis supernatant provided 44.8 g L−1 yeast biomass containing 37.1% (w/dwbiomass) lipids. The remaining yeast biomass after lipid extraction is targeted as a performance animal feed additive. Selectivity and capacity of solid macroalgae residues as biosorbents were assessed for removal and recycling of rare and heavy metals, such as Ce+3, Pb+2, Cu+2 and Ni+2 from model wastewater. The biosorption capacity of the macroalgae residues (sorption capacity ∼ 0.7 mmol g−1) exceeds that of relevant commercially available adsorption resins and biosorbents. To facilitate the integration of our technology in existing chemical and biotechnological production environments, we have devised simple, rapid and cost-efficient methods for monitoring both lipogenesis and metal sorption processes. The application of the new optical monitoring tools is essential to determine yeast cell harvesting times and biosorption capacities respectively. For the first time we report on a waste-free bioprocess that combines sustainable, microbial lipid production from low value marine biomass with in-process precious metal recycling options. Our data allowed for a preliminary economic analysis, which indicated that each product could be cost competitive with current market equivalents. Hence, the synaptic nature of the technology platform provides for the economic and ecologic viability of the overall process chain. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The constant increase in biofuel consumption has originated a wide variety concerning the use of raw materials for biofuel manufacture. Currently, ISO 17225 norm establishes a set of kinds and specifications for the use of solid biofuels —woody, herbaceous, fruit and aquatic biomass, along with their combinations or mixtures—. One of the non-woody kinds of pellets in this norm is aquatic biomass, among which the cultivation of microalgae stands out. Even though the main use of microalgae is not for energy purposes, its potential is significant due to their high photosynthesis efficiency, fast growth rate, efficient CO2 fixation and no competition with arable land. The present research work offers an additional alternative for microalgae use, that is, the densification of the waste obtained after microalgae conversion to biodiesel and biogas. Thus, an analysis of the energy viability of wastes from Scenedesmus microalgae was carried out. Satisfactory results would revalue this waste, obtaining an additional biofuel. The initial characterization showed poor outcomes concerning nitrogen, sulphur and ash content —well above most biomass fuels—. Nevertheless, physical characterization of the pellets manufactured was satisfactory. After a preliminary drying, the waste showed good properties for densification, which is a positive circumstance for the intended purposes, such as energy, animal feeding, etc. © 2018

AB  - Background: Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) enhances plant water-use efficiency through an inverse day/night pattern of stomatal closure/opening that facilitates nocturnal CO2 uptake. CAM has evolved independently in over 35 plant lineages, accounting for ~ 6% of all higher plants. Agave species are highly heat- and drought-tolerant, and have been domesticated as model CAM crops for beverage, fiber, and biofuel production in semi-arid and arid regions. However, the genomic basis of evolutionary innovation of CAM in genus Agave is largely unknown. Results: Using an approach that integrated genomics, gene co-expression networks, comparative genomics and protein structure analyses, we investigated the molecular evolution of CAM as exemplified in Agave. Comparative genomics analyses among C3, C4 and CAM species revealed that core metabolic components required for CAM have ancient genomic origins traceable to non-vascular plants while regulatory proteins required for diel re-programming of metabolism have a more recent origin shared among C3, C4 and CAM species. We showed that accelerated evolution of key functional domains in proteins responsible for primary metabolism and signaling, together with a diel re-programming of the transcription of genes involved in carbon fixation, carbohydrate processing, redox homeostasis, and circadian control is required for the evolution of CAM in Agave. Furthermore, we highlighted the potential candidates contributing to the adaptation of CAM functional modules. Conclusions: This work provides evidence of adaptive evolution of CAM related pathways. We showed that the core metabolic components required for CAM are shared by non-vascular plants, but regulatory proteins involved in re-reprogramming of carbon fixation and metabolite transportation appeared more recently. We propose that the accelerated evolution of key proteins together with a diel re-programming of gene expression were required for CAM evolution from C3 ancestors in Agave. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Life cycle analysis was conducted with a focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of renewable gasoline and diesel produced by the integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion (IH2) and the new IH2 plus Fischer-Tropsch (IH2 Plus cool GTL) processes. This new process has a primary objective of increasing the yield of biofuel relative to original IH2 process (increase of 26% to 38% wt) by processing the C1-C3 gas co-products through an integrated Fischer-Tropsch unit to produce liquid-range hydrocarbon biofuel. For both biofuel processes, woody biomass residues (forest logging and saw mills) and algae were investigated as feedstocks. The effect of the electricity generation mix of different states in the U.S. was also examined for algae cultivation. For woody residues as feedstock, life cycle GHG emission savings of about 86.8% and 63.3% were calculated for the IH2 and optimized-IH2 Plus cool GTL hydrocarbon biofuel, respectively, relative to fossil-derived fuel. For algae as feedstock, emission increases of about 140% and 103% were calculated for the IH2 and optimized-IH2 Plus cool GTL, respectively, relative to fossil-derived fuel. The electricity grid mix of the biorefinery location significantly impacts the GHG emissions of the processes for algae feedstock. GHG savings of about 42% can be potentially achieved if the plant was located in an area with a low GHG intensity grid. This study has shown that a significant biofuel yield boost can be achieved while retaining high GHG savings by using IH2 Plus cool GTL for a woody feedstock. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Industrial enzymes can be used to improve the digestibility of livestock feed components, thereby increasing the nutritional value of the feed, and allowing farmers to change and cost-optimize the feed composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts of adding a starch-degrading enzyme (amylase) to feed for Brazilian chicken production. A lifecycle assessment covering all significant processes in the value chain as well as all significant impact categories was used as analytical tool. The application of amylase increases the energy value of corn in chicken feed and allows saving of costly fat in the feed. In Brazil, the saved fat is used either for biodiesel production or as a replacement for other fats in cleaning and hygiene products. The study showed that approximately 6% of greenhouse-gas emission from Brazilian chicken production could be avoided using the amylase. Using the amylase increases the contribution to nutrient enrichment by 0.6% when the excess fat is used for biodiesel. The use of amylase has little impact on agricultural land use, water consumption and acidification. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The diverse microbiome present in the rumen of ruminant animals facilitates the digestion of plant-based fiber. In this study, a shotgun metagenomic analysis of the microbes adhering to plant fiber in the camel rumen was undertaken to identify the key species contributing to lignocellulose degradation and short chain volatile fatty acids (VFA) fermentation. Results: The density of genes in the metagenome encoding glycoside hydrolases was estimated to be 25 per Mbp of assembled DNA, which is significantly greater than what has been reported in other sourced metagenomes, including cow rumen. There was also a substantial representation of sequences encoding scaffoldins, dockerins and cohesins, indicating the potential for cellulosome-mediated lignocellulose degradation. Binning of the assembled metagenome has enabled the definition of 65 high-quality genome bins which showed high diversity for lignocellulose degrading enzymes. Species associated to Bacteroidetes showed a high proportion of genes for debranching and oligosaccharide degrading enzymes, while those belonging to Firmicutes and Fibrobacteres were rich in cellulases and hemicellulases and thus these lineages were probably the key for ensuring the degradation of lignocellulose. The presence of many "polysaccharide utilization loci" (PULs) in Bacteroidetes genomes indicates their broad substrate specificity and high potential carbohydrate degradation ability. An analysis of VFA biosynthesis pathways showed that genes required for the synthesis of acetate were present in a range of species, except for Elusimicrobiota and Euryarchaeota. The production of propionate, exclusively via the succinate pathway, was carried out by species belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres. Butyrate was generated via the butyrylCoA: acetate CoA-transferase pathway by Bacteroidetes and Lentisphaerae species, but generally via the butyrate kinase pathway by Firmicutes species. Conclusion: The analysis confirmed the camel rumen's microbiome as a dense and yet largely untapped source of enzymes with the potential to be used in a range of biotechnological processes including biofuel, fine chemicals and food processing industries. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper discusses an evaluation of the environmental impacts of a Municipal Solid Waste Management System using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), with a view to the proposal of improvement actions, the support of decision-making processes, and the establishment of public policies. This study was developed based on an analysis of the solid waste management system of the city of Sorocaba, Brazil (600,000 inhabitants). The LCA was performed using the CML baseline 2000 method of impact assessment. The system consists primarily of the ordinary collection and disposal in a landfill of 488 tons/day of solid wastes containing more than 40% of organic matter and a selective collection which diverts only 17 tons/day of the wastes from landfilling. It was found that emissions of methane in the landfill are responsible for 62% of all the impacts, followed by the transport of ordinary wastes (34.2%). Actions such as increased recycling and the development of composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration of waste would significantly reduce the amount of landfill waste, and hence, the impacts of landfilling. The burning of methane and the use of biofuels by the fleet should be immediately implemented to reduce the impacts provided by this waste management system. © 2018 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

AB  - Many countries see biofuels as a replacement to fossil fuels to mitigate climate change. Nevertheless, some concerns remain about the overall benefits of biofuels policies. More comprehensive tools seem required to evaluate indirect effects of biofuel policies. This article proposes a method to evaluate large-scale biofuel policies that is based on life cycle assessment (LCA), environmental extensions of input-output (I-O) tables, and a general equilibrium model. The method enables the assessment of indirect environmental effects of biofuels policies, including land-use changes (LUCs), in the context of economic and demographic growth. The method is illustrated with a case study involving two scenarios. The first one describes the evolution of the world economy from 2006 to 2020 under business as usual (BAU) conditions (including demographic and dietary preferences changes), and the second integrates biofuel policies in the United States and the European Union (EU). Results show that the biofuel scenario, originally designed to mitigate climate change, results in more greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the BAU scenario. This is mainly due to emissions associated with global LUCs. The case study shows that the method enables a broader consideration for environmental effects of biofuel policies than usual LCA: Global economic variations calculated by a general equilibrium economic model and LUC emissions can be evaluated. More work is needed, however, to include new biofuel production technologies and reduce the uncertainty of the method. © 2017 by Yale University.

AB  - The empty fruit bunches of oil palm have been used as the raw material to produce biofuel. However, the lignin present in oil palm tissues hampers the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass and lower the yield of biofuel produced. Hence, various efforts were taken to identify the lignin biosynthetic genes in oil palm and to investigate their regulation at the molecular level. In this study, a lignin biosynthetic gene, Eg4CL1 and its promoter were isolated from the oil palm. Eg4CL1 contains the acyl-activating enzyme consensus motif and boxes I & II which are present in other 4CL homologs. Eg4CL1 was clustered together with known type I 4CL proteins involved in lignin biosynthesis in other plants. Gene expression analysis showed that Eg4CL1 was expressed abundantly in different organs of oil palm throughout the course of development, reflecting its involvement in lignin biosynthesis in different organs at all stages of growth. The presence of the lignification toolbox - AC elements in the 1.5 kb promoter of Eg4CL1 further suggests the potential role of the gene in lignin biosynthesis in oil palm. Together, these results suggested that Eg4CL1 is a potential candidate gene involved in lignin biosynthesis in oil palm. © 2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel has recently attracted much interest as an appropriate alternative for the fossil diesel which is mostly consumed in the transportation sector. Meanwhile, Jatropha Curcas L. has emerged as one of the most promising biofuel feedstocks due largely to its salient features such as compatibility with arid and semi-arid lands. In this regard, this paper unveils a two-stage stochastic programming model for the design of an integrated green biodiesel supply chain network from Jatropha Curcas feedstocks. The concerned biodiesel supply chain design is an environmentally friendly mixed-integer linear programming, multi-period and multi-product model. Furthermore, a flexible stochastic programming approach is developed and applied to the supply chain network model. This proposed approach is indeed an extension of a two-stage scenario-based stochastic programming approach which incorporates min-max relative regret in a soft worst-case framework. Given the natural variability of long-term decision-making, fuel demand and Jatropha Curcas trees yielding are hemmed in by uncertainty in this model. The performance of the proposed framework and biodiesel supply chain network design is corroborated through ten realizations and a myriad of various analyses in a real case study of Iran. The derived results and their analyses acknowledge the efficiency and applicability of the model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilization of fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion in thermal power plants, is a sustainable use of waste for power generation. Discarding fly ash as waste in landfills/ash ponds may not only be regarded as a loss of valuable land and essential nutrients, but also pose a significant health hazard due to fine air-borne particles and leaching of heavy metals. The presence of essential macro- and micronutrients and its porosity make fly ash an excellent soil amendment for plant growth as an organic nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) supplementation. As harmful heavy metals make fly ash unsafe for agronomy, bioenergy crop plantation and energy generation from different thermochemical conversions of the biomass would be an ideal method for coal fly ash utilization through which carbon-neutral fuel can be generated from fossil fuel, thus reducing climate change impact. This review summarizes the development of bioenergy plantation and silviculture at fly ash dumpsites with an integrated phyto-bio-rhizo-mycoremediation approach and assesses utilization of the valuable biomass for thermal energy, electricity, and biofuel generation with inclusion of a SWOT analysis (a strategic technique typically used to help identify the strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat). Bioenergy crop production through integrated phytomanagement can generate billions of dollars of wealth from waste and provides a sustainable solution for fly ash management, with environmental, economic, and social benefits. © 2018 Soil Science Society of China

AB  - The poplar species Populus davidiana and P. koreana are widely grown in plantations and as biofuel resources, but little is known about ex-situ seed conservation in poplar. To identify the optimal long-term seed storage conditions for these species, we evaluated the viability of seeds with different seed water contents (SWCs) at various storage temperatures and time periods. P. davidiana seeds with <6% SWC could be stored at room temperature (RT) for 4 weeks, while P. koreana seeds showed no storability at RT. P. davidiana seeds with 3% SWC showed 74% viability after 36 months of storage at 4C, while those with 9–18% SWC showed >89% viability after 48 months of storage at -18C. Long-term storage at -80C was best for P. davidiana seeds with a wide range of SWCs (3–24%), with 91–98% of normal germination after 48 months of storage. However, the normal germination of P. koreana seeds with 3–24% SWC declined to <20% after 36 months of storage, even at -18C and -80C. No significant difference was observed between seeds immersed vs. not immersed in liquid nitrogen for both species. Our findings increase the possibility for long-term seed conservation for both Populus species. © 2018 Du Hyun Kim.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to study the co-cultivation of Chlorella sp. and wastewater wild algae under different cultivation conditions (i.e. CO2, light intensity, cultivation time, and inoculation ratio) for enhanced algal biomass and lipid productivity in wastewater medium using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The results show that mixed cultures of Chlorella sp. and wastewater wild algae increase biomass and lipid yield. Additionally, findings indicate that CO2, light intensity and cultivation time significantly affect algal productivity. Furthermore, CO2 concentration and light intensity, and CO2 concentration and algal composition, have an interactive effect on biomass productivity. Under different cultivation conditions, the response of algal biomass, cell count, and lipid productivity ranges from 2.5 to 10.2 mg/mL, 1.1 × 106 to 8.2 × 108 cells/mL, and 1.1 × 1012 to 6.8 × 1012 total fluorescent units/mL, respectively. The optimum conditions for simultaneous biomass and lipid accumulation are 3.6% of CO2 (v/v), 160 µmol/m2/s of light intensity, 1.6/2.4 of inoculation ratio (wastewater-algae/Chlorella), and 8.3 days of cultivation time. The optimal productivity is 9.8 (g/L) for dry biomass, 8.6 E + 08 (cells/mL) for cell count, and 6.8 E + 12 (Total FL units per mL) for lipid yield, achieving up to four times, eight times, and seven times higher productivity compared to nonoptimized conditions. Provided is a supportive methodology to improve mixed algal culture for bioenergy feedstock generation and to optimize cultivation conditions in complex wastewater environments. This work is an important step forward in the development of sustainable large-scale algae cultivation for cost-efficient generation of biofuel.

AB  - Safflower is an important industrial oil seed and bioenergy crop in semi-arid subtropical regions due to its potential to grow on marginal land and having good percentage of seed oil contents which is an important parameter for biofuel production. However, it is an ignored crop in Pakistan. In order to improve the crop productivity and reduce the use of agrochemicals for sustainable biodiesel feedstock production, an experiment was conducted for two years to improve the fatty acid composition and oil quality of Carthamus tinctorius L. (safflower) by the inoculation of Azospirillum and Azotobacter alone as well as in combined application with nitrogen and phosphate (NP) fertilizers on cultivars Thori and Saif-32 under field conditions. Separation and quantification of fatty acids were done on precise comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). The results showed that fatty acid profile specifically monounsaturated fatty acids i-e oleic acid (C18:1) was significantly improved by Azospirillum supplemented with the quarter dose of NP fertilizers (SPQ) with concomitant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids by the respective treatment. Oil quality attributes such as acid value, saponification number, iodine value, refractive index and free fatty acid contents were reduced by the application of Azotobacter and Azospirillum in combination with half and quarter doses of NP fertilizers treatments (BTH, SPH, BTQ and SPQ). The reduction in these variables is positively linked with improved biodiesel yield and quality. It can be concluded that application of Azospirillum and Azotobacter not only reduced the use of NP fertilizers up to 50%-75% but also improved the oil quality in order to obtain environment friendly, sustainable and green fuel. © 2018 Nosheen et al.

AB  - The Brazilian sugar-energy sector (SES) is facing an increasing challenge due to the worldwide expansion of biofuel consumption as a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making yield improvement and land and water availability key factors in addressing this situation. Consequently, our main aim here is to identify SES vulnerability under climate change conditions, based on the methodology used by the Agricultural Zoning of Climatic Risks (ZARC) program. We assessed changes of the sugarcane ZARC in light of the current and near-future climatic conditions given by eight general circulation models (GCM) of the 5th IPCC report and under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. We identified a conversion of the current climatic risk levels in the Brazilian central-southern macro-region for sugarcane in future climate change scenarios, but the spatial distribution of these changes is heterogeneous. The current expansion areas located mainly in southern Goiás and northwest of São Paulo are marked by an increase in areas of low water availability in the future, while the traditional production areas, east of São Paulo, do not present this same vulnerability. Sugarcane cultivation in the south of Goiás is already occurring based on a complementary irrigation (of about 50 mm per month from April to September) to reach a yield similar to traditional areas located in São Paulo state. The development of drought-resistant cultivars based on genetic engineering and the efficiency of the irrigation systems used on a large spatial scale and also in the long term are two key points of concern in the Brazilian context of greenhouse gas emission mitigation. The challenges for the traditional production regions are related to the production system’s ability to regulate the capacity and idleness of sugarcane mills aiming to avoid current and future competition by same raw material. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Key message: Coexpression network revealing genes with Co-variation Expression pattern (CE) and those with Top rank of Expression fold change (TE) played different roles in responding to new environment of Miscanthus lutarioriparius. Abstract: Variation in gene expression level, the product of genetic and/or environmental perturbation, determines the robustness-to-plasticity spectrum of a phenotype in plants. Understanding how expression variation of plant population response to a new field is crucial to domesticate energy crops. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the patterns of expression variation based on 72 Miscanthus lutarioriparius transcriptomes from two contrasting environments, one near the native habitat and the other in one harsh domesticating region. The 932 genes with Co-variation Expression pattern (CE) and other 932 genes with Top rank of Expression fold change (TE) were identified and the former were strongly associated with the water use efficiency (r ≥ 0.55, P ≤ 10−7). Functional enrichment of CE genes were related to three organelles, which well matched the annotation of twelve motifs identified from their conserved noncoding sequence; while TE genes were mostly related to biotic and/or abiotic stress. The expression robustness of CE genes with high genetic diversity kept relatively stable between environments while the harsh environment reduced the expression robustness of TE genes with low genetic diversity. The expression plasticity of CE genes was increased less than that of TE genes. These results suggested that expression variation of CE genes and TE genes could account for the robustness and plasticity of acclimation ability of Miscanthus, respectively. The patterns of expression variation revealed by transcriptomic network would shed new light on breeding and domestication of energy crops. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic substrates are associated with limited biodegradability due to the structural complexity. For that reason, a pretreatment step is mandatory for efficient biomass transformation which will lead to increased bioenergy output. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of two pretreatment machines to enhance the methane yield of meadow grass. Specifically, the application of shearing forces with a rotated plastic sweeping brush against a steel roller significantly increased biomass biodegradability by 20% under relatively gentle operation conditions (600 rpm). The more intense operation (1200 rpm) was not associated with higher methane yield enhancement. Regarding an alternative machine, in which the brush was replaced with a coarse steel roller resulted in a more distinct effect (+27%) despite the lower rotating speed (∼400 rpm). Moreover, the association of the substrate's individual chemical components and the practical methane yield was assessed, establishing single and multiple linear regression models. However, the estimation accuracy was rather low with either single (regressor: lignin, R2: 0.50) or multiple linear regression analyses (regressors: arabinan-lignin-protein, R2: 0.61). Results showed that poorly lignified plant tissue containing relatively high fractions of protein and arabinan is more susceptible to anaerobic digestion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper analyzes the influence of sugarcane on soybean and livestock productions in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Midwest of Brazil, the main agricultural region of the country. We also observed indirect influence of sugarcane in non-producing regions. Two periods have been analyzed, 2006–2009, which is the beginning of the sugarcane expansion, and 2009–2013, which is the main expansion phase. In this state, sugarcane is essentially used for ethanol production, and soybean and livestock production are the main food products, together with corn. The shift-share method was used, with decomposition of the evolution in area, productivity and geographic location effects. The area effect was divided between scale and substitution effects. Data were collected from national and local databases. From 2006 to 2009, sugarcane areas replaced soybean in the best land areas. In the second period, sugarcane and soybeans occupied pasture areas. None of the activities surveyed decreased its production between 2006 and 2013. Sugarcane generated positive externalities on food production in the state, forcing the evolution of productivity, mainly in cattle raising. Positive impact of sugarcane on the productivity of livestock and soybean reduces indirect effects of the production of biofuels on land use and didn't have a negative effect on food production. The increase in food consumption had a much greater impact on the evolution of crops, with a high increase in cultivated areas of soybean and pastures in Brazil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Availability and access to energy is strongly linked to food security as cooking is needed to make foods ready for consumption. Without access to energy, there is no food security. In rural Tanzania, the population strongly depends on traditional biofuels such as firewood and charcoal. Under the pressure of population growth, energy demand will substantially increase in the next decades. The potential of improved efficiency in charcoal production and efficient cooking stoves were evaluated using scenario analysis. For quantitative data collection, a household survey was conducted in Laela village (2010). The sampling process was based on relative income classes (ICs) defined by local representatives and extending from “rich” (IC 1) to “below self-sufficiency” (IC 4). Based on quantitative survey data, we calculated the quantity of pre-carbonised fuelwood associated with charcoal consumption for ICs in order to display specific consumption patterns. Further, we applied scenario analysis and projected charcoal consumption by 2030 including population growth (+3.41%/year), improved kiln efficiencies (11.1%–20%) and different dissemination rates of efficient stoves (0%–100%). Results of consumption patterns showed that fuelwood consumption in IC 1 was twice that of IC 4, when a conversion efficiency of 11.1% was applied. Calculations of the scenario analyses showed that overall energy consumption will almost double by 2030. The combined approach of a moderate improvement of conversion efficiency (15.6%) combined with a dissemination rate for energy efficient stoves of 50% would overcome the effect of population growth in projected energy consumption and offer a means of coping with future bioenergy demands. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the availability of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), water footprinting, and carbon footprinting data in Brazil. In particular, the study is targeted at showing what LCA-related studies are accessible to non-specialists residing in Brazil as well as LCA specialists interested in accessing Brazilian LCA-related studies. Methods: Online searches for LCA documents were performed using publicly available search engines such as Google and Google Scholar, as well as academic databases containing peer-reviewed journal articles such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Springer. The searches were conducted utilizing the keywords “Life Cycle Assessment,” “carbon footprint,” “water footprint,” and “Brazil.” Results and discussion: A total of 73 published documents on LCA studies conducted between 2000 and 2016 could be found. Of these, 59 were only available in restricted access journals requiring some form of paid subscriptions. Most of these documents originated from academic institutions. For the majority of the studies, the exact region in which the study was carried out was not specified. Only twelve carbon and water footprinting studies were found. However, it was known that several other studies were available but were not found in these searches unless more specific years, authors, and/or products were included in the search terms. Conclusions: It was observed that LCA studies were more established in the energy and agricultural sectors, an expected result given that all LCA studies would rely on energy as a background process, as well as the increasing energy demand due to increasing population and industrial activities in Brazil. Furthermore, it was observed that most LCA studies in the energy sector concentrated on the conversion of biomass, mainly sugarcane and soybean, to biofuels; thereby, establishing a strong link between the energy and agricultural sectors. The results showed that LCA is an emerging quantitative assessment technique in Brazil, especially in the energy and agricultural sectors. While there were over 70 studies found, it is not clear how many of these could be transferable into an LCI database or be used in other studies, due to the exact inputs used. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - From 2012 to 2016, the long-term signal in the biofuel market changed almost once per year, leading to a drastic decrease in investments and contributing to multiple production unit closures in France and around Europe. The European Commission proposed a new renewable energy directive that includes a 3.8% cap limit on the contribution of food-crop biofuels by 2030. Given the role of biofuels in green growth, the bioeconomy, and renewable energy incorporation targets, how will this measure affect the stakeholders by 2030? Will it lead to, contribute to, or hamper their sustainability criteria? This paper aims to contribute to this debate by studying the case of France. To this end, our methodology—the range-based multi-actor multi-criteria analysis—aims to (1) explicitly consider the stakeholder groups and their sustainability criteria; (2) evaluate and compare how the cap limit will affect these sustainability criteria whether or not advanced biofuels are deployed by 2030; (3) capture the uncertainty of the context evolution and biofuel capacity to fulfil the stakeholders’ sustainability criteria by means of a Monte Carlo. The results suggest that the cap limit is a double-edged sword for the stakeholders and their sustainability criteria. Shifting towards advanced biofuels while limiting the food-crop biofuels is the better alternative for most of the stakeholders. Nevertheless, given biofuel policy instability and the lost confidence of investors, such a shift may not occur by 2030. In such a case, this paper demonstrates that the cap limit may highly and negatively affect the stakeholders and their sustainability targets, whereas fostering French food-crop biofuel production at its full capacity level constitutes a better alternative. As no alternative is suited to all actors simultaneously, this paper also studies the strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives from each stakeholder groups’ perspective. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A crucial element of the quest of curbing carbon dioxide emissions is deemed to rely on a biobased economy, which will rely on the development of financially sustainable biorefining systems enabling a full exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass (and its macrocomponents such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) for the coproduction of biofuels and bioderived platform chemicals. In this work, a general modeling framework conceived to steer decision-making regarding the strategic design and systematic planning of advanced biorefining supply networks is presented. The design task is formulated as a mixed integer linear program which accounts for the maximization of the supply chain profit, considering multiechelon, multiperiod, multifeedstock, and multiproduct aspects as well as spatially explicit features. The applicability of the proposed model, along with the use of a bilevel decomposition approach, are demonstrated with a case study of lignocellulose-based biorefining production systems in the South-West of Hungary. Results show the effectiveness of the tool in the decision-making regarding the systematic design of advanced biorefining SC networks. An economic analysis of different design configurations (i.e., centralized and distributed scenarios) through a holistic evaluation of the entire biobased SC, integrating technology superstructure, shows that both instances generate profitable investment decisions that could be equally trusted by the decision-maker unless regional restrictions are applied. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Aims: As ammonium (NH4 +) has been reported as the “preferred” mineral N source for sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), the predominant supply of NH4 + has been hypothesized as a means of increasing the 15N recovery and crop yield. We aimed to evaluate the 15N recovery by sugarcane as affected by 15N-NH4 + and 15N-NO3 − addition. Methods: Under field conditions, 15N-labeled ammonium nitrate [labeling as 15NH4NO3 (15N-NH4 +) and NH4 15NO3 (15N-NO3 −)] and urea were surface-applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha−1. Under controlled conditions, sugarcane was grown in hydroponic medium (containing unlabeled N) until the maximum N demand period. Subsequently, plants received 15N-NH4 + or 15N-NO3 − (as ammonium nitrate). Plants were then sampled at 1, 3, 7, and 15 d after fertilization (DAF) to estimate 15N recovery. Results: Under field conditions, the 15N recovery for urea was lower than that for ammonium nitrate, partly explained by ammonia volatilization, but there was no difference in N use efficiency between the two fertilizer N sources, as well as between 15N-NH4 + and 15N-NO3 − supply. Under controlled conditions, however, 15N-NH4 + resulted in higher 15N recovery than 15N-NO3 − until 7 DAF. Nevertheless, as 15N-NH4 + became depleted in the nutrient solution, 15N-NO3 − was taken up more intensely by the crop. At 15 DAF, highest 15N recovery was detected in the roots and whole plant under 15N-NO3 − supply. Conclusions: Although uptake of NH4 + is faster than NO3 −, the so-called “preference” for NH4 + by the crop did not necessarily translate into higher 15N recovery. Therefore, we suggest that the term “preference” should be used with caution to avoid misinterpretation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study presents a two-phase simulation-based framework for finding the optimal locations of biomass storage facilities that is a very critical link on the biomass supply chain, which can help to solve biorefinery concerns (e.g. steady supply, uniform feedstock properties, stable feedstock costs, and low transportation cost). The proposed framework consists of two simulation phases: (1) crop yield estimation using a process-based model such as Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) and (2) biomass transportation cost estimation using agent-based simulation (ABS) such as AnyLogic® with geographic information system (GIS). The OptQuest® in AnyLogic is used as an optimization engine to find the best locations of biomass storage facilities based on evaluation results given by the two-phase simulation framework. In addition, network partitioning and integer linear programming techniques are used to mitigate computation demand of the optimization problem. Since the proposed hybrid simulation approach utilizes realistic biofuel feedstock production and considers dynamics of supply chain activities, it is able to provide reliable locations of biomass storage facilities for operational excellence of a biomass supply chain. © 2018

AB  - Recent estimates show that the potential for biomethane production in Italy for 2030 is about 8 Bn Nm3/year, initially by upgrading the biogas produced by anaerobic digestion. We derive the ‘Land Efficiency’ of Biomethane in accordance with the Biogasdoneright® principles in Sicily (Italy), from the standard formula to determine the ‘First Crop Land Requirement’. The results were achieved using large proportions of ‘integration biomasses’. The concept of Land Efficiency is verified because the first constituent of the formula (land efficiency) is much higher than the second one (biomethane yield of monocrops). The outcome of this study indicates clearly that ‘integration biomasses’ in the Sicilian context are among those which produce advanced biofuels. All by-products and wastes from the agrifood sector are necessary to produce about 562 million Nm3/year of biomethane in Sicily for 2030 (about 8% of the Italian one), allocating only 28,000 ha for the monocrops for the anaerobic digesters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The United States (US) military plans to acquire drop-in biofuels (renewable diesel and biojet fuel) to reduce carbon emissions and diversify military energy portfolio. To expedite this endeavor, the military provided direct financial incentives to offset investment costs of selected drop-in biofuel demonstration facilities. It is not known if investment incentives alone will stimulate the creation of a full-scale advanced biofuel supply chain capable of meeting US military demands, given limited availability of low-cost sustainable biomass feedstocks in some areas and considering the uncertainty in global oil prices. The objective of this work is to determine 1) whether a state in the US can meet its share of military biofuel targets from local biomass resources, and 2) if direct financial incentives can expedite the development of the military biofuel supply chain, under two different oil price scenarios. The Biofuel supply chain GeoSpatial and Temporal Optimizer (BioGeSTO), was developed for that purpose and applied to the state of California, USA from 2020 to 2040. The BioGeSTO model determined that biomass resources in California can meet 12-19% of its annual military targets between 2020 and 2040 of renewable diesel and biojet fuel using the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Hydro-Treatment of Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) conversion technologies. However, under the reference oil price scenario, only HEFA conversion facilities introduced at 2027 in Kings County were found feasible. Under the high oil price scenario, both the HEFA and FT technologies were financially feasible and the supply chain production approaches the theoretical production limit by 2032. In both scenarios, providing investment incentives has a modest impact on expediting the supply chain, as facilities are introduced only 1-3 years earlier when receiving direct investment incentives. Sensitivity analysis shows that biomass availability has the greatest impact on the supply chain performance such that a 50% increase in the baseline amount of biomass feedstock results in a 150% surge in the total cumulative production. In conclusion, the reference oil price scenario drastically limits the ability of California to meet its military drop-in biofuel targets. Assuming a high oil price scenario, the state may be able to meet military biofuel targets by subsidizing local biomass production and importing the rest of the biomass required for this purpose from the northwestern states of Washington and Oregon. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emerging transportation technologies have the potential to surmount carbon lock-in and enable a transition to environmentally sustainable mobility. Promising options include biofuels; hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles; hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; maglev trains; and the Hyperloop. To varying degrees, widespread adoption of these technologies is complicated by the chicken-and-egg problem of infrastructure provision. Consumers are unlikely to adopt a technology in the absence of supporting infrastructure, but infrastructure provision is unprofitable without a critical mass of adopters. To derive policy recommendations for overcoming this problem, this study analyzes historical data on the diffusion dynamics of transport systems in the United States. The methodology systematically compares the relative timing of diffusion processes for infrastructure, vehicles, and travel. A striking regularity observed across transport systems is that the diffusion of infrastructure precedes the adoption of vehicles, which precedes the expansion of travel. On the chicken-and-egg conundrum, findings thus support the view that infrastructure comes first. The analysis leads to three salient policy recommendations: support adequate infrastructure provision early in the technology life cycle, target suitable niche markets to maximize the impact of infrastructure investment, and leverage distributed technologies to reduce overall infrastructure requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The paper explores the economic feasibility and environmental sustainability of producing second-generation biofuel in Italy from Brassica carinata, a non-edible flowering plant of the Brassicaceae family, in a context of rotation with wheat (and eventually other crops). The framework considered allows to rule out issues of ILUC and is highly relevant in a country where extensive monoculture is extremely widespread and there is a high degree of dependence on foreign imports for both biofuels and biofuels-related raw materials, especially from countries such as Indonesia, where the adverse impacts of first-generation biofuel production on the environment are most felt. Using yield and cost data from 5 experimental fields in Italy and taking into account potential returns from the sale of biodiesel and its by-products, glycerine and expeller/meal, the economic sustainability of the entire biodiesel production chain (cultivation, oil extraction and oil refining) is established. Implementation of the Argonne National Laboratory's GREET life cycle model, suitably adjusted so as to apply it to the BC case, confirms also a high environmental sustainability. The range of positive economic effects and externalities that may be triggered by the development of a BC-derived biofuel production chain justifies some form of policy intervention. © 2018

AB  - Concerns about impacts of biomass growth for biofuel production emphasize the importance of planning energy crops expansion considering land, water, food and biodiversity. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer worldwide and sugarcane is cultivated in many regions, including the Brazilian Cerrado (a Savannah-type biome). This paper analyses the impacts of first-generation sugarcane expansion in the Paranaíba basin (Goiás State), focusing on how future demand for ethanol could affect local resources availability. The study area is a sugarcane expansion frontier in Brazil, thus, the Cerrado biome should be focus of research considering competition for land and water uses. An economic-ecologic Input-Output (IO) framework was applied to develop a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus analysis. The Goiás’ IO table was expanded to assess water, energy and land uses, GHG emissions and employment levels through six different ethanol supply scenarios. Results show that if sugarcane expansion projected to 2030 considers the Goiás’ extended IO structure for the year 2008, it should cause little impact on land and water availability in the state, due to both the ample availability of suitable pasturelands for sugarcane expansion as well as water in most of the Paranaíba basin. The WEF nexus analysis is a valuable tool on guiding the sustainable management of natural resources considering water, energy, land use and GHG emissions as goals to the same policy. In particular, the hybrid extended IO-WEF nexus framework is useful to design effective biofuel policies, collectively addressing impacts on environmental, social and economic spheres, in a local or broader context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among the renewables, non-food and wastelands based biofuels are essential for the transport sector to achieve country's climate mitigation targets. With the growing interest in biorefineries, setting policy requirements for other coproducts along with biofuels is necessary to improve the products portfolio of biorefinery, increase the bioproducts perception by the consumers and push the technology forward. Towards this context, Claiming-Based allocation models were used in comparative life cycle assessment of multiple products from wheat straw biorefinery and vetiver biorefinery. Vetiver biorefinery shows promising Greenhouse gas emission savings (181-213%) compared to the common crop based lignocellulose (wheat straw) biorefinery. Assistance of Claiming-Based Allocation models favors to find out the affordable allocation limit (0-80%) among the coproducts in order to achieve the individual prospective policy targets. Such models show promising application in multiproduct life cycle assessment studies where appropriate allocation is challenging to achieve the individual products emission subject to policy targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Widely blended in the transportation fuels, biofuels have been generally regarded as indispensable components in the U.S. national energy portfolio. Although the current production of cellulosic biofuels has been staggering at pilot scales, it is expected that large-scale cultivation of cellulosic biofuel crops may occur when techniques for cost-effective bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol are available. However, it is still unclear if enough land is in existence to accommodate potential large-scale lignocellulosic crops development without negative effects on the environment and food market. The appropriate land use for the next-generation biofuel crops should be planned and allocated in a manner that the competitive use of land dedicated to food and energy production and other side effects could be minimized. This research proposes an approach of identifying the potential available land for planting switchgrass in the U.S. Midwest using a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis that combines soil and water constraint factors. The results showed that land areas of approximately 13.6 million ha are unsuitable for profitable food crops but available for switchgrass cultivation in 7 U.S. Great Plains states. The findings can assist decision-makers in formulating land use policies and related environmental management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract: Shrub willow (Salix L. spp.) is a strong candidate for use as a dedicated bioenergy crop in moist, temperate climates due to high growth rates, excellent regenerative properties and relatively low nutrient demand. Large discrepancies exist in the literature as to the benefits of fertilization for improving biomass production. Controlled environment fertilization studies can remove some confounding edaphic and climatic factors present in field studies. Ten top-performing commercial or pre-commercial cultivars, mostly bred in the US, were assessed for response to five fertilization levels by measuring 20 biomass and growth traits. Triploid hybrid Salix viminalis × S. miyabeana cultivars had the greatest total aboveground biomass, as well as high stem biomass. There was a strong relationship between early stem growth and final aboveground biomass, but only under adequate fertilization. Different strategies for high biomass production among cultivars are discussed in the context of nitrogen investment in leaves. Comparing field trial results and this greenhouse experiment indicates that while the yield ranking is generally preserved, the greenhouse results diverged greatly for two cultivars. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The efficiency of spark-ignition engines is limited by the phenomenon of knock, which is caused by auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture ahead of the spark-initiated flame front. The resistance of a fuel to knock is quantified by its octane index; therefore, increasing the octane index of a spark-ignition engine fuel increases the efficiency of the respective engine. However, raising the octane index of gasoline increases the refining costs, as well as the energy consumption during production. The use of alternative fuels with synergistic blending effects presents an attractive option for improving octane index. In this work, the octane enhancing potential of 2-methylfuran (2-MF), a next-generation biofuel, has been examined and compared to other high-octane components (i.e., ethanol and toluene). A primary reference fuel with an octane index of 60 (PRF60) was chosen as the base fuel since it closely represents refinery naphtha streams, which are used as gasoline blend stocks. Initial screening of the fuels was done in an ignition quality tester (IQT). The PRF60/2-MF (80/20 v/v%) blend exhibited longer ignition delay times compared to PRF60/ethanol (80/20 v/v%) blend and PRF60/toluene (80/20 v/v%) blend, even though pure 2-MF is more reactive than both ethanol and toluene. The mixtures were also tested in a cooperative fuels research (CFR) engine under research octane number and motor octane number like conditions. The PRF60/2-MF blend again possesses a higher octane index than other blending components. A detailed chemical kinetic analysis was performed to understand the synergetic blending effect of 2-MF, using a well-validated PRF/2-MF kinetic model. Kinetic analysis revealed superior suppression of low-temperature chemistry with the addition of 2-MF. The results from simulations were further confirmed by homogeneous charge compression ignition engine experiments, which established its superior low-temperature heat release (LTHR) suppression compared to ethanol, resulting in better blending octane numbers. This work explores and provides a chemically sound explanation for the potential of 2-MF as an octane enhancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has been proposed to be a potential tropical plant for augmenting renewable energy sources. Due to its several merits, J. curcas deserves to be considered as candidate for biofuel production instead of for food seed sources. Its seeds contain 27–40% oil that can be processed to produce a high quality biodiesel fuel that is usable in a standard diesel engine. While J. curcas grows well under low-rainfall conditions, the salt tolerance capacity of this species has received meager attention. Furthermore, another major problem faced by this species is the lack of a safe system capable of guaranteeing seed germination when stored for medium or long periods of time. Thus, J. curcas seeds show two important problems: (i) rapid loss of viability, resulting from the high respiratory rate of the seeds during storage, and (ii) seed sensitivity when germinated under salt conditions. Therefore, the main objectives were (i) to verify if storage in very low humidity boxes can improve germination without affecting the oil content of the seeds and (ii) to compare different genotypes to prove their salt tolerance capacities. The results indicate that from the use of desiccants, all the germination parameters were kept reasonably constant, and germination was essentially unchanged during the entire storage period. Biochemical activity, supported by the drastic reduction in respiratory activity of the seeds, was also decreased during the storage in order to keep the seed reserves intact; therefore, J. curcas seeds may be resistant to storage when stored in a controlled process. On the other hand, it was shown that J. curcas presents a moderate tolerance to salinity. This species is able to germinate in the presence of up to 150 mM of Sodium chloride (NaCl), although a drastic reduction in the biomass accumulation was observed with the increase in salt concentration in the irrigation water. It was shown that the germination was reduced to values close to 4% at 150 mM NaCl; whereas biometric and biomass characteristics were strongly affected by the increase in salt content. However, it was shown that genotypes 114, 171 and 183 were shown to be potentially tolerant, whereas genotypes 218 and 133 were sensitive. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The marine green microalga, Tetraselmis suecica, is an important food source for aquaculture, lipid source for biofuel production, and a potential model organism for toxicity assays because of its rapid growth and ability to produce useful chemicals. In order to gain molecular toxicogenomic insights, we determined expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of T. suecica by pyrosequencing, and attained 741 K reads, including 290 Mb of cDNA information. Upon data processing, 24,651 contigs and 19,072 non-overlapping fragments were acquired and deposited to the NCBI non-redundant and gene ontology databases. Of these, 11,292 contigs and 1848 singletons were annotated. From the EST data, we found that many previously identified stress-responsive protein-coding genes were included. The data were further investigated with a focus on heat shock protein (HSP) gene families, with most characterized HSP genes present in our ESTs. In addition, the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 was significantly increased after T. suecica cells were exposed to metal contaminants. This work expands our understanding of stress-related genomics of T. suecica and further evaluates a potential use of oxidative stress-related genes as biomarkers, in particular HSP involvement in environmental genomics and marine toxicological assessment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A simple reliable method with fast response for lipid detection and quantification is proposed, combining a new highly lipophilic fluorescent probe BODIPY BD-C12 and image analysis to determine the algal lipid content and the lipid production in the microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. Lipid bodies stained with BODIPY BD-C12 have a characteristic multicolor fluorescence, and their volumes were determined using a sphere volume approach. The method developed was applied in the evaluation of lipid accumulation by Nannochloropsis sp. under different cultivation conditions (varying nitrate and salinity concentrations and combined effect of these two variables). The results show an increase of lipid content in Nannochloropsis sp. cultivated in nitrogen replete and depleted conditions, from 9.4 to 40.8 μm3 cell−1 and 35.5 to 73.5%, respectively. The findings are also compared with conventional methods for determination of neutral lipids and with results obtained from the dyes Nile Red and BODIPY 505/515. A reasonable agreement between neutral lipid production measured by BODIPY BD-C12 and gravimetric methods (correlation coefficient of 0.98) was obtained. The neutral lipids production decreased from 964.6 to 244.8 mg L−1 and from 809.1 to 396.7 mg L−1, as the nitrate concentration increased from 0 to 0.3 g L−1. It is observed that, with the two commercially available dyes, lipid quantification using Nile Red leads to an overestimation of lipids, while the use of BODIPY 505/515 promoted unreliable measures due to rapid bleaching of the chromophore. The method proposed shows excellent potential to become a standard, yet advanced, strategy for rapid evaluation and quantification of intracellular lipids in microalgae, a crucial step of the scaling-up process involved in the production of biobased products. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The ecotoxicity of two biofuel candidates (1‑octanol and 2‑butanone) was investigated by an integrative test strategy using three bioassays: the acute immobilisation test with water flea (D. magna), the fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the in vitro micronucleus assay with Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) V79 cells. The median effective concentration (EC50) values were 14.9 ± 0.66 mg L−1 for 1‑octanol, and 2152.1 ± 44.6 mg L−1 for 2‑butanone in the D. magna test. Both 1‑octanol and 2‑butanone caused teratogenic and lethal effects on zebrafish embryos, while exposure to 1‑octanol significantly induced these effects at concentrations ≥2.0 mg L−1. These results indicate that 1‑octanol exert much higher ecotoxicity than 2‑butanone to D. magna and zebrafish embryos. Moreover, both 1‑octanol and 2‑butanone did not cause significant genotoxic effects, while their metabolites significantly induced micronuclei in V79 cells. The present study proposed an integrative test approach to evaluate the potential ecotoxicity of biofuels using simple, quick and inexpensive bioassays. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Managed forests in southern U.S. are a potential source of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. Changes in management practices to optimize biomass production may impact the quality of waters draining to nutrient-sensitive waters in coastal plain regions. We investigated shallow groundwater quality effects of intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) with managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to produce bioenergy feedstock and quality sawtimber in a poorly drained soil of eastern North Carolina, U.S.A. Treatments included PINE (traditional pine production), PSWITCH (pine-switchgrass intercropped), SWITCH (switchgrass monoculture) and REF (mature loblolly pine stand). Each treatment was replicated three times on 0.8 ha plots drained by parallel-open ditches, 1.0–1.2 m deep and 100 m apart. Water samples were collected monthly or more frequently after fertilizer application. Water samples were analyzed for organic nitrogen (ON), ammonium N (NH4+- N), and nitrite+nitrate N (NO3−+ NO2−- N), ortohophosphate phosphorus (OP), and total organic carbon (TOC). Overall, PSWITCH did not significantly affect shallow groundwater quality relative to PINE and SWITCH. ON, NO3−+ NO2−- N, and TOC concentrations in PSWITCH, PINE and SWITCH were substantially elevated during the two years after tree harvest and site establishment. The elevated nutrient concentrations at the beginning of the study were likely caused by a combination of rapid organic matter decomposition of the abundant supply of post-harvest residues, warming of exposed soil surfaces and reduction of plant nutrient uptake that can occur after harvesting, and pre-plant fertilization. Nutrient concentrations returned to background levels observed in REF during the third year after harvest. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper investigates how climate change strategies and resource conflicts are shaping each other in the Greater Aural region of western Cambodia. Agro-industrial projects linked to climate change goals are reshaping both social and ecological dynamics, by altering patterns of access to land and water resources as well as the nature of the resources themselves. Using a landscape perspective, we investigate these social and ecological changes occurring across space and time. Drawing on data from community researchers, field visits, interviews and secondary sources, we examine two kinds of connections between climate change responses and resource conflicts in the Greater Aural: 1) demand for biofuels as a driver of flex crop expansion; and 2) the construction of irrigation infrastructure as a climate change adaptation strategy. Findings include that some impacts of flex crop expansion and irrigation systems are local and immediate, for example when villagers lose land, plantation workers are not paid, and cassava processing pollutes local water supplies. Other impacts are transferred to different locations or deferred to the future, for example when changes in water quality and quantity affect those living downstream, or when soil degraded by cassava production becomes unproductive for future generations. We conclude that climate change strategies are now deeply entangled with resource conflicts in the Greater Aural region. Adopting a landscape perspective and working directly with community researchers opens new pathways for identifying not only site-specific, but also cumulative and shifting impacts of climate change strategies and their relationship to resource conflicts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The food-feed competition is one of the complex challenges, and so are the ongoing climate change, land degradation and water shortage for realizing sustainable food production systems. By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60% to 70%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, ~800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints. © 2018 The Animal Consortium.

AB  - An important energy poverty reduction initiative in India is aimed at replacing the use of solid cooking fuels with cleaner burning Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Projections suggest however that India will become increasingly dependent on LPG imports, the cost of which is strongly linked to the prevailing oil price and associated volatility. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a synthetic fuel which may be manufactured from domestically available carbonaceous feedstocks, and is compatible with blending with LPG. Very large quantities of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are generated in India's metropolitan cities, 90% of which is disposed of onto unsanitary landfills, creating major environmental and health concerns. This article investigates the techno-economic merits of reducing these impacts by using a portion of the MSW generated in Kolkata (in the form of a Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF)) to produce DME. Results suggest that the production of DME from a 50:50 blend of locally available coal and RDF (comprising 10% of the MSW placed at Kolkata's main landfill) will enable the supply of a clean cooking fuel to approximately 15% of Kolkata's population, and become cost competitive with imported LPG at an Indian basket oil price of $130 per barrel. Results also suggest that, at this blend ratio, the fossil fuel derived greenhouse gas emissions at the DME production plant will be more than offset by landfill methane emissions avoided using the RDF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, the second generation pathway for bioethanol from hornbeam residues was investigated, in order to define the optimum operative conditions of steam explosion pretreatment and subsequently enzymatic hydrolysis maximizing the glucose amount for fermentation process. The whole experimental procedure was designed and analyzed by Response Surface Methodology, a statistic multivariate model that allows to investigate the effect of different parameters on a process and define the optimum values of these variables to optimize the response. The glucose yield from enzymatic hydrolysis was maximize as function of three variables: the severity factor of pretreatment (log R0), the total solids (TS%) of the enzymatic hydrolysis and enzyme loading (EL%) in the enzymatic hydrolysis stage. The Design of Experiment (DoE), based on central composite model, was characterized by 17 tests, varying the variables at five levels, log R0 (3.92, 4.08, 4.31, 4.54, 4.7), TS% (5, 7, 10, 13, 15), EL% (5, 7, 10, 13, 15). The optimization allows to define the best operative condition that is log R0 = 3.97, TS% = 6, EL% = 15 which leads to an overall fermentable sugars yield of 67.8% respect to the initial sugars content in the raw material that corresponds to a theoretical amount of producible ethanol of 251 L/ton dry raw material. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the production of sweet potato bioethanol was conducted at a small industrial plant in Brazil and integrated in biodiesel production through ethanolysis. The specific objectives were: (i) monitor bioethanol production at a small industrial plant, considering production yield; (ii) study the ethanolysis of sunflower oil using sweet potato bioethanol with different grades (98, 99 and 99.4 °GL), with focus on biodiesel yield and purity. Bioethanol was produced under the following conditions: Sweet potato dilution in water (1:1 in wt.%); enzymatic hydrolysis with alpha-amylase (90 °C) and glucoamylase (60 °C) enzymes (700 mL/t); and, fermentation (30 °C) with saccharomyces cerevisiae (3.3 kg/t). Ethanolysis was performed as follows: 6:1 ethanol:oil molar ratio; 1.0 wt% NaOH; 45 °C; 1 h. The average yield of bioethanol was 161.4 L/t, corresponding to 10 598 L/ha. Biodiesel synthesis using bioethanol of different grades showed that both the yield and purity of the product increased with the grade of the ethanol used, with values ranging from 63 to 83 wt%, and 50 to 94 wt% for yield and purity, respectively. Results show that a high alcohol grade is required to make viable integrated production of biodiesel and bioethanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores a neglected aspect of the financialization of land grabbing. Whereas financialization is a multifaceted phenomenon, a straightforward link has been established between financialization and land grabbing. On the one hand, market-oriented views claim that large-scale land investments benefit both the agrifood industry and small-scale farmers. On the other hand, structuralist scholarship explains how financialization creates new ways to accumulate profits by dispossessing small-scale farmers. We build on the call for a more nuanced account of large-scale land investments’ impact on land access by considering the crops involved. While finance’s attraction for flex crops has already been touched upon, we reverse the perspective by exploring whether flex crops influence the way financialization in agriculture unfolds in three areas: megamergers, contract farming, and land commodification. Building on Allaire’s concept of quality, we argue that flex crops can exacerbate unequal power relations and limit access to land for small-scale farmers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Wood bioenergy may decrease the reliance on fossil carbon and mitigate anticipated increases in temperature. However, increased use of wood bioenergy may have large impacts on forest biodiversity primarily through the loss of dead wood habitats. We evaluated both the large-scale and long-term effects of different bioenergy extraction scenarios on the availability of dead wood and the suitability of the resulting habitat for saproxylic species, using a spatially explicit forest landscape simulation framework applied in the Swedish boreal forest. We demonstrate that bioenergy extraction scenarios, differing in the level of removal of biomass, can have significant effects on dead wood volumes. Although all of the scenarios led to decreasing levels of dead wood, the scenario aimed at species conservation led to highest volumes of dead wood (about 10 m3 ha-1) and highest connectivity of dead wood patches (mean proximity index of 78), whilst the scenario aimed at reaching zero fossil fuel targets led to the lowest levels (about 8 m3 ha-1) and least connectivity (mean proximity index of 7). Our simulations stress that further exploitation of dead wood from sites where volumes are already below suggested habitat thresholds for saproxylic species will very likely have further negative effects on dead wood dependent species. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The behavior of cyanobacteria and its potential use for biofuel production in scale-up conditions is a topic of growing importance. The aim of our work is to study the effects of illumination, stirring, and different growth phases on the cultivation of the cyanobacteria Spirulina platensis in 10 L raceways. The cultivations were carried out in a greenhouse under measured, but not controlled, illumination and in agitated raceways with stirring speeds varying from 0.1 to 0.4 m s−1, using culture media with nutrient depletion. At the end of the stationary phase (SP) and decline of culture, the biomass was harvested and used to determine the chemical composition. The stirring rate and the growing phase influenced the carbohydrate concentration. In both phases of cultivation, compared to high-speed stirring, stirring at lower speeds produced fewer carbohydrates in the culture. Biomass grown until the end of the SP with a stirring speed of 0.35 m s−1 had a carbohydrate content of 72%, which is very high compared to that reported in the literature. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sewage sludge is an abundant source of microorganisms that are metabolically active against numerous contaminants, and thus possibly useful in environmental biotechnologies. However, amongst the sewage sludge isolates, pathogenic bacteria can potentially be found, and such isolates should therefore be carefully tested before their application. A novel bacterial strain, Ochrobactrum sp. POC9, was isolated from a sewage sludge sample collected from a wastewater treatment plant. The strain exhibited lipolytic, proteolytic, cellulolytic, and amylolytic activities, which supports its application in biodegradation of complex organic compounds. We demonstrated that bioaugmentation with this strain substantially improved the overall biogas production and methane content during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. The POC9 genome content analysis provided a deeper insight into the biotechnological potential of this bacterium and revealed that it is a metalotolerant and a biofilm-producing strain capable of utilizing various toxic compounds. The strain is resistant to rifampicin, chloramphenicol and β-lactams. The corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (including blaOCH and cmlA/floR) were identified in the POC9 genome. Nevertheless, as only few genes in the POC9 genome might be linked to pathogenicity, and none of those genes is a critical virulence factor found in severe pathogens, the strain appears safe for application in environmental biotechnologies. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The present study aims to address the following question: compared with first and second-generation biofuels, can microalgae biodiesel contribute to addressing the sustainability objectives in the transport sector in France? To this end, we deployed the range based Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (range-based MAMCA) methodology that explicitly considers the different and occasionally conflicting values of the stakeholders (feedstock producers, biofuel producers, refining industry, fuel distributors, end-users, car manufacturers, government, and NGOs). By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, the method also provides an exploratory scenario approach that enables considering uncertainty concerning the context evolution and the biofuel impacts by 2030. In our case study, we aimed at fostering co-construction with stakeholders into the decision-making process by involving them starting from the very beginning of the procedure. Assuming a “weak sustainability” (i.e. the substitutability between human and environmental capital) our results suggest that microalgae biodiesel can contribute to the achievement of the sustainability objectives in the transport sector. Preliminary policy measures are finally suggested to speeding up the deployment of microalgae biodiesel in France. At the overall level, our study provides new insights about the capacity of first, second and third generation biofuels in fulfilling the sustainability criteria of the different stakeholders. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Salinity is one of the strongest environmental drivers of microbial evolution and community composition. Here we aimed to determine the impact of salt concentrations (2.5, 7.5, and 33.2%) on the microbial community structure of reclaimed saltern ponds near San Francisco, California, and to discover prospective enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. Community compositions were determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealing both higher richness and evenness in the pond sediments compared to the water columns. Co-occurrence network analysis additionally uncovered the presence of microbial seed bank communities, potentially primed to respond to rapid changes in salinity. In addition, functional annotation of shotgun metagenomic DNA showed different capabilities if the microbial communities at different salinities for methanogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate-active enzymes. There was an overall shift with increasing salinity in the functional potential for starch degradation, and a decrease in degradation of cellulose and other oligosaccharides. Further, many carbohydrate-active enzymes identified have acidic isoelectric points that have potential biotechnological applications, including deconstruction of biofuel feedstocks under high ionic conditions. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of individual halotolerant and halophilic microbes were binned revealing a variety of carbohydrate-degrading potential of individual pond inhabitants. © 2018 Kimbrel, Ballor, Wu, David, Hazen, Simmons, Singer and Jansson.

AB  - Background: Switchgrass breeders need to improve the rates of genetic gain in many bioenergy-related traits in order to create improved cultivars that are higher yielding and have optimal biomass composition. One way to achieve this is through genomic selection. However, the heritability of traits needs to be determined as well as the accuracy of prediction in order to determine if efficient selection is possible. Results: Using five distinct switchgrass populations comprised of three lowland, one upland and one hybrid accession, the accuracy of genomic predictions under different cross-validation strategies and prediction methods was investigated. Individual genotypes were collected using GBS while kin-BLUP, partial least squares, sparse partial least squares, and BayesB methods were employed to predict yield, morphological, and NIRS-based compositional data collected in 2012-2013 from a replicated Nebraska field trial. Population structure was assessed by F statistics which ranged from 0.3952 between lowland and upland accessions to 0.0131 among the lowland accessions. Prediction accuracy ranged from 0.57-0.52 for cell wall soluble glucose and fructose respectively, to insignificant for traits with low repeatability. Ratios of heritability across to within-population ranged from 15 to 0.6. Conclusions: Accuracy was significantly affected by both cross-validation strategy and trait. Accounting for population structure with a cross-validation strategy constrained by accession resulted in accuracies that were 69% lower than apparent accuracies using unconstrained cross-validation. Less accurate genomic selection is anticipated when most of the phenotypic variation exists between populations such as with spring regreening and yield phenotypes. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the use of grapeseed oil as a fuel substitute obtained from biomass waste from winery industry and the synergic effect of hydrogen addition for compression ignition engine application. The experiments were carried out in a single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine for various loads and energy share of hydrogen. Combustion, performance and emission characteristics of grapeseed biodiesel, neat grapeseed oil and diesel have been analysed and compared with the results obtained with hydrogen induction in the intake manifold in dual fuel mode. At full load, maximum brake thermal efficiency of the engine with diesel, grapeseed biodiesel and neat grapeseed oil has increased from 32.34%, 30.28% and 25.94% to 36.04%, 33.97% and 30.95% for a maximum hydrogen energy share of 14.46%, 14.1% and 12.8% respectively. Although there is an increasing trend in Nitric Oxide emission with hydrogen induction, smoke, brake specific hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide emissions respectively, reduces. Nitric oxide emission of Grapeseed biodiesel with maximum hydrogen share at full load is higher by 43.61% and smoke emission lower by 19.73% compared to biodiesel operation without hydrogen induction. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The demand for renewable energy resources, such as Miscanthus spp., has increased significantly in temperate regions. Miscanthus spp. has the potential to mitigate GHG emissions by replacing fossil fuels and sequestering carbon in soil. However, the biomass yield and C sequestration performance of Miscanthus spp. varies by climate, soil type, management practices, and land-use history. Therefore, there is a need for site-specific research on biomass yield and C sequestration of Miscanthus × giganteus (M × g). An alternative to M × g is the seed-propagated Miscanthus sinensis which could be another option as a bioenergy crop. The objective of this study was to assess the C sequestration rates and biomass yield performance of these two Miscanthus spp. The C sequestration rates were measured in side-by-side comparison plots using the 13 C natural abundance technique. The results revealed C sequestration rates of M × g and M. sinensis were 1.96 ± 0.82 and 0.99 ± 0.21 Mg C ha −1 year −1 over 6 years. The average biomass yields of M × g and M. sinensis from 2010 to 2015 were 25.6 ± 0.2 and 31.2 ± 0.5 Mg ha −1 year −1 , respectively. It can be concluded that M. sinensis has a higher yield while M × g has a higher potential for immediate C sequestration in cool regions such as Northern Japan. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) has favorable attributes for producing biofuels. Two study sites were established on retired agricultural fields in the LMAV to explore switchgrass (SWITCH) and eastern cottonwood (CTWD) as biofuel feedstocks. A soybean-sorghum rotation (CROP) was also established as a conventional cropping system. Soil efflux gas (carbon dioxide [CO2], methane [CH4], and nitrous oxide [N2O]), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and dehydrogenase activity were measured for two years. Cumulative growing-season soil CO2 efflux of SWITCH exceeded that of CROP; SWITCH had higher daily CO2 efflux than CTWD and CROP in some months. SWITCH and CTWD had greater Cmic than CROP at both sites. Soil CH4 and N2O efflux rates were low for much of the study, with only short-term differences in soil CH4 observed. Converting these retired agricultural sites to SWITCH increased soil CO2 efflux relative to CROP, with increases attributable to greater plant and microbial respiration. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper investigates where and how sustainable transport goals are translated into public transport planning and operations. The case where this is explored is the Regional Public Transport Authority (RPTA) in Stockholm, Sweden. By drawing upon recent discussions on policy translation and political–administrative relationships, sustainable transport is found to be translated in two different collaborative spaces in the RTPA. In the market side of the authority, which is mainly preoccupied with procurement of traffic and compliance issues, sustainable transport is translated into quantitative goals (including biofuels, emissions, noise, etc.) and mechanically reproduced from the politicians via the civil servants to the private operators. In the planning side of the authority, sustainability measurements have been hard to quantify and the challenge to integrate land-use and transport planning is resolved in an organic manner, in specific projects, between the strategic transport planners in the RPTA and the land-use planners in the municipalities, at a distance from the politicians’ involvement. Throughout the RPTA, sustainable transport has broadened to also include social sustainability, although this has been difficult to translate into quantitative measurements, which is the desired mode of governance by the politicians. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Soybean, rapeseed, and palm oil are the main raw materials for biodiesel production worldwide. However, there are other potential feedstocks for biodiesel production. Speculations swirl around the agreements signed at the 21st Conference of the Parties to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector and stimulate the biofuel blending. As an increase in the biodiesel demand is expected, Brazil can be an important player in the international market because of the availability of land and the diversity of raw materials. This paper discusses current global oil and biodiesel scenarios and reviews several potential feedstocks focusing on the prospects, limitations, food–fuel nexus, and opportunities to develop added-value products. Despite the variety of potential feedstocks, the biodiesel sector is likely to pursue its development based on large-scale economically competitive alternatives. Animal fat and waste frying oil are options for a short-term scenario. Palm oil is a promising choice for medium term, while algae and second generation routes may contribute to the biodiesel supply in the long term. Development of competitive chains, investment in technologies, processes and logistics, and domestication of species are essential to guarantee the inclusion of such feedstocks in the world biofuel mix. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While the impact of emissions from combustion of fossil fuel on human health has been extensively studied, current knowledge of exhaust exposure from combustion of biofuels provides limited and inconsistent information about its neurotoxicity. The objective of the present work was to compare the gene expression patterns in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus after exposure to diesel exhaust emissions (DEE) from combustion of two 1st generation fuels, 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) (B7) and 20% FAME (B20), and a 2nd generation 20% FAME/hydrotreated vegetable oil (SHB20: synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel), with and without diesel particulate filter (DPF). The Fisher 344 rats (n = 7/treatment) were exposed to DEE for 7 days (6h/day), and for 28 days (6h/day, 5 days/week) in whole body exposure chambers. The controls were breathing room air. Brain histological examinations did not reveal any adverse exposure-related effects of DEE in frontal cortex or in hippocampus. Gene expression analysis showed that several genes associated with antioxidant defenses and inflammation were statistically differently expressed in DEE exposed animals versus control. In addition, the gene expression changes between the exposure groups were compared, where the observed rank order in frontal cortex was B7 > B20 > SHB20 after 7 days of exposure, and SHB20 > B7 = B20 after 28 days of exposure. In the hippocampus, the rank order was B7 > SHB20 > B20. Effect of DPF treatment was observed for Tnf only. Overall, moderate increases in bio-components in diesel blends do not appear to result in dramatic alterations in gene expression or adverse histopathological effects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Complex carbohydrates of plants are the main food sources of animals and microbes, and serve as promising renewable feedstock for biofuel and biomaterial production. Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) are the most important enzymes for complex carbohydrate metabolism. With an increasing number of plant and plant-associated microbial genomes and metagenomes being sequenced, there is an urgent need of automatic tools for genomic data mining of CAZymes. We developed the dbCAN web server in 2012 to provide a public service for automated CAZyme annotation for newly sequenced genomes. Here, dbCAN2 (http://cys.bios.niu.edu/dbCAN2) is presented as an updated meta server, which integrates three state-of-the-art tools for CAZome (all CAZymes of a genome) annotation: (i) HMMER search against the dbCAN HMM (hidden Markov model) database; (ii) DIAMOND search against the CAZy pre-annotated CAZyme sequence database and (iii) Hotpep search against the conserved CAZyme short peptide database. Combining the three outputs and removing CAZymes found by only one tool can significantly improve the CAZome annotation accuracy. In addition, dbCAN2 now also accepts nucleotide sequence submission, and offers the service to predict physically linked CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs), which will be a very useful online tool for identifying putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in microbial genomes or metagenomes. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This paper presents a mathematical programming model for the optimal planning of an integrated system for producing fuels and biofuels considering the interaction with facilities capable of capturing emissions from biorefineries and refineries and receiving a monetary benefit; these facilities can be named eco-industries or forest plantations. The proposed approach is formulated as a multistakeholder scheme to consider the benefits and effects in each one of the involved supply chain entities and to determine how the interactions between the different stakeholders take place. The proposed approach takes into account the profit of biorefineries, refineries, and forest plantations as well as the emissions and jobs generated in each one of the involved entities. Additionally, it considers local and imported raw materials to satisfy the energy demand. Also, the approach considers features such as the project lifetime; the availability of resources; the amount and type of products that should be produced; and the allocation and capacity of the refineries, biorefineries, and forest plantations. The mathematical approach was applied to a nationwide case study for Mexico, considering the creation of new jobs, overall emissions, and net profit as main objectives. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Introduction: Waste frying oils transesterification was studied for the purpose of achieving the best conditions for biodiesel production. Biodiesel is proved to be the best replacement for diesel because of its unique properties such as significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, non-sulfur emissions, non-particulate matter pollutants, low toxicity, and biodegradability. Waste edible oil is an feedstock in the biodiesel production. The discussion will cover various aspects from oil composition, oil yielding, economics, cultivation materials, land availability, and also the resources availability. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire has been conducted among 100 students from Saveetha Dental College on awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste. Results: Most of the waste accumulated in India is found to be form household wastes. 80% of the participants do not know about the zero waste system. There are 45% of the participants who are aware of glass Büchner system. In the present generation, more than 95% of the world biodiesel is produced from the edible oil which is easily available in many large-scale industries from the agriculture land. Conclusion: Production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils for diesel substitute is particularly important because of the decreasing trend of economical oil reserves, environmental problems caused due to fossil fuel use, and the high price of petroleum products in the international market. An awareness on the production of biodiesel from household waste was created. © JPR Solutions. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to an increasing global demand in cheap oils and biofuels, forest conversion to oil palm plantations is rapidly increasing in Indonesia. Oil palm canopy soil, or the soil lodged between the stems and leaf axils of oil palms, is one ecosystem compartment that has yet to be investigated as to its importance on the soil greenhouse gas budget. Our objectives were 1) to quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from oil palm canopy soil, and 2) to determine the factors controlling these fluxes. Our study was conducted in Jambi Province, Indonesia, an area of rapid oil palm expansion. Trace gas fluxes were measured in eight smallholder oil palm plantations (9–16 years old). In each plantation, oil palms were delineated into three 1-m height sections (low, middle, and top) to represent possible gradients of canopy soil conditions that influence N2O and CH4 fluxes. Trace gas fluxes were measured by collecting canopy soil from each stem section and immediately incubating in the field in an air-tight glass jar. Canopy soils from all oil palm stem sections emitted N2O and CH4. The top stem section had higher N2O and CH4 emissions than the lower sections, and this pattern was paralleled by nitrogen availability and water content, which strongly influenced these fluxes. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit dry mass of canopy soil were considerable, but on a hectare basis these emissions were small due to the low amount of canopy soil per hectare (170 kg ha−1). Annual canopy soil N2O and CH4 emissions were 10.7 ± 3.3 g N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 and 1.9 ± 0.5 g CH4-C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, which contributed only 1% of the total soil (canopy soil + ground soil) N2O fluxes and 0.2% of the ground soil net CH4 consumption. Our estimate of oil palm canopy soil emissions in Jambi Province were 7.7 Mg N2O-N yr−1 and 1.3 Mg CH4-C yr−1. Considering the increasing areal coverage of oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, these fluxes may substantially contribute to soil greenhouse gas budgets. © 2018

AB  - We investigated impacts of simultaneous production of biomass for biofuel and quality timber on soil nitrogen (N) cycling in a poorly drained forest soil of eastern North Carolina, U.S.A. Treatments included traditional loblolly pine (PINE) and pine-switchgrass intercropping (PSWITCH). Treatments were replicated three times on 0.8 ha plots drained by parallel open ditches which were 1.2 m deep and spaced 100 m apart. Net N mineralization (Nm) and nitrification (Nn) rates were measured in the field using sequential in-situ technique over two years with multiple measurements in each year and laboratory by incubating soil samples for one-, two-, eight-, and thirteen weeks. Soil incubation in-situ or sample collection for laboratory incubation was conducted at nine sampling points within a 30 × 40 m subplot at each plot center and 20 cm from the soil surface. Soil samples were composited by location including near tree (NT), between two trees on the same bed (BT), and in the middle of four trees on two adjacent beds (M4T). Composite samples from NT and BT were categorized as tree-bed (BED), while those from M4T were grouped as interbed (INT). Field results showed that total soil N availability and its temporal variations over two years were not significantly affected by PSWITCH. However, it significantly reduced Nn rates, particularly in the INT. The plot-level mean Nm rates in PINE were 0.21 and 0.26 mg N·kg soil−1 d−1, while in PSWITCH they were 0.10 and 0.21 mg N kg soil−1 d−1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The plot-level mean Nn rates in PINE were 0.09 and 0.10 mg N kg soil−1 d−1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, while in PSWITCH they remained at 0.03 mg N kg soil−1 d−1 across these two years. At the INT, mean Nn rates in PINE were 0.11 and 0.12 mg N kg soil−1 d−1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, while in PSWITCH, Nn rate remained at 0.02 mg N kg soil−1 d−1 over two years. Laboratory results indicated that change in litter quality inputs (changing from mixed species to switchgrass) in the INT did not significantly affect Nm rates. Results of this study contributed to a better understanding of the changes in soil N cycling due to loblolly pine-switchgrass interactions, which is important in sustainable nutrient management of this new land use. Further, the results suggested that growing switchgrass as intercrop to managed loblolly pine has positive water quality implication since ammonium N is less mobile in soil than nitrate N. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of fast pyrolysis bio oil (FPBO) constitutes one of the newest technologies for gaining a liquid biofuel from woody biomass. During this process biomass fly ashes (FAs), rich in minerals and salts, are produced. However, FAs are often disposed in landfills and their fertilising potential has been underestimated. A greenhouse trial was set up to test the impact of FA on soil physico-chemical and microbiological properties with a special focus on phosphorus, one of the main limiting nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. FA were added into an acidic grassland soil at a rate of 2% with wheat (Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta) used as test plant. Soil and plants were collected after an incubation period of 60 and 100 days. Ash application increased soil pH and electrical conductivity, and improved soil nutritional status by increasing soil total, inorganic, and plant available phosphorus over time. Accordingly, higher plant yields were observed in ash-treated soils. The effect of FA on microbial biomass, assessed as double stranded DNA content, was time dependent and increased significantly with plant presence. Acid phosphomonoesterase activity significantly decreased following ash addition. However, neither alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP) activity nor the abundance and composition of the ALP gene (phoD) harboured by bacteria were affected by FA application. On the whole, FA from FPBO production seems to improve soil nutrient status and plant growth without inheriting detrimental effects on soil microbial communities in the mid-term. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a conceptual approach that allows better understanding of what determines the performance of polycentric governance. The paper first identifies discrete structural alternatives of polycentric governance types (Public Service Industries). We suggest that efficient performance of Public Service Industries is shaped by variations in social-problem characteristics (determining potential types of governance) and constitutional and overarching rules (of people's choosing), which jointly determine the credibility with which citizen-consumers are able to discipline the activities of agents involved in governance. We illustrate this approach through the case of transnational biofuel governance in the European Union. We find that constitutionally granted (lack of) transparency and accountability are, in this case, pivotal for relatively inefficient governance of public goods. However, we also acknowledge the difficulties of assessing performance of polycentric governance based on single case studies. To overcome this problem, we suggest Comparative Institutional Analysis, which selects case studies according to social problem characteristics that are responsible for particular kinds of performance (e.g., efficiency) of polycentric governance types. This would allow scholars associated with the Bloomington School of Political Economy but also scholars analyzing governance from perspectives adopting similar assumptions to learn more about how constitutional rules shape the performance of polycentric governance types to build sound policy recommendations derived from this. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Biofuel production using native perennials on marginal soils can reduce US dependence on foreign oil and curtail greenhouse gas emissions with minimal impact on food crop production. We quantified post-establishment biomass yield and N removal as a function of harvest regime (anthesis and post-frost) and N application rate (0, 56, and 112 kg N ha–1) at two marginal sites in Minnesota. We examined three switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) monocultures: ‘Shawnee’, ‘Sunburst’, and ‘Liberty’, a new bioenergy variety, and three polycultures: grass-only, grass-legume, and grass-legume-forb. On an excessively-drained loamy sand soil, maximum productivity occurred in ‘Sunburst’ and ‘Shawnee’ switchgrass fertilized at 112 kg N ha–1 yr–1 in the post-frost harvest regime, with 3-yr total yields of 11.0 Mg ha–1, while ‘Liberty’ produced 7.0 Mg ha–1. On an eroded loam soil, maximum post-frost productivity in ‘Shawnee’, ‘Sunburst’, and ‘Liberty’ was similar at 56 and 112 kg N ha–1 yr–1, with total yields of 32.6, 29.8, and 23.5 Mg ha–1, respectively. Yields of the low-diversity (LD) grass mix were similar to ‘Shawnee’ switchgrass at both locations, indicating that an LD grass mix or well-adapted switchgrass monoculture are likely the most productive feedstocks for this region. Most feedstocks produced similar or greater yields and removed less N in the post-frost relative to the anthesis harvest. While producers may have flexibility in harvest timing for some feedstocks in the first few years following establishment, a post-frost harvest regime may promote stand longevity with less N fertilizer use over time. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Vegetable oils, biodiesels, bio-alcohols and bio-gas are some of the popular biofuels evaluated for their suitability in compression-ignition (CI) engines. Among these, bio-alcohols can be produced from any kinds of biomass through fermentation and biosynthesis and they do not require extra land for cultivation. Therefore, bio-alcohols can be considered as the next generation alternative fuels for automobiles. Investigations have been already initiated to determine the effects of bioalcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, in automobiles as fuel. However, they pose some problems like miscibility, phase separation, low cetane number and low calorific value. On the other side, the effects of higher alcohols, such as butanol, pentanol, octanol, are investigated very rarely. In this work, the effects of higher alcohol addition on the engine performance and emissions characteristics are investigated on a single cylinder diesel engine. Conventional diesel and biodiesel are taken as the reference fuels. 1-Butanol of blends (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) was mixed with the remaining biodiesel as the testing fuel blends. Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder compression ignition diesel engine for four load conditions (5 kg, 10 kg, 15 kg and 20 kg) at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. Brake thermal efficiency and emissions of CO, NOx and HC were recorded and discussed. From the experimental results, it is evident that the addition of butanol with biodiesel seems to an alternative fuel that can replace conventional diesel fuel in terms of both engine emissions and performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The special issue Scaling up bioenergy? identifies major policy expectations attached to biofuels production worldwide, and it provides systematic reviews of actual biofuel performance and governance in these areas. Papers address the extent to which policy expectations related to climate change mitigation, energy security, rural livelihoods and risk mitigation have been achieved, and the effectiveness of public and private governance in advancing sector sustainability. Building on these findings, the synthesis paper asks, “What next?” for countries wishing to advance national biofuel programmes as one option for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Among other sine qua nons, the special issue highlights the urgent need to downscale global energy demand, and to stop treating biofuels as an isolated sector. Goldemberg et al. (2018) query several aspects of our approach, from research design, data collection, to our recommendation to apply the “precautionary principle” in research as well as policy making. Unfortunately, Goldemberg et al. (2018) incorrectly portray our main argument. Moreover, they claim bias in our approach and mistakes in our empirical evidence, however, without bringing forward an evenhanded critique of research philosophy, methodology or referencing different empirical literature. We fully stand behind our research philosophy and findings presented. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reducing aviation emissions will be a major concern in the coming years, as the relative contribution of aviation to overall emissions is projected to increase in the future. The South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) is an extreme nonattainment area with many airports located upwind of the most polluted regions in the basin. Techniques to reduce aviation emissions have been studied in the past, and strategies that can be implemented at airports include taxi-out times reduction, ground support equipment electrification and aviation biofuel implementation. These strategies have been analyzed only at the national scale, their effectiveness to improve air quality within the SoCAB given the local meteorology and chemical regimes is unclear. This work studies how the adoption of the techniques at commercial SoCAB airports affect ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. In addition, potential impacts on public exposure to PM2.5 and O3 resulting from changes in the concentration of these pollutants are estimated. In addition, the work calculates aviation emissions for each scenario and simulate the transport and atmospheric chemistry of the pollutants using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The simultaneous application of all reduction strategies is projected to reduce the aviation-attributable population weighted ground-level PM2.5 by 36% in summer and 32% in winter. On the other hand, O3 increases by 16% in winter. Occurring mostly in densely populated areas, the decrease in ground-level PM2.5 would have a positive health impact and help the region achieve attainment of national ambient air quality standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perennial bioenergy crops accumulate carbon (C) in soils through minimally disturbing management practices and large root inputs, but the mechanisms of microbial control over C dynamics under bioenergy crops have not been clarified. Root-derived C inputs affect both soil microbial contribution to and degradation of soil organic matter resulting in differing soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, storage, and stabilities under different vegetation regimes. Here, we measured biomarker amino sugars and neutral sugars and used diffuse reflectance mid-infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to explore microbial C contributions, degradation ability, and SOC stability, respectively, under four potential bioenergy crops, M.×giganteus (Miscanthus × giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a mixed prairie, and a maize (Zea mays L.)–maize–soybean (Glycine max(L.) Merr.) (MMS) rotation over six growing seasons. Our results showed that SOC concentration (g/kg) increased by 10.6% in mixed prairie over the duration of this experiment and SOC storage (Mg/ha) increased by 17.0% and 15.6% in switchgrass and mixed prairie, respectively. Conversion of row crops to perennial grasses maintained SOC stability and increased bacterial residue contribution to SOC in M.×giganteus and switchgrass by 20.0% and 15.0%, respectively, after 6 years. Degradation of microbe-derived labile SOC was increased in M.×giganteus, and degradation of both labile and stable SOC increased in MMS rotation. These results demonstrate that microbial communities under perennial grasses maintained SOC quality, while SOC quantity increased under switchgrass and mixed prairie. Annual MMS rotation displayed decreases in aspects of SOC quality without changes in SOC quantity. These findings have implications for understanding microbial control over soil C quantity and quality under land-use shift from annual to perennial bioenergy cropping systems. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Biofuel development to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) would alter conventional crop patterns in agricultural watersheds. As a result, the hydrologic response of the watersheds will exhibit different and often opposing effects on agrohydrological system variables such as riverine nitrate-N load and streamflow. Conventional modeling approaches treat those externalities as regulatory constraints, often fail to consider the hierarchical nature of the decision-making process, and end with unrealistic solutions. This study therefore proposes an alternative decision-modeling framework for biofuel development to optimize a water-quality objective under different levels of streamflow requirement in the watershed. A bilevel programming model is established to mimic the hierarchical decision-making process in environmental regulation. The model is applied to the Sangamon River basin, a typical agricultural watershed in central Illinois, to determine the optimal locations and type of ethanol biorefineries as policy instruments. The results show that the proposed instruments can effectively guide the decisions in biofuel development to meet the environmental objectives in the watershed, although adopting the proposed framework yields a lower profit than the conventional models, which is the price of a more realistic solution to the hierarchical decision problem. The results also highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity and identifying an appropriate spatial scale to design effective environmental policies in biofuel development. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Biomass-derived bio-oil cannot be applied directly in diesel engines due to several poor fuel properties such high viscosity and instability. Emulsification could overcome the disadvantages of bio-oil. In this study, bio-oil emulsified with diesel was combusted in a DI diesel engine, and the effects of bio-oil compositions on the engine performance and emissions were investigated. Crude bio-oil has aging and instability problems, which could cause inconsistencies in the results. Synthetic bio-oil was used to avoid the limitations posed by crude bio-oil. Synthetic bio-oil was fractioned into three categories (hydroxyl compounds, aldehydes and sugars), and the corresponding emulsions were prepared. Compared with diesel, the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) were increased, and the brake power remained almost unchanged for the emulsions. For the exhaust emissions, CO and smoke emissions were decreased, while CO2 emissions were increased. The emulsions derived from the aldehydes and hydroxyl compounds reduced NOx emissions, whereas emulsions derived from sugars and the whole bio-oil increased NOx emissions. The results indicated that the aldehydes and hydroxyl compounds in bio-oil were more desirable for clean combustion than sugars. The hydroxyl compounds could result in the largest emissions reductions due to the presence of OH radicals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents an economic optimization of a supply chain network to produce sugar and bioethanol from the first- and second-generation biomass in South Africa. A mixed-integer linear program model in combination with Google Earth® and ArcGIS was hereby developed to account for sugar demand, different feedstocks and products, as well as their distribution, tax subsidies and different processing technologies to address bioethanol production. The model was applied to two case studies depending on availability of biomass of which the results showed that the integrated bioethanol and sugar supply chain network is economically viable in South Africa. Transportation costs accounted for a significant part of the costs incurred in the supply chain, while highest profits are made when higher amounts of raw materials are available and there is no restriction relating to ethanol production. It is concluded that the 2% bioethanol-fuel blend target stipulated by the government of South Africa in the biofuel industrial strategy can be exceeded while still producing current amounts of sugar. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Offshore production of macroalgae biomass, which was recently given the name seagriculture, is one of the important but least explored alternative energy resources. Unlike microalgae, macroalgae cultivation can be done offshore and therefore brings real news to the biofuel - food land agriculture conflict. A wide variety of small-scale laboratory experiments are done lately in order to deepen the knowledge and develop expertise in macroalgae cultivation and its downstream processing. For energy applications, it is common to evaluate the performance of an energy source or system in exergy efficiency terms. Another important parameter that is evaluated to determine the system's environmental impact is it's volumetric and areal footprint. The current work examines two exergy efficiency indexes, the Exergy Efficiency (EE), which takes into account all exergy inputs, and the Exergy Return On Investment (ExROI), that includes only fossil fuel exergy inputs, both on a green macroalgae Ulva grown in the macroalgae photobioreactor system (MPBR) incorporated into a building. Cultivation of macroalgae in the building embedded MPBR achieved maximal values of 0.012 and 0.22 for EE and ExROI, compared to a range of 0.05-8.34 and 0.013-0.327 found in published papers of microalgae systems. In addition, a modelled optimization of the initial biomass density leads to maximal values of about 0.035 for EE and 0.433 for ExROI, while further improvement may be achieved by optimization of nutrient addition and mixing methodology. This work demonstrates a tool to measure the performance of laboratory scale macroalgae biomass cultivation systems, followed by preliminary efficiency and environmental impact values, important for future upscaling. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perennial bioenergy crops are considered an important feedstock for a growing bioeconomy. However, in the USA, production of biofuel from these dedicated, nonfood crops is lagging behind federal mandates and markets have yet to develop. Most studies on the economic potential of perennial biofuel crops have concluded that even high-yielding bioenergy grasses are unprofitable compared to corn/soybeans, the prevailing crops in the United States Corn Belt. However, they did not account for opportunities precision agriculture presents to integrate perennials into agronomically and economically underperforming parts of corn/soybean fields. Using publicly available subfield data and market projections, we identified an upper bound to the areas in Iowa, United States, where the conversion from corn/soybean cropland to an herbaceous bioenergy crop, switchgrass, could be economically viable under different price, land tenancy, and yield scenarios. Assuming owned land, medium crop prices, and a biomass price of US$ 55 Mg−1, we showed that 4.3% of corn/soybean cropland could break even when converted to switchgrass yielding up to 10.08 Mg ha−1. The annualized change in net present value on each converted subfield patch ranged from just above US$ 0 ha−1 to 692 ha−1. In the three counties of highest economic opportunity, total annualized producer benefits from converting corn/soybean to switchgrass summed to US$ 2.6 million, 3.4 million, and 7.6 million, respectively. This is the first study to quantify an upper bound to the potential private economic benefits from targeted conversion of unfavorable corn/soybean cropland to switchgrass, leaving arable land already under perennial cover unchanged. Broadly, we conclude that areas with high within-field yield variation provide highest economic opportunities for switchgrass conversion. Our results are relevant for policy design intended to improve the sustainability of agricultural production. While focused on Iowa, this approach is applicable to other intensively farmed regions globally with similar data availability. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Renewable energy transitions in the U.S. have included growing interest in promoting perennial bioenergy crop production within different rural landscapes. However, landowners’ receptivity to such land use and development in mixed-use landscapes is not well understood. Previous research has shown that economic motivations and market factors contribute to farmer decision-making about growing energy crops in working landscapes, while research on public responses to renewable energy technologies has found that sense of place and symbolic meanings regarding land, nature, and technologies are influential. The goal of this study is to integrate these strands of research to examine the influence of sociocultural factors on both landowners’ general support for local bioenergy crop production and their willingness to participate directly by growing dedicated energy crops in mixed-use landscapes. The study draws on a survey completed by 908 landowners and farmers in rural New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Seeing bioenergy as a broadly progressive technology significantly increased the likelihood of support for local bioenergy crop production, as did having a college degree and larger landholdings, while sense of place factors were not significant. Seeing bioenergy as a progressive technology also significantly increased the likelihood of being willing to grow bioenergy crops on one's own land, as did having a college degree, knowledge about switchgrass, having idle land, as well as concerns about bioenergy markets. This study demonstrates that in addition to other variables, sociocultural factors influence both support for local bioenergy crop production and landowner willingness to grow bioenergy crops on their own land. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and a mix of native warm season grasses with forbs (NWSG-mix) have received attention as cellulosic biofuel sources. While numerous studies support greater biodiversity within those biofuel crops than corn, it is unclear how switchgrass and NWSG-mix affect beneficial insects such as pollinators (PO) and predators/parasites/parasitoids (PPP). Also, few empirical studies have explored the effects of biofuel crop harvest on insects. We investigated the responses of PO and PPP insects to those two biofuel crops and harvest frequency in Mississippi, USA, during 2011–2013. We established 16 fields on agricultural lands and randomly assigned each one of 4 treatments: switchgrass with single harvest; switchgrass with multiple harvests; NWSG-mix with single harvest; NWSG-mix with multiple harvests. We set up 3 sampling stations per field and conducted insect sampling 1–3 times monthly during summer to fall using colored pan traps. We tested treatment effects with general linear mixed models and redundancy analyses. While treatment effects varied by season and year, biofuel crop type influenced abundance and insect family diversity but harvest frequency did not. During summer, total abundance and guild-level (PO and PPP) abundance were high in switchgrass in 2011. During fall, total abundance and abundance of PPP were high in NWSG-mix in 2011 and 2012 and abundance of PO in 2011 and 2013. Family richness was also greater in NWSG-mix across seasons in 2011 and 2012 and during fall in 2013. More families tended to be associated with NWSG-mix than switchgrass. Our results suggest that 1) biofuel crop type is a more important factor influencing beneficial insects than harvest frequency and 2) compared to NWSG-mix, switchgrass may provide more resources for insects during summer or during the first year after establishment; however, NWSG-mix could enhance insect diversity and abundance of pollinators for a longer period of time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dairy wastes can be conveniently processed and valorized in a biorefinery value chain since they are abundant, zero-cost and all year round available. For a comprehensive knowledge of the microbial species involved in producing biofuels and valuable intermediates from dairy wastes, the changes in bacterial and archaeal population were evaluated when H2, CH4 and chemical intermediates were produced. Batch anaerobic tests were conducted with a mixture of mozzarella cheese whey and buttermilk as organic substrate, inoculated with 1% and 3% w/v industrial animal manure pellets. The archaeal methanogens concentration increased in the test inoculated at 3% (w/v) when H2 and CH4 production occurred, being 1 log higher than that achieved in the test inoculated at 1% (w/v). Many archaeal species, mostly involved in the production of CH4, were identified by sequencing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. Methanoculleus, Methanocorpusculum and Methanobrevibacter genera were dominant archaea involved in the anaerobic process for bioenergy production from mozzarella cheese whey and buttermilk mixture. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work introduces biodiesel production from wet spent coffee grounds (SCGs) with supercritical methanol without any pre-drying process. Supercritical methanol and subcritical water effectively produced biodiesel via in situ transesterification by inducing more porous SCG and enhancing the efficiency of lipid extraction and conversion. It was also found that space loading was one of the critical factors for biodiesel production. An optimal biodiesel yield of 10.17 wt% of dry SCG mass (86.33 w/w% of esterifiable lipids in SCG) was obtained at reaction conditions of 270 °C, 90 bars, methanol to wet SCG ratio 5:1, space loading 58.4 ml/g and reaction time 20 min. Direct use of wet SCG waste as feedstock for supercritical biodiesel production eliminates the conventional dying process and the need of catalyst and also reduces environmental problems caused by landfill accumulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Technical, economic and environmental aspects of implementing two-phase anaerobic digestion (AD), i.e., acidogenic + methanogenic systems, in sugarcane biorefineries for the treatment of vinasse were assessed based on different strategies to using the hydrogen-rich biogas (biogas-H2) generated via acidogenesis. Phase separation greatly enhanced the bioenergy recovered from vinasse AD compared with single-phase systems (methanogenic phase exclusively). The best results for generating electric energy were observed in combined cycle-based power plants that utilized biohythane (10.8 MW + 5.5 MW for the harvest and inter-harvest, respectively), which is the gaseous biofuel from blending biogas-H2 with the methane-rich stream from the methanogenic phase (biogas-CH4). Moreover, the results of this study indicated that scaling up two-phase AD systems is economically feasible for the treatment of sugarcane vinasse (net present value = USD 208.58–219.86 million) because a better or equivalent economic performance was attained compared with single-phase processes. Optimizing the alkalinization of methanogenic reactors strongly affected both the economic and environmental performance of the process, with better results observed with the use of low sodium hydroxide dosages (4 g NaOH kg−1COD). In summary, our results highlighted that two-phase biodigestion may enhance energy production from vinasse by 20–30% without impairing the profitability of the biorefinery and could lead to slight improvements in the environmental performance of the ethanol production chain via the use of an optimized alkalinization strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) is a potential biofuel feedstock crop in China. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of energy use efficiency and economic perspectives for this crop, face-to-face surveys were collected from farmers in Gansu and Shandong provinces. The results demonstrated highest energy use efficiency (2.47 in Gansu and 2.37 in Shandong), net energy (59,926 MJ/ha in Gansu and 55,298 MJ/ha in Shandong) and energy productivity (0.77 kg/MJ in Gansu and 0.74 kg/MJ in Shandong) for Jerusalem artichoke plantation size ranging from 4.0–20.0 ha in Gansu and for plantation sizes >35.0 ha in Shandong. Moreover, the lowest total production costs, namely, 9913 CNY/ha and 12,264 CNY/ha, were incurred by plantation size of 20.1–35.0 ha in size in both Gansu and Shandong, respectively. In addition, the highest benefit/cost ratio and economic productivity values were observed for plantation size of 4.0–20.0 ha in Gansu (2.60 and 2.89 kg/CNY, respectively) and >35.0 ha in Shandong (1.96 and 2.17 kg/CNY, respectively). Consequently, plantation size of <35.0 ha in Gansu and >35.0 ha in Shandong are recommended for Jerusalem artichoke production with the use of mechanization in conjunction with the use of Jerusalem artichoke straw for bioenergy production. Therefore, Jerusalem artichoke may make a large contribution in meeting the growing future challenges for bioenergy production for an expanding population. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Triticale is an emerging bioenergy crop in Canada, with potential as a feedstock for the production of ethanol and co-products from both its grain and straw. This study evaluates the commercial potential of introducing triticale as an industrial feedstock crop in the Brown agroecological soil zone of the Canadian Prairies, a semi-arid area which accounts for the highest share of underutilized summerfallow in the region. The study approach includes determination of location parameters (potential triticale land area, feedstock collection radius, and transportation distance), on-farm triticale yield, on-farm production cost, and feedstock chemical composition. Subsequently, SuperPro® Designer was used to develop and simulate two processes using both grain and straw: a) integrated process that ferments both pentose and hexose (Process I); b) single process involving fermentation of hexose sugars only, while pentose sugar is diverted for biogas production and then combined with lignin for power generation (Process II). Triticale on-farm yield is analyzed for the range 5.1–6.8 t ha−1 (which corresponds to 74–126 thousand ha of triticale area). Triticale on-farm production cost is $473 ha−1 with corresponding on-farm profit of $570–$1150 ha−1 from grain and straw sale. The integrated grain and straw processing model is developed and simulated for a 200–550 million L annum−1 ethanol biorefinery, with corresponding total capital investment cost of $140–$240 million. Fermenting both grain and straw and using hydrothermal pretreatment for straw resulted a lower equipment purchase cost per litre of ethanol ($0.12–$0.14 L−1) compared with cellulosic ethanol production using other pretreatment methods ($0.60–$1.24 L−1). The process involving fermentation of both pentose and hexose (Process I) is more profitable compared with a hexose-only process (Process II). Ethanol selling price, plant capacity, and feedstock cost all have high impact on net present value. All plants generate negative net present value at ethanol prices of $0.60 L−1 or less, while a price of at least $0.80 L−1 is required for plants with capacity higher than 250 million L to generate positive net present value. This study provides a basis for further articulation of Canada's triticale biorefinery concept beyond the near-term goal of producing ethanol, namely, sustainable production of a wide array of bioproducts (bioenergy, biofuels, biomaterials, biochemicals, and biologics) to enhance the profitability of the triticale biorefinery and contribute to Canada's environmental goals for a bio-based economy. © 2018

AB  - Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is one of the most important candidate crops that can be used to increase the land cover and crop yield in the arid and saline region of China. To evaluate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on the growth of castor bean under drought and salt stresses, a pot experiment was carried out to examine how AM fungi improve the plant growth of castor bean by affecting the leaf gas exchange, pigments, and metabolites accumulation of castor bean seedlings. The results showed that AM fungi stimulated plant growth and increased the castor bean aboveground biomass. AM fungi significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) of castor bean and decreased the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) under drought and salt stress. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids in leaves treated by AM fungi were higher than in those without the AM fungi treatment. AM fungi notably increased the soluble protein and proline contents and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of castor bean. The results indicated that AM fungi could protect castor bean against drought and salt stresses by improving its leaf gas exchanges and photosynthetic capacity and altering its concentrations of metabolites. Our results highlight that AM fungi might be a promising bio-approach that can be used to plant castor beans in northeast and northwest China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large private agricultural projects are described by their promoters as “win-win” partnerships: investments supposedly make it possible to increase agricultural productivity in developing countries, and to create thousands of jobs in the industry. These arguments, which are used in Sierra Leone where the priority of the agricultural policy is to attract foreign capitals, rely on the conviction that lands occupied by large private agricultural projects are “under-farmed” or even “unused” and that, therefore, their opportunity cost is nil. However, where family farms are well-established, the differential between the jobs created and those destroyed must be examined carefully. This is what we propose to do in this article, by examining the case of an ethanol and electricity production unit relying on an industrial sugar cane plantation of more than 12 500 ha, in the centre of the country. By analysing family farming in a control region close to that of the project, we show that family farming supplanted by the project would enable more farm labourers to make a living than the number of jobs potentially created by the industrial production unit. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While the US Midwest is expected to serve as a primary feedstock source for cellulosic biofuel production, the impacts of residue harvesting on soil organic carbon (SOC) may greatly limit sustainable production capacity. However, viable feedstock production could be realized through adoption of management practices and cropping systems that offset residue-harvestinduced SOC losses. Sequestration of SOC can be enhanced by increasing the duration of crop soil cover through cover or double cropping or cultivation of dedicated perennials. However, assessing the efficacy of such options across sites and over long periods is experimentally challenging. Hence, we use the Environmental Productivity Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to provide such an assessment. Model-data integration was used to calibrate and evaluate model suitability, which exhibited reasonable effectiveness through R2 of 0.97 and 0.63 for SOC stock and yield, respectively. Long-term simulations indicate considerable capacity for offsetting SOC loss. Incorporating rye (Secale cereal L.) into continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems offset the SOC losses induced by harvesting 21.2 and 38.3% of available stover, respectively. Similarly, converting 20.4% of corn-soybean land to miscanthus (Miscanthus ×giganteus J.M. Greef &amp; Deuter ex Hodkinson &amp; Renvoize) or 27.5% of land to switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) offset the SOC impacts of harvesting 60% of stover from the remaining corn-soybean lands. These responses indicate that adoption of such measures would sizably affect the life cycle consequences of residue-derived biofuels and expand estimates of sustainable cellulosic feedstock production capacity from the US Midwest. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Biofuel feedstock production can be a significant driver of landscape modification, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss. There is growing body of literature that shows how biofuel landscapes provide various ecosystem services (e.g., feedstock for fuel, carbon sequestration) and compromise other ecosystem services (e.g., food, freshwater services). These effects are context-specific and depend largely on prior land use conditions and feedstock production practices. Changes in the flow of ecosystem services due to the conversion of natural and agricultural areas can have ripple effects on human wellbeing. Despite some recent attempts to apply to biofuel settings concepts and methods rooted in the ecosystem services literature, this is the exception rather than the rule within both the biofuel and the ecosystem services research communities. This paper synthesizes the current knowledge about the impact of biofuels on ecosystem services. It focuses especially on the feedstock production phase and outlines the main mechanisms through which landscape conversion affects the provisions of ecosystem services. It proposes conceptually coherent indicators to reflect these mechanisms and offers a critical discussion of key issues at the interface of biofuels and ecosystem services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rape is a non-grain feedstock with several characteristics that make it suitable for biofuel production, such as high oil yields and low environmental impact. Planting rape on winter fallow fields could allow for seasonal rotation between the bioenergy production and agricultural production. In the present study, the Global Agro-Ecological Zones model was used to estimate the production potential of rapeseed on winter fallow fields in the Yangtze River region from 2010 to 2015. Life cycle assessment was then conducted to calculate energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from the entire energy-producing process and to estimate the number of bioenergy enterprises and their spatial distribution. The results indicated that the total area available of winter fallow fields in the Yangtze River region was 24.93 million ha, accounting for 34.2% of the total cultivated land area. The total yield of winter rapeseed was up to 46.41 million tons (an average yield of 1.86 tons/ha). Thus, the study area could potentially produce net energy of up to 3564 million MJ with energy return on energy investment (EROEI) as high as 1.52–1.84. The total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions may be up to 23.28 million tons, and the total number of bioenergy enterprises could be 589, from which the total biodiesel output could be 167.5 million tons. Hubei, Henan, Anhui and Jiangxi should be prioritized for generating biofuels from rapeseed planted on winter fallow fields. © 2018

AB  - A sulfonated carbon material was developed and investigated as an environmentally benign catalyst for furfural production. The sulfonic acid functionality was introduced by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology and textural properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and N2 sorption measurements, respectively. The presence of sulfonic acid on the surface was proven by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meanwhile, the acid properties were studied using an NH3-TPD profile. Two different sulfonated carbons that was activated with KOH before sulfonation and one that was compared. The KOH-activated sulfonated carbon contained both a porous structure and a high sulfonic acid content that improved the furfural yield and selectivity by more than 50% compared to the nonactivated sulfonated carbon. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by monitoring the furfural selectivity over several reaction cycles, and after the 3rd cycle, a reduction in the selectivity from 72 to 30% was observed. However, the acid-functionalized carbon could still be useful for furfural production due to its low environmental impact in both the preparation and disposal steps. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1455–1461, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - There have been strong calls globally to improve the sustainability of biodiesel production from oilseeds. Nevertheless, there is a lack of robust methodologies that are able to depict the local impacts of intensive feedstock production on soil properties and functions. The aim of this study is to quantify and map the potential biodiesel production from oilseed (e.g. soybean, sunflower and rapeseed), and understand possible trade-offs with other soil-related Ecosystem Services (ESs) such as i) habitat for soil organisms (supporting service), ii) soil carbon storage (regulating service), iii) groundwater quality protection (regulating service) and iv) food crops (provisioning service). This method is tested on current intensive agricultural areas of the Veneto region plain of Northern Italy. The results suggest that the study area has a sustainable biodiesel production potential of 20.7 dam3 per year, which is only 52% of the regional target for the year 2020. The areas that are currently under other annual crops (primarily cereals and maize) can also have a significant further contribution that if exploited would greatly exceed the regional target. This finding indicates that achieving the regional target will be impossible without having significant trade-offs with other soil-related ES or causing land use change. The proposed methodology could provide a tool that could be integrated within (and potentially improve the effectiveness of) biofuel certification schemes, strategic environmental assessments of renewable energy pathways, and regional energy plans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continued development of cellulosic-based biofuels is needed to provide renewable energy and strengthen rural investment and development in the United States (US). To ensure biofuel development is sustainable and does not negatively affect ecosystem services, stakeholder input is necessary to identify sensitive and meaningful indicators. A major challenge is that there are substantial differences in terminology, perspectives, and methods used to quantify sustainability and ecosystem services with regard to processes, biodiversity, and socioeconomic effects. Our objectives were to identify relevant indicator categories for both perspectives using a case study from the US state of Iowa. A scientific literature review and engagement with stakeholders were used to identify 11 indicator categories associated with production, harvest, storage, and transport of cellulosic feedstocks. Five categories focus on environmental concerns (soil quality, water quality and quantity, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, and productivity) and six on socioeconomic concerns (social wellbeing, energy security, external trade, profitability, resource conservation, and social acceptability). Although these indicators reflect sustainability concerns of these stakeholders, additional monitoring and stakeholder engagement are needed to support the continual improvement that is part of adaptive management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper analyses the implications of the expansion of biofuel feedstock production in Malawi on local food crop production. This represents a trade-off between two provisioning ecosystem services: biofuel feedstock (i.e. sugarcane) and food crops. Specifically, we assess household-level linkages between biofuel feedstock and food crop production among farmers involved in outgrower schemes around a large-scale plantation, sugar mill and ethanol distillery complex in Dwangwa, Central Malawi. Our analysis is based on a farm household survey that targeted sugarcane outgrowers (intervention group) and households not growing sugarcane (control group). We apply econometric and matching techniques to assess the impact of household participation in biofuel feedstock production on agricultural input expenditures for food crop production, land under food crops and investment in agricultural assets. In spite of limitations to establish causality, our results suggest that participation in sugarcane outgrower schemes is associated with larger amounts of land under staple food crops and higher purchases of farm inputs compared to the control group. The results further suggest that the expansion of biofuel feedstock production does not necessarily compromise household food production for those households involved in outgrowers schemes due to potentially positive intra-household linkages. We discuss under which circumstances this is possible, and whether and how other ecosystem services may be affected by sugarcane expansion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane ethanol is an alternative to fossil fuels that can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and offer socioeconomic benefits, but at the same time have a series of negative impacts. Brazil is the second largest producer of fuel ethanol globally, with this production predicted to almost double over the next 15 years. However sugarcane ethanol production in the country has been shown to interact with a range of ecosystem services. It is only when such interactions are understood that we can fully determine the potential trade-offs, synergies and sustainability outcomes of biofuel production in the country. This paper explores the local perceptions about the impacts of sugarcane production on ecosystem services in two municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo with significant sugarcane production: Capivari and Rancharia. Impact perceptions have been elicited through interviews with local residents, with the results showing that perceptions vary between the two study sites and are affected considerably by the different local experiences with sugarcane production. For example, although sugarcane farming has been traditionally performed in Capivari, it has been Rancharia that has experienced more recently a rapid sugarcane expansion that has caused considerable changes in land use and farming patterns. Interview results also suggest that the negative effects of sugarcane farming can be reduced through the adoption of good agricultural practices and the enforcement of existing laws, as many respondents cited considerable improvements in ecosystem health from such actions. Assessing the perception of local communities such as the one reported in this paper can be crucial in designing policies and planning land uses that enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced biomass feedstocks tend to provide more non-fuel ecosystem goods and services (ES) than 1st-generation alternatives. We explore the idea that payment for non-fuel ES could facilitate market penetration of advanced biofuels by closing the profitability gap. As a specific example, we discuss the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB), where 1st-generation bioenergy feedstocks (e.g., corn-grain) have been integrated into the agricultural landscape. Downstream, the MARB drains to the Gulf of Mexico, where the most-valuable fishery in the US is impacted by annual formation of a large hypoxic “Dead zone.” We suggest that advanced biomass production systems in the MARB can increase and stabilize the provision of ES derived from the coastal and marine ecosystems of the Gulf-of-Mexico. Upstream, we suggest that choosing feedstocks based on their resistance or resilience to disturbance (e.g., perennials, diverse feedstocks) can increase reliability in ES provision over time. Direct feedbacks to incentivize producers of advanced feedstocks are currently lacking. Perhaps a shift from first-generation biofuels to perennial-based fuels and other advanced bioenergy systems (e.g., algal diesel, biogas from animal wastes) can be encouraged by bringing downstream environmental externalities into the market for upstream producers. In future, we can create such feedbacks through payments for ES, but significant research is needed to pave the way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The concept of marginal land is often used to justify land availability and inform land allocation for biofuel projects. However, marginal lands can provide other valuable ecosystem services. Using interviews with multiple stakeholders and fieldwork in three collapsed biofuel projects in Ghana, this paper shares perspectives on how the ecosystem service approach (ESA) can offer a better basis for selecting land for biofuel projects. Expert interviews with key stakeholders (e.g. Lands Commission) in biofuel value chains in Ghana highlight the lack of consensus of what constitutes marginal land, with two dominant interpretations coming up; (i) land unsuitable for food production and (ii) land unsuitable for cost-effective agricultural production. Both interpretations however do not reflect the ecosystem services lands provide, as well as the significant cultural values attached to them. Our empirical work shows that many ecosystem services are obtained from the supposedly marginal lands that are neglected from both interpretations, as well as the standard project planning and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We make the case that when compared to the current marginal land narrative, the ESA offers a better lens for understanding local land uses, in managing emerging tradeoffs and providing information for locating biofuel projects. Our findings suggest that expanding the scope of EIAs by integrating elements of the ESA can go a long way towards informing site selection for biofuel investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Small-scale biodiesel production with a high level of community involvement has been associated with a number of benefits. These include relatively low environmental impacts, lack of competition with food production, strong poverty alleviation effects and enhanced access to energy. This Short Communication provides a qualitative analysis of the effects of the cultivation of biodiesel oilseed tree crops (mostly Millettia pinnata, along with Simarouba glauca, Azadirachta indica, Madhuca lungifolia and Jatropha curcas) in such a small-scale project, the Hassan Bio-Fuel Park in Karnataka, India. This extensive ethnographic research and using the ecosystem services approach to synthesize the findings suggests that the changes in both the flows of ecosystem services and different constituents of human wellbeing are marginal. While the ecosystem services approach can be useful to synthesize various forms of knowledge on biofuels to inform policy, this particular case study highlights the importance of being open about the different, often implicit, priorities and values of research projects and the various kinds of actors involved in biofuel production. Finally, it is crucial to understand not just which impacts are generated but especially how those impacts are generated. © 2017 The Author

AB  - National or supranational policies such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED) prescribe both the assessment of the environmental impacts of biofuel and bioenergy production, as well as their impact on ecosystem services (ESS). However, it is not clear what differentiates environmental assessment (EA) and ESS studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and compared ESS and EA studies of biofuel and bioenergy production. We focused on topics such as whether both approaches allow for a holistic sustainability assessment of biofuel/bioenergy production, are suitable for practitioners, and which gaps for policymaking they can bridge. The results of the systematic review suggest that ESS studies tend to assess economic and social sustainability more prominently when compared to EA studies. Furthermore, ESS studies often assess ESS bundles and thereby cover multiple environmental impact categories, while EA studies focus more on selected environmental impacts (e.g., GHG emissions, air pollution, water quality and availability), targeting fewer environmental impacts to achieve slightly more feasible and reliable impact assessments (lower uncertainty). EA studies are dominated by life-cycle assessments. Contrastingly, ESS studies rather cover the entire social-ecological dimensions of biofuel and bioenergy production. Due to their systematic approach, they act as an envelope for multiple methodologies that can quantify the sustainability impacts of biofuel and bioenergy production. In this respect, it can be argued that ESS studies could support policymaking bridging some existing gaps such as the underrepresentation of social assessments in the EU RED. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass cropping systems have the potential to alter the ecosystem services provided by agricultural landscapes. Depending on crop type and management, strategic incorporation of biomass cropping systems into existing agricultural landscapes could enhance a range of ecosystem services while mitigating some disservices. Here, we review the approaches and findings of eight years of research into the potential effects of a range of biomass cropping systems on ecosystem services in the North Central US. Our research was framed by an initial assessment of the abundance and distribution of multiple taxa (i.e., biodiversity) within candidate biomass cropping systems. The processes underpinning important ecosystem services in each system were then measured or modeled, related to biodiversity metrics, and used to explore the influence of management scenarios on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We also used these data and models to develop a decision support system that allows stakeholders to consider tradeoffs and synergies under alternative landscape composition, configuration, and agronomic management. Perennial grass cropping systems provided the greatest potential to promote multiple ecosystem services. More diverse perennial grasslands that include forbs have the potential to increase pest suppression and pollination, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance grassland bird communities, but likely at the expense of biomass yield. Providing stakeholders and policymakers with information about the expected mix of ecosystem services supported by different biomass feedstock cropping systems in advance of their adoption offers the potential for informed choices to guide the implementation and management of future biomass-producing landscapes. © 2017

AB  - Replacing row crops with perennial bioenergy crops may reduce nitrogen (N) loading to surface waters. We estimated the benefits, costs, and potential for replacing maize with switchgrass to meet required N loading reduction targets for the Chesapeake Bay (CB) of 26.9 Gg y−1. After subtracting the potential reduction in N loading due to improved N fertilizer practices for maize, a further 22.8 Gg y−1 reduction is required. Replacing maize with fertilized switchgrass could reduce N loading to the CB by 18 kg ha−1 y−1, meeting 31% of the N reduction target. The break-even price of fertilized switchgrass to provide the same profit as maize in the CB is 111 $ Mg−1 (oven-dry basis throughout). Growers replacing maize with switchgrass could receive an ecosystem service payment of 148 $ ha−1 based on the price paid in Maryland for planting a rye cover crop. For our estimated average switchgrass yield of 9.9 Mg ha−1, and the greater N loading reduction of switchgrass compared to a cover crop, this equates to 24 $ Mg−1. The annual cost of this ecosystem service payment to induce switchgrass planting is 13.29 $ kg−1 of N. Using the POLYSYS model to account for competition among food, feed, and biomass markets, we found that with the ecosystem service payment for switchgrass of 25 $ Mg−1 added to a farm-gate price of 111 $ Mg−1, 11% of the N loading reduction target could be met while also producing 1.3 Tg of switchgrass, potentially yielding 420 dam3 y−1 of ethanol. © 2017

AB  - There is a long-term concern that the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks could have negative impacts on communities involved in, or adjacent to, such projects. In southern Africa, the acquisition and allocation of large blocks of land for biofuel feedstock production has been especially contentious. The present study investigates the local multi-dimensional poverty effects of growing biofuel crops using the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative's Multidimensional Poverty Index. It investigates different modes of production (large-scale vs. smallholder-based) and different feedstocks (sugarcane vs. jatropha) in four study sites in Malawi, Swaziland and Mozambique. In the sugarcane growing areas, those who participated in its value chain as farmers or workers had lower poverty than those who were not involved. However, for jatropha growing areas, there were no clearly defined differences between the controls and the jatropha farmers in Mangochi, while in Mozambique the plantation workers had slightly lower poverty than the control groups. Although it was not possible to make direct comparisons between all projects, sugarcane areas seem to be better off than non-sugarcane areas. In all projects there was generally high incidence of deprivations in indicators related to living standards, particularly, access to electricity and cooking fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding changes in carbon sequestration due to land conversion is key for elucidating the true potential of biofuel landscapes to provide climate regulation ecosystem services. In this study, we focus on the two most promoted biofuel crops in southern Africa, Jatropha and sugarcane, to analyse the land use change effects and associated carbon impacts of growing biofuel crops in five study sites in Mozambique, Malawi and Swaziland. We found that, considering a 20-year cycle, carbon stocks in aboveground biomass are higher for sugarcane than for Jatropha. However, as soil organic carbon (SOC) is generally the main carbon pool, total carbon stocks (considering biomass and soil) will highly depend on SOC. Our results show that, in our study sites, sugarcane replaced land uses with low carbon stocks (low-density forest and agriculture), and as a result carbon gains occurred due to land use change. In the Jatropha projects, carbon gains are observed in the smallholder scheme as agricultural land was converted to Jatropha, but carbon debts occurred in the Jatropha plantation as high-density forest was cleared to grow this feedstock. Finally we show that, if a plantation of sugarcane or Jatropha is envisioned to be located in the studied regions, more forested land could potentially be converted into sugarcane (30–44% of forest) than into Jatropha (24–32%), without creating carbon debts due to land conversion. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of the carbon impacts of land use change of the main biofuel crops in southern Africa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is a cost-effective approach for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and biochemicals. The enzymatic conversion of cellulose to glucose requires the synergistic action of three types of enzymes: exoglucanases, endoglucanases and β-glucosidases. The thermophilic, hemicellulolytic Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12 was shown to harbor desired features for CBP, although it lacks the desired endo and exoglucanases required for the conversion of cellulose. Here, we report the expression of both endoglucanase and exoglucanase encoding genes by G. thermodenitrificans T12, in an initial attempt to express cellulolytic enzymes that complement the enzymatic machinery of this strain. Results: A metagenome screen was performed on 73 G. thermodenitrificans strains using HMM profiles of all known CAZy families that contain endo and/or exoglucanases. Two putative endoglucanases, GE39 and GE40, belonging to glucoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) were isolated and expressed in both E. coli and G. thermodenitrificans T12. Structure modeling of GE39 revealed a folding similar to a GH5 exo-1,3-β-glucanase from S. cerevisiae. However, we determined GE39 to be a β-xylosidase having pronounced activity towards p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside. Structure modelling of GE40 revealed its protein architecture to be similar to a GH5 endoglucanase from B. halodurans, and its endoglucanase activity was confirmed by enzymatic activity against 2-hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and barley β-glucan. Additionally, we introduced expression constructs into T12 containing Geobacillus sp. 70PC53 endoglucanase gene celA and both endoglucanase genes (M1 and M2) from Geobacillus sp. WSUCF1. Finally, we introduced expression constructs into T12 containing the C. thermocellum exoglucanases celK and celS genes and the endoglucanase celC gene. Conclusions: We identified a novel G. thermodenitrificans β-xylosidase (GE39) and a novel endoglucanase (GE40) using a metagenome screen based on multiple HMM profiles. We successfully expressed both genes in E. coli and functionally expressed the GE40 endoglucanase in G. thermodenitrificans T12. Additionally, the heterologous production of active CelK, a C. thermocellum derived exoglucanase, and CelA, a Geobacillus derived endoglucanase, was demonstrated with strain T12. The native hemicellulolytic activity and the heterologous cellulolytic activity described in this research provide a good basis for the further development of G. thermodenitrificans T12 as a host for consolidated bioprocessing. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach to produce either aliphatic or aromatic bio-hydrocarbons is introduced. First, poplar or spruce wood was deconstructed by a lignin-first biorefining process, a technique based on the early-stage catalytic conversion of lignin, yielding lignin oils along with cellulosic pulps. Next, the lignin oils were catalytically upgraded in the presence of a phosphidated Ni/SiO2 catalyst under H2 pressure. Notably, selectivity toward aliphatics or aromatics can simply be adjusted by changes in H2 pressure and temperature. The process renders two distinct main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20). As the approach is H2-intensive, we examined the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification. For several biomass sources, the H2 obtainable by gasification stoichiometrically meets the H2 demand of the deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, making this concept plausible for the production of high-energy-density drop-in biofuels. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. Such solutions are referred to as lignin-first biorefining. They are highly efficient at preventing the generation of recalcitrance in the lignin streams while yielding delignified pulps. Herein, a lignin-centered convergent approach rendering two main cuts of branched hydrocarbons (gasoline: C6-C10, and kerosene/diesel: C14-C20) is introduced. As the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin streams is H2-intensive, the utilization of pulp as an H2 source via gasification is proposed. The cellulosic H2 shows potential for covering the H2 demand for the production of drop-in lignin fuels. Importantly, the energy content of the lignin fuels relative to the energy content of the lignocellulose is approximately 2- to 2.5-times higher than that of cellulosic ethanol. Therefore, it is now timely to question whether cellulosic bioethanol is the most sensible target fuel from lignocellulose. Heterogeneous catalysis is no longer limited to the conversion of lignin wastes from cellulosic-centric industries, but has expanded to offer innovative solutions for the deconstruction of lignocellulose by reductive processes. This enables the creation of a deep converting lignin-first biorefinery, shifting paradigms. Lignin-biorefinery produces gasoline and kerosene/diesel drop-in fuels. The self-sufficiency in H2 is achieved through the gasification of the delignified holocelluloses. Notably, H2 surplus releases holocellulose for the production of platform chemicals, further monetizing the lignin-first process chains. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Worldwide significant amounts of food waste are generated daily causing serious environmental issues, occupying land and requiring expenditure of resources for its treatment. A smart method for handling this food waste problem is the development of novel processes targeting the conversion of this waste into value added products. Although valorization of food waste to biofuels, biochemicals and bio-polymers have been widely investigated, the utilization of food waste streams into biofertiliser has not been intensively reviewed. Conversion of food waste, especially agriculture residues into biofertiliser would reduce its environmental impact, improve nutrition levels of the soil, decrease requirements for synthetic chemical fertiliser and have a direct benefit on food production. This paper reviews recent progress in the field regarding the production of biofertiliser from food waste, using anaerobic digestion, aerobic composting, chemical hydrolysis, in situ degradation and direct burning methods. This review also highlights the latest field applications of biofertiliser derived from various food waste streams. It confirms that the technology for the conversion of food waste to biofertilisers is viable, but the production efficiency could be improved with better process control strategies, strict quality controls, development of a smart product distribution system and adoption of advanced technologies. Field tests have indicated that biofertilisers which are obtained in proper managed AD plants are safe and could partially replace the use of chemical fertilisers in field application. © 2018

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal carbonization was conducted to convert lipid extracted algae (Chlorella vulgaris) from the algal biodiesel process to produce hydrochar, while evaluating its feasibility for use as a solid fuel. Hydrothermal carbonization was conducted at a relatively low temperature range, owing to the energy consumption during the process. Based on the results, the properties of lipid extracted algae as a solid fuel improved during hydrothermal carbonization, being comparable to the low-ranked coals. The hydrochars thus produced showed stable combustion characteristics at high temperature. Moreover, the sulfur and ash content in the lipid extracted algae decreased through devolatilization during hydrothermal carbonization, allowing the hydrochar (low sulfur and ash content) to be considered as a clean energy source. Thus, a sustainable integration process, combining the hydrochar production from lipid extracted algae with the algal biodiesel process, seems to be feasible for solid fuel production and disposal of waste. © 2018

AB  - The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a complex mixture of easily digestible compounds, mainly starchy materials, and hardly digestible compounds, mainly lignocelluloses. Thus, OFMSW has a high potential for biofuel production after the hydrolysis of carbohydrates. In this study, dilute-acid treatment was used for the hydrolysis of starchy materials, eliminating the amylases enzymes requirement. Besides, the acid treatment acted as a pretreatment for the improvement of lignocelluloses fractions prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses. The acid treatment was conducted with 0.5 and 1% (w/w) sulfuric acid at 130 and 160 °C for 0, 30, and 60 min. The treatment with 1% acid at 130 °C for 60 min resulted in the hydrolysate with the highest glucose concentration of 43.2 g/L, mainly originated from starchy materials, and the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the treated solids resulted in a hydrolysate containing 23.4 g/L glucose, mainly from cellulose. These hydrolysates, containing different sugars and inhibitors, were then subjected to ethanolic fermentation using a highly inhibitor-tolerant strain of Zygomycetes fungi, Mucor indicus. Using acid treatment with 1% at 130 °C for 60 min, without detoxification, the ethanol yield of 44.6 and 44.4 g per 100 g glucose was obtained from hydrolysate and acid treatment liquor, respectively. The liquid remained after the separation of ethanol from fermentation liquor and the residual solid remained after enzymatic hydrolysis were subjected to anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Overall, 194.0 g ethanol and 144.8 L methane were produced from each kg of dry OFMSW through the consecutive processes. Therefore, without detoxification and amylases requirement, all biodegradable parts of MSW were converted to bioenergy in the form of ethanol and biogas, resulting in the production of 10,453 kJ energy and 326.6 mL gasoline equivalent from each kg of dry OFMSW. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas production using waste activated sludge (WAS) is one of the most demanding technologies for sludge treatment and generating energy in sustainable manner. The present study deals with the photocatalytic pretreatment of WAS using ZnO-ZnS@polyaniline (ZnO-ZnS@PANI) nanocomposite as means for increasing its degradability for improved biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). Photocatalysis accelerated the hydrolysis of WAS and increased the sCOD by 6.7 folds after 6 h and transform tCOD into bioavailable sCOD. After the AD of WAS, a removal of organic matter (60.6%) and tCOD (69.3%) was achieved in photocatalytic pretreated sludge. The biogas production was 1.6 folds higher in photocatalytic sludge with accumulative biogas up to 1645.1 ml L−1vs after 45 days compared with the raw sludge (1022.4 ml L−1 VS). Moreover, the photocatalysis decrease the onset of methanogenesis from 25 to 12 days while achieve the maximum conversion rate of reducing sugars into organic acids at that time. These results suggested that photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method and ZnO-ZnS@PANI can degrade sludge efficiently for enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The price volatility of fossil resources, the uncertainty of their long-term availability and the environmental, climatic and societal problems posed by their operation lead to the need of an energy transition enabling the development and utilization of other alternative and sustainable resources. Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can increase greenhouse gas emission, the European Union (EU) has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has set criteria for sustainability to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon savings and protects biodiversity. From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (e.g., more secure energy supply, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and production of high added-value molecules) as well as risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way should help to maximize benefits and minimize risks. This approach has been adopted and is described in the present work that combines chemical, biological, social and territorial studies on the management of pruning waste residues from olive trees in the Sierra Mágina in Spain. The biological and social analyses helped to orientate the research towards an attractive chemical process based on extraction and pyrolysis, in which high added value molecules are recovered and in which the residual biochar may be used as pathogen-free fertilizer. In this region where farmers face declining economic margins, the new intended method may both solve greenhouse gas emission problems and provide farmers with additional revenues and convenient fertilizers. Further research with a larger partnership will consolidate the results and tackle issues such as the logistics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Disposal of sewage sludge is one of the most important issues in wastewater treatment throughout Europe, as EU sludge production, estimated at 9.5 million tons dry weight in 2005, is expected to approach 13 million tons in 2020. While sludge disposal costs may constitute 30–50% of the total operation costs of wastewater treatment processes, waste sewage sludge still contains resources that may be put to use, like nutrients and energy, that can be recovered through a variety of approaches. Research has shown that waste sewage sludge can be a valuable and very productive feedstock for biodiesel generation, containing lipids (the fats from which biofuels are extracted) in amounts that would require large areas cultivated with typical biodiesel feedstock, to produce, and at a much lower final cost. Several methods have been tested for the production of biodiesel from sewage sludge. To date, among the most efficient such process is pyrolysis, and in particular Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP), under which process conditions are more favorable in energetic and economic terms. Sludge characteristics are very variable, depending on the characteristics of the wastewater-generating service area and on the wastewater treatment process itself. Each sludge can be considered a unique case, and as such experimental determination of the optimal biodiesel yields must be conducted on a case-by-case basis. In addition to biodiesel, other pyrolysis products can add to the energetic yield of the process (and not only). This paper discusses how feedstock properties and process characteristics may influence biodiesel (and other products) yield from pyrolytic (and in particular, MAP) processes, and discusses future possible technological developments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into soluble sugars is a major bottleneck in the plant biomass utilization. Several anaerobic organisms cope these issues via multiple-enzyme complex system so called 'cellulosome'. Hence, we proposed a "biomimic operon" concept for making an artificial cellulosome which can be used as a promising tool for the expression of cellulosomal enzymes in Bacillus subtilis. Results: According to the proteomic analysis of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC27405 induced by Avicel or cellobiose, we selected eight highly expressed cellulosomal genes including a scaffoldin protein gene (cipA), a cell-surface anchor gene (sdbA), two exoglucanase genes (celK and celS), two endoglucanase genes (celA and celR), and two xylanase genes (xynC and xynZ). Arranging these eight genes in two different orders, we constructed two different polycistronic operons using the ordered gene assembly in Bacillus method. This is the first study to express the whole CipA along with cellulolytic enzymes in B. subtilis. Each operon was successfully expressed in B. subtilis RM125, and the protein complex assembly, cellulose-binding ability, thermostability, and cellulolytic activity were demonstrated. The operon with a higher xylanase activity showed greater saccharification on complex cellulosic substrates such as Napier grass than the other operon. Conclusions: In this study, a strategy for constructing an efficient cellulosome system was developed and two different artificial cellulosomal operons were constructed. Both operons could efficiently express the cellulosomal enzymes and exhibited cellulose saccharification. This strategy can be applied to different industries with cellulose-containing materials, such as papermaking, biofuel, agricultural compost, mushroom cultivation, and waste processing industries. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper introduces a method to analyse and explore consistency within policy mixes in order to support the policymaking cycle and applies it to energy and climate change policies in the United Kingdom (UK) biofuels policy context. The first part of the paper introduces a multi-level method to evaluate consistency within policy mixes implemented over a period of time. The first level explores consistency across policy design features in policy mixes. The second level evaluates how stakeholders, and their interactions with policy instruments and each other, can impact consistency within a given context. These interactions influence the implementation of policies and can lead to unintended outcomes that fail to meet the overarching goals. In the second part of the paper, we apply our method to the UK biofuels policy mix, to explore a sector that cuts across the policy areas of transportation, energy, land-use, air, and climate change. Our analysis demonstrates how, by overlooking complex interactions in the design and implementation of policies in the biofuels sector, policy mixes have conflicted with the development of a potential low-carbon technology. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Plants have a diverse endophytic microbiome that is functionally important for their growth, development, and health. In this study, the diversity and specificity of culturable endophytic fungal communities were explored in one of the most important biofuel crops, switchgrass plants (Panicum virgatum L.), which have been cultivated on a reclaimed coal-mining site for more than 20 years. The endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface-sterilized shoot (leaf and stem), root, and seed tissues of switchgrass plants and then cultured for identification. A total of 1339 fungal isolates were found and 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were sequence identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and grouped into 7 orders and 4 classes. Although a diverse range of endophytic fungi associated with switchgrass were documented, the most abundant class, order, and species were Sordariomycetes, Hypocreales, and Fusarium spp. respectively. About 86% of the isolated endophytic fungi were able to enhance the heights of the shoots; 69% could increase the shoot fresh weights; and 62% could improve the shoot dry weights after being reintroduced back into the switchgrass plants, which illustrated their functional importance. Through the Shannon Diversity Index analysis, we observed a gradation of species diversity, with shoots and roots having the similar values and seeds having a lesser value. It was observed that the switchgrass plants showing better growth performance displayed higher endophytic fungal species diversity and abundance. It was also discovered that the rhizosphere soil organic matter content was positively correlated with the fungal species diversity. All these data demonstrate the functional association of these beneficial endophytic fungi with switchgrass and their great potential in improving the switchgrass growth and biomass to benefit the biofuel industry by reducing chemical inputs and burden to the environment. © 2018 Xia et al.

AB  - Oil palm is the major crop grown and cultivated in various Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The core of oil palm trunk (COPT) consists of high sugar content, hence suitable for synthesis of fine chemicals and biofuels. Increase of sugar content was reported previously during prolonged COPT storage. However, until now, there has been no report on protein profiles during storage. Therefore, in this study, protein expression of the COPT during the storage period of one to six weeks was investigated using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) coupled with optical density quantification and multivariate analyses for measuring differentially expressed proteins. Accordingly, protein bands were subjected to tryptic digestion followed by tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) protein identification. The results from SDS-PAGE showed consistent protein bands appearing across the biological replicates ranging from 10.455 to 202.92 kDa molecular weight (MW) regions. The findings from the principal component analysis (PCA) plot illustrated the separation pattern of the proteins at weeks 4 and 5 of storage, which was influenced mainly by the molecular weights of 14.283, 25.543, 29.757, 30.549, 31.511, 34.585 and 84.395 kDa, respectively. The majority of these proteins are identified as those involved in stress- and defense-related, disease resistance, as well as gene/protein expression processes. Indeed, these proteins were mostly upregulated during the later storage period suggesting that long-term storage may influence the molecular regulation of COPT sap. © 2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Peculiarities of metals uptake by the biofuel crop Miscanthus x giganteus were explored during plant growth at soil from the military site (Sliač, Slovakia). The experiment was carried out in greenhouse during two vegetation seasons. Research soil was predominantly elevated in Fe and Ti, while other metals (As, Cu, Mn, Sr, Zn and Zr) were presented at order of magnitude lower concentrations. No inhibition of plant growth was observed. The calculated Bioconcentration Factor showed that levels of metals' accumulation by plant roots, stems and leaves were independent of metals' concentrations in the soil. The accumulation of metals by stems and leaves was much lower than by roots. As, Zr, Ti were almost not accumulated by stems and leaves during both seasons; accumulation of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and Sr was not essential which confirmed that biomass of M. x giganteus might be processed for the energy purpose. © 2018 Valentina V.

AB  - Algae undergo a complete metabolic transformation under stress by arresting cell growth, inducing autophagy and hyperaccumulating biofuel precursors such as triacylglycerols and starch. However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this stress-induced transformation are still unclear. Here, we use biochemical, mutational, and “omics” approaches to demonstrate that PI3K signaling mediates the homeostasis of energy molecules and influences carbon metabolism in algae. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the inhibition and knockdown (KD) of algal class III PI3K led to significantly decreased cell growth, altered cell morphology, and higher lipid and starch contents. Lipid profiling of wild-type and PI3K KD lines showed significantly reduced membrane lipid breakdown under nitrogen starvation (-N) in the KD. RNA-seq and network analyses showed that under -N conditions, the KD line carried out lipogenesis rather than lipid hydrolysis by initiating de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, which was supported by tricarboxylic acid cycle down-regulation and via acetyl-CoA synthesis from glycolysis. Remarkably, autophagic responses did not have primacy over inositide signaling in algae, unlike in mammals and vascular plants. The mutant displayed a fundamental shift in intracellular energy flux, analogous to that in tumor cells. The high free fatty acid levels and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation led to decreased cell viability. These results indicate that the PI3K signal transduction pathway is the metabolic gatekeeper restraining biofuel yields, thus maintaining fitness and viability under stress in algae. This study demonstrates the existence of homeostasis between starch and lipid synthesis controlled by lipid signaling in algae and expands our understanding of such processes, with biotechnological and evolutionary implications. © 2018 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Microalgae biodiesel production depends on several factors to minimize the costs of the production process from both biomass and biodiesel. In some outdoor systems, the temperature can be higher than 35 °C, which is lethal for several algae. Prospecting microalga from thermal environments seems to be a good option. Therefore, the objective of this work was to isolate a microalga (Acutodesmus obliquus (Turpin) Hegewald and Hanagata) from thermal water and evaluate its cultivation productivity in Bold Basal Medium (BBM) and in lower cost alternative media. One alternative medium contained only the main growth ingredients (DAF), the other included these same ingredients with the addition of wastewater from the purification of grease-based raw materials (DAF + OGR). Microalga biodiesel productivity was also compared with the biodiesel yield of soybean, which is one of the main raw materials currently used for biodiesel production. The microalga was shown to provide biomass with similar productivity using the three different culture media in log phase. The microalga exhibited biodiesel productivity from 46 to 61 times higher than soybean; using 5.5–7.2% of the water and 1.6–2.2% of the land required for soybean cultivation to produce the same amount of biodiesel. The DAF + OGR medium, which costs 29% of the cost of the BBM medium, proved to be an efficient alternative medium compared to other in biomass productivity. Levels of tri-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids from A. obliquus microalga were slightly higher than those standardized by EN14214, requiring that the biodiesel be mixed with antioxidants. © 2018, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Soil salinization is a major factor limiting crop growth and development in many areas. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is an important warm-season grass species used for biofuel production. The objective of this study was to investigate antioxidant metabolism, proline,and protein variation associated with alkali-salt tolerance among 30 switchgrass lines and identify metabolic markers for evaluating alkali-salt tolerance of switchgrass lines. The grass lines were transplanted into plastic pots containing fine sand. When the plants reached E5 developmental stage, they were subjected to either alkali-salt stress treatment (150 mM Na+ and pH of 9.5) or control (no alkali-salt stress) for 20 d. The 30 switchgrass lines differed in alkali-salt tolerance as determined by the level of leaf malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activity [(superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX)], proline and protein. Alkali-salt stress increased MDA, proline, SOD, reduced CAT activity, but its effect on protein and APX varied depending on lines. Wide variations in the five parameters existed among the 30 lines. In general, the lines with higher CAT activity and lower proline content under alkali-salt stress had less MDA, exhibiting better alkali-salt tolerance. Among the five parameters, CAT can be considered as valuable metabolic markers for assessment of switchgrass tolerance to alkali-salt stress. © 2018 Hu et al.

AB  - Landowners’ attitudes towards energy crops are a keystone for the fulfillment of the European Union objectives of energy production (electrical, thermal and biofuels) from biomass in the next years. Economic instruments play a fundamental role to increase the participation of the landowners in renewable energy schemes. A discrete choice experiment was conducted using a mail survey to 268 private forest landowners from the Andalusia region (southern Spain). The aim was to examine forest landowners’ willingness to implement afforestation schemes considering short rotation plantations based on woody energy crops (eucalyptus, paulownia and poplar) and traditional tree species (holm oak and pine). Results show that afforestation with holm oak is the preferred alternative followed by woody energy crops. According to the experiment results, the participation of about half of the Andalusian forest owners in a woody energy crops scheme would imply a public expenditure in incentives for this land use change of 265 million of euros, i.e. an unrealistic figure given the current institutional framework for renewables in Europe. Finally, it is shown that compensations to forest landowners are affected by the payment timeframe and that the discount rate implicitly used by landowners exceeds the 4% rate commonly used in forest economics literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flow cytometry is an indispensable method for valuable applications in numerous fields such as immunology, pathology, pharmacology, molecular biology, and marine biology. Optofluidic time-stretch microscopy is superior to conventional flow cytometry methods for its capability to acquire high-quality images of single cells at a high-throughput exceeding 10,000 cells per second. This makes it possible to extract copious information from cellular images for accurate cell detection and analysis with the assistance of machine learning. Optofluidic time-stretch microscopy has proven its effectivity in various applications, including microalga-based biofuel production, evaluation of thrombotic disorders, as well as drug screening and discovery. In this review, we discuss the principles and recent advances of optofluidic time-stretch microscopy. © 2018, The Optical Society of Japan.

AB  - Marginal land is considered promising for biomass production. However, understanding on biomass crop growth and total biofuel production from this land type is very limited. This study evaluated potential production of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) on marginal lands in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. A soil and water assessment tool model with detailed representation of marginal lands and their suitability for growth of the 2 grasses was setup. Marginal land was defined as cropland and grassland with land capability class from 3 to 8. All marginal lands were included as new land covers in the land use map and were preserved when HRUs were defined. The soil and water assessment tool model was calibrated for flow at 13 sites within the Upper Mississippi River Basin region at monthly scale. The predicted biomass by growing switchgrass and Miscanthus on marginal lands in the study area can produce up to 37% of the 132 × 109 L biofuel goal set by the 2010 Energy Independence and Security Act in the USA. The simulated flow was lower when marginal lands were converted to grow perennial bioenergy crops. The results from this study improved our understanding on growth of perennial crops on marginal land and their contributions to biofuel development. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Increasing energy demand, limited fossil fuel resources and climate change have prompted development of alternative sustainable and economical fuel resources such as crop-based bio-ethanol and biodiesel. However, there is concern over use of arable land that is used for food agriculture for creation of biofuel. Thus, there is a renewed interest in the use of microbes particularly microalgae for bio-fuel production. Microbes such as micro-algae and cyanobacteria that are used for biofuel production also produce other bioactive compounds under stressed conditions. Microbial agents used for biofuel production also produce bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, antiviral, anticoagulant, antioxidant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity. Because of importance of such high-value compounds in aquaculture and bioremediation, and the potential to reduce carbon emissions and energy security, the biofuels produced by microbial biotechnology might substitute the crop-based bioethanol and bio-diesel production. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Bioenergy crops have a secondary benefit if they increase soil organic C (SOC) stocks through capture and allocation below-ground. The effects of four genotypes of short-rotation coppice willow (Salix spp., ‘Terra Nova’ and ‘Tora’) and Miscanthus (M. × giganteus (‘Giganteus’) and M. sinensis (‘Sinensis’)) on roots, SOC and total nitrogen (TN) were quantified to test whether below-ground biomass controls SOC and TN dynamics. Soil cores were collected under (‘plant’) and between plants (‘gap’) in a field experiment on a temperate agricultural silty clay loam after 4 and 6 years’ management. Root density was greater under Miscanthus for plant (up to 15.5 kg m−3) compared with gap (up to 2.7 kg m−3), whereas willow had lower densities (up to 3.7 kg m−3). Over 2 years, SOC increased below 0.2 m depth from 7.1 to 8.5 kg m−3 and was greatest under Sinensis at 0–0.1 m depth (24.8 kg m−3). Miscanthus-derived SOC, based on stable isotope analysis, was greater under plant (11.6 kg m−3) than gap (3.1 kg m−3) for Sinensis. Estimated SOC stock change rates over the 2-year period to 1-m depth were 6.4 for Terra Nova, 7.4 for Tora, 3.1 for Giganteus and 8.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 for Sinensis. Rates of change of TN were much less. That SOC matched root mass down the profile, particularly under Miscanthus, indicated that perennial root systems are an important contributor. Willow and Miscanthus offer both biomass production and C sequestration when planted in arable soil. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Ghana experienced a surge in large-scale land acquisitions in the past decade spearheaded by the bioenergy crop jatropha. To accommodate such acquisitions, small and medium-sized land holdings were consolidated to develop large parcels of land that could accommodate large-scale investments. Chiefs have been an important player in these processes as they are supposed to be the custodians of land in Ghana. However, they often engage with such land acquisition processes in a counterproductive manner, deeply affecting their outcomes. Chiefs often act as the gatekeepers of large-scale land acquisitions, helping foreign donors/investors and the state steer the institutional landscape of land tenure, which is not only complicated but also prone to social conflicts. In order to unravel the exact roles that chiefs have played in such processes (and the motivations behind their actions) we adopt an agrarian political economy framework based on the five key questions: “who owns what”, “who does what”, “who gets what”, “who interacts with whom” and “participation by whom in what”. To answer these questions, we conduct interviews with chiefs, experts and local households around five collapsed jatropha plantations in Ghana. Our empirical analysis suggests that chiefs often went beyond their customary roles as land custodians, by occasionally acting as land owners/sellers, expropriators, negotiators, receivers of compensation, and sources of conflict. These roles are to an extent an outcome of the weak, undocumented and largely discretionary land administration system of Ghana, which allows chiefs benefit by bypassing both customary and statutory land laws. Chiefs were often motivated by expected economic gains for themselves at the expense of the communal interests. On some cases this unconstructive role catalysed the collapse of the jatropha investments. These suggest the need for deep land policy reforms within the land administration system of Ghana. While the recent adoption of guidelines for large-scale land acquisitions promoted by the government of Ghana is a good start, land policy reforms should go deeper. Further reforms would be needed to strengthen the current legislation in terms of harmonizing all land laws, as well as outlining explicit directives for land negotiations, compensation (including defining the rightful recipients of compensation) and the effective evaluation of large-scale land acquisitions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work describes the development and application of an ultrasonic-enhanced microwave-assisted extraction (UEMAE) followed by online solid phase extraction (SPE)–ultra–high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of 14 fluoroquinolones in cattle manure-based biogas residue (CMBBR). The UEMAE was performed using the mixed solution of sodium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, avoiding use of any organic solvent. The online SPE system employed two solid phase extraction columns in a parallel manner, and the extraction was performed by passing 1 mL of the extract through the column. Quantification was performed using standard spiked samples and structural analogue internal standard, which were indispensable to reduce the matrix effects. Validation parameters were performed and good linearity (R2 &gt; 0.99 in all cases) and precision (inter- and intra-day relative standard deviations were lower than 12.8%) were obtained. Limits of detection were as low as 0.021 ng ∙ g−1 and lower limits of quantification were 0.5 ng ∙ g−1 for all fluoroquinolones. The overall extraction recovery, which was the product of the UEMAE recovery and the online SPE recovery, was assessed for three concentration levels (0.8, 40 and 400 ng ∙ g−1) and acceptable values (74.3–99.3%) were found. As a part of the method validation, the developed method has been used to analyze real CMBBR samples. Nine fluoroquinolones were found in the concentration range of 0.9–74.6 ng ∙ g−1, while five were not detected in the samples. The results showed the method could be adapted for screening the presence or the final fate of fluoroquinolones during fermentation of animal waste. © 2018

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a highly productive perennial grass, has been recommended as one potential source for cellulosic biofuel feedstocks. Previous studies indicate that planting perennial grasses (e.g., switchgrass) in high-topographic-relief cropland waterway buffers can improve local environmental conditions and sustainability. The main advantages of this land management practice include (i) reducing soil erosion and improving water quality because switchgrass requires less tillage, fertilizers, and pesticides; and (ii) improving regional ecosystem services (e.g., improving water infiltration, minimizing drought and flood impacts on production, and serving as carbon sinks). In this study, we mapped high-topographic-relief cropland waterway buffers with high switchgrass productivity potential that may be suitable for switchgrass development in the eastern Great Plains (EGP). The US Geological Survey (USGS) Compound Topographic Index map, National Land Cover Database 2011, USGS irrigation map, and a switchgrass biomass productivity map derived from a previous study were used to identify the switchgrass potential areas. Results show that about 16 342 km2 (c. 1.3% of the total study area) of cropland waterway buffers in the EGP are potentially suitable for switchgrass development. The total annual estimated switchgrass biomass production for these suitable areas is approximately 15 million metric tons. Results from this study provide useful information on EGP areas with good cellulosic switchgrass biomass production potential and synergistic substantial potential for improvement of ecosystem services.

AB  - Replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass can contribute to the mitigation of global warming and the economic development of rural communities. This will require lignocellulosic biofuels to become price competitive with fossil fuels. Techno-economic analyses can provide insights into which parts of the biofuel production process need to be optimized to reduce cost or energy use. We used data obtained from a pilot biorefinery to model a commercial-scale biorefinery that processes lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, with a focus on the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP). The process utilizes a phosphoric acid-catalyzed pre-treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse followed by liquefaction and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (L+SScF) of hexose and pentose sugars by an engineered Escherichia coli strain. After validating a techno-economic model developed with the SuperPro Designer software for the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to ethanol by comparing it to a published Aspen Plus model, six different scenarios were modeled for sweet sorghum bagasse Under the most optimistic scenario, the ethanol can be produced at a cost close to the energy-equivalent price of gasoline. Aside from an increase in the price of gasoline, the gap between ethanol and gasoline prices could also be bridged by either a decrease in the cost of cellulolytic enzymes or development of value-added products from lignin. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Large-scale copper (Cu) mining activities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula produced millions of metric tons of mining wastes also known as stamp sands. The stamp sands containing high concentrations of Cu were disposed of into several lakes connected to the Lake Superior. Eventually, as aquatic organisms in these lakes started to exhibit toxicity symptoms, the stamp sands were dredged and discarded on the lake shores. Consequently, these areas turned into degraded, marginal lands and were collectively classified as a Torch Lake Superfund site by the US EPA. Due to the lack of vegetative cover, the Cu-rich stamp sands eroded into the lakes, affecting the aquatic life. To alleviate this issue, a sustainable restoration plan (SRP) was developed and tested in a greenhouse environment prior to field implementation. Cold-tolerant oilseed crops, camelina (Camelina sativa) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), were grown on compost-fertilized stamp sands, which reduced soil erosion by acting as a vegetative cap. Oilseed plants produced normal yield, demonstrating their potential utilization as biofuel feedstock. Prior to implementing the SRP in field-scale in the Torch Lake Superfund site, a public opinion survey of the local community was conducted to understand the views of residents. Door-to-door survey was performed in July–August 2015, which yielded a response rate of 68.1%. Results showed that residents were generally concerned with stamp sand erosion into the Torch Lake and were overwhelmingly supportive of the SRP, which would not only provide environmental benefits but could boost the local economy via biofuel production. To gauge the general environmental awareness of the respondents, the survey included questions on climate change. Most of the respondents acknowledged that climate change is real and anthropogenically mediated. Having college education and a relatively high annual household income showed a positive and significant correlation with climate change awareness. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date bibliometric view about the current life cycle assessment (LCA) for bioenergy. The social network analysis (SNA) method was applied to study total 2367 publications in this field. The results showed the high frequency keywords related with the “LCA” for bioenergy included three categories: (1) Bioenergy production, such as “Biodiesel” “Bioethanol” “Biogas” and “Biorefinery”; (2) Environmental problems, such as “Greenhouse gas” (GHG), “Environmental impact” “Climate change”; (3) Environmental target: “Sustainability”. This means that LCA methods have been widely used in assessing the environmental impact from various types of bioenergy production process. Specially, the “GHG” attracted more attention in this research area. According to the temporal trend of the high frequency keywords, “bioethanol” is the most significant hotspot keyword of implication LCA. However, it has become colder since 2011. The environmental performance of “biogas” and “land use” began to receive attention since 2015.The evolutionary co-words network showed that the boundary of hotspots became overlapped. We also found four clusters were identified from keywords networks, i.e. the biggest cluster Cluster (I) (central cluster node linkage was “Bioethanol-GHG”), followed by Cluster (II) (central cluster node linkage was “Biodiesel-Algae”), Cluster (III) (central cluster node linkage was “Biorefinery-Sustainability”) and Cluster (IV) (central cluster node linkage was “Biogas-Anaerobic digestion”). This cluster analysis also showed that the implication of LCA for the relationship between “bioethanol” and “GHG” is the most important hotspot research field. Although “biogas” is the smallest cluster now, it could be the next important hotspot of implication LCA for bioenergy. This study provides an effective approach to obtain a general knowledge of the LCA for bioenergy and supports a deeper understanding of research directions in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the effects of cropping practices on soil pore characteristics is important for determining soil productivity and ecosystem services. Objectives of the study were to compare differences in computed tomography (CT) measured soil pore parameters (number of macropores, macroporosity, area of the largest pore, circularity and fractal dimension) among cover crops (CC), no-cover crops (NCC), and biofuel crops [Miscanthus (M): Miscanthus x giganteus and switchgrass (SG): Panicum virgatum] and examine relationships between CT-measured pore parameters and soil hydraulic and thermal properties. Cover crops were Cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) and Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum subsp. arvense). Three replicates each of undisturbed soil cores were collected at two soil depths (0–10 and 10–20 cm) from each treatment using plexiglass cores measuring 76.2 mm diameter by 76.2 mm long. Ten scan images from each core were acquired using an X-ray CT scanner with 0.19 by 0.19 mm pixel resolution with 0.5 mm slice thickness and analyzed with Image-J. Soil under CC, NCC, M, and SG on average had 21, 14, 17, and 12 macropores on a 2500 mm2 area across all the depths. Soil under miscanthus had significantly greater macroporosity (0.049 m2 m− 2) and area for the largest pore (89.70 mm2) than other treatments. The cover crop treatment had approximately 50%, 28%, and 75% greater number of macropores than NCC, M, and SG treatments. Bulk density (Db) of soil was 13% lower in M than the NCC. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) values were positively correlated with most CT-measured pore parameters. In contrast, Db was negatively correlated with most CT-measured pore parameters (circularity and fractal dimension were positively correlated). While the circularity values were correlated positively with Db and thermal conductivity (λ), the fractal dimension was correlated positively with volumetric heat capacity (Cv). The study illustrates that M and CC treatments can improve soil pore parameters. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The introduction of a market for agricultural biomass to feed large-scale second generation bioenergy (cellulosic ethanol) or other bio-products has positive implications for food producers and bio-product industries but may impact soil quality. In order to assess the potential impact on Canada's agricultural lands, we integrated land use and soil capability maps and land management information to introduce several scenarios of crop residue harvest rates and land use conversions. The implications for soil quality, as represented by soil cover, were assessed for each scenario. The results showed that average soil cover at the national scale would decrease by more than 1 day if 40% of annual crop residues (by mass) were harvested, but the negative impacts could be resolved by increased adoption of conservation tillage methods. Additional biomass could be produced by converting low quality agricultural land to perennial biomass crops, but this would result in increased intensity of food production on high quality land. The total area of high and low quality land within the agricultural region of Canada is roughly equal, and the amount of high quality land currently used for perennial crops is about the same as the amount of low quality land used for annual crops, and ‘balancing’ production with capability would result in a net increase in both food and biofuel feedstock, with little impact to soil quality. About 6.73 M ha of high quality land is covered by forest, shrub and grass, and conversion of this land to agricultural production would have a negative impact on soil quality. The study indicates considerable potential for production of both food and biofuel feedstock on Canada's agricultural lands through careful land use planning. Our analysis using soil cover as an indicator of environmental sustainability also indicates that land use planning should be cautious to prevent soil degradation. Particularly, regional variability of land use and soil capability distribution requires region specific land use policy for sustainable biofuel feedstock production. © 2018

AB  - A major critique of large scale biomass production is the land competition between food and energy crops. A commonly suggested solution is to limit energy crop production to marginal lands. Physical marginality is often used when discussing marginal lands. However, as important is the socioeconomic marginality. This research fills this gap by evaluating willingness to supply bioenergy crops for landowners who have marginal lands. We conducted contingent valuation surveys at study sites with three model crops: switchgrass, miscanthus and willow. Random utility theory is applied to evaluate factors influencing decision maker's choice to plant energy crops. The results indicate that landowners who own marginal lands are more likely to plant energy crops and they require a lower willingness to accept price compared with landowners who do not have marginal lands. At the same time, we noticed that landowners are unfamiliar with these new crops. Economic concerns are the top reasons preventing them from planting energy crops. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulosic biorefineries require a stable supply of low-cost feedstock. In this paper we conduct a financial analysis of hybrid poplar as a purpose grown biofuel feedstock. We analyzed growth rates and costs for producing hybrid poplar in the Peace River region of western Canada – an area previously identified as a preferred location for a large biorefinery. We estimated financial returns for two hybrid poplar management systems: (i) a single-stem system that involves the planting and harvesting of individual trees according to optimal economic rotations of 20–26 years, and (ii) a coppice (multi-stem) system that involves multiple harvests of new shoots that sprout from stumps following harvest every 3–4 years. Results suggest that the coppice system is financially inferior (with estimated costs of 202 $ Mg−1) to the single-stem system (with estimated costs of 125 $ Mg−1), largely due to the cost of establishing the high density coppice plantations. But even the single-stem production system does not appear to be financially feasible given the current environment of high land prices and low biomass prices. In contrast to estimated costs of growing poplar, current biomass prices for agriculture and forestry residues are approximately 50 $ Mg−1. However, even though purpose grown energy crops are more expensive than residues, they could be valuable in supplementing a biorefinery's feedstock supply during years when residue yields are low. If governments in Canada wish to encourage renewable energy from cellulosic feedstock, then current economic conditions suggest that subsidies aimed at biomass production are likely required. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is a wide-spread resource that have been studied for decades to realize energy utilization is a renewable and sustainable way. It was reported that there is a synergistic interaction during co-pyrolysis of different biomasses such as algae and terrestrial plants, but the mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the heterogeneous interactions between rice husk (HU) volatile and Enteromorpha clathrate (EN) bio-coke during co-pyrolysis using a sectional tubular pyrolysis furnace. Physical and chemical properties of the interacted bio-coke were studied using N2 isothermal absorption method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the obtained bio-oil was also characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The changes in specific surface area of the pyrolyzed bio-coke indicated the significant effect of HU volatiles on EN bio-coke microstructure. After flew through by rice husk volatiles, the adsorption capacity of EN bio-coke improved. Owing to the free radicals in HU volatile, polycondensation and aromatization reactions were enhanced in EN bio-coke resulting in aromatic compounds with higher cyclization of nitrogenous compounds. On the other hand, EN bio-coke participated the decomposition of carbohydrates in HU volatiles to increase the content of aldehydes and furans in the produced bio-oil. In addition, the significant Maillard reaction accelerated the production of ketones and phenols in the bio-oil and reduced the content of N in EN bio-coke at 400 °C. The present study confirmed that there is a significant interaction between seaweed bio-coke and rice husk volatiles during co-pyrolysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work mainly aims to explore the potential of synergistic use of cadmium-resistant bacteria and Napier grass to promote cadmium phytoremediation and the possibility of using the harvested Napier grass for biomass fuel. A pot experiment was carried out by transplanting Napier grass with and without bacterial inoculation in cadmium contaminated soil for 6 months. The results found that Micrococcus sp. significantly promoted the shoot biomass of Napier grass but not the root biomass. Micrococcus sp. and Arthrobacter sp. stimulated cadmium accumulation in the root and the shoot. Cadmium was retained more in the root than the shoot at all plantation periods. The maximum cadmium content in a whole plant was found in plants inoculated with Micrococcus sp. at six months. The values of phytoextraction coefficient and bioaccumulation factor in plants with bacterial inoculation were higher than those in the uninoculated control. Translocation factor was very low. Napier grass could be considered as a candidate plant for cadmium phytostabilization. The calorific value of Napier grass transplanted in cadmium-contaminated soil was similar to that in uncontaminated soil, but cadmium was still retained in the ash and some was emitted into the air. In conclusion, these cadmium-resistant bacteria enhanced the performance of Napier grass on cadmium phytoremediation. The harvested Napier grass can be used for biomass fuel under controlled ash and air emission from the combustion process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - India is developing at a faster rate in the current era. It needs usage of large amount fuel and electricity, which leads to increase the import of crude oil and huge greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, air pollution in the metro cities is increased. To reduce these emissions, alternative fuel is to be used which emits less GHG emissions in the atmosphere. This review highlights the potential materials such as sweet Sorghum, Neem seed, Mahua seed, Sugarcane molasses, Jatropha etc. for producing biofuels. This article also discusses the promising blends and their effects on GHG emissions. This will helps India to sustainably develop its economy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The economic and environmental performance of microalgal processes has been widely analyzed in recent years. However, few studies propose an integrated process-based approach to evaluate economic and environmental indicators simultaneously. Biodiesel is usually the single product and the effect of environmental benefits of co-products obtained in the process is rarely discussed. In addition, there is wide variation of the results due to inherent variability of some parameters as well as different assumptions in the models and limited knowledge about the processes. In this study, two standardized models were combined to provide an integrated simulation tool allowing the simultaneous estimation of economic and environmental indicators from a unique set of input parameters. First, a harmonized scenario was assessed to validate the joint environmental and techno-economic model. The findings were consistent with previous assessments. In a second stage, a Monte Carlo simulation was applied to evaluate the influence of variable and uncertain parameters in the model output, as well as the correlations between the different outputs. The simulation showed a high probability of achieving favorable environmental performance for the evaluated categories and a minimum selling price ranging from $11 gal− 1 to $106 gal− 1. Greenhouse gas emissions and minimum selling price were found to have the strongest positive linear relationship, whereas eutrophication showed weak correlations with the other indicators (namely greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative energy demand and minimum selling price). Process parameters (especially biomass productivity and lipid content) were the main source of variation, whereas uncertainties linked to the characterization methods and economic parameters had limited effect on the results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large influx of excess nutrients into sub-tropical brackish-water habitats is expected to radically affect the algal populations in the heavily populated Sunderbans brackish-water ecozone. Twelve selected brackish-water sites in the Indian Sunderbans were surveyed to investigate the growth performance of mat-forming dominant algal/cyanobacterial macrophytes and their potential for carbon (C) sequestration into hydrologic and pedologic pools. The mats were dominated by particular taxa at different seasons related to physico-chemical properties of the wetland habitats. Different environmental variables and biomass productivity parameters were measured on fortnightly basis to assess the carbon cycle related to dominant algal blooms of the study area. The dominating species at the twelve sites included seven genera (Spirogyra, Rhizoclonium, Ulva, Cladophora, Pithophora, Chaetomorpha) belonging to Chlorophyta, three genera (Polysiphonia, Gracilaria, Catenella) belonging to Rhodophyta and Lyngbya majuscula from cyanobacteria. Multivariate statistical methods indicated that nutrient availability, particularly dissolved P concentration and N:P ratio in the water column, along with salinity in the water column mainly affected biomass yield and C sequestration of mat-forming macrophytes and OC input into water column. However, OC contents of underlying muck proved to be very stable, though small influxes of OC occurred at each bloom. High biomass yields (34–3107 g/m2) of the dominant mat components accumulated enormous stocks of OC, very little of which reaches the pedologic pool. This transient biomass might be utilized as dietary supplements or biofuel feedstocks. Availability of important dietary fatty acids in Spirogyra punctulata, Gracilaria sp., Polysiphonia mollis, Rhizoclonium riparium, R. tortuosum, Pithophora oedogonia and Ulva lactuca was considered as suitability of these species as nutraceuticals. Fatty acid compositions of L. majuscula, Catenella repens, R. tortuosum and Cladophora crystallina were estimated to be applicable for producing biodiesel for usage in sub-tropical climates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Latin American and Caribbean's (LAC) external dependency on fossil fuels and the pursuit for renewable energy leads to the need for a strategy to afford a cleaner and reliable domestic energy supply. Sugarcane presents high photosynthetic efficiency and it is a well-spread crop in LAC. Our study aims to explore the potential of different approaches of modern energy production from sugarcane, at a national level, and its implication to the environmental aspects. We found that Guatemala, Nicaragua and Cuba would be able to replace 10% of the gasoline and about 2–3% of the diesel consumption by only using the current molasses. With a slight expansion on sugarcane production, Bolivia can replace 20% of the gasoline and diesel, besides providing surplus ethanol for exportation or other purposes. With a minor investment, bagasse may enlarge the electricity access in many countries whereas in other may represent an alternative to replace fossil fuel sources. We also found relevant potential on reducing the GHG emissions specially in Bolivia, Paraguay and Nicaragua. However, the implementation of such strategies must be supported by appropriate policies to ensure competitive prices, overcome opportunity costs, and stimulate investments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in land-based investments for food, feed, fuel, and fibre, driven by the volatility in commodity prices, economic growth of emerging economies, policy drivers of biofuel demand, and investor strategies in the wake of the global economic crisis. This interest has led to a surge of foreign and local investments in developing countries, where land can be obtained at a lower cost, and it has led to fears of land grabbing. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying the determinants of large-scale land acquisitions in Africa and employ a unilateral beta regression to explore the link between investments and a number of indicators related to both land supply and institutional features. The results on the resource-seeking nature of investments and the impact of the land governance indicators are mostly in line with the findings of other studies. On the contrary, the results on forest land being a driver for large-scale land acquisitions, especially from international investors in Africa, differ from previous findings and indicate commercial pressure on African forests that may lead to accelerating degradation and deforestation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy crops are an important renewable source for energy production in future. To ensure high yields of crops, N fertilization is a common practice. However, knowledge on environmental impacts of bioenergy plantations, particularly in systems involving trees, and the effects of N fertilization is scarce. We studied the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC), which negatively affect the environment by contributing to tropospheric ozone and aerosols formation, from Miscanthus and willow plantations. Particularly, we aimed at quantifying the effect of N fertilization on VOC emission. For this purpose, we determined plant traits, photosynthetic gas exchange and VOC emission rates of the two systems as affected by N fertilization (0 and 80 kg ha−1 yr−1). Additionally, we used a modelling approach to simulate (i) the annual VOC emission rates as well as (ii) the OH. reactivity resulting from individual VOC emitted. Total VOC emissions from Salix was 1.5- and 2.5-fold higher compared to Miscanthus in non-fertilized and fertilized plantations, respectively. Isoprene was the dominating VOC in Salix (80–130 μg g−1 DW h−1), whereas it was negligible in Miscanthus. We identified twenty-eight VOC compounds, which were released by Miscanthus with the green leaf volatile hexanal as well as dimethyl benzene, dihydrofuranone, phenol, and decanal as the dominant volatiles. The pattern of VOC released from this species clearly differed to the pattern emitted by Salix. OH. reactivity from VOC released by Salix was ca. 8-times higher than that of Miscanthus. N fertilization enhanced stand level VOC emissions, mainly by promoting the leaf area index and only marginally by enhancing the basal emission capacity of leaves. Considering the higher productivity of fertilized Miscanthus compared to Salix together with the considerably lower OH. reactivity per weight unit of biomass produced, qualified the C4-perennial grass Miscanthus as a superior source of future bioenergy production. N fertilization strongly increased VOC emission of Salix but not of Miscanthus at the plantation level, making the latter a superior source of future bioenergy production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To meet the increasing food and biofuel demand, the Midwestern United States has become one of the most intensively human-disturbed hotspots, characterized by widespread cropland expansion and various management practices. However, the role of human activities in the carbon (C) cycling across managed landscape remains far from certain. In this study, based on state- and national census, field experiments, and model simulation, we comprehensively examined long-term carbon storage change in response to land use and cover change (LUCC) and agricultural management in the Midwest from 1850 to 2015. We also quantified estimation uncertainties related to key parameter values. Model estimation showed LUCC led to a reduction of 1.35 Pg (with a range of 1.3–1.4 Pg) in vegetation C pool of the Midwest, yet agricultural management barely affected vegetation C change. In comparison, LUCC reduced SOC by 4.5 Pg (3.1 to 6.2 Pg), while agricultural management practices increased SOC stock by 0.9 Pg. Moreover, we found 45% of the study area was characterized by continuously decreasing SOC caused by LUCC, and SOC in 13% and 31% of the area was fully and partially recovered, respectively, since 1850. Agricultural management was estimated to increase the area of full recovery and partial recovery by 8.5% and 1.1%. Our results imply that LUCC plays an essential role in regional C balance, and more importantly, sustainable land management can be beneficial for strengthening C sequestration of the agroecosystems in the Midwestern US, which may serve as an important contributor to C sinks in the US. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Harvesting corn stover for biofuel production may decrease soil organic carbon (SOC) and increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Adding additional organic matter into soil or reducing tillage intensity, however, could potentially offset this SOC loss. Here, using SOC and life cycle analysis (LCA) models, we evaluated the impacts of land management change (LMC), that is, stover removal, organic matter addition, and tillage on spatially explicit SOC level and biofuels’ overall life cycle GHG emissions in US corn–soybean production systems. Results indicate that under conventional tillage (CT), 30% stover removal (dry weight) may reduce baseline SOC by 0.04 t C ha−1yr−1 over a 30-year simulation period. Growing a cover crop during the fallow season or applying manure, on the other hand, could add to SOC and further reduce biofuels’ life cycle GHG emissions. With 30% stover removal in a CT system, cover crop and manure application can increase SOC at the national level by about 0.06 and 0.02 t C ha−1yr−1, respectively, compared to baseline cases without such measures. With contributions from this SOC increase, the life cycle GHG emissions for stover ethanol are more than 80% lower than those of gasoline, exceeding the US Renewable Fuel Standard mandate of 60% emissions reduction in cellulosic biofuels. Reducing tillage intensity while removing stover could also limit SOC loss or lead to SOC gain, which would lower stover ethanol life cycle GHG emissions to near or under the mandated 60% reduction. Without these organic matter inputs or reduced tillage intensity, however, the emissions will not meet this mandate. More efforts are still required to further identify key practical LMCs, improve SOC modeling, and accounting for LMCs in biofuel LCAs that incorporate stover removal. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The goal of this study was to integrate a crop model, DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition), with life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis models using a GIS-based integrated platform, ENVISION. The integrated model enables LCA practitioners to conduct integrated economic analysis and LCA on a regional scale while capturing the variability of soil emissions due to variation in regional factors during production of crops and biofuel feedstocks. In order to evaluate the integrated model, the corn-soybean cropping system in Eagle Creek Watershed, Indiana was studied and the integrated model was used to first model the soil emissions and then conduct the LCA as well as economic analysis. The results showed that the variation in soil emissions due to variation in weather is high causing some locations to be carbon sink in some years and source of CO2 in other years. In order to test the model under different scenarios, two tillage scenarios were defined: 1) conventional tillage (CT) and 2) no tillage (NT) and analyzed with the model. The overall GHG emissions for the corn-soybean cropping system was simulated and results showed that the NT scenario resulted in lower soil GHG emissions compared to CT scenario. Moreover, global warming potential (GWP) of corn ethanol from well to pump varied between 57 and 92 g CO2-eq./MJ while GWP under the NT system was lower than that of the CT system. The cost break-even point was calculated as $3612.5/ha in a two year corn-soybean cropping system and the results showed that under low and medium prices for corn and soybean most of the farms did not meet the break-even point. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and global value chain (GVC) frameworks to analyse the drivers and trajectories of foreign private investment in biofuel production in Ghana. It is based on a narrative of the evolution of a niche for jatropha production in Ghana in the period 1995–2016 including company case studies. The factors analysed relating to MLP are alignment of expectations, network formation, and learning and knowledge sharing, and those relating to GVC are chain structure, governance, ownership, and access to land and capital. High entry barriers for creating a new agriculture-based value chain for global biofuel markets, i.e. high volume requirements, high capital needs, and market risks contributed to the collapse of the jatropha sector in Ghana. A low level of learning and knowledge sharing between jatropha actors in Ghana, alongside weak public R&D support, reduced access to technical and managerial information. Confirming previous GVC research on biofuels, policy and NGOs had a stronger influence on the jatropha value chain than in typical agricultural chains. Moreover, global drivers and the strategies and capabilities of foreign investors can strongly influence the development of a new biofuel value chain in a developing country. The latter points complement previous research on jatropha, which highlights politico- economic factors such as land tenure, regional and local power relations, and the interests of donors and NGOs. The study exemplifies a non- evolutionary niche development that goes beyond the European experiences of industrial niche development on which the MLP framework was first established. The importance of investors and policy at different levels of the value chain illustrate the synergies in combining the MLP and GVC frameworks in research on energy transitions in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: A kind of mesoporous Al–Mo mixed oxides as solid acid catalysts was designed and prepared through a facile and low-cost approach using stearic acid as a soft modifier, and investigated by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, fourier transform infrared spectra, N2 adsorption–desorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption and scanning electron microscopy. By using this catalyst, an environmentally benign process for esterification of free-fatty acids in non-edible Euphorbia lathyris crude oil with methanol was developed. It was shown that the activity of the catalysts for the esterification reaction is closely related to their mesoporous structures, surface area and acid properties. The Al–Mo solid acid catalyst exhibited an optimal esterification performance with 80.9% esterification efficiency under the optimum synthesis conditions. Moreover, the conversion remained over 73.2% after the catalyst being used for three times. These results showed that the catalysts have promising viability in esterification for biodiesel production in industry. Graphical Abstract: Mesoporous Al–Mo oxides catalysts were prepared via a facile and low-cost modified approach and exhibited excellent catalytic activity and reusability in esterification reaction of high value acid non-edible oil and methanol. This material has great potential in the future production of biofuels used as the solid acid catalyst. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biofuel production systems used hitherto have often been marred by controversies such as food versus fuel and the failure of Jatropha plantations. Biofuel Agroforestry Systems have the potential to address these concerns. This paper analyses the tree borne non-edible oilseed production benefits, generated by planting number multipurpose trees grown on the bunds and borders of agricultural fields including marginal and degraded lands known as Smallholder Biofuel Agroforestry System. It considers two different strategies (strategy 1 and 2) for both Smallholder and Large-holder Farmers for analysis. In each case, the two strategies differ in terms of the magnitude of investment required; the operational practices required and the net incremental benefit potential at the farm level. The tree species being used are Pongamia (Millettia pinnata), Simarouba (Simarouba glauca), Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and Neem (Azadirachta indica). The aim of this study is to understand and analyse the socio-economic impact of Karnataka State Bioenergy Development Board’s (KSBDB) Programme on Biofuel Agroforestry System on Smallholder and Large-holder Farmers. Field interviews and corresponding economic modelling analysis shows that the Programme has potential to deliver a small incremental income to Smallholder Farmers, especially during the ‘lean’ non-harvesting period of the year. The sensitivity analysis around the seed and end-product prices shows that Biofuel Agroforestry System has a potential to boost income levels of Smallholder Farmers by a significant amount—up to 60% over starting income in a time period of 25 years. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: Glycoside hydrolases of the GH9 family encode cellulases that predominantly function as endoglucanases and have wide applications in the food, paper, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries. The partitioning of plant GH9 endoglucanases, into classes A, B, and C, is based on the differential presence of transmembrane, signal peptide, and the carbohydrate binding module (CBM49). There is considerable debate on the distribution and the functions of these enzymes which may vary in different organisms. In light of these findings we examined the origin, emergence, and subsequent divergence of plant GH9 endoglucanases, with an emphasis on elucidating the role of CBM49 in the digestion of crystalline cellulose by class C members. Results: Since, the digestion of crystalline cellulose mandates the presence of a well-defined set of aromatic and polar amino acids and/or an attributable domain that can mediate this conversion, we hypothesize a vertical mode of transfer of genes that could favour the emergence of class C like GH9 endoglucanase activity in land plants from potentially ancestral non plant taxa. We demonstrated the concomitant occurrence of a GH9 domain with CBM49 and other homologous carbohydrate binding modules, in putative endoglucanase sequences from several non-plant taxa. In the absence of comparable full length CBMs, we have characterized several low strength patterns that could approximate the CBM49, thereby, extending support for digestion of crystalline cellulose to other segments of the protein. We also provide data suggestive of the ancestral role of putative class C GH9 endoglucanases in land plants, which includes detailed phylogenetics and the presence and subsequent loss of CBM49, transmembrane, and signal peptide regions in certain populations of early land plants. These findings suggest that classes A and B of modern vascular land plants may have emerged by diverging directly from CBM49 encompassing putative class C enzymes. Conclusion: Our detailed phylogenetic and bioinformatics analysis of putative GH9 endoglucanase sequences across major taxa suggests that plant class C enzymes, despite their recent discovery, could function as the last common ancestor of classes A and B. Additionally, research into their ability to digest or inter-convert crystalline and amorphous forms of cellulose could make them lucrative candidates for engineering biofuel feedstock. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In this research study, biodiesel has been successfully produced from vegetable seed oil of an indigenous plant Salvadora persica L. that meets the international biodiesel standard (ASTM D6751). The biodiesel yield was 1.57 g/5 g (31.4% by weight) and the in-situ transesterification ester content conversion was 97.7%. The produced biodiesel density was 0.894 g/mL, its kinematic viscosity 5.51 mm2/s, HHV 35.26 MJ/kg, flash point 210°C, cetane no. 61, and sulfur content 0.0844%. Thermal analysis of the biodiesel showed that 97% weight loss was achieved at 595°C with total oxidation of the biodiesel. The production energy efficiency was 0.46% with a lab scale setup, assuming the volume fraction ratio (volume of the sample/total volume of the equipment used). The results revealed that single-step in-situ transesterification method is suitable for the production of biodiesel from S. persica seed oil. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Some lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks occur in Mediterranean Countries. They are still largely unexploited and cause considerable problems due to the lack of cost-effective harvesting, storage and disposal technologies. Recent studies found that some basidiomycetous yeasts are able to accumulate high amount of intracellular lipids for biorefinery processes (i.e., biofuels and biochemicals). Accordingly, the above biomass feedstocks could be used as carbon sources (after their pre-treatment and hydrolysis) for lipid accumulation by oleaginous yeasts. Results: Cardoon stalks, stranded driftwood and olive tree pruning residues were pre-treated with steam-explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis for releasing free mono- and oligosaccharides. Lipid accumulation tests were performed at two temperatures (20 and 25 °C) using Leucosporidium creatinivorum DBVPG 4794, Naganishia adeliensis DBVPG 5195 and Solicoccozyma terricola DBVPG 5870. S. terricola grown on cardoon stalks at 20 °C exhibited the highest lipid production (13.20 g/l), a lipid yield (28.95%) close to the maximum theoretical value and a lipid composition similar to that found in palm oil. On the contrary, N. adeliensis grown on stranded driftwood and olive tree pruning residues exhibited a lipid composition similar to those of olive and almonds oils. A predictive evaluation of the physical properties of the potential biodiesel obtainable by lipids produced by tested yeast strains has been reported and discussed. Conclusions: Lipids produced by some basidiomycetous yeasts grown on Mediterranean lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks could be used as supplementary sources of oils for producing biofuels and biochemicals. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This article optimizes the design and configuration of algal biofuel supply chain networks (SCN) under economic and environmental objectives. Minimization of the total supply chain cost and the total life cycle greenhouse gas emission are the economic and environmental objectives, respectively. The SCN has been modeled by a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming approach which incorporates multiple production pathways and time periods, seasonality factors, water evaporation, recycling opportunities, and other major traits of the algal biofuel SCN. The model determines the optimal strategic and tactical level decisions of all SCN echelons. A fuzzy solution-based ε-constraint method has been utilized to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions that illustrate the trade-off between economic and environmental objectives. The performance of the model has been assessed in a case study carried out in seven states of the U.S which intends to develop the algal biofuel SCN from the year 2018 to the year 2024. Essential information with regard to the future of different technological pathways, relative importance of various supply chain factors, and sensitivity analysis has been discussed with respect to the case study results. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Constructed wetlands, which are designed ecosystems that consist of substrates, plants and microorganisms, have been used as an alternative clean technology to treat wastewater. However, greenhouse gas emission in constructed wetlands is still an accompanying problem. Finding a cleaner way to mitigate the net global warming potential while maintaining nitrogen removal efficiency has received increasing attention in recent years. High plant diversity has been found to increase nitrogen removal efficiency, but its effect on net global warming potential is not well understood. In this study, four species richness levels (1, 2, 3 and 4) were assembled in microcosms simulating constructed wetlands. The goal of this work is to explore the effects of plant diversity (species richness and identity) on the net global warming potential integrating multiple functions, including carbon sequestration in substrate, carbon dioxide emission mitigation by aboveground biomass converted to biofuel, and non-carbon dioxide (methane and nitrous oxide) emissions. Results showed that: (1) increasing species richness reduced the global warming potential based on carbon sequestration and carbon dioxide emission mitigation while increasing the global warming potential of non-carbon dioxide emissions of the microcosms; (2) increasing species richness mitigated the overall global warming potential due to the greater role of carbon sequestration and carbon dioxide emission mitigation; and (3) the presence of Rumex japonicus or Oenanthe javanica decreased the overall global warming potential of the microcosms. This study concluded that assembling communities with high plant species richness and several specific species instead of monocultures are more effective and cleaner for mitigating global warming potential while maintaining the efficiency of nitrogen removal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The excessive blooming of green filamentous macroalgae is a global problem due to their unwanted presence in freshwater, lakes, nursery garden and stagnant waters. An attractive solution is to use macroalgae as a biofuel feedstock. In this work, the macroalgae studied was the Chaetomorpha cf. gracilis. The macroalgae oil extraction was accomplished using Soxhlet method obtaining a yield of 1.85%. The gas chromatography analysis showed higher unsaturated fatty acids (56.14%) compared to saturated fatty acids (35.18%), highlighting the content of oleic acid, 27.89%. The kinematic viscosity and density were 0.826 mm2/s and 699.6 kg/m3, respectively. The heating value, crystallization temperature and elemental composition showed higher values than other algae oils. Nevertheless, the nitrogen content was similar to L.digitata macroalgae. The analysis conducted on the net energy ratio for the oil extraction process showed that the Chaetomorpha macroalgae oil might represent an attractive alternative for liquid biofuel production. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this paper we apply a model of technological diffusion, Future Technology Transformations in the Transport Sector (FTT: Transport), linked to the E3ME macroeconomic model, to study possible future technological transitions in personal passenger transport in four East Asian countries. We assess how targeted policies could impact on these transitions by defining four scenarios based on policies that aim to reduce emissions from transport. For each country we find that an integrated approach of tax incentives, subsidies, regulations (fuel economy efficiency), kick-start programs and biofuel programs yield the most significant emission reductions because, when combined, they accelerate effectively the diffusion of electric vehicles in the region. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A two-stage continuous fermentative hydrogen and methane co-production using macro-algae (Laminaria digitata) and micro-algae (Arthrospira platensis) at a C/N ratio of 20 was established. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of first-stage H2 reactor was 4 days. The highest specific hydrogen yield of 55.3 mL/g volatile solids (VS) was obtained at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 6.0 gVS/L/d. In the second-stage CH4 reactor at a short HRT of 12 days, a specific methane yield of 245.0 mL/gVS was achieved at a corresponding OLR of 2.0 gVS/L/d. At these loading rates, the two-stage continuous system offered process stability and effected an energy yield of 9.4 kJ/gVS, equivalent to 77.7% of that in an idealised batch system. However, further increases in OLR led to reduced hydrogen and methane yields in both reactors. The process was compared to a one-stage anaerobic co-digestion of algal mixtures at an HRT of 16 days. A remarkably high salinity level of 13.3 g/kg was recorded and volatile fatty acid accumulations were encountered in the one-stage CH4 reactor. The two-stage system offered better performances in both energy return and process stability. The gross energy potential of the advanced gaseous biofuels from this algal mixture may reach 213 GJ/ha/yr. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Questions regarding the net effect of biofuels on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have been difficult to resolve because of methodological uncertainties. One method of choice is lifecycle assessment (LCA), which takes a fuel product system as its object of analysis. LCA uses a static system model, with carbon flows averaged over a defined "lifecycle". Although it may evaluate some carbon stock changes, the LCA convention of treating biogenic CO2 emissions as fully offset by the carbon embodied in a biofuel's feedstock renders its results independent of the dominant portion of carbon uptake on the land from which the feedstock is sourced. An application of material flow analysis termed annual basis carbon (ABC) accounting captures system dynamics and is fully sensitive to changes in carbon uptake. This paper compares the LCA and ABC methods, and contrasts their respective results for a case study of real-world biofuel production. It highlights the large impact of baseline carbon uptake, which can affect the sign of the results from either a likely decrease or a likely increase in net CO2 emissions even before considering economically-induced effects. Implications include the need for further methodological work, new program-scale model development, an empirical re-analysis of biofuel systems, and a reconsideration of existing public policies and research priorities. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This research combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to determine feedstock supply, preprocessing facility, and biorefinery locations at a highly resolved spatial scale with the objective of meeting a large-scale annual biofuel production and demand goal for Tennessee, USA. Simultaneous determination of this supply chain network using MIP is computationally expensive. Memory limitation of typical personal computers constrain the network problem. High Performance Computing environments may require days to solve, and without any assurance of a feasible solution. This paper proposes a two-stage optimization procedure to overcome these computational challenges while maintaining theoretical consistency with conventional firm location theory paradigms. The two-stage procedure assumes that firms first identify biorefinery locations with comparative advantage in terms of supplying biomass. Step two entails determining if costs can be lowered with the addition of preprocessing facilities, and their optimal location relative to the biorefinery sites. In contrast, a single step optimization procedure siting multiple biorefineries and concomitantly preprocessing units and biomass supply areas assumes a different strategy for a single firm. Results suggest that the two-stage optimization approach is able to identify a feasible solution of multiple feedstock areas, feedstock preprocessing and fuel production locations using high-resolution spatial layers over a relatively large geographic region in a fraction of the computer resources required to solve a single, simultaneous location problem. The optimal supply chain network solutions generated from the two-stage and single simultaneous approaches are different. The absolute difference in the smaller scaled models’ objective values is less than 1%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We examined relative changes in soil C pools shortly after the establishment of six perennial and two annual bioenergy cropping systems that differed in diversity (monoculture vs. polyculture). Perennial systems included two monocultures (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum; and miscanthus, Miscanthus × giganteus) and four polycultures including hybrid poplar (Populus sp.) + herbaceous understory; mixed native grasses, successional vegetation, and restored prairie. Two annual systems included no-till continuous corn (Zea mays) and rotational corn (corn-soybean (Glycine max)-canola (Brassica napus)). Each crop was planted in a full factorial design at both a moderate fertility Alfisol and a high fertility Mollisol site. Relative differences in active, slow, and passive C pools in surface soils, where C changes are most likely to be detected early, were evaluated with 322-day laboratory incubations followed by acid hydrolysis to infer different pools from exponential decay curves. Five years post-establishment, active C pools under perennial polycultures at the Alfisol site were up to twice those under annual and perennial monocultures, and followed the order hybrid poplars (696 ± 216 μg C g− 1 soil, n = 5 replicate blocks) ≈ native grasses (656 ± 155) ≈ restored prairie (638 ± 44) &gt; early successional (500 ± 54) ≫ continuous corn (237 ± 68) ≈ rotational corn (180 ± n.a.). Active C pools in perennial monocultures were similar to those in continuous corn: switchgrass (274 ± 29) ≈ miscanthus (299 ± 9). In contrast, differences in active C pools among crops at the more fertile Mollisol site were not detectable except for greater pools in the restored prairie and rotational corn systems. At both sites, slow and passive C pools differed little among systems except that slow pools were greater in the poplar system. That diversity rather than perenniality itself led to greater active C pools suggests that polycultures might be used to accelerate soil C accumulation in bioenergy and other perennial cropping systems. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Background: Bio-jet fuels are emerging as a valuable alternative to petroleum-based fuels for their potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel dependence. In this study, residual woody biomass from slash piles in the U.S. Pacific Northwest is used as a feedstock to produce iso-paraffinic kerosene, through the production of sugar and subsequent patented proprietary fermentation and upgrading. To enhance the economic viability and reduce the environmental impacts of iso-paraffinic kerosene, two co-products, activated carbon and lignosulfonate, are simultaneously produced within the same bio-refinery. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed for the residual woody biomass-based bio-jet fuel and compared against the cradle-to-grave LCA of petroleum-based jet fuel. This paper also discusses the differences in the environmental impacts of the residual biomass-based bio-jet fuel using two different approaches, mass allocation and system expansion, to partition the impacts between the bio-fuel and the co-products, which are produced in the bio-refinery. Results: The environmental assessment of biomass-based bio-jet fuel reveals an improvement along most critical environmental criteria, as compared to its petroleum-based counterpart. However, the results present significant differences in the environmental impact of biomass-based bio-jet fuel, based on the partitioning method adopted. The mass allocation approach shows a greater improvement along most of the environmental criteria, as compared to the system expansion approach. However, independent of the partitioning approach, the results of this study reveal that more than the EISA mandated 60% reduction in the global warming potential could be achieved by substituting petroleum-based jet fuel with residual woody biomass-based jet fuel. Converting residual woody biomass from slash piles into bio-jet fuel presents the additional benefit of avoiding the impacts of slash pile burning in the forest, which results in a net negative impact on 'Carcinogenics' and 'Respiratory effects', and substantial reduction in the 'Smog' and 'Ecotoxicity' impacts. The production of woody biomass-based bio-jet fuel, however, did not show any significant improvement in the 'Acidification' and 'Eutrophication' impact categories. Conclusions: The study reveals that residual woody biomass recovered from slash piles represents a more sustainable alternative to petroleum for the production of jet fuel with a lower impact on global warming and local pollution. Future research should focus on the optimization of chemical processes of the bio-refinery to reduce the impacts on the 'Acidification' and 'Eutrophication' impact categories. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The fluctuation in the price of oil and the positive consequences of fuels from renewable sources (compared to fossil fuels) propel the expansion of biofuel global production. In this work, the current distillation operation of an ethanol distillery is simulated and compared to the use of indirect heating, evaluating the environmental and economic impacts associated with vinasse fertirrigation by using an external automated tool. Results show that the replacement proposed decreases approximately 15% of the amount of vinasse. Moreover, as the modifications do not change the outlet flowrates, such revamping might be done without additional operational changes that could affect the productivity. The environmental evaluation presents positive results, showing that the new configuration may decrease all environmental impacts categories assessed. From an economic perspective, the plant could also have higher profits, presenting a payback period of 3.57 years. Finally, the new improved system is treated as a multi-objective optimization problem and it is solved by using the weighted sum method to obtain the Pareto frontier, providing the optimal solutions that trade-off economic and environmental objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The US-China biofuel trade has experienced exponential growth in the past few years. This study conducts life cycle analysis on the US-China fuel ethanol trade and compares the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ethanol produced in China with ethanol imported from the U.S. We conduct lifecycle analysis for five China ethanol production pathways – corn, cassava, sweet sorghum, corn stover, and corncob, using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation) model. The well-to-pump (WTP) GHG emissions are estimated to be 54–234 gCO2e/MJ. The WTP emissions of ethanol imported from the U.S. are lower than starch- and sugar-based ethanol in China. By building vehicle pathways for passenger cars in China, we estimate the well-to-wheel emissions to be 184–253 gCO2e/km for spark-ignition (SI) engine vehicles. Overall, importing ethanol from the U.S. is estimated to reduce emissions by 34.21 gCO2e/MJ on average, suggesting great potential of imported ethanol on curbing China's GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New innovations are called for to renew the European forest sector into bioeconomy. However, little research exists on how the industry innovativeness is publicly perceived. Using data collected with an online questionnaire in four European countries, we investigate perceptions related to forest sector innovations on 13 current and new bioeconomy-related products and services. Altogether, 218 valid responses were received in 2015, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics, performance-importance analysis, and Gartner's innovation hype cycle. Based on our results, the respondents were in the strongest agreement that the forest sector has since the year 2000 has produced innovations related to wood building systems, construction materials, and wood composites. In the next 15 years, they foresaw a decline in innovations related to biofuels and paper products. The European forest sector also has future potential in wood construction, which is likely related to international policy targets related to carbon mitigation and capture. The observed variation in perceptions among the respondents on forest sector innovativeness calls for strengthening industry R&D, as well as by improving societal awareness of ongoing innovation projects by developing better communication. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - This study investigated the environmental and economic sustainability of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel production via fast pyrolysis of poplar biomass through two pathways: a one-step pathway that converted poplar via fast pyrolysis only, and a two-step pathway that includes a torrefaction step prior to fast pyrolysis. Optimization of these fast pyrolysis-based biofuel processes were investigated through heat integration and alternative uses of the coproduct biochar, which can be sold as an energy source to displace coal, soil amendment or processed into activated carbon. The impacts of optimization on the cost of hydrocarbon biofuel production as well as the environmental impacts were investigated through a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA), respectively, with two-step and one-step processing compared to fossil fuels. The TEA indicates that a one-step heat integrated pathway with the production of activated carbon has a minimum selling price of 3.23/gallon compared to 5.16/gallon for a two-step heat integrated process with burning of the coproduct biochar to displace coal. The LCA indicates that using the displacement analysis approach, a two-step heat integrated pathway had a global warming potential of -102 g CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel compared to 16 CO2 equivalent/MJ biofuel for the heat integrated one-step pathway. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In light of advances in the simultaneous production of biobased fuels and chemicals, a prospective well-to-wheel lifecycle assessment (LCA) model of a two-step multistage torrefaction biorefinery is constructed to quantify both lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy return on primary fossil energy investment (EROIfossil) for a transportation-range biofuel product. Coproducts - including cyclopentanone (CPO), biochar, and a potential net electricity export - are handled via six coproduct scenarios, evaluated across both market-based allocation and displacement methods. Process-scale performance metrics and product distributions are compared across cases to evaluate trade-offs between process and environmental performance; carbon flows are visualized to better explain patterns of carbon yield and waste. LCA results include median GHG values spanning from -30.8 to +36.1 g CO2e/MJ-fuel and median EROIfossil values ranging from 1.6 to 12.8 MJ-fuel/MJ-PEfossil. Sensitivity results for the Market CPO case under market-based allocation display a large dependence on CPO yield, hydrogen consumption and fuel and CPO prices, while exhibiting minimal dependence on liquid fuel yield. Unrealistically low lifecycle GHG and high EROIfossil values are obtained under displacement for the maximum level of CPO production, prompting a discussion of methodological limitations, especially as they relate to the assignment of system expansion coproduct credit within existing EROI formulations. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The energy market is diversifying, allowing for the development of biofuels that seek to reduce environmental impact and be energetically competitive with conventional fuels. One of the aforementioned biofuels is the biodiesel that is produced from the oil extracted from the seeds of Jatropha curcas L. This research uses life cycle analysis (LCA) tool to analyze the following environmental impacts associated with its production: energy, water footprint, carbon footprint, mineral resource depletion, fossil resource depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. The following stages were evaluated: (i) cultivation, (ii) the extraction of oil, and (iii) the biodiesel manufacturing process. The results showed that the overall process has an accumulated energy demand of 37.9 MJ/kg biodiesel, and generates 2.16 kg CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases (GHG) per kg of biofuel. The cultivation stage had the greatest contribution towards its energy and carbon footprints, taking up 45% and 60%, respectively. However, considering the energy valorization of the coproducts that are generated in the agricultural and extraction stages for self-consumption into the product system, both categories of impact mentioned above were reduced by 35% and 41%, respectively. © 2018 by the author.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that it is possible to engineer substantial increases in triacylglycerol (TAG) content in plant vegetative biomass, which offers a novel approach for increasing the energy density of food, feed, and bioenergy crops or for creating a sink for the accumulation of unusual, high-value fatty acids. However, whether or not these changes in lipid metabolism affect plant responses to biotic and/or abiotic stresses is an open question. Here we show that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant lines engineered for elevated leaf oil content, as well as lines engineered for accumulation of unusual conjugated fatty acids in leaf oil, had similar short-term responses to heat stress (e.g., 3 days at 37°C) as wild-type plants, including a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing polar lipids and an increase in PUFA-containing neutral lipids. At extended time periods (e.g., 14 days at 37°C), however, plant lines containing accumulated conjugated fatty acids displayed earlier senescence and plant death. Further, no-choice feeding studies demonstrated that plants with the highest leaf oil content generated cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) insects with significantly heavier body weights. Taken together, these results suggest that biotic and abiotic responses will be important considerations when developing and deploying high-oil-biomass crops in the field. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The expansion of the production and use of bioenergy is one of the most efficient mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nevertheless, the environmental impact of the production processes for many raw materials remains unexplored. Several studies have pointed to macauba palm as a promising species for biofuel production in the tropics, but investigations on the environmental benefits of its cultivation have not been reported so far. In this work, an analysis of macauba production system in terms of GHG emissions and CO2 uptake has been conducted for a productive cycle. The energy conversion efficiency per unit area of land has been put in relationship with crop productivity and related to the dilution effect of production inputs. Simulation results estimate GHG emissions of 180 Mg CO2eq·ha-1 and a CO2 fixation ranging from 796 to 1137 Mg CO2eq·ha-1. The net energy balance would reach 512.3 GJ·ha-1 and energy efficiency would be 24.2 GJ·GJ-1. These results suggest that macauba would outperform traditional energy crops such as sugarcane, oil palm, sunflower, corn or jatropha in terms of efficiency. The domestication and exploitation in extensive farming of this species as an agroforestry crop, although still at an early stage, has a bright future. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Expanding biofuel markets are challenged by the need to meet future biofuel demands and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, while using domestically available feedstock sustainably. In the context of the sugar industry, exploiting under-utilized cane leaf matter (CLM) in addition to surplus sugarcane bagasse as supplementary feedstock for second-generation ethanol production has the potential to improve bioenergy yields per unit land. In this study, the ethanol yields and processing bottlenecks of ammonia fibre expansion (AFEX™) and steam explosion (StEx) as adopted technologies for pretreating sugarcane bagasse and CLM were experimentally measured and compared for the first time. Results: Ethanol yields between 249 and 256 kg Mg-1 raw dry biomass (RDM) were obtained with AFEX™-pretreated sugarcane bagasse and CLM after high solids loading enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. In contrast, StEx-pretreated sugarcane bagasse and CLM resulted in substantially lower ethanol yields that ranged between 162 and 203 kg Mg-1 RDM. The ethanol yields from StEx-treated sugarcane residues were limited by the aggregated effect of sugar degradation during pretreatment, enzyme inhibition during enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial inhibition of S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST) during fermentation. However, relatively high enzyme dosages (&gt; 20 mg g-1 glucan) were required irrespective of pretreatment method to reach 75% carbohydrate conversion, even when optimal combinations of Cellic® CTec3, Cellic® HTec3 and Pectinex Ultra-SP were used. Ethanol yields per hectare sugarcane cultivation area were estimated at 4496 and 3416 L ha-1 for biorefineries using AFEX™- or StEx-treated sugarcane residues, respectively. Conclusions: AFEX™ proved to be a more effective pretreatment method for sugarcane residues relative to StEx due to the higher fermentable sugar recovery and enzymatic hydrolysate fermentability after high solids loading enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation by S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST). The identification of auxiliary enzyme activities, adequate process integration and the use of robust xylose-fermenting ethanologens were identified as opportunities to further improve ethanol yields from AFEX™- and StEx-treated sugarcane residues. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Second-generation biofuels derived from agricultural lignocellulosic waste represent what is hoped to be a significant technological, but also socio-economic advance beyond the shortcomings of first generation biofuels (chiefly bioethanol). The development of advanced catalytic techniques is a central part of making such technologies viable. However, assessing the socioeconomic viability of technologies based on such techniques is necessary to help second-generation technologies both avoid the shortcomings of first-generation fuels and to become more responsive to actual social needs. A pilot deliberative workshop with farmers in Wales is described here in which the research team explored the potential societal impacts of novel nanocatalysis methods for second generation biofuels. Using risk and benefit-ranking/issue mapping methodologies, the workshop examined the part that second-generation biofuels might play in bioeconomies of different scales. Grounded scepticism from workshop participants delineated key socio-technical issues that will be highly consequential for the responsible development of second generation technologies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Desulfurococcus amylolyticus DSM 16532 is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that can grow on cellulose. Due to the relevance of cellulose as a second generation biofuel production substrate this carbon compound was selected for molecular hydrogen (H2) production studies. D. amylolyticus has several genes that are necessary for H2 production, such as pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, formate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and two membrane-bound hydrogenases. Moreover, D. amylolyticus comprises many physiological features that could promote H2 production. Here, the biohydrogen production potential of D. amylolyticus was analysed in batch cultivation mode in bioreactors on cellulose and fructose. Analysing the cell specific biohydrogen production rates revealed that the organism possesses an intriguing physiological potential to produce H2, at rates higher or equal to other known biohydrogen producing strains. However, with respect to the volumetric H2 production rate the limiting factor could be related to low cell densities. Given the physiological capacity of D. amylolyticus the organism could still be envisioned to be optimized as a second generation H2 cell factory. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Background: Zymomonas mobilis is a natural ethanologen being developed and deployed as an industrial biofuel producer. To date, eight Z. mobilis strains have been completely sequenced and found to contain 2-8 native plasmids. However, systematic verification of predicted Z. mobilis plasmid genes and their contribution to cell fitness has not been hitherto addressed. Moreover, the precise number and identities of plasmids in Z. mobilis model strain ZM4 have been unclear. The lack of functional information about plasmid genes in ZM4 impedes ongoing studies for this model biofuel-producing strain. Results: In this study, we determined the complete chromosome and plasmid sequences of ZM4 and its engineered xylose-utilizing derivatives 2032 and 8b. Compared to previously published and revised ZM4 chromosome sequences, the ZM4 chromosome sequence reported here contains 65 nucleotide sequence variations as well as a 2400-bp insertion. Four plasmids were identified in all three strains, with 150 plasmid genes predicted in strain ZM4 and 2032, and 153 plasmid genes predicted in strain 8b due to the insertion of heterologous DNA for expanded substrate utilization. Plasmid genes were then annotated using Blast2GO, InterProScan, and systems biology data analyses, and most genes were found to have apparent orthologs in other organisms or identifiable conserved domains. To verify plasmid gene prediction, RNA-Seq was used to map transcripts and also compare relative gene expression under various growth conditions, including anaerobic and aerobic conditions, or growth in different concentrations of biomass hydrolysates. Overall, plasmid genes were more responsive to varying hydrolysate concentrations than to oxygen availability. Additionally, our results indicated that although all plasmids were present in low copy number (about 1-2 per cell), the copy number of some plasmids varied under specific growth conditions or due to heterologous gene insertion. Conclusions: The complete genome of ZM4 and two xylose-utilizing derivatives is reported in this study, with an emphasis on identifying and characterizing plasmid genes. Plasmid gene annotation, validation, expression levels at growth conditions of interest, and contribution to host fitness are reported for the first time. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Municipal solid waste landfills represent one of the most important issues related to the waste management cycle. Knowledge of biogas production is a key aspect for the proper exploitation of this energy source, even in the post-closure period. A simple mathematical model, which is based on first-order biodegradation kinetics and also considers the temperature variation in time and depth as well as landfill settlement, was proposed for the simulation of biogas production. The model was applied to an operating landfill located in Sicily, in Italy, and the first results obtained were potential. The results showed a good fit between measured and simulated data. Based on these potential results, the model can also be considered a useful tool for landfill operators for a reliable estimate of the duration of the post-closure period.

AB  - Increasing combustion of woody biomass for electricity has raised concerns and produced conflicting statements about impacts on atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, climate, and other forest values such as timber supply and biodiversity. The purposes of this concise review of current literature are to (1) examine impacts on net GHG emissions and climate from increasing bioenergy production from forests and exporting wood pellets to Europe from North America, (2) develop a set of science-based recommendations about the circumstances that would result in GHG reductions or increases in the atmosphere, and (3) identify economic and environmental impacts of increasing bioenergy use of forests. We find that increasing bioenergy production and pellet exports often increase net emissions of GHGs for decades or longer, depending on source of feedstock and its alternate fate, time horizon of analysis, energy emissions associated with the supply chain and fuel substitution, and impacts on carbon cycling of forest ecosystems. Alternative uses of roundwood often offer larger reductions in GHGs, in particular long-lived wood products that store carbon for longer periods of time and can achieve greater substitution benefits than bioenergy. Other effects of using wood for bioenergy may be considerable including induced land-use change, changes in supplies of wood and other materials for construction, albedo and non-radiative effects of land-cover change on climate, and long-term impacts on soil productivity. Changes in biodiversity and other ecosystem attributes may be strongly affected by increasing biofuel production, depending on source of material and the projected scale of biofuel production increases. © US Government.

AB  - Soybean is an important oil and protein source for human and animal food, as well as being used in the production of biofuel. Brazilian soybean is known for its quality, especially with regard to its high protein content. This work aimed to present a screening of Brazilian soybean cropped at different locations, to assess the composition of seed with regard to the protein, oil and fatty acid contents. We screened 46 cultivars, which represent more than 50% of the soybean cultivars produced in the South-Center region of Brazil in recent years, analyzed under six environments. In order to conduct the analysis, a grain sample was used to determine seed protein, oil and fatty acid contents, which was accomplished using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR). All the characters presented a genotype x environment interaction (GEI) (p < 0.01). A mean oil content of 20.35% was identified for all the evaluated cultivars. This was superior to that obtained in other countries. The mean protein content was 40.20%, which was expected for the Brazilian soybean. This higher oil content is doubly favorable in Brazilian soybean: firstly, for its use as cooking oil and biofuel; secondly, for the production of high protein soybean meal, once all the oil is removed. The cultivars which presented the highest oil contents were also stable across the evaluated environments. On the other hand, the genotypes with the highest protein content presented low stability across the environments. Regarding the fatty acid composition, Brazilian soybean stands out for its low linoleic acid content, which gives a high oxidative stability to the resulting oil and biofuel. Character associations were dependent on the location, thus breeders can select plants for specific traits at different locations. Brazilian cultivars present interesting characteristics for use in human and animal food products, and for biofuel production. © 2007-2018 Southern Cross Publishing-Australia.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emission induced global climate shift is an immediate threat to the world because of increased likelihood of the occurrence of extreme events. Expanding bioenergy production on currently set-aside land is an attractive option being considered by Taiwanese policymakers to reduce potential damages. This study investigates the impact of pyrolysis-based bioelectricity and ethanol on the greenhouse gas emission using a two-stage dynamic semi-parametric model. The results show that the bioelectricity generation has a significantly positive impact on the emission reduction. It encourages Taiwan to place more public resource on bioelectricity generation. This study is extended to forecast the emission reduction for 2015 to 2017. The quarterly emission reduction forecasts vary between 214,806 and 239,497 tons, which is less than 3% out of total emissions. It implies that the Taiwanese government could move the policy supports from biofuel production to bioelectricity production to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Energy cane is a specialized sugarcane (Sacharum spontaneum L.) hybrid developed for high lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. The optimum planting spacing for energy cane is not known; hence, it has been planted with sugarcane planting spacing. We examined the effect of six plant spacings derived from three inter- (1.22, 1.52, and 1.83 m) and two intra-row (0.61 and 0.91 m) spacings on energy cane growth, physiology, and biomass yield. Energy cane was planted in fall 2012, was harvested after establishment in 2013, and was allowed to ratoon for biomass yield in 2014 and 2015. The plant spacing had varied effects on energy cane growth and physiology, but no effect on biomass yield. Wide spacing resulted in increased tiller and leaf numbers, but spacing had no effect on other growth and physiological parameters at the p &lt; 0.05 level. The results suggested that energy cane possesses the ability to adjust plant growth according to plant spacing without compromising its biomass yield and can effectively use wide spacing (1.83 ´ 0.91 m) commonly adopted for sugarcane planting. Wide spacing can reduce seeding cost and energy during planting and will allow the use of existing sugarcane farm machinery for energy cane production. The high biomass yield (18.8–25.1 Mg ha−1) of energy cane obtained in this study also suggests that energy cane can be successfully produced for lignocellulosic feedstock. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Land-use changes under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) have been analyzed globally, but how regional and national land use respond to the global mitigation policies is seldom explored, which poses difficulties in regional environmental adaptation and decision-making. China, as a major food consuming and biofuel production country, would suffer great uncertainties in future land-use dynamics under the global scenarios. Here, we present a scenario-based land-use change assessment framework, integrating Global Change Assessment Model and Future Land Use Simulation Model, to evaluate the potential land use projections of China from 2010 to 2100. Eight scenarios with different combinations of SSPs and radiative forcing targets of RCPs are designed, to analyze the impacts of the global socioeconomic and emission assumptions on regional mitigations and land-use changes. We recalibrated the historical land use data and urban dynamics of China to improve the consistency of modeling results with the actual regional changes. Meanwhile, differences in land use dynamics are demonstrated by spatial downscaling, which are jointly affected by the global assumptions and local driving factors, showing a fierce competition between the crop and forest. We find that the regional crop changes are sensitive to the socioeconomic dynamics as well as the bioenergy production, while different carbon regimes drive the forest changes in unexpected ways. Besides, overall heterogeneous landscape patterns and similar spatial suitability maps are found in distributions of land-use change between the emission and socioeconomic scenarios. The results indicate that this framework embedded with the consideration of anthropogenic managements as well as the detailed interactions of local environments provides an effective way to investigate regional land use response to a range of alternative future pathways. © 2018

AB  - The bioenergy crop Miscanthus × giganteus has a high water demand to quickly increase biomass with rapid canopy closure and effective rainfall interception, traits that are likely to impact on hydrology in land use change. Evapotranspiration (ET, the combination of plant and ground surface transpiration and evaporation) forms an important part of the water balance, and few ET models have been tested with Miscanthus. Therefore, this study uses field measurements to determine the most accurate ET model and to establish the interception of precipitation by the canopy (Ci). Daily ET estimates from 2012 to 2016 using the Hargreaves–Samani, Priestley–Taylor, Granger–Gray, and Penman–Monteith (short grass) models were calculated using data from a weather station situated in a 6 ha Miscanthus crop. Results from these models were compared to data from on-site eddy covariance (EC) instrumentation to determine accuracy and calculate the crop coefficient (Kc) model parameter. Ci was measured from June 2016 to March 2017 using stem-flow and through-flow gauges within the crop and rain gauges outside the crop. The closest estimated ET to the EC data was the Penman-Monteith (short grass) model. The Kc values proposed are 0.63 for the early season (March and April), 0.85 for the main growing season (May to September), 1.57 for the late growing season (October and November), and 1.12 over the winter (December to February). These more accurate Kc values will enable better ET estimates with the use of the Penman-Monteith (short grass) model improving estimates of potential yields and hydrological impacts of land use change. Ci was 24% and remained high during the autumn and winter thereby sustaining significant levels of canopy evaporation and suggesting benefits for winter flood mitigation. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Biomass is a promising renewable energy source and its significance is escalating in the context of climate change and depletion of fossil foils. This study was conducted for two consecutive years 2016 and 2017, using five sorghum cultivars, i.e., JS-263, Jawar-2011, Hagari, JS-2002, and YS-2016, in order to determine the best cultivars in terms of dry matter yield, chemical composition, and biomethane yield grown under semi-arid conditions in Pakistan. The results revealed that sorghum cultivars responded differently in terms of growth, biomass yield, chemical composition, and methane yield. Cultivars Jawar-2011 produced maximum leaf area index, leaf area duration, crop growth rate, plant height, and leaves per plant, however, they were comparable with Sorghum-2016, whereas cultivar JS-2002 performed poorly among the tested cultivars. Similarly, cultivar Jawar-2011 produced maximum dry matter yield (16.37 t ha−1) similar to that of YS-2016, further cultivar JS-2002 performed poorly and gave lower dry matter yield (12.87 t ha−1). The maximum protein concentration (10.95), neutral detergent fibers (61.20), and lignin contents (5.55) found in Jawar-2011 were comparable with those in YS-2016, while the lowest neutral detergent fiber and lignin contents were found in JS-2002. Although JS-2002 produced the highest specific methane yield per kilogram of volatile solids, it was overcompensated by Jawar-2011 owing to higher dry matter yield per hectare. These results suggested that cultivar Jawar-2011 can be grown successfully in semi-arid conditions of Pakistan in order to get good biomass yield along with higher methane yield. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of biomass to achieve a sustainable, low carbon, competitive model of growth and employment is at the heart of European Union (EU) policy making. This study constitutes a first step toward understanding (i) the medium-term prospects for biobased sectors in the context of expected EU biomass policy developments and (ii) the degree of coherency with the Bioeconomy strategy in terms of identifying potential policy conflicts. A general finding is that EU bio-based sectors face important challenges, largely due to slower assumed rates of economic growth and land productivity, coupled with deeper greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Furthermore, EU policy conflicts are encountered in attempting to reconcile greenhouse gas reductions with macroeconomic growth, food security and biofuel mandates. To conclude, a more holistic public policy approach is necessary to avoid the perceived conflicts in biomass usage, whilst there is a clear need for targeted and sustained investments in EU bio-based activity to fully exploit its potential. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many developed countries promote the use of biofuels for environmental concerns, leading to a rise in the price of agricultural commodities utilized in their production. Such environmental policies have major effects on the economy of emerging and developing countries whose activity is highly dependent on agricultural commodities involved in biofuel production. This paper tackles this issue by examining the price impact of biofuels on the current account for a panel of 16 developing and emerging countries, and the potential nonlinear effect exerted by the price of oil on this relationship. Relying on the estimation of panel smooth-transition regression models, we show that positive shocks in the price of biofuels lead to a current-account improvement for agricultural commodity exporters (resp. producers) only when the price of oil is below 45 (resp. 56) US dollars per barrel. When the price of oil exceeds these thresholds, the effect of fluctuations in the price of biofuels on the current account tends to weaken and become non significant. Under these conditions, our findings indicate that, for agricultural commodity exporters which are also oil importers, the current account is pulled by two opposite forces, making its overall reaction modest or even nil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While the production of biofuels has expanded in recent years, findings in the literature on its impact on economic growth and development remain contradictory. This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies published between 2006 and 2017 on the effect of biofuel production on economic development worldwide. Using 30 CGE studies, we found that biofuel-supportive policies generated significant impacts on GDP and household incomes. CGE studies included in our database reported an average 0.25 percentage point increase in GDP and a 0.49 percentage point increase in household incomes. We also found that results were driven by several key features of the CGE studies included in our database. We investigated features such as biofuel type, geographic area, and characteristics of the CGE models employed. We found that biofuel expansion has heterogeneous effects in developed versus emerging countries. Simulations on longer time periods and in multi-country studies led to results that indicate higher impacts of biofuel expansion on GDP growth and household incomes. Moreover, simulations with an increase in agricultural productivity indicate positive welfare impact gains, unlike simulations with land expansion. Lastly, we found that biodiesel development leads to higher welfare impact gains than that of bioethanol. © 2017

AB  - Microbial toluene biosynthesis was reported in anoxic lake sediments more than three decades ago, but the enzyme catalyzing this biochemically challenging reaction has never been identified. Here we report the toluene-producing enzyme PhdB, a glycyl radical enzyme of bacterial origin that catalyzes phenylacetate decarboxylation, and its cognate activating enzyme PhdA, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, discovered in two distinct anoxic microbial communities that produce toluene. The unconventional process of enzyme discovery from a complex microbial community (>300,000 genes), rather than from a microbial isolate, involved metagenomics- and metaproteomics-enabled biochemistry, as well as in vitro confirmation of activity with recombinant enzymes. This work expands the known catalytic range of glycyl radical enzymes (only seven reaction types had been characterized previously) and aromatic-hydrocarbon-producing enzymes, and will enable first-time biochemical synthesis of an aromatic fuel hydrocarbon from renewable resources, such as lignocellulosic biomass, rather than from petroleum. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Agriculture is a key economic sector for developing countries confronting challenges on the overexploitation of land and water resources for food and biofuels crop production. Sugarcane is recognized as a promising crop serving both food and bioenergy needs that are being promoted leading to expansion of the plantation areas. The study assesses the land-water-energy nexus of irrigated and non-irrigated sugarcane production systems in the Chao Phraya and Chi watersheds of Thailand using carbon footprint, ecological footprint, and water scarcity footprint. The results indicate that freshwater resource is essential to sugarcane productivity improvement. Irrigation helps increase the sugarcane yields around 23–54% as compared to the non-irrigated system; the carbon and ecological footprint of sugarcane products are also consequently decreased by around 11–36% and 15–35%, respectively. Nevertheless, the water scarcity potential would be increased. Hence, the efficient irrigation technology like drip irrigation is an important factor to drive sustainable sugarcane production in the future. Land-water-energy nexus management measures for improving sustainability of sugarcane production are also recommended. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Life cycle environmental impacts of a product or process may be global and/or spatially-explicit, such as land use change (LUC) and LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Life cycle optimization (LCO) usually does not account for these impacts. However, for a product or process to be truly sustainable, they must be considered. We integrate computable general equilibrium (CGE)-based LUC modeling and LCO to create a novel multiobjective CGE-LUC-LCO framework to account for global environmental impacts and production costs. The framework is then applied to case studies on life cycle GHG emissions throughout the bioethanol life cycle, considering regional and global agricultural practices, land use, technological impacts, and global economic forces. The framework considers emissions from feedstock production, transportation, direct/indirect processing emissions, end use, and LUC. The model allows for selection of 16 bioethanol production pathways from 5 feedstocks, and 3 case studies with US and EU bioethanol demands are examined. The methodology identifies cleaner production strategies by considering global, spatially-explicit life cycle environmental impacts like LUC and LUC GHG emissions for the first time in LCO. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Winter oilseed rape is one of the most important crops in Germany. However, due to intensive nitrogen (N) fertilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions can occur, which may negatively affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil. Therefore, various field experiments were performed during 2013 to 2016 to investigate the influence of different N forms (ammonium sulphate nitrate and urea) as well as the use of a nitrification inhibitor (NI) on the harvest yields, N uptake, soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) dynamics and N2O emissions during the cultivation of winter rapeseed. At a N fertilization level of 220 kg ha−1 and seed yields of up to 6.0 Mg ha−1, the N2O-N emissions during the crop growing period were relatively low, i.e., within the range of 200 and 2300 g ha−1. The oil yield of the various N forms did not differ significantly. Concerning SMN dynamics, the nitrate values in the urea treatments were mostly lower than in the ammonium sulphate nitrate (ASN) plots. Although being on a relatively low level, the bulk of N2O emissions occurred between flowering and maturity of plants. N surpluses in plants fertilized with urea were highest, but in contrast these treatments showed the lowest measured N2O emissions within the fertilized plots. N2O-N emissions during the different seasons averaged 360 g ha−1 in the unfertilized control treatment. In the fertilized treatments, 770 g N2O-N emitted in the single schedule treatment with urea + NI, respectively 790 g ha−1 N2O-N in the urea + NI treatment with a split fertilization, moreover 1110 g ha−1 in the urea treatment without NI and 1450 g ha−1 in the plots fertilized with ammonium sulphate nitrate. The results show that the choice of the form of N and use of nitrification inhibitors at this site represent an approach for the abatement of nitrous oxide fluxes. This potential should be enhanced to fulfil the sustainability requirements of the European Union (EU RED) concerning the use of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The following paper provides an overview of the potential uses of seaweeds derived both from artificial cultivation as well as from eutrophic reservoirs as the feedstock for biofuels production. This review presents biochemical (anaerobic digestion [AD] and fermentation), chemical (extraction and transesterification) and thermochemical conversions (combustion, liquefaction, gasification and pyrolysis) of seaweeds for biofuels with special attention being paid to seaweeds processing such as pretreatment techniques, production methods and experimental conditions, and so forth. Seaweeds are considered as a suitable source for biogas and bioethanol production due to their high carbohydrate content. This review explores also the possibility of the application of oil extracted from seaweeds for biodiesel production. Since the chemical composition of seaweeds significantly differs from land biomass, a new comprehensive approach is required. Many macroalgal components are recalcitrant to bioconversion and pose microbiological challenges. The text deals with advantages and disadvantages of seaweeds as a feedstock for biofuels. Since macroalgae exploitation only for energy production is too expensive, seaweed integrated biorefineries were proposed as a solution which enables a development of high-value algal bioproducts. Algae appear to be a promising source of biofuels. Utilization of waste algal biomass constitutes a link between the pollution abatement and energy production.

AB  - Metal and metalloid concentration has been determined through inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in bioethanol samples, raw materials employed to obtain this biofuel and samples taken from different critical points of the manufacture method. In this way, it was possible to study the evolution of the metal and metalloid content all along the bioethanol production process, allowing to establish the origin of the elements determined in the final samples. Moreover, the steps of the production process where they were either removed from the biomass or accumulated in the biofuel were successfully identified. Four different acid assisted protocols were compared through the analysis of two biomass certified reference materials (CRMs). The results revealed that, for the most suitable method (nitric acid assisted MW digestion), recoveries for the analytes of interest went from 90% to 110%. Furthermore, good short-term and long-term precision and acceptable limits of detection (LODs) were obtained. Two different production lines were studied, and our results show that slight differences in terms of the minor elements concentration (Cd, Co, Sb, Pb and V) were identified. The most important source of metals and metalloids in the whole process can be attributed to the raw material. Meanwhile the distillation step caused 1000 to 10,000 times decrease in elemental concentration in the final bioethanol as compared to the initial biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol is one of the most widely used biofuels worldwide and rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a feedstock for bioethanol production. This study aimed at evaluating the energy use efficiency of rice single cropping and ratooning agro-systems in terms of brown rice production as a feedstock for bioethanol production. Moreover, the possibility of bioethanol production from Iranian rice was studied and a potential atlas, regarding the possibility of bioethanol production across the country, was also presented. The results demonstrated that the total energy consumption for producing 2.4 kg of brown rice as the feedstock unit for 1 L bioethanol production in rice single and ratooning agro-systems were 54.24 and 29.98 MJ, respectively. The results clearly highlighted that the bioethanol feedstock production in ratooning agro-system was more energy-efficient than the single cropping system. Substitution of low-yielding paddy variety of Hashemi with high-yielding cultivars and compensating some of the crop's nitrogen requirement using biological alternatives are proposed to enhance energy productivity in both agro-systems. The annual potential of bioethanol production from rice in Iran was estimated to be 648 million liters. Overall, developing a macro-plan is recommended to produce rice to be used as food and bioethanol feedstock based on the ratooning agro-system in Northern Iran. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An alternative to the sugar/starch-based crops bioethanol is lignocellulosic biomass, but its utilization to biofuels is still not economically viable. In this context, an increasing interest has arising on the search for specific energy crops that do not require arable lands and are not water intensive, such as Jerusalem artichoke (JA). So, this work consisted on the cultivation of JA on those agricultural conditions and its further evaluation as a sustainable feedstock towards bioethanol. Two strategies of producing bioethanol were evaluated pointing out for the consolidated bioprocessing with the Zygosaccharomyces bailii Talf1 yeast as the best approach for further scale-up, based on energy data analysis and ethanol productivity. Different industrial scenarios were outlined and compared for overall CO2eq emissions and energy consumption per liter of ethanol (LEtOH), using adequate criteria on a cradle-to-gate approach. With no land-use change, no biogenic and no co-products credits, the comparison of the overall energy consumption and CO2eq emissions (100% process) from JA ethanol (9 MJ/LEtOH; 679 g CO2/LEtOH) with sugarcane/sugar beet ethanol (42/29 MJ/LEtOH; 731/735 g CO2/LEtOH) and with gasoline refinery (15 MJ/LEtOH eq; 1154 g CO2/LEtOH eq), highlights the JA as an alternative feedstock to be a focus of ethanol research for gasoline blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A cradle-to-wheel life cycle analysis evaluated the greenhouse gas (GHG) contribution and fossil energy consumption (FEC) of bio-ethanol (EtOH) from dedicated crops on marginal lands in Campania Region (Southern Italy). The analysis processed experimental agronomic data of giant reed cultivated on hilly areas at high erosion risk and industrial data of feedstock conversion to EtOH, through second generation innovative technologies. Two ethanol–gasoline mixes (E10 and E85) were considered and compared with gasoline vehicle (GV). The E10 GHG and FEC profiles were driven by the gasoline input in the blend and the linked CO2 tailpipe emissions. The EtOH supply chain, especially the crop phase, was the major contributor to E85 impacts. The higher amount of biogenic C in E85 determined a marked reduction over GV of both GHG emissions (−60%) and FEC (−65%). The soil carbon storage would save 25 g CO2 eq per MJ; however, the issue is controversial due to the spatial and temporal variability of the process. Based on land availability, E85 contribution to renewables in the regional transport sector would amount to 4% and the blend wall would be far from saturation. A possible mismatch between future flexi-fuel vehicles density and E85 availability should be considered. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land use changes into and out of agricultural production may substantially influence ecosystem carbon (C) balance for many years. We examined ecosystem C balances for eight years after the conversion of 22 year-old Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands and formerly tilled agricultural fields (AGR) to annual (continuous no-till corn) and perennial (switchgrass and restored prairie) cropland. An unconverted CRP field (CRP-Ref) was maintained as a historical reference. Ecosystem C balance was assessed using adjusted net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEEadj) calculated by adding C removed in harvested biomass to NEE measured using eddy covariance method. The cumulative NEEadj of the corn and perennial systems on former CRP fields showed that these systems were a net C source to the atmosphere over the 8-year period while on former AGR fields, the perennial systems were net C sinks and the corn system near-neutral. The CRP-Ref was near neutral until a drought year when it became a net source. The corn system on the CRP field will likely reach a new lower soil C equilibrium at least 14 years after conversion but will never regain the C lost upon conversion under current no-till management with residue partially removed. On the other hand, the perennial systems could fully regain in ∼14 years the C lost following conversion. The cumulative NEEadj of the corn systems exhibited a higher C emission than did the perennial systems within the same land use histories, reflecting the dominant role of crop type and management in agricultural ecosystem C balance. Results suggest that converting croplands to grasslands results in immediate C gains whereas converting grasslands to croplands results in permanent (no-till corn with partial residue removal) or temporary (perennial herbaceous crops) net C loss to the atmosphere. This has a significant implications for global climate change mitigation where biomass production from annual and perennial crops is promoted to avoid fossil-fuel C emissions (biofuel) or to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (bioenergy C capture and storage). © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Moniliella wahieum Y12T, isolated from biodiesel was used as a model organism to assess the use of lanthanum oxide (La2O3) (60–80 nm) and silver oxide (AgO) (10–40 nm) nanoparticles as potential fungal inhibitors. This is the first study to investigate the use of nanoscale La2O3 as a eukaryotic bio-inhibitor. The AgO nanoparticles were relatively effective at inhibiting the growth of M. wahieum Y12T. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for AgO was 0.012 mg/mL as compared with 4.63 mg/mL of La2O3. Fluorescein diacetate analysis showed that AgO nanoparticles significantly reduced metabolic activity in M. wahieum Y12T. The results of this study indicated that AgO nanoparticles can be a nonspecific inhibitor for the treatment of M. wahieum Y12T, a eukaryotic biodiesel contaminant. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion was investigated as a potential method for on-farm disposal of fallen stock (pig carcases), degrading the carcase material to produce biogas and digestate. The effects of feedstock (sugar beet pulp or pig carcase material or a 50:50 mix) and organic loading rate (50 g-TS L−1 or 100 g-TS L−1), during mesophilic (35 °C) anaerobic digestion were investigated. Anaerobic digestion was achieved for all experimental treatments, however the pig carcase material at the higher organic loading rate produced the second highest methane yield (0.56 Nm3 kg-VS−1 versus a range of 0.14–0.58 Nm3 kg-VS−1 for other treatments), with the highest percentage of methane in total biogas (61.6% versus a range of 36.1–55.2% for all other treatments). Satisfactory pathogen reduction is a legislative requirement for disposal of carcase material. Pathogens were quantified throughout the anaerobic digestion process. Enterococcus faecalis concentrations decreased to negligible levels (2.8 log10 CFU g-TS−1), whilst Clostridium perfringens levels remained unaffected by treatment throughout the digestion process (5.3 ± 0.2 log10 CFU g-TS−1). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to test practical solutions to improve biogas yield during the anaerobic digestion of water hyacinth (WH) biomass. Increasing the WH (whole plant) solid content to ∼40% through sun drying (6 h), and its subsequent digestion increased biogas yield by 14% with a higher biogas methane (75%) content. Ensilation of dried WH (40% moisture) was found effective for its preservation to ensure its continuous availability even during offseasons, but the biogas yield from six months ensilated biomass was 20% less compared with fresh WH. Co-digestion of WH with waste activated sludge and food waste revealed ∼150 and ∼400 ml biogas/g VS respectively against ∼140 ml/g VS of WH alone. The practical approaches tested in this study like pre-treatment, preservation, and co-digestion of WH found to be effective to make its bio methanation more feasible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L.) is an important feedstock for biodiesel; hence, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and particularly fertilizer-derived nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during cultivation must be quantified to assess putative greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, thus creating an urgent and increasing need for such data. Substrates of nitrification [ammonium (NH4)] and denitrification [nitrate (NO3)], the predominant N2O production pathways, were supplied separately and in combination to OSR in a UK field trial aiming to: (i) produce an accurate GHG budget of fertilizer application; (ii) characterize short- to medium-term variation in GHG fluxes; (iii) establish the processes driving N2O emission. Three treatments were applied twice, 1 week apart: ammonium nitrate fertilizer (NH4NO3, 69 kg-N ha−1) mimicking the farm management, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 34.4 kg-N ha−1) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 34.6 kg-N ha−1). We deployed SkyLine2D for the very first time, a novel automated chamber system to measure CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes at unprecedented high temporal and spatial resolution from OSR. During 3 weeks following the fertilizer application, CH4 fluxes were negligible, but all treatments were a net sink for CO2 (ca. 100 g CO2 m−2). Cumulative N2O emissions (ca. 120 g CO2-eq m−2) from NH4NO3 were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.04) than from NaNO3 (ca. 80 g CO2-eq m−2), but did not differ from NH4Cl (ca. 100 g CO2-eq m−2) and reduced the carbon sink of photosynthesis so that OSR was a net GHG source in the fertilizer treatment. Diurnal variation in N2O emissions, peaking in the afternoon, was more strongly associated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than temperature. This suggests that the supply of carbon (C) from photosynthate may have been the key driver of the observed diurnal pattern in N2O emission and thus should be considered in future process-based models of GHG emissions. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) between rows in managed pine stands is a potential, emerging method for biofuel feedstock production in forestry systems. Switchgrass intercropping likely alters vegetation characteristics within a stand by increasing herbaceous vegetation cover and thus influences insect communities positively. However, its effect may vary with stand age, which often determines canopy closure and vegetation structure within a stand: effects of switchgrass intercropping may be stronger in old pine stands with a closed canopy than in young pine stands with an open canopy. We examined how switchgrass intercropping and stand age, namely 3–4-year-old pine (YPine) and 8–9-year-old pine (OPine), influenced insect abundance and diversity in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands in Mississippi, U.S.A., during May to August 2013–2014. We captured insects at 36 locations throughout 12 stands (three stands per each of four treatments; intercropping and non-intercropping treatment in YPine and OPine stands), using pan traps. Abundance and family level richness were greater in YPine stands and Shannon–Wiener diversity and evenness at family level was higher in OPine stands both years. However, insect abundance and diversity did not differ between intercropping and non-intercropping treatments. Community composition was also influenced by stand age, which explained > 90% of constrained inertia, rather than switchgrass intercropping. Our findings suggest that switchgrass intercropping is unlikely to significantly affect insect communities in managed pine stands, whereas stand age, as well as associated successional changes, can be a main factor affecting insects, as often observed in other animal taxa in managed pine landscapes. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society

AB  - Effective soil management is critical to achieving climate change mitigation in plant-based renewable energy systems, yet limitations exist in our understanding of dynamic belowground responses to the cultivation of energy crops. To better understand the belowground dynamics following cultivation of a grassland in a high-yielding tropical perennial C4 grass in a zero-tillage production system, changes in soil carbon (C) pools were quantified, modeled, and projected and the chemical composition of the aggregate-protected pool was determined in support of the simulated dynamics. Multiple C pools with different ecosystem functions and turnover increased following cultivation: immediately available microbial substrate (measured as hot water-soluble C) and active C (determined through laboratory incubation) increased by 12 and 30% respectively over time and soil C accumulated significantly in multiple physical fractions. A more rapid and dynamic nature of multiple C pools and transfers between pools existed than is often assumed in belowground models used widely in the field to simulate soil C accumulation. Multiple indicators of fresh roots, including the more easily degraded lignin monomers and root-derived long chain substituted fatty acids, appeared in aggregate-protected pools of cultivated soils over time since planting. This rapid transfer of plant inputs through active and intermediate C pools into mineral-dominated pools is the ultimate outcome required for building soil C stocks. Initial model runs suggested that this is evident, even on a 2-year frame, in transfer rates of 0.485 and 0.890 from active to slow and slow to passive pools respectively. The rapid transfer of fresh root-derived input to stable pool suggests that soil C under zero-tillage management may be resilient to disturbances, such as replanting following a kill-harvest, that would otherwise result in losses from unprotected or readily available pools. © 2018 Crow, Deem, Sierra and Wells.

AB  - The production and use of transportation fuels can lead to sustainability impacts. Assessing them simultaneously in a holistic way is a challenge. This paper examines methodology for assessing the sustainability performance of products in a more integrated way, including a broad range of social impacts. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology is applied for this assessment. LSCA often constitutes of the integration of results from social LCA (S-LCA), environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). In this study, an S-LCA from an earlier project is extended with a positive social aspect, as well as refined and detailed. E-LCA and LCC results are built from LCA database and literature. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology is applied to integrate the results from the three different assessments into an LCSA. The weighting of key sustainability dimensions in the MCDA is performed in different ways, where the sustainability dimensions are prioritized differently priority based on the assumed values of different stakeholder profiles (Egalitarian, Hierarchist, and Individualist). The developed methodology is tested on selected biomass based and fossil transportation fuels - ethanol produced from Brazilian sugarcane and US corn/maize, and petrol produced from Russian and Nigerian crude oils, where it delineates differences in sustainability performance between products assessed. The outcome in terms of relative ranking of the transportation fuel chains based on sustainability performance differs when applying different decision-maker profiles. This result highlights and supports views that there is no one single answer regarding which of the alternatives that is most sustainable. Rather, it depends strongly upon the worldview and values held by the decision maker. A key conclusion is that sustainability assessments should pay more attention to potential differences in underlying values held by key stakeholders in relevant societal contexts. The LCSA methodology still faces challenges regarding results integration but MCDA in combination with stakeholder profiles appears to be a useful approach to build on further. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (mainly carbon dioxide) is one of the major threats of the modern era. Primary causes are the high reliance on fossil fuels for power generation, transportation, manufacturing and the intensive land usage (deforestation). The current share of renewable biofuel production in the overall fuel demand has been found insufficient to replace fossil fuels. Microalgae can deliver a sustainable and complementary biofuel platform with some important advantages. This review aims to offer a state-of-the art review of algal biomass conversion methods into various biofuel products, including biodiesel, syngas, biogas, bioethanol. Emerging more sustainable biofuel/bioenergy production technologies are highlighted. Attention is also paid to sustainable cultivation methods, including wastewater treatment and bioremediation to capture CO2 and fix nitrogen and phosphorus, produced from industrial, agricultural and municipal sources. Finally, a light is shed on the important role of algae metabolic engineering. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Greenhouse gases emissions from biomass burning have been given a little attention, especially the spatiotemporal features of biomass burning sources and greenhouse gases emissions have not been comprehensively uncovered. This research undertook IPCC bottom-up inventory guideline to estimate Chinese greenhouse gases emissions from biomass burning and applied geographical information system to reveal biomass burning emissions spatiotemporal features. The purposes were to quantify greenhouse gases emissions from various biomass burning sources and to uncover the spatial and temporal emissions features so to deliver future policy implications in China. The results showed that the average annual biomass burning emissions in China from 2000 to 2012 were 880.66 Mt for CO2, 96.59 Mt CO2-eq for CH4, and 16.81 Mt CO2-eq for N2O. The spatial pattern of biomass greenhouse gases emissions showed about 50% of national emission were in the east and south-central regions. The majority of biomass burning emissions were from firewood and crop residues, which accounted for more than 90% of national biomass burning emissions. All types of biomass burning emissions exhibited similar temporal trends from 2000 to 2012, with strong inter-annual variability and fluctuant increase. The large grassland and forest fires induced the significant greenhouse gases emissions peaks in the years of 2001, 2003 and 2006. We found that biofuel burning, with low combustion efficiency, is the major emission source. Open burning of biomass was widespread in China, and east and south-central regions were the major distribution of biomass burning greenhouse gases emission. Optimized design for improving the efficiency of biomass utilization and making emission control policy combination with its spatiotemporal features will be the effective way to reduce the biomass burning emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) is one of a number of sustainability standards schemes that have been approved by the European Union under its 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED). The RSB scheme is often referred to positively not only because the sustainability standard is considered to exemplify greater rigour than many of the other EU-approved standards in terms of their claims to protect ‘sustainability’, but also because it provides an example of a ‘multi-stakeholder’ model of standards development that is assumed to confer greater legitimacy on the sustainability standards that are produced. In recognising that standards processes are part of wider processes of neoliberalisation, this paper explores the process in which the RSB standard was produced. In doing so it considers how notions of sustainability embodied in the RSB standards were shaped not only by its ‘multi-stakeholder’ process, but also by wider influences that were brought to bear in that process, including the growing spectre of a ‘standards market’ produced by the EU’s approval of different schemes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biofuel has emerged as a substantial source of energy in many countries. In order to avoid the ‘food versus fuel competition’, arising from grain-based ethanol production, the United States has passed regulations that require second generation or cellulosic biofeedstocks to be used for majority of the biofuel production by 2022. Agricultural residue, such as corn stover, is currently the largest source of cellulosic feedstock. However, increased harvesting of crops residue may lead to increased application of fertilizers in order to recover the soil nutrients lost from the residue removal. Alternatively, introduction of less-fertilizer intensive perennial grasses such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deu.) can be a viable source for biofuel production. Even though these grasses are shown to reduce nutrient loads to a great extent, high production cost have constrained their wide adoptability to be used as a viable feedstock. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to optimize feedstock production to meet bioenergy demand while improving water quality. This study presents a multi-objective simulation optimization framework using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Multi Algorithm Genetically Adaptive Method (AMALGAM) to develop optimal cropping pattern with minimum nutrient delivery and minimum biomass production cost. Computational time required for optimization was significantly reduced by loose coupling SWAT with an external in-stream solute transport model. Optimization was constrained by food security and biofuel production targets that ensured not more than 10% reduction in grain yield and at least 100 million gallons of ethanol production. A case study was carried out in St. Joseph River Watershed that covers 280,000 ha area in the Midwest U.S. Results of the study indicated that introduction of corn stover removal and perennial grass production reduce nitrate and total phosphorus loads without compromising on food and biofuel production. Optimization runs yielded an optimal cropping pattern with 32% of watershed area in stover removal, 15% in switchgrass and 2% in Miscanthus. The optimal scenario resulted in 14% reduction in nitrate and 22% reduction in total phosphorus from the baseline. This framework can be used as an effective tool to take decisions regarding environmentally and economically sustainable strategies to minimize the nutrient delivery at minimal biomass production cost, while simultaneously meeting food and biofuel production targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land use can affect ecosystems on land and their services. Because land use has mainly local effects, damage to ecosystem productivity due to land use should be modelled spatially dependent. Unfortunately, even though land use of impacts are particular importance for countries whose economies are highly agriculture-based, ecosystem productivity damage due to land use has not yet been assessed in Thailand so far. This study presents the method for assessing the damage to ecosystem productivity due to land use (land occupation and land transformation) in Thailand. Ecosystem productivity damage is expressed through net primary production (NPP). To convert the damage into monetary units, this study performs an economic valuation of NPP using the production function approach. The results show that the value of marginal product of NPP is around 10–15 Thai baht (THB) (1 USD ≈ 36 THB), per tonne dry weight biomass. The results are applied to the case of biodiesel production. The method presented in this paper could be a guideline for future land use impact assessment research. In addition, converting the NPP damage results into monetary units facilitates integration of impact assessment and economic analysis results for supporting decision support tools such as cost benefit analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) regulations were recently re-adopted (2015) with numerous revisions to the 2009 LCFS. Many aspects of the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) approach to modeling indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions have changed, including significant updates to the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) agro-economic model and use of a new emission factor (EF) database derived from the Agro-Economic Zone Emission Factor (AEZ-EF) model. These revisions have resulted in significantly reduced Carbon Intensity (CI) values for many biofuel pathways, making them more attractive to meet greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. The objective of this work was to investigate the most significant changes made to CARB's approach of modeling ILUC, the reasons for these changes, and their impacts on calculated CI values of biofuels. In this effort, land use change (LUC) estimates from GTAP and the AEZ-EF emission factors (EF) were compared to previous values. A new subset of land type, referred to as “cropland-pasture” has been incorporated into the GTAP-BIO model, and now constitutes the bulk of LUC for corn ethanol, soy biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol. However, since EFs of cropland-pasture are not well established, the AEZ-EF model simply applies an EF that is equivalent to 50% of the EF for conversion of pasture to cropland for the same AEZ region. In addition, differences in carbon accounting between perennial crops and annual crops contribute significantly to large reductions in sugarcane CI. These influential assumptions require further investigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The advocation of a biobased economy has created a compelling case for consideration of biofuels as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, biofuels must be evaluated on multiple criteria to ensure they truly are an improvement over the fossil fuels they are to replace. This study evaluates the carbon (C) footprint (emissions – sequestration) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions footprint of two fossil fuels, two first generation biofuels, and eight cellulosic fuels, many with process inputs allocated multiple ways to allow for different valuation of inputs and products. For both C and Nr results, fossil and first generation fuels were often the worst options, while cellulosic fuels look notably better, often in both criteria. For most fuels, there is a trade-off between a low C footprint and low Nr emissions footprint, which is investigated throughout the entire nutrient cycles here. Biofuels usually have lower C footprints and higher Nr emissions due to intensive farming processes, while fossil fuels have a high C footprint and lower Nr emissions. However, cellulosic fuels from feedstocks with low farming inputs switchgrass and low intensity high diversity grassland, or from waste feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste and newsprint have low C and Nr footprints, making them better options for transportation fuels. However, just because these fuels have smaller C and Nr footprints than other fuels does not imply they are absolutely sustainable. The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services should also be considered before sustainability claims are made. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forest residue is a major potential feedstock for second-generation biofuel; however, little knowledge exists about the environmental impacts of the development and production of biofuel from such a feedstock. Using a high-resolution regional air quality model, we estimate the air quality impacts of a forest residue based aviation biofuel supply chain scenario in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Using two potential supply chain regions, we find that biomass and biofuel hauling activities will add &lt;1% of vehicle miles traveled to existing traffic, but the biorefineries will add significant local sources of NOx and CO. In the biofuel production scenario, the regional average increase in the pollutant concentration is small, but 8-hr maximum summer time O3 can increase by 1-2 ppb and 24-hr average maximum PM2.5 by 2 μg/m3. The alternate scenario of slash pile burning increased the multiday average PM2.5 by 2-5 μg/m3 during a winter simulation. Using BenMAP, a health impact assessment tool, we show that avoiding slash pile burning results in a decrease in premature mortality as well as several other nonfatal and minor health effects. In general, we show that most air quality and health benefits result primarily from avoided slash pile burning emissions. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has emerged in recent times as a leading energy crop in sub-Saharan Africa with over 32 countries in the region involved in its cultivation. By 2008, five countries in the region (Senegal, Nigeria, Mali, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe) had policies promoting Jatropha cultivation. These policies were not informed by empirical evidence arising from the performance of Jatropha in the region. This paper analyses performance data of Jatropha in the region with a view to synthesizing information that is useful for evidence-based policy formulation. Production data in terms of agronomic issues and seed yields are analyzed. The results show that most of the attributes generically associated with Jatropha have not been achieved in the region and there has been inadequate research to support Jatropha cultivation. Policies supporting cultivation of Jatropha need to be informed by these observations in order to promote viable cultivation of the crop. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increasing demand for renewable energy and limiting CO2 emissions have stimulated much interest in wood-based biofuels. Unfortunately, expanding the utilization of forest biomass may cause nutrient depletion in forested environments. This study investigates the element content from various parts of the tree. Comparisons were made between different harvesting scenarios and their impact on the amount of nutrients removed from the forest environment. The harvesting scenarios were: stem-only harvesting (SOH), branch and stem harvesting (BSH), and two variants of whole-tree harvesting (WTH). The elements taken into account were: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), sulphur (S), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb). To make the results comparable, the same amount of removed biomass was taken into calculation. The differences between harvesting scenarios were significant. The amounts of removed elements formed similar pattern: the lowest level was found in SOH, average in BSH, and highest in both variants of WTH. This confirms that the application of WTH is connected with increased risk of nutrient depletion, even when the volume of harvest would be equal to other variants. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Palm kernel shell biochars (PKSB) ejected as residues from a gasifier have been used for solid fuel briquette production. With this approach, palm kernel shells can be used for energy production twice: first, by producing rich syngas during gasification; second, by compacting the leftover residues from gasification into high calorific value briquettes. Herein, the process parameters for the manufacture of PKSB biomass briquettes via compaction are optimized. Two possible optimum process scenarios are considered. In the first, the compaction speed is increased from 0.5 to 10 mm/s, the compaction pressure is decreased from 80 Pa to 40 MPa, the retention time is reduced from 10 s to zero, and the starch binder content of the briquette is halved from 0.1 to 0.05 kg/kg. With these adjustments, the briquette production rate increases by more than 20-fold; hence capital and operational costs can be reduced and the service life of compaction equipment can be increased. The resulting product satisfactorily passes tensile (compressive) crushing strength and impact resistance tests. The second scenario involves reducing the starch weight content to 0.03 kg/kg, while reducing the compaction pressure to a value no lower than 60 MPa. Overall, in both cases, the PKSB biomass briquettes show excellent potential as a solid fuel with calorific values on par with good-quality coal.

AB  - Background: Yeast-based chemical production is an environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based production or processes that involve harsh chemicals. However, many potential alcohol biofuels, such as n-butanol, isobutanol and n-hexanol, are toxic to production organisms, lowering the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these processes. We set out to improve the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae toward these alcohols. Results: We evolved the laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae BY4741 to be more tolerant toward n-hexanol and show that the mutations which confer tolerance occur in proteins of the translation initiation complex. We found that n-hexanol inhibits initiation of translation and evolved mutations in the α subunit of eIF2 and the γ subunit of its guanine exchange factor eIF2B rescue this inhibition. We further demonstrate that translation initiation is affected by other alcohols such as n-pentanol and n-heptanol, and that mutations in the eIF2 and eIF2B complexes greatly improve tolerance to these medium-chain alcohols. Conclusions: We successfully generated S. cerevisiae strains that have improved tolerance toward medium-chain alcohols and have demonstrated that the causative mutations overcome inhibition of translation initiation by these alcohols. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Compared with other general energy crops, microalgae are more compatible with desert conditions. In addition, microalgae cultivated in desert regions can be used to develop biodiesel. Therefore, screening oil-rich microalgae, and researching the algae growth, CO2 fixation and oil yield in desert areas not only effectively utilize the idle desertification lands and other resources, but also reduce CO2 emission. Results: Monoraphidium dybowskii LB50 can be efficiently cultured in the desert area using light resources, and lipid yield can be effectively improved using two-stage induction and semi-continuous culture modes in open raceway ponds (ORPs). Lipid content (LC) and lipid productivity (LP) were increased by 20% under two-stage industrial salt induction, whereas biomass productivity (BP) increased by 80% to enhance LP under semi-continuous mode in 5 m2 ORPs. After 3 years of operation, M. dybowskii LB50 was successfully and stably cultivated under semi-continuous mode for a month during five cycles of repeated culture in a 200 m2 ORP in the desert area. This culture mode reduced the supply of the original species. The BP and CO2 fixation rate were maintained at 18 and 33 g m-2 day-1, respectively. Moreover, LC decreased only during the fifth cycle of repeated culture. Evaporation occurred at 0.9-1.8 L m-2 day-1, which corresponded to 6.5-13% of evaporation loss rate. Semi-continuous and two-stage salt induction culture modes can reduce energy consumption and increase energy balance through the energy consumption analysis of life cycle. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of combining biodiesel production and CO2 fixation using microalgae grown as feedstock under culture modes with ORPs by using the resources in the desert area. The understanding of evaporation loss and the sustainability of semi-continuous culture render this approach practically viable. The novel strategy may be a promising alternative to existing technology for CO2 emission reduction and biofuel production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Torrefaction is an option for improving biomass properties for fuel application. Biomass undergoes chemical changes reflected on the upgrading of its properties as a biofuel, such as higher calorific power, lower O/C and H/C ratios, lower higroscopicity or better grindability. The objectives of this experimental study were to analyze the effects of torrefaction, under standard conditions of 265 ºC, and residence time of 15 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere and during a total 1h45m heating period, on a set of sixteen woody biomasses coming from poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) and other Portuguese roundwoods. Average mass loss was higher than 40%. The set of poplar clones and common broom provided torrefied products with higher quality than the set of roundwood forest species. The results on other parameters for proximate and ultimate analysis corroborate this global picture. Correlation analysis showed a higher degree of interconnectedness between LHV and proximate analysis results, for poplar clones and common broom, comparatively with roundwood biomasses. © 2018, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard mandates large increases in U.S. biofuel consumption and is implemented using tradable compliance credits known as RINs. In early 2013, RIN prices soared, causing the regulator to propose reducing future mandates. We estimate empirically the effect of three "policy shocks" that reduced the expected mandates in 2013. We find that the largest of these shocks decreased the value of the fuel industry's 2013 compliance obligation by $7 billion. We then study the effects of the shocks on commodity markets and the market value of publicly-traded biofuel firms. Results show that the burden of the mandate reductions fell primarily on advanced biofuel firms and commodity markets of the marginal compliance biofuel. We argue that the policy shocks reduced the incentive to invest in the technologies required to meet the future objectives of the RFS, and discuss alternative policy designs to address the problems that arose in 2013. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Among the fossil fuels, diesel has the major share in petroleum product consumption. Diesel demand in Iran has increasingly grown due to the low price of diesel, a high subsidy, and an unsuitable consumption pattern. During 2006-2007, this growth imposed 2.2 billion liters of imports, which were equivalent to 7.5% of diesel production in 2007 and cost about $1.2 billion. Therefore, the government implemented fuel rationing in 2007 and a targeted subsidy law in 2010. These projects have not gained effective control of consumption due to the wide gap between the international diesel price and the domestic price. Diesel import after the implementation of fuel rationing and the targeted subsidy law in 2011 imposed 3.6 billion liters of import and cost about $2.2 billion. Therefore, the government will need fundamental strategies and policies to face and control the negative impact on the economy and the environment. Third generation fuels, biofuels, as another supplementary approach seems to have the capability to reduce the petroleum requirement. This paper investigates the potential of biodiesel as diesel alternative fuel from oil seeds and microalgae in Iran along with evaluating the policy for reducing diesel consumption. Dunaliella salina as an indigenous green microalga isolated from the Maharlu Salt Lake was cultivated in an integration of an airlift system and a raceway pond (IARWP) to prove microalgal potentials in Iran. Additionally, the natural culture medium from the Maharlu Salt Lake was utilized for Dunaliella salina in order to commercialize and reduce cultivation cost. Compared to oilseeds, microalgae because of their high lipid content have much potential to solve a fuel consumption problem. This paper found that only 21 percent of cultivable land is needed to replace the diesel currently consumed in Iran with microalgal biodiesel. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is heavily relied upon in scenarios of future emissions that are consistent with limiting global mean temperature increase to 1.5 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial. These temperature limits are defined in the Paris Agreement in order to reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Here, we explore the use of BECCS technologies in a reference scenario and three low emission scenarios generated by an integrated assessment model (IMAGE). Using these scenarios we investigate the feasibility of key implicit and explicit assumptions about these BECCS technologies, including biomass resource, land use, CO2 storage capacity and carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment rate. In these scenarios, we find that half of all global CO2 storage required by 2100 occurs in USA, Western Europe, China and India, which is compatible with current estimates of regional CO2 storage capacity. CCS deployment rates in the scenarios are very challenging compared to historical rates of fossil, renewable or nuclear technologies and are entirely dependent on stringent policy action to incentivise CCS. In the scenarios, half of the biomass resource is derived from agricultural and forestry residues and half from dedicated bioenergy crops grown on abandoned agricultural land and expansion into grasslands (i.e. land for forests and food production is protected). Poor governance of the sustainability of bioenergy crop production can significantly limit the amount of CO2 removed by BECCS, through soil carbon loss from direct and indirect land use change. Only one-third of the bioenergy crops are grown in regions associated with more developed governance frameworks. Overall, the scenarios in IMAGE are ambitious but consistent with current relevant literature with respect to assumed biomass resource, land use and CO2 storage capacity. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Exposure to household air pollution (HAP) from cooking and heating with solid fuels is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Children under five are particularly at risk for acute lower respiratory infection. We use baseline data from a randomized controlled trial evaluating a household energy intervention in Gisenyi, Rwanda to investigate the role of the microenvironment as a determinant of children's HAP-related health symptoms. Our sample includes 529 households, with 694 children under five. We examine the association between likelihood of HAP-related health symptom prevalence and characteristics of the microenvironment including: dwelling and cooking area structure; distance to nearest road; and tree cover. We find that children residing in groups of enclosed dwellings, in households that cook indoors, and in households proximate to tree cover, are significantly more likely to experience symptoms of respiratory infection, illness with cough and difficulty breathing. On the other hand, children in households with cemented floors and ventilation holes in the cooking area, are significantly less likely to experience the same symptoms. Our findings suggest that in addition to promoting increased access to clean cooking technologies, there are important infrastructure and microenvironment-related interventions that mitigate HAP exposure. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Negative emission (NE) technologies are recognized to play an increasingly relevant role in strategies limiting mean global warming to 1.5 °C as specified in the Paris Agreement. The potentially significant contribution of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS) is, however, highly underrepresented in the discussion. In this study, we conduct the first quantitative assessment of the global potential of PyCCS as a NE technology based on biomass plantations. Using a process-based biosphere model, we calculate the land use change required to reach specific climate mitigation goals while observing biodiversity protection guardrails. We consider NE targets of 100-300 GtC following socioeconomic pathways consistent with a mean global warming of 1.5 °C as well as the option of additional carbon balancing required in case of failure or delay of decarbonization measures. The technological opportunities of PyCCS are represented by three tracks accounting for the sequestration of different pyrolysis products: Biochar (as soil amendment), bio-oil (pumped into geological storages) and permanent-pyrogas (capture and storage of CO2 from gas combustion). In addition, we analyse how the gain in land induced by biochar-mediated yield increases on tropical cropland may reduce the pressure on land. Our results show that meeting the 1.5 °C goal through mitigation strategies including large-scale NE with plantation-based PyCCS may require conversion of natural vegetation to biomass plantations in the order of 133-3280 Mha globally, depending on the applied technology and the NE demand. Advancing towards additional bio-oil sequestration reduces land demand considerably by potentially up to 60%, while the benefits from yield increases account for another 3%-38% reduction (equalling 82-362 Mha). However, when mitigation commitments are increased by high balancing claims, even the most advanced PyCCS technologies and biochar-mediated co-benefits cannot compensate for delayed action towards phasing-out fossil fuels. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels from soybean and corn oil can potentially create new markets in Brazil. The key to a stable biofuel production is the use of high-yielding varieties tolerant to environmental stresses. The inter-annual variability of rainfall caused by large scale meteorological phenomena, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation and irregular distribution of precipitation has been a major cause of uncertainty in agricultural production in Brazil. The objective of this study was to perform an inter-annual and inter-regional analysis of soybean and corn yield in relation to water deficit in a transitional zone between subtropical and tropical climate in southern Brazil. The study was conducted in the state of Parana (22-26° S), one of the main soybean and corn producing areas in the country. The state was divided into six regions (Northwest, North, West, Midwest, Southwest, and South), and the year with the highest productivity in each region was used as a reference to calculate the relative yield losses per year. These losses were correlated with the accumulated water deficit between November and January. The relative yield losses of soybean and corn had a nonlinear relationship with water deficit within each region. Based on the market prices of each year, we estimated that the total losses due to water deficit over the nine growing seasons were $8.36 and $2.67 billion for soybean and corn, respectively. In terms of productivity, the South region showed the highest stability, whereas the Northwest region the lowest stability in response to water deficit. The results show that inter-annual and regional variability of water stress play an important role in soybean and corn productivity in the transition zone between tropical and subtropical climate in southern Brazil. © 2018, Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - Liquid biofuel production has been widely promoted as a rural development strategy in the South. Yet, the development of biofuel value chains faces many context-specific challenges. In this empirical study we use a labelled choice experiment to assess smallholder farmer preferences for alternative production systems, value chain organisations and market developments for a biofuel program using oilseed trees (neem (Azadirachta indica), pongamia (Millettia pinnata), mahua (Madhuca longifolia)) in Karnataka state, India. Our results demonstrate that biofuel programs can benefit from ex ante analyses to improve their design. We find that most farmers (71%) are likely to adopt biofuel trees in most scenarios, especially species with relatively high yields, low labour requirements and high oilseed prices. Nevertheless, value chain reorganization through contracting and labour provision proves to be the key lever to stimulate adoption. This calls for further research on effective contract design and implementation, and for developing alternative business models. Our results imply that next to high opportunity costs of land, also high opportunity costs of labour can be a barrier to biofuel tree adoption. If biofuel programs are to succeed, they have to move beyond the idea of smallholder biofuel production on marginal lands with surplus labour. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Household air pollution from burning solid fuels is responsible for an estimated 2.9 million premature deaths worldwide each year and 4.5% of global disability-adjusted life years, while cooking and fuel collection pose a considerable time burden, particularly for women and children. Cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves have the potential to lower exposure to household air pollution as well as reduce fuelwood demand by increasing the combustion efficiency of cooking fires, which may in turn yield ancillary benefits in other domains. The present paper capitalises on opportunities offered by the Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest randomised trial of biomass-fuelled cookstoves on health outcomes conducted to date, the design of which allows for the evaluation of additional outcomes at scale. This mixed methods study assesses the impact of cookstoves on primary school absenteeism in Karonga district, northern Malawi, in particular by conferring health and time and resource gains on young people aged 5–18. The analysis combines quantitative data from 6168 primary school students with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions carried out among 48 students in the same catchment area in 2016. Negative binomial regression models find no evidence that the cookstoves affected primary school absenteeism overall [IRR 0.92 (0.71–1.18), p = 0.51]. Qualitative analysis suggests that the cookstoves did not sufficiently improve household health to influence school attendance, while the time and resource burdens associated with cooking activities—although reduced in intervention households—were considered to be compatible with school attendance in both trial arms. More research is needed to assess whether the cookstoves influenced educational outcomes not captured by the attendance measure available, such as timely arrival to school or hours spent on homework. © 2018 Kelly et al.

AB  - Organic soil fertilizers, such as livestock manure and biogas digestate, frequently contain bacteria carrying resistance genes (RGs) to antimicrobial substances and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The effects of different fertilizers (inorganic, manure, digestate) on RG and MGE abundance and microbial community composition were investigated in a field plot experiment. The relative abundances of RGs [sul1, sul2, tet(A), tet(M), tet(Q), tet(W), qacE±1/qacE] andMGEs [intI1, intI2, IncP-1, IncP-1e and LowGC plasmids] in total community (TC)-DNA from organic fertilizers, bulk soil and maize rhizosphere were quantified by qPCR before/after fertilization and prior to maize harvest. Microbial communities were analyzed via Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from TC-DNA. Compared to inorganic fertilization, manure treatments increased relative abundances of all RGs analyzed, integrons and few genera affiliated to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in bulk soil, while digestate increased sul2, tet(W) and intI2. At harvest, treatment effects vanished in bulk soil. However, organic fertilizer effects were still detectable in the rhizosphere for RGs [manure: intI1, sul1; digestate: tet(W)] and Clostridium related sequences (digestates) with increased relative abundance. Our data indicated transient organic fertilizer effects on RGs, MGEs and microbial community composition in bulk soil with long-term history of digestate or manure application. © FEMS 2018.

AB  - This article presents the definition, building, calibration and application of a system dynamics simulation model to quantify the present and future comparative advantages and disadvantages of using forest and agricultural residual biomass for energetic purpose through different processes and technologies, on a regional basis. A dynamic structure of the agricultural and forestry biomass process activities (i.e. production, transport, conversion and consumption) based on regional time-series data was built, implemented into and calibrated within a dynamic simulation tool (Vensim software) within a Hungarian county. Besides the agriculture and forestry sectors, the model includes data about demography, economy, environment and land use, among others. For carrying out the assessment, realistic scenarios of future biomass processes and of biomass use were formulated, characterised by quantitative sustainable development indicators and simulated within the dynamic model. The results prove that the introduced model supports decision making of biomass utilisation in a regional scale, through comparing and analysing quantitative changes of economic, social and environment indicators, which characterise a sustainable regional development. The model therefore allows analyses and evaluation of not only partial prosperous or adverse characteristics of biomass processes and use, but also to relate regional components and their development over time. The developed dynamic tool is therefore a powerful method to model complex systems, such as a regional energy system, considering the framework of the regional preferences stated by the regional stakeholders. It can thus provide useful decision support, especially when used as a priority-based screening of potential regional development programmes in the energy field. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Feruloylation of arabinoxylan (AX) in grass cell walls is a key determinant of recalcitrance to enzyme attack, making it a target for improvement of grass crops, and of interest in grass evolution. Definitive evidence on the genes responsible is lacking so we studied a candidate gene that we identified within the BAHD acyl-CoA transferase family. We used RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of orthologs in the model grasses Setaria viridis (SvBAHD01) and Brachypodium distachyon (BdBAHD01) and determined effects on AX feruloylation. Silencing of SvBAHD01 in Setaria resulted in a c. 60% decrease in AX feruloylation in stems consistently across four generations. Silencing of BdBAHD01 in Brachypodium stems decreased feruloylation much less, possibly due to higher expression of functionally redundant genes. Setaria SvBAHD01 RNAi plants showed: no decrease in total lignin, approximately doubled arabinose acylated by p-coumarate, changes in two-dimensional NMR spectra of unfractionated cell walls consistent with biochemical estimates, no effect on total biomass production and an increase in biomass saccharification efficiency of 40–60%. We provide the first strong evidence for a key role of the BAHD01 gene in AX feruloylation and demonstrate that it is a promising target for improvement of grass crops for biofuel, biorefining and animal nutrition applications. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The design of socio-ecological landscapes to provide simultaneously multiple benefits has become a key concept in current sustainable development thinking and an attractive goal for policy makers. However, its application in the practice of landscape management has proved difficult. In this study, we develop an approach for practical application of landscape design to advance multifunctionality and sustainable outcomes. We combine ideas of landscape ecology with methods for collaborative decision-making to deal with the practice of designing landscapes. Our approach consists of six components including (a) definition of boundaries and scales, (b) assessment of local values and concerns, (c) knowledge development, (d) stakeholders participation, (e) collaborative decision-making and (d) monitoring. We test the approach on the case of advanced transport biofuels. These technologies have attracted attention in recent years as a means to achieve climate, energy and development goals avoiding the environmental and socio-economic risks of conventional biofuel technologies. The findings suggest that the landscape design approach has the potential to guide the planning of complex biofuel projects for sustainable outcomes improving local acceptability of potentially controversial projects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agriculture, and its impact on land, contributes almost a third of total human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). At the same time, it is the only sector which has significant potential for negative emissions through offsetting via the supply of feedstock for energy and sequestration in biomass and soils. Perennial crops represent 30% of the global cropland area. However, the positive effect of biomass storage on net GHG emissions has largely been ignored. Reasons for this include the inconsistency in methods of accounting for biomass in perennials. In this study, we present a generic model to calculate the carbon balance and GHG emissions from perennial crops, covering both bioenergy and food crops. The model can be parametrized for any given crop if the necessary empirical data exists. We illustrate the model for four perennial crops – apple, coffee, sugarcane, and Miscanthus– to demonstrate the importance of biomass in overall farm GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pilot-scale fermentation is one of the important processes for achieving industrialization of biogenic coalbed methane (CBM), although the mechanism of biogenic CBM remains unknown. In this study, 16 samples of formation water from CBM production wells were collected and enriched for methane production, and the methane content was between 3.1 and 21.4%. The formation water of maximum methane production was used as inoculum source for pilot-scale fermentation. The maximum methane yield of the pilot-scale fermentation with lump anthracite amendment reached 13.66 μmol CH4/mL, suggesting that indigenous microorganisms from formation water degraded coal to produce methane. Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial and archaeal communities in the formation water sample differed greatly from the methanogic water enrichment culture. The hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanocalculus dominated the formation water. Acetoclastic methanogens, from the order Methanosarcinales, dominated coal bioconversion. Thus, the biogenic methanogenic pathway ex situ cannot be simply identified according to methanogenic archaea in the original inoculum. Importantly, this study was the first time to successfully simulate methanogenesis in large-capacity fermentors (160 L) with lump anthracite amendment, and the result was also a realistic case for methane generation in pilot-scale ex situ. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Heavy metals (HMs) contamination of soils is a major problem occurring worldwide. Utility of energy crops for biofuel feedstock production systems offers a feasible solution for a commercial exploitation of an arable land contaminated with HMs. Experiments involved field testing of Miscanthus x giganteus and Spartina pectinata cultivated on HMs-contaminated soil with standard NPK fertilizers and commercially available microbial inoculum. Biomass yield, water content, macronutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca), and heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Zn) concentrations in plant shoots were assessed at the end of the first and the second growing season. Independently of the applied fertilizers, Miscanthus x giganteus produced higher biomass yield while contrary results were obtained for S. pectinata. Higher HMs content in plants influenced the status of the mineral macronutrients in particular N and K. Occurrence of hasted senescence induced by drought in the second growing season caused reduction in the concentrations of all elements (except Pb), due to earlier rhizomes relocation. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The practice of fire suppression across the western United States over the past century has led to dense forests, and when coupled with drought has contributed to an increase in large and destructive wildfires. Forest management efforts aimed at reducing flammable fuels through various fuel treatments can help to restore frequent fire regimes and increase forest resilience. Our research examines how different fuel treatments influenced burn severity and post-fire vegetative stand dynamics on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, in east-central Arizona, U.S.A. Our methods included the use of multitemporal remote sensing data and cloud computing to evaluate burn severity and post-fire vegetation conditions as well as statistical analyses. We investigated how forest thinning, commercial harvesting, prescribed burning, and resource benefit burning (managed wildfire) related to satellite measured burn severity (the difference Normalized Burn Ratio – dNBR) following the 2013 Creek Fire and used spectral measures of post-fire stand dynamics to track changes in land surface characteristics (i.e., brightness, greenness and wetness). We found strong negative relationships between dNBR and post-fire greenness and wetness, and a positive non-linear relationship between dNBR and brightness, with greater variability at higher severities. Fire severity and post-fire surface changes also differed by treatment type. Our results showed harvested and thinned sites that were not treated with prescribed fire had the highest severity fire. When harvesting was followed by a prescribed burn, the sites experienced lower burn severity and reduced post-fire changes in vegetation greenness and wetness. Areas that had previously experienced resource benefit burns had the lowest burn severities and the highest post-fire greenness measurements compared to all other treatments, except for where the prescribed burn had occurred. These results suggest that fire treatments may be most effective at reducing the probability of hazardous fire and increasing post-fire recovery. This research demonstrates the utility of remote sensing and spatial data to inform forest management, and how various fuel treatments can influence burn severity and post-fire vegetation response within ponderosa pine forests across the southwestern U.S. © 2018

AB  - Large-scale agricultural investment (LSAI) involves complex trade-offs with regard to West African farmers’ livelihoods. Our research presents a robust impact evaluation of a biofuel investment in northern Sierra Leone. The LSAI case evaluated has been certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterial and is noted for complying with several other international guidelines. A total of 882 households were surveyed in the treatment and control areas, and asked about their livelihood structures. Statistical results show that farmers in the LSAI area have reduced their agricultural area for food production, have lower yields, and need to spend more on external labour. By contrast, the LSAI-impacted villages present a clear increase in total monetary income, a perceived improvement in food and water security, and an increase in food consumption expenditure. However, the improvement in financial income was higher for landowners than for tenants, and access to wage labour was mainly given to men rather than women, suggesting that LSAI can potentially increase local inequalities. It is therefore not possible to speak about a linear impact in this case, but more of a transformation of livelihood structures toward a more wage-dependent system. The findings also support the idea that the enforcement of international guidelines on responsible investment is necessary to mitigate the negative consequences of LSAI on local livelihoods. Further efforts must also be made along these lines to create a security net, to prevent potentially harmful consequences in the case of operations shutting down. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel production, but difficulties associated with harvesting suspended cultures contribute to the high costs of algal feedstock production. Ultrasonic harvesting has been identified as a potential low-cost technique, but limited data are available on the response of microalgae cells in the presence of an acoustic field. The acoustic radiation force acting on a cell depends upon cell size and the acoustic contrast factor (ACF) of the cell in the media. The ACF depends upon the density and compressibility of the cell and the media. Cell size and ACF were measured for Microchloropsis gaditana, Nannochloropsis oculata, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The average ACFs, which were determined by measuring the densities and sound velocities of suspensions containing varying concentrations of cells in growth media, were 0.04 (range = 0.03–0.05) for M. gaditana, 0.02 (range = 0.01–0.04) for N. oculata, 0.05 (range = 0.04–0.07) for P. tricornutum, and 0.05 (range = 0.049–0.053) for C. reinhardtii. The ratio of the acoustic radiation force to the drag force would be highest for C. reinhardtii cells due to their larger effective radius (5.6 μm compared to 1.9–2.7 μm for the other species). The effective ACF of C. reinhardtii was also evaluated by recording the motion of cells in the presence of an acoustic field, using particle tracking velocimetry, and then modeling the recorded motion using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The result (ACF = 0.04) demonstrated agreement with the density/sound velocity meter method. Experiments with starch null sta6 mutant C. reinhardtii cells demonstrated that the effective ACF can transition from positive to zero and eventually become negative as microalgae cells accumulate lipids. The dynamic nature of the ACF represents an opportunity and a challenge for acoustic harvesting of algal cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Liquefaction of sewage sludge (SS) is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil (target product) and biochar (by-product). The liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent were preliminarily investigated in this study. There existed synergetic effects between ethanol and water on the liquefaction of SS. Higher bio-oil yield (33.5–36.1 wt%) were obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent, compared to those in pure water (32.2 wt%) and pure ethanol (26.8 wt%). Furthermore, the bio-oil obtained in ethanol-water cosolvent contained higher content of ester components, suggesting higher bio-oil quality. The addition of Na2CO3 further increased the yield of bio-oil (37.5 wt% versus 34.9 wt%), but lowered the quality of bio-oil. The main two types of coke oils in bio-oils were diesel oils and lubricating oils. Elemental, proximate and micromorphology analyses of biochars further indicated that ethanol-water cosolvent had better degradation/transformation effects on SS. The biochars obtained from the liquefaction of SS in ethanol-water cosolvent possessed similar specific surface area (23.0–26.0 m2/g) and pore volume (0.118–0.141 cm3/g) to SS pyrolysis biochar. In view of the yield and quality of liquefaction products, ethanol-water cosolvent may be more proper for the liquefaction of SS, compared to pure water/ethanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to determine the productivity and energy values of 10 poplar cultivars for use as potential fuel sources in Poland. The study was conducted over a seven-year cycle in northern Poland. The cultivars belonged to clones traditionally used for timber production, as well as new clones specific to short-rotation coppice (SRC) practices. Biomass production and biomass properties were measured, including elemental composition, the gross and net calorific values (heating value) of wood, and envelope density. For each cultivar, the synthetic fuel value index (FVI) was calculated. Biomass dry matter (DM) production differed noticeably between cultivars, and it was the highest for traditional cultivars (‘NE-42’ and ‘Fritzi Pauley’, amounting to 8 Mg ha−1 yr−1), and the lowest for new cultivars (DM was one-third that of the cultivars with the highest production). Two traditional cultivars (‘NE-42’ and ‘Fritzi Pauley’) had the highest FVI, representing potential biofuels, whereas two new SRC cultivars (‘AF-8’ and ‘AF-2’) had the lowest indexes. Overall, poplar plantations with short rotations could be considered as a potential additional source of renewable energy in Poland. However, the key factor is selection of appropriate genotypes for the specific climatic conditions. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the importance of testing cultivars under local climatic conditions before using them at a commercial scale. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Approximately 20% of wastewaters globally do not receive treatment, whereas wastewater discharges are projected to increase, thereby leading to excessive water quality degradation of surface waters on a global scale. Increased treatment could help alleviate water quality issues by constructing more treatment plants; however, in many areas there exist economic constraints. Energy recovery methods including the utilization of biogas and incineration of biosolids generated during the treatment process may help to alleviate treatment costs. This study explores the potential for investments in energy recovery from wastewater to increase treatment levels and thus improve surface water quality. This was done by examining the relationships between nutrient over-enrichment, wastewater treatment, and energy recovery at a global scale using system dynamics simulation as part of the ANEMI integrated assessment model. The results show that a significant amount of energy can be recovered from wastewater, which helps to alleviate some of the costs of treatment. It was found that wastewater treatment levels could be increased by 34%, helping to offset the higher nutrient loading from a growing population with access to improved sanitation. The production of renewable natural gas from biogas was found to have the potential to prolong the depletion of natural gas resources used to produce electricity and heat. It is recommended that agricultural nutrient discharges be better managed to help reduce nutrient over-enrichment on global scale. To increase the utility of the simulation, a finer spatial scale should be used to consider regional treatment, economic, and water quality characteristics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The applicability of microbial structure analyses and gene quantification to understand microbial conditions was evaluated. The results show that information from gene analyses is useful in managing anaerobic co-digestion and damaged microbes in addition to conventional parameters like total solids, pH and biogas production. Total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers are the most useful tools for evaluating unstable anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, rather than mcrA and total archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, and high-throughput sequencing. First order decay rates of gene copy numbers during pH failure were higher than typical decay rates of microbes in stable operation. The sequencing analyses, including multidimensional scaling, showed very different microbial structure shifts, but the results were not consistent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of the present investigation was to optimize the pyrolysis condition of an abundantly available and low cost perennial grass of north-east India Saccharum ravannae L. (S. ravannae) using response surface methodology based on central composite design. Kinetic study of the biomass was conducted at four different heating rates of 10, 20, 40 and 60 °C min−1 and results were interpreted by Friedman, Kissinger Akira Sunnose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods. Average activation energy 151.45 kJ mol−1 was used for evaluation of reaction mechanism following Criado master plot. Maximum bio-oil yield of 38.1 wt% was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, heating rate of 20 °C min−1 and nitrogen flow rate of 226 mL min−1. Study on bio-oil quality revealed higher content of hydrocarbon, antioxidant property, total phenolic content and metal chelating capacity. These opened up probable applications of S. ravannae bio-oil in different fields including fuel, food industry and biomedical domain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Texas High Plains (THP), which is an important cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growing region in the United States faces challenges from declining/deteriorating groundwater levels/quality, recurring droughts and severe wind erosion. Growing cover crops after harvesting cotton and/or changing land use from cotton to perennial bioenergy crops could not only address above challenges, but also assist in meeting the national biofuel target. The objective of this study is to assess the implications of changes in land use (replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus) and crop management (growing winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop) on hydrology and wind erosion in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos Watershed using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. Simulated average annual wind erosion, total nitrogen (TN) loss to surface water and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching to groundwater reduced by more than 37%, 43% and 73%, respectively, when winter wheat was grown as a cover crop under the 457 mm (18-inch) annual groundwater pumping limit setup by the High Plains Water District. In addition, winter wheat produced about 0.20–0.26 kg m−2 of biomass for biofuel purposes. Land use change from irrigated cotton to switchgrass and rainfed cotton to Miscanthus decreased the TN load, NO3-N leaching and soil loss by wind erosion by &gt; 89% relative to the baseline scenario. Under the groundwater pumping restrictions, multiple harvests of perennial grasses were found to be better in terms of biomass production (&gt;2 kg m−2), and protection of groundwater and soil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite concerted efforts to innovate the solid waste management (SWM) system, land disposal continues to represent the most widely used technology in the treatment of urban solid waste worldwide. On the other hand, landfilling is an unavoidable step in closing the material cycle, since final residues, although minimized, need to be safely disposed of and confined. In recent years, the implementation of more sustainable landfilling aims to achieve the Final Storage Quality conditions as fast as possible. In particular, semi-aerobic landfill appears to represent an effective solution for use in the poorest economies due to lower management costs and shorter aftercare resulting from aerobic stabilisation of the waste. Nevertheless, the implementation of a semi-aerobic landfill in a tropical climate may affect the correct functioning of the plant: a lack of moisture during the dry season and heavy rainfalls during the wet season could negatively affect performance of both the degradation process, and of leachate and biogas management. This paper illustrates the results obtained through the experimentation of a potential dual-step management of semi-aerobic landfilling in a tropical climate in which composting process was reproduced during the dry season and subsequently flushing (high rainfall rate) during the wet period. Eight bioreactors specifically designed: four operated under anaerobic conditions and four under semi-aerobic conditions; half of the reactors were filled with high organic content waste, half with residual waste obtained following enhanced source segregation. The synergic effect of the subsequent phases (composting and flushing) in the semi-aerobic landfill was evaluated on the basis of both types of waste. Biogas production, leachate composition and waste stabilization were analysed during the trial and at the end of each step, and compared in view of the performance of anaerobic reactors. The results obtained underlined the effectiveness of the dual-step management evidencing how wastes reached a higher degree of stabilization and reference FSQ values for leachate were achieved over a one-year simulation period. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the biofuel production ability and potential of heavy metal remediation of Chlorella sp. ISTLA1 isolated from a landfill site. The strain was cultured in Bold's Basal medium at different concentration of NaHCO3 and pH. Response surface methodology was employed for the optimization of nutrient sources for higher lipid production. Under the optimized conditions, the yield of lipid and biomass was 365.42 and 833.14 mg L−1 respectively. GC–MS analysis of lipid indicated the presence of C8 to C31 organic compounds consisting mainly of palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1). Additionally, remediation of heavy metals like Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe from waste water was observed by AAS and EDX. The removal efficiency was 82.6% for Zn, 56.5% for Cu, 79.8% for Mn and 40% for Fe. The study revealed simultaneous biodiesel production and waste water treatment by Chlorella sp. ISTLA1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced biofuels, when used as components in fuels, offer advantages over fossil-based hydrocarbons and conventional biofuels to realize highly efficient and clean propulsion systems. Among the several chemical routes to produce biofuels, special attention is given to gas-liquid heterogeneous catalyzed reactions to reduce carbohydrate derived platform building blocks. Supercritical reactors offer opportunities to enhance yield of these type of reactions. In this review, we present studies that take advantage of supercritical technologies to reduce platform biobased molecules. In addition, we discuss related high-pressure phase equilibrium experimental data and modeling tools available, as well as the gaps and needs, for engineering supercritical reactors to produce advanced biofuels. Due to the possibility of tuning solubility with density, opportunities arise in the use of supercritical fluids in combined reaction and separation processes. In this regard, the design of less energy intensive processes is needed to boost the production of advanced biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the relatively low investment, operation costs, and technical requirements, landfills are still the most widespread alternative for final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW). The biogas produced in the landfill, a renewable energy source, may be an important alternative for electric power generation. Brazil has a significant number of operating landfills, which receive the most part of the collected MSW. However, the country has only 17 landfill biogas power plants (LBPPs), resulting in about 122 MW of capacity. The United Kingdom, for instance, which is about 3 times smaller than Brazil in population, has 442 LBPPs (corresponding to 1051 MW of capacity). This fact highlights a considerable unexplored potential of landfill biogas in Brazil. It is also important to estimate this potential throughout the country to provide information for the government, researchers and companies in decision making, planning and formulation of public policies regarding this use of landfill biogas. Therefore, this study aims at estimating the spatially distributed potential of landfill biogas production that can be used for electric power generation in Brazil from 2015 to 2045, considering two scenarios: (i) operating sanitary landfills and (ii) hypothetical scenario of Territorial Arrangements (TA) comprising every Brazilian city, considering one landfill per TA. The total installed capacity estimated in 2018 for scenario 1 is about 523 MW and 87% of this number are related to LBPPs bigger than 1 MW. In this same year, the total installed capacity estimated for scenario 2 is 768 MW and 95% of this number are related to LBPPs bigger than 1 MW. These results emphasize that Brazil has a considerable unexplored potential of landfill biogas and the importance of municipal consortiums for MSW management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production has the potential to improve soils and the environment. However, little is known about the long-term future assessment of soil and environmental impacts associated with switchgrass production. In this study, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nitrate (NO- 3), water-filled pore space (WFPS), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and biomass yield from switchgrass field were predicted using DAYCENT models for 2016 through 2050. Measured data for model calibration and validation at this study site managed with nitrogen fertilization rates (N rates) (low, 0 kg N ha−1; medium, 56 kg N ha−1; and high, 112 kg N ha−1) and landscape positions (shoulder and footslope) for switchgrass production were collected from the previously published studies. Modeling results showed that the N fertilization can enhance SOC and soil NO3 −, but increase soil N2O and CO2 fluxes. In this study, medium N fertilization was the optimum rate for enhancing switchgrass yield and reducing negative impact on the environment. Footslope position can be beneficial for improving SOC, NO- 3, and yield, but contribute higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to those of the shoulder. An increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation (climate scenarios) may reduce soil NO-3, WFPS, and N2O flux. Switchgrass production can improve and maintain SOC and NO- 3, and reduce N2O and CO2 fluxes over the predicted years. These findings indicate that switchgrass could be a sustainable bioenergy crop on marginally yielding lands for improving soils without significant negative impacts on the environment in the long run. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) and Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) Synfuels have been the two most significant alternatives for the transportation liquid fuels. But their performance in resource depletion, economic investment, and environmental impacts differs greatly from the conventional refinery. For comparing the strengths and the weakness of each alternative, a quantitative trade-off procedure is required. However, a few researches have discussed such trade-off procedures. In this paper, the life cycle inventories, production cost, and Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) of BTL and CTL in China are investigated to compare the pros and cons of each Synfuel. Herewith, the ECEC is taken as a metric for the ecological burden, providing a significant way to integrate the life cycle resource, economic, and environmental factors of Synfuels for the sustainability assessments. The results demonstrated that the shifting of petroleum to BTL reduced the CO2 emission by 98% but relatively increased the water consumption and wastewater. The production cost-breakeven crude oil price with BTL is about 98 $/bbl without considering the taxes, and it could be decreased to 50 $/bbl according to China's tax policy. More importantly, BTL could cut as high as 65% of the overall ecological burden so that would be much more beneficial to the sustainable development of the fuel industry. On the other hand, the economic effectiveness of CTL is relatively reliable, where its production cost-breakeven crude oil price is below 70 $/bbl. However, 10.7 t of CO2 are created for each tonne of CTL, which is 3.3 times to conventional petroleum, and three times of water is consumed in the whole. The ECEC analysis also indicates that the shifting of crude oil to coal for transportation fuels will almost double the overall ecological burden and pose threats to the safety and sustainability of the entire fuel industry at which the cautions should be paid. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing valuable coproducts from oleaginous microalgae is an option to reduce the total cost of biofuel production. Here, the influence of nitrogen sources on biomass yield and lipid accumulation of a newly identified oleaginous green microalgal strain, Mychonastes afer HSO-3-1, was evaluated. Carbon assimilation and the following lipid biosynthesis of M. afer were inhibited to some extent under weak acidic conditions (6 &lt; pH &lt; 7) and any of the tested nitrogen source. The highest lipid productivity of 50.7 mg L−1 day−1 was achieved with a 17.6 mM nitrogen supplement in the form of urea. The cell polar lipid content was significantly higher than triacylglycerol (TAG), and saturated palmitic acid (C16:0) occupied a dominant position in the fatty acid profiles while culturing M. afer in acidic medium with NH4 + as the nitrogen source. Under neutral conditions, the lipid productivities of M. afer cultivated in media containing 17.6 mM of NaNO3, NH4Cl, and NH4NO3 were 76.2, 77.5, and 79.0 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. The greatest TAG content (58.56%) of total lipids was obtained when NaNO3 was used as the nitrogen source. There was no significant difference in the fatty acid composition of M. afer cells when they were cultivated in neutral media supplemented with NaNO3, urea, NH4Cl, and NH4NO3. Therefore, NH4 + was not a suitable nitrogen source for M. afer cultivation due to the additional labor, working procedures, and alkali required to adjust the medium pH. Considering that using urea as nitrogen source could reduce the cost of nutrient salts substantially and urea can be taken up and utilized by most microalgae, it is a preferred nitrogen source. The major properties of biodiesel derived from M. afer HSO-3-1 met biodiesel quality, and nervonic acid concentrations remained at approximately 3.0% of total fatty acids. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Considering the urgent need to shift to low carbon energy carriers, waste wood resources could provide an alternative energy feedstock and at the same time reduce emissions from landfill. This research examines the climate change impacts and related emission uncertainties of waste wood based energy. For this, different grades of waste wood and energy application have been investigated using lifecycle assessment. Sensitivity analysis has then been applied for supply chain processes and feedstock properties for the main emission contributing categories: transport, processing, pelletizing, urea resin fraction and related N2O formation. The results show, depending on the waste wood grade, the conversion option, scale and the related reference case, that emission reductions of up to 91% are possible for non-treated wood waste. Compared to this, energy from treated wood waste with low contamination can achieve up to 83% emission savings, similar to untreated waste wood pellets, but in some cases emissions from waste wood based energy can exceed the ones of the fossil fuel reference - in the worst case by 126%. Emission reductions from highly contaminated feedstocks are largest when replacing electricity from large-scale coal and landfill. The highest emission uncertainties are related to the wood's resin fraction and N2O formation during combustion and, pelletizing. Comparing wood processing with diesel and electricity powered equipment also generated high variations in the results, while emission variations related to transport are relatively small. Using treated waste wood as a bioenergy feedstock can be a valid option to reduce emissions from energy production but this is only realisable if coal and landfill gas are replaced. To achieve meaningful emission reduction in line with national and international climate change targets, pre-treatment of waste wood would be required to reduce components that form N2O during the energy conversion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Noncompetitive carbon sources such as algae are unconventional and promising raw material for sustainable biofuel production. The capability of one marine bacterium, Saccharophagus degradans 2–40 to degrade red seaweed Gelidium amansii for production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) was evaluated in this study. S. degradans can readily attach to algae, degrade algal carbohydrates, and utilize that material as main carbon source. Minimal media containing 8 g/L G. amansii were used for the growth of S. degradans. The PHA content obtained was 17–27% of dry cell weight by pure culture of S. degradans and co-culture of S. degradans and Bacillus cereus, a contaminant found with S. degradans cultures. The PHA type was found to be poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) by gas chromatography and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. This work demonstrates PHA production through consolidated bioprocessing of insoluble, untreated red algae by bacterial pure culture and co-culture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Lithuania about 201 PJ of energy is consumed annually and heat energy amounts to two-thirds of the total energy used. Biofuel combustion plants built in the country in 2000–2015 produce more than 1500 MW of power. The increasing demand for raw material compels a search for alternative sources. The promising crops for enhancement of biomass resources are high-yielding perennial herbaceous energy plants. Yield and yield variations of A.dubia Wall. with and without the application of nitrogen fertilizer were determined. The highest biomass productivity of 26.99 ± 6.88 t ha−1 was achieved at the second growing year. The average moisture content was 59.2 ± 0.83% in A. dubia harvested in October, but only 10.98 ± 0.60% in A.dubia harvested in March. Also, the influence of ventilation intensity on the drying processes and on variation of physical and thermal properties of A. dubia was determined in this study. On the basis of the research carried out, by simulation of A. dubia growth and the biofuel production technologies, energy efficiency indices of thermal conversion were determined. For pellet production and thermal conversion of pellets, the energy efficiency index varied in the range of (7–10):1; for A.dubia biomass combustion, it varied in the range of (15–20):1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are promising candidate for biofuels as well as precursors for many high value products like polyunsaturated fatty acids, pigments or polysaccharides. Major cultivation of microalgae is carried out in open raceway ponds. Conventional raceway pond designs with paddle wheels have limitations such as high capital investment, inefficient mixing, lower depth (approximately 0.3 m) and lower productivity. In the present work, a modified high depth (1 m) raceway pond design with side entry axial flow impeller has been studied. The higher depth decreases the land requirement as well as capital cost. The pilot scale (4.5 m3) studies for cultivation of Spirullinaplatensis in nutrient rich Zarrouk's culture media have shown productivity of 21.22 gm/m2/day compared to 11.05 gm/m2/day in convectional raceway ponds. The specific power consumption was found to be 4 W/gm in modified design compared to 6 W/gm in conventional design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis shows that modified design minimized the excessive turbulence generation and provided higher convective currents keeping biomass in suspension. The simulation results have been validated with ultrasonic velocity profiler (UVP) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluates environmental impacts of an integrated mixed crop-livestock system with a green biorefinery (GBR). System integration included production of feed crops and green biomasses (Sys-I) to meet the demand of a livestock system (Sys-III) and to process green biomasses in a GBR system (Sys-II). Processing of grass-clover to produce feed protein was considered in Sys-II, particularly to substitute the imported soybean meal. Waste generated from the livestock and GBR systems were considered for the conversion to biomethane (Sys-IV). Digestate produced therefrom was assumed to be recirculated back to the farmers' field (Sys-I). A consequential approach of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a combined production of suckler cow calves (SCC) and Pigs, calculated in terms of their live weight (LW). The functional unit (FU) was a basket of two products “1 kgLW-SCC + 1 kgLW-Pigs”, produced at the farm gate. Results obtained per FU were: 19.6 kg CO2 eq for carbon footprint; 0.11 kg PO4 eq for eutrophication potential, − 129 MJ eq for non-renewable energy use and − 3.9 comparative toxicity units (CTUe) for potential freshwater ecotoxicity. Environmental impact, e.g. greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was primarily due to (i) N2O emission and diesel consumption within Sys-I, (ii) energy input to Sys-II, III and IV, and (iii) methane emission from Sys-III and Sys-IV. Specifically, integrating GBR with the mixed crop-livestock system contributed 4% of the GHG emissions, whilst its products credited 7% of the total impact. Synergies among the different sub-systems showed positive environmental gains for the selected main products. The main effects of the system integration were in the reductions of GHG emissions, fossil fuel consumption, eutrophication potential and freshwater ecotoxicity, compared to a conventional mixed crop-livestock system, without the biogas conversion facility and the GBR. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel and efficient bioprocess from sodium hydroxide pretreated corn stover (SHPCS) or sodium hydroxide pretreated rice straw (SHPRS) to ethanol was successfully established, where the on-site cellulase production by the mixed culture of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger was used, producing 3.63 ± 0.35 FPIU/mL cellulase from SHPCS and 2.56 ± 0.33 FPIU/mL cellulase from SHPRS, respectively. Then those cellulases were applied to the enzymatic saccharification of SHPCS and SHPRS respectively, leading to yields of 81.5 ± 1.2% and 70.5 ± 2.1% respectively. Subsequently, SHPCS and SHPRS enzymatic hydrolysates mainly containing glucose and xylose were fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing 27.6 ± 1.5 and 21.7 ± 1.9 g/L ethanol respectively. Concurrent with the distillation of fermentation broths for ethanol separation, the residual xylose was concentrated about 3 times. Thereafter, the distillation residues from SHPCS and SHPRS containing xylose were fermented by the adapted Pichia stipistis, producing 16.6 ± 1.1 and 13.0 ± 0.9 g/L ethanol respectively. In sum, the bioprocess could produce 33.1 g ethanol from 113.20 g SHPCS and 26.0 g ethanol from 117.58 g SHPRS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of oleaginous bacteria to produce lipid-based biofuels from organic waste is an emerging approach. The present study was designed to isolate oleaginous bacteria capable of growing on food-processing waste to produce bio-fuels on a sustainable basis. About 26 oleaginous bacteria were isolated from natural crude oils using Luria-Bertani (LB) medium under nitrogen-deficient conditions. The GC–MS analysis confirmed the ability of 10 isolates to produce free fatty acids, where oleic acid appeared to be the most recurring compound among the identified fatty acids. The results of aerobic wet digestion (batch mode) showed the potential of the strain KM15 for simultaneous lipid accumulation and waste treatment. Among different types of waste, removal of volatile solids (VS) up to 38.5% and oxidizable organic matter removal (COD-based) up to 48.9% was achieved by strain KM15, while simultaneously showing an accumulation of lipids up to 41.5% in 96 h. The degradation efficiency of organic matter was 30.9% and 31% for apple and orange waste after 96 h with a lipid accumulation of 21% and 25% respectively. Overall, Bacillus cerus strain KM15 was the most effective strain in the degradation of mango waste and, correspondingly, the production of biolipids from waste. This study illustrates the concept of biorefinery for sustainable waste management and simultaneous production of lipid-based biofuels. The use of waste as the sole source of nutrition could be a key factor in reducing the total production cost of lipid-based bacteriological biorefineries. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - With growing concerns about climate change, countries are increasing efforts to reduce dependency on fossil energy sources, the major source of CO2, by replacing them with cleaner energy sources including bioenergy. In this context, the global bioenergy market has grown massively during the last few decades. In addition, under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, 162 countries have already submitted their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to mitigate climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions pledges and action plans. Hence, the effect of these GHG restrictions on the bioenergy sector in the new expected global decarbonized energy system needs to be addressed. In this study, we estimate what role the international climate agreement could play in bioenergy sector expansion using the bottom-up energy system optimization model, TIAM-FR, a TIMES family model from ETSAP/IEA. As results, GHG restrictions promoted global bioenergy supply over the time horizon 2010–2050. In 2050, global biomass supply reaches 131–138 EJ under these climate scenarios, which is more than double biomass supply in the BAU scenario (60 EJ). In final bioenergy consumption, in 2050, only 3–5 EJ is consumed as biofuel in transport sector while 60 EJ of biomass is consumed for different uses in other sectors and more than 40% of total supplied biomass produces heat and electricity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this work was to assess biomass and grain yields, path modelling of yield components, and perenniality in 97 Sorghum bicolor x S. halepense (SB x SH) lines, and compare their biomass production to a series of 38 historic (1987–2015) biomass SB trials. Perenniality was evaluated as rhizome overwintering, while other traits were scored using standard procedures. Contrary to SB, several SB x SH lines developed rhizomes and overwintered, depending mostly upon increased dosage of SH genome in SB background. A few backcross-derived SB x SH lines overwintered, indicating that perenniality can be introgressed in sorghum using backcrossing approach. SB x SH lines were competitive in terms of grain and aboveground dry biomass yields compared to SB. SB x SH selections outperformed or were comparable to the best commercial biomass SB hybrid checks, and ranked among the best selections from the historic trials. Grain yield in SB x SH lines depended mainly on number of culms, whereas biomass yields depended mainly on plant height, dry mass and fiber mass fractions of dry material, and number of culms. We identified superior dual purpose SB x SH genotypes producing 5–11 and 38–45 t ha−1 of grain and aboveground biomass, respectively, most of which displayed satisfactory overwintering rates (56–100%) and high levels of fiber (61–69%) mass fraction. These lines represent high energy sorghums suitable for biofuel and food production. The best SB x SH crosses for developing perennial biomass and grain sorghums were represented by perennial/perennial, annual/perennial/perennial, and annual/perennial combinations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bioconversion of lignocellulose in various industrial processes, such as biofuel production, requires the degradation of cellulose. Actinomadura amylolytica YIM 77502T is an aerobic, Gram-positive actinomycete that can efficiently degrade crystalline cellulose by extracellular cellulases. Genomic analysis of A. amylolytica identified 9 cellulase and 11 β-glucosidase genes that could potentially encode proteins that digest cellulose. Extracellular proteome characterization of A. amylolytica cell-free culture supernatant by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 4 of these cellulases and 2 of these β-glucosidases functioned during cellulose hydrolysis. Thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed extracellular β-glucosidases play a major role in carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) degradation of products in culture supernatants. In this study, 2 of the identified secreted β-glucosidases, AaBGL1 and AaBGL2, were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and found to have β-glucosidase activity with wide substrate specificities, including for p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside (pNPC), and cellobiose. Moreover, AaBGL1 and AaBGL2 had high tolerances for glucose. After adding these β-glucosidases to commercial cellulases, the degradation rates of CMC, Avicel, birch sawdust, and corncob powder increased by 37, 42, 33, and 9%, respectively. Overall, this work identifies an alternative potential source of β-glucosidases with potential applications in commercial cellulose utilization and the bioenergy industry. © Copyright © 2018 Yin, Sang, Xian, Li, Jiao, Liu, Hozzein, Xiao and Li.

AB  - Climate suitability of 4 major energy species,i.e. sweet sorghum,cassava,switchgrass and Jatropha curcas, in marginal land in China was assessed according to the regional meteorological resources. Production potential of liquid biofuels and economic benefits of these 4 energy species were quantitatively compared in this study. The results showed that the suitable land for sweet sorghum,cassava,switchgrass and Jatropha curcas is 218.65×104,18.82×104,208.67× 104,and 46.19×104 hm2 respectively in cultivatable marginal land in China. The ethanol fuel production potential of sweet sorghum,cassava or switchgrass in suitable marginal land is 648.82× 104,23.85× 104 or 633.63× 104 tonnes respectively. And biodiesel production potential of Jatropha curcas is 40.42×104 tonnes. Comparing with Jatropha curcas and switchgrass,sweet sorghum and cassava have higher economic benefits for producing liquid biofuels,which can reach 2940 and 1322 ¥/hm2 in the most suitable marginal land. © 2018, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

AB  - Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a negative-emissions technology that may play a crucial role in climate change mitigation. BECCS relies on the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) following bioenergy production to remove and reliably sequester atmospheric CO2. Previous BECCS deployment assessments have largely overlooked the potential lack of spatial colocation of suitable storage basins and biomass availability, in the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. These conditions could constrain the near-term technical deployment potential of BECCS due to social and economic barriers that exist for biomass and CO2 transport. This study leverages biomass production data and site-specific injection and storage capacity estimates at high spatial resolution to assess the near-term deployment opportunities for BECCS in the United States. If the total biomass resource available in the United States was mobilized for BECCS, an estimated 370 Mt CO2·y−1 of negative emissions could be supplied in 2020. However, the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport, as well as limitations imposed by unsuitable regional storage and injection capacities, collectively decrease the technical potential of negative emissions to 100 Mt CO2·y−1. Meeting this technical potential may require large-scale deployment of BECCS technology in more than 1,000 counties, as well as widespread deployment of dedicated energy crops. Specifically, the Illinois basin, Gulf region, and western North Dakota have the greatest potential for near-term BECCS deployment. High-resolution spatial assessment as conducted in this study can inform near-term opportunities that minimize social and economic barriers to BECCS deployment. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Changes in fire activity across regions around the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood, especially under the recent warming and drying trends. In this work, we report records of the specific fire tracer levoglucosan in a central Tibetan ice core, indicating a rapid increase in wildfires across the Himalayas and surroundings at the beginning of the 21st century. The climate system, especially precipitation changes, modulates the annual variability of wildfires in regions around the Tibetan Plateau. Decreasing premonsoon precipitation has prolonged the dry seasons across Himalayan regions affected by the Indian summer monsoon; meanwhile, increasing precipitation over the arid and semiarid Indus River Plain promotes plant growth and thereby increases biofuel availability. These trends have therefore induced increased frequencies of strong wildfires in the Himalayas and surroundings. Increasing strong wildfire events can potentially enhance black carbon deposits on Himalayan glaciers, which would impact glacial melting during the premonsoon wildfire seasons in the near future. ©2018.

AB  - The demand for cellulosic biofuels is on the rise because of the anticipation for sustainable energy and less greenhouse gas emissions in the future. However, production of cellulosic biofuels, especially cellulosic butanol, has been hampered by the lack of potent microbes that are capable of converting cellulosic biomass into biofuels. We report a wild-type Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain TG57, which is capable of using microcrystalline cellulose directly to produce butanol (1.93 g/liter) as the only final product (without any acetone or ethanol produced), comparable to that of engineered microbes thus far. Strain TG57 exhibits significant advances including unique genes responsible for a new butyrate synthesis pathway, no carbon catabolite repression, and the absence of genes responsible for acetone synthesis (which is observed as the main by-product in most Clostridium strains known today). Furthermore, the use of glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose posed a selection pressure to facilitate isolation of strain TG57 with deletion/silencing of carbon catabolite repressor genes-the ccr and xylR genes-and thus is able to simultaneously ferment glucose, xylose, and arabinose to produce butanol (7.33 g/liter) as the sole solvent. Combined analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data revealed unusual aspects of genome organization, numerous determinants for unique bioconversions, regulation of central metabolic pathways, and distinct transcriptomic profiles. This study provides a genome-level understanding of how cellulose is metabolized by T. thermosaccharolyticum and sheds light on the potential of competitive and sustainable biofuel production. © 2018 The Authors, some Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is a thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium that efficiently deconstructs lignocellulosic biomass into sugars, which subsequently can be fermented into alcohols, such as ethanol, and other products. Deconstruction of complex substrates by C. bescii involves a myriad of highly abundant, substrate-specific extracellular solute binding proteins (ESBPs) and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) containing carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was employed to investigate how these substrate recognition proteins and enzymes vary as a function of lignocellulosic substrates. Results: Proteomic analysis revealed several key extracellular proteins that respond specifically to either C5 or C6 mono- and polysaccharides. These include proteins of unknown functions (PUFs), ESBPs, and CAZymes. ESBPs that were previously shown to interact more efficiently with hemicellulose and pectin were detected in high abundance during growth on complex C5 substrates, such as switchgrass and xylan. Some proteins, such as Athe-0614 and Athe-2368, whose functions are not well defined were predicted to be involved in xylan utilization and ABC transport and were significantly more abundant in complex and C5 substrates, respectively. The proteins encoded by the entire glucan degradation locus (GDL; Athe-1857, 1859, 1860, 1865, 1867, and 1866) were highly abundant under all growth conditions, particularly when C. bescii was grown on cellobiose, switchgrass, or xylan. In contrast, the glycoside hydrolases Athe-0609 (Pullulanase) and 0610, which both possess CBM20 and a starch binding domain, appear preferential to C5/complex substrate deconstruction. Some PUFs, such as Athe-2463 and 2464, were detected as highly abundant when grown on C5 substrates (xylan and xylose), also suggesting C5-substrate specificity. Conclusions: This study reveals the protein membership of the C. bescii secretome and demonstrates its plasticity based on the complexity (mono-/disaccharides vs. polysaccharides) and type of carbon (C5 vs. C6) available to the microorganism. The presence or increased abundance of extracellular proteins as a response to specific substrates helps to further elucidate C. bescii's utilization and conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and other valuable products. This includes improved characterization of extracellular proteins that lack discrete functional roles and are poorly/not annotated. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In the biofuel industry, land productivity is important to feedstock growers and conversion process product yield is important to the biorefinery. The crop productivity, however, may not positively correlate with bioconversion yield. Therefore, it is important to evaluate sugar yield and biomass productivity. In this study, 2-year-old poplar trees harvested in the first coppice cycle, including one low-productivity hybrid and one high-productivity hybrid, were collected from two poplar tree farms. Through steam pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, the bioconversion yields of low- and high-productivity poplar hybrids were compared for both sites. Results: The low-productivity hybrids had 9-19% higher sugar yields than the high-productivity hybrids, although they have the similar chemical composition. Economic calculations show the impact on the plantation and biorefinery of using the two feedstocks. Growing a high-productivity hybrid means the land owner would use 11-26% less land (which could be used for other crops) or collect 2.53-$3.46 MM/year extra revenue from the surplus feedstock. On the other side, the biorefinery would receive 5-10% additional revenue using the low-productivity hybrid. Conclusion: We propose a business model based on the integration of the plantation and the biorefinery. In this model, different feedstocks are assessed using a metric of product tonnage per unit land per year. Use of this new economic metric bridges the gap between feedstock growers and users to maximize the overall production efficiency. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - A broad methanotrophic community consisting of 16 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was detected by particulate methane monooxygenase A (pmoA) gene analyses of reactor sludge samples obtained from an industrial biogas plant. Using a cloning-sequencing approach, 75% of the OTUs were affiliated to the group of type I methanotrophs (γ-Proteobacteria) and 25% to type II methanotrophs (α-Proteobacteria) with a distinct predominance of the genus Methylobacter. By database matching, half of the total OTUs may constitute entirely novel species. For evaluation of process conditions that support growth of methanotrophic bacteria, qPCR analyses of pmoA gene copy numbers were performed during a sampling period of 70 days at varying reactor feeding scenarios. During the investigation period, methanotrophic cell counts estimated by qPCR fluctuated between 3.4 × 104 and 2 × 105 cells/mL with no distinct correlation to the organic loading rate, the amount of CH4, O2 and NH4-N. Methanotrophic activity was proofed even at low O2 levels (1%) by using stable carbon isotope labelling experiments of CH4 in batch experiments inoculated with reactor sludge. Supplementation of 13C labelled CH4 in the headspace of the reaction vials unambiguously confirmed the formation of 13C labelled CO2. Thus, industrial biogas reactors can be considered as a further methanotrophic habitat that exhibits a unique methanotrophic community which is specifically adapted to high CH4 and low O2 concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first accurate detection and quantification of methanotrophic bacteria in industrial biogas reactors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Communal anaerobic digesters (ADs) have been promoted as a waste-to-energy strategy that can provide sanitation and clean energy co-benefits. However, little empirical evidence is available regarding the performance of such systems in field conditions. This study assesses the wastewater treatment efficiency, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and financial costs and benefits of communal ADs used for domestic wastewater treatment in Zambia. Primary data on the technical performance of 15 ADs were collected over a 6-month period and in-person interviews were conducted with heads of 120 households. Findings from this study suggest that ADs offer comparable wastewater treatment efficiencies and greater GHG emission reduction benefits relative to conventional septic tanks (STs), with the greatest benefits in settings with reliable access to water, use of low efficiency solid fuels and with sufficient demand for biogas in proximity to supply. However, absent a mechanism to monetize additional benefits from biogas recovery, ADs in this context will not be a financially attractive investment relative to STs. Our financial analysis suggests that, under the conditions in this study, a carbon price of US$9 to $28 per tCO2e is necessary for positive investment in ADs relative to STs. Findings from this study contribute empirical evidence on ADs as a sanitation and clean energy strategy, identify conditions under which the greatest benefits are likely to accrue and inform international climate efforts on the carbon price required to attract investment in emissions reduction projects such as ADs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates bed agglomeration during fast pyrolysis of bio-oil in a fluidized-bed reactor at temperatures of 500-800 °C. The samples used include bio-oil, bio-oil water-soluble fraction (WSF), bio-oil water-insoluble fraction (WIF), and selected model compounds. Increasing pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 800 °C decreases the agglomeration yields of bio-oil, WSF, and WIF from 40% to 15%, 26.2% to 11.6%, and 15.0% to 5.2%, respectively. Investigation using model compounds suggests that the interactions between lignin-derived oligomers and sugar are mainly responsible for the high bed agglomeration yields of bio-oil and WSF, and such interactions weaken as pyrolysis temperature increases. Water has an insignificant effect on bed agglomeration during bio-oil or WSF pyrolysis. The results also show that the bed agglomeration yield and the formation of tar (and/or coke) are in broad linear correlations, indicating that the tar (and/or coke) formed during fast pyrolysis contributes to the bed agglomeration of bio-oil. The linear correlation from the data of bio-oil has a steeper gradient compared to that of WSF and WIF, clearly indicating the synergy taking place between the WSF and WIF during fast pyrolysis in enhancing bed agglomeration. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The “Corn Belt” is a commonly used term, but often referenced as a vaguely defined region in the Midwest USA. A few key studies have delineated synoptic maps of the Corn Belt boundaries going back to the early 20th century, but a modern flexible and accessible framework for mapping the Corn Belt in space and time is needed. New tools provide reference maps for the Corn Belt in the 21st century and the ability to quantify space-time changes in corn cropping patterns. The Landuse and Agricultural Management Practices web-Service (LAMPS) was used to estimate the average corn (maize, Zea mays L.) area in each county of the contiguous 48 USA states for the years 2010–2016. LAMPS provides a modified areal Fraction of corn (Fc) used to map the Corn Belt at three intensity levels, for example. The resulting patterns illustrate a mostly contiguous Midwest Corn Belt surrounded by more scattered regions, including southern and eastern regions. We also mapped irrigated areas and temporal changes in Fc. Mapped patterns have the potential to help researchers study issues related to food, feed, biofuel, and water security. © 2017

AB  - Five currently used methods to account for the global warming (GW) impact of the induced land-use change (LUC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been applied to four biofuel case studies. Two of the investigated methods attempt to avoid the need of considering a definite occupation –thus amortization– period by considering ongoing LUC trends as a dynamic baseline. This leads to the accounting of a small fraction (0.8%) of the related emissions from the assessed LUC, thus their validity is disputed. The comparison of methods and contrasting case studies illustrated the need of clearly distinguishing between the different time horizons involved in life cycle assessments (LCA) of land-demanding products like biofuels. Absent in ISO standards, and giving rise to several confusions, definitions for the following time horizons have been proposed: technological scope, inventory model, impact characterization, amortization/occupation, plantation lifetime and harvesting frequency. It is suggested that the anticipated technical lifetime of biorefineries using energy crops as feedstock stands as the best proxy for the cut-off criterion of land's occupation period and the inventory modeling period. Top-down LUC models are suggested as a gross reference benchmark to evaluate LUC results from bottom-up models, since the former represent average GHG emissions from deforestation statistics at different spatial resolutions. Reporting LUC emissions per area and implementing a corporate accounting system that ascribes deforestation emissions to responsible companies could avoid the critical uncertainty related to yield estimations. © 2017

AB  - Under dual pressures of energy and environmental security, sweet sorghum is becoming one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuel production. In the present study, the technical feasibility of sweet sorghum production was assessed in eight agricultural regions in China using the Sweet Sorghum Production Technique Maturity Model. Three top typical agricultural zones were then selected for further sustainability assessment of sweet sorghum production: Northeast China (NEC), Huang-Huai-Hai Basin (HHHB) and Ganxin Region (GX). Assessment results demonstrated that NEC exhibited the best sustainable production of sweet sorghum, with a degree of technical maturity value of 0.8066, followed by HHHB and GX, with corresponding values of 0.7531 and 0.6594, respectively. Prospective economic profitability analysis indicated that bioethanol production from sweet sorghum was not feasible using current technologies in China. More efforts are needed to dramatically improve feedstock mechanization logistics while developing new bioethanol productive technology to reduce the total cost. This study provides insight and information to guide further technological development toward profitable industrialization and large-scale sweet sorghum bioethanol production. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Generation of coproducts from nutrients is purported to improve the sustainability of algae-derived transportation fuels by minimizing life cycle impacts and improving economic sustainability. Although algae cultivation produces lipids that is upgraded to drop-in transportation fuel products, life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis have shown that without coproducts, energy/economic returns are diminishing regardless of processing methods. This study utilizes a combined flash hydrolysis (FH), hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and coproduct conversion technology (atmospheric precipitation/AP; hydrothermal mineralization/HTM) to conserve the most recyclable nutrients for coproduct marketability. Six biofuel pathways were developed and compared in terms of "well-to-pump" energy, life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions, and economic profitability: renewable diesel II (RDII), renewable gasoline (RG), and hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel, each were modeled for AP and HTM coproduct conversion. A functional unit of 1 MJ usable energy was employed. RG showed a promising energy-return-on-investment (EROI) due to multiple coproducts. All models demonstrated favorable EROI (EROI > 1). LC-GHG emissions tie in with EROI such that RG produced the least emissions. HRJ-HTM was determined to be the most profitable model with a profitability index (PI) of 0.75. Sensitivity analyses revealed that dewatering affects EROI and PI significantly. To achieve break-even, gasoline must sell at $4.10/gal, diesel at $5.64/gal, and jet fuel at $3.43/gal. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass is a renewable resource that has attractive characteristics for manufacturing many types of products such as biofuels, specialty chemicals, and energy generation. Several studies have addressed diverse important features such as new technologies for biomass treatment, approaches for potential location of refineries, models to evaluate existing relationships between availability and price, among others. However, two important issues need to be considered: potential locations for biomass processing systems facilities considering geographic constraints, as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability over time. Thus, this paper presents an approach to determine viable facility locations for supply chains based on residual biomass. This work has used a tool based on geographic information systems in order to involve environmental, social and geographic restrictions. Some of considered environmental features are exclusion of protected areas, vegetation type according with human activities, and water bodies location. Also, the approach considers technical constraints given by the terrain slope, wetland zones, distance to transportation infrastructure, distance to power grids and power plants, etc. In addition, social constrains such as distance to urban and rural communities, and historic monuments are included as well. Additionally, climatic aspects such as frequency of drought and hurricanes have been also taken into account. Besides, this work has considered the effect of biomass uncertainty through several scenarios, based on historical data for residual biomass availability, to include variations over time of this factor on biomass processing systems. The proposed geographic information system was tested for a nationwide case study in Mexico to determine viable regions to locate biomass processing systems facilities. The results show that biomass availability variations over time due to uncertainty have a strong effect on viable regions to install facilities in a supply chain based on biomass. Furthermore, the results also illustrate the influence of the type of raw material on the number of potential locations. This method is useful to define potential locations to be taken into account in problems like supply chain design or planning problem because it is possible to decrease considerably the number of options to choose accounting social, environmental, and geographic issues as well as uncertainty associated with biomass availability.

AB  - Following the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP21 (Paris, France), several countries have attempted to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reach this objective, microalgae could be used to capture carbon dioxide and transform it into a biomass composed essentially of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. Moreover, cultivating microalgae does not require arable land, in opposition to several oleaginous plants used to produce biofuels. Despite the fact that microalgae could be transformed into several biofuels such as bioethanol (by fermentation of hydrocarbons) and biomethane (by anaerobic digestion), transforming lipids into biodiesel could allow the reduction of oil-based diesel consumption. However, microalgae biodiesel production costs remain high for a short-term commercialization. The microalgae lipids can be transesterified into biodiesel in the presence of catalysts (homogeneous or heterogeneous). In order to commercialize biodiesel from microalgae, biodiesel physicochemical properties must respect the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The aim of the study was to describe the current technologies available to produce biodiesel from microalgae. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Supplying affordable, acceptable, and adequate sources of energy is one of the most important concerns of the communities. Due to the unbalanced distribution of fossil fuels, as well as their environmental effects, the utilization of renewable energies sources has been one of the main strategies. Due to the importance of transportation for societies, biofuels technologies is important part of researches, in particular algae. Algae are a type of single or multi-cellular organisms that are multiplying rapidly, and have photosynthesis-based growth and evolution. In this paper, after classifying and determining the main factors affecting the production of liquid fuels from microalgae, the feasibility and the best regions for production are discussed in the case study, Iran. The analysis method is multi criteria decision making in order to rank the best locations for microalgae growing. The results show that Iran has a high potential for microalgae utilization and the coastlines of Oman Sea and the Persian Gulf are the best regions for large-scale algae cultivation and processing projects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transport biofuels are currently the fastest growing bioenergy sectors even they represent around 3-4% of total road transport fuel and only 6% of total bioenergy consumption today. Low oil prices and poor margins continue to challenge biofuel producers in Europe. Under current market conditions it is unlikely that the 7% cap will be reached in the EU by 2020. Since the past ten years, production of biodiesel from waste and animal fats has taken off, while the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is lagging behind compared to former targets. Co-products are supposed to be credited with the area of cropland required to produce the amount of feed they substitute. If co-products are taken into account, the net use of land and feedstocks declines. Most existing biofuel regulations significantly undervalue the contribution of co-products when assessing the net land use and GHG impacts of biofuel production. Long-term transport shares are the most challenging to project because the range of possible vehicle technologies and fuel types in the future is very broad and future oil prices are uncertain. It is concluded that the rise in the use of biofuels has slowed down and sustainability criteria have been established regarding the use of land and the mitigation of environmental impacts caused by biofuel production. © 2018 General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.

AB  - This study explores the environmentally innovative and low-impact technology, a zero food waste system (ZFWS) that utilizes food waste and converts it into composts or biofuels and curtails carbon emissions. The ZFWS not just achieves food waste reductions but recycles food waste into fertilizer. Based on a fermentation-extinction technique using bio wood chips, the ZFWS was employed in a field experiment of the system installed in a large-scale apartment complex, and the performance of the system was examined. The on-site ZFWS consisted of three primary parts: 1) a food waste slot into which food waste was injected; 2) a fermentation-extinction reactor where food waste was mixed with bio wood chips made up of complex enzyme and aseptic wood chips; and 3) deodorization equipment in which an ultraviolet and ozone photolysis method was employed. The field experiment showed that food waste injected into the ZFWS was reduced by 94%. Overall microbial activity of the food waste in the fermentation-extinction reactor was measured using adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), and the degradation rate of organic compounds, referred to as volatile solids, increased with ATP concentration. The by-products generated from ZFWS comply with the national standard for organic fertilizer. © 2018 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.

We conduct extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate the application of the model and algorithm in a case study based on the South Carolina settings.

AB  - To assure energy security source, a renewable nonedible plant such as Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) is attractive as a feedstock. However, the high viscosity of this vegetable oil is the main limitation on its fuel properties and makes it unsuitable for direct application in current diesel engines. Microemulsification is an alternative method for fuel production that reduces the by-products from the transesterification process. In this research, microemulsion fuels (MFs) were produced from crude JCO, diesel and ethanol in the presence of a surfactant. Three formulations of MFs with various composition of diesel and an ethanol-surfactant ratio were examined in terms of their biodiesel characteristics, performance and emission levels. For instance MF(E5), MF(E5)-LS1 and MF(E10)-LS1 were MFs without surfactant, ME with 5% and 10% of the ethanol-surfactant component, respectively. The high heating value, kinematic viscosity and water content of the MFs were close to the biodiesel standard and compatible for use with diesel engines. In addition, the MF(E5), gave an engine power, brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature similar to those of petroleum-derived diesel. The emissions from these MFs showed a lower smoke emission than that of diesel, while the CO and CO2 emissions were similar to those of diesel. Thus MF(E5) showed great potential for use as biofuel with less exhaust smoke emission in diesel engines without modification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The EU is one of the key consumers of palm oil globally. Over 2000-2017, the EU countries increased their total use of palm oil by 63%. The palm oil is used in large volumes by food, personal care and biofuel industries. However, the general increase in palm oil consumption in Europe can be related to the increase in its use, mostly as biodiesel. For biodiesel, the principal European-grown feedstock is the rapeseed oil. Nevertheless, it becoming increasingly difficult for European rapeseed oil to compete with imported palm oil. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, it aims at presenting the European palm oil market, second, it seeks to explore whether there are relationships among prices for palm oil, rapeseed oil and biodiesel using times series analysis method. Rapeseed oil is the most prominently used vegetable oils and has a number of food and industrial uses. In contrast, biodiesel represents the energy-based prospective. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but concerns remain about competition for arable land and freshwater. The synergistic integration of algae production, which does not require arable land or freshwater, with BECCS (called “ABECCS”) can reduce CO2 emissions without competing with agriculture. This study presents a technoeconomic and life-cycle assessment for colocating a 121-ha algae facility with a 2,680-ha eucalyptus forest for BECCS. The eucalyptus biomass fuels combined heat and power (CHP) generation with subsequent amine-based carbon capture and storage (CCS). A portion of the captured CO2 is used for growing algae and the remainder is sequestered. Biomass combustion supplies CO2, heat, and electricity, thus increasing the range of sites suitable for algae cultivation. Economic, energetic, and environmental impacts are considered. The system yields as much protein as soybeans while generating 61.5 TJ of electricity and sequestering 29,600 t of CO2 per year. More energy is generated than consumed and the freshwater footprint is roughly equal to that for soybeans. Financial break-even is achieved for product value combinations that include 1) algal biomass sold for $1,400/t (fishmeal replacement) with a $68/t carbon credit and 2) algal biomass sold for $600/t (soymeal replacement) with a $278/t carbon credit. Sensitivity analysis shows significant reductions to the cost of carbon sequestration are possible. The ABECCS system represents a unique technology for negative emissions without reducing protein production or increasing water demand, and should therefore be included in the suite of technologies being considered to address global sustainability. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to determine farmers' willingness to adopt and allocate land for growing non-food oilseeds as bio-energy crops across the western US. A mail survey was conducted in three regions of the western US from randomly selected wheat farmers. Data was analyzed using Heckman's two stage selection model to correct for selection bias. Under favorable contracts, the study found that 58% of sample farmers were willing to adopt oilseeds as bio-energy crops and initially contribute an average of 160 acres of land for production per farm. Concerning farmers' adoption decisions, factors such as experience growing oilseed crops, availability of a nearby crushing facility, use of no till, being a first adopter and having a college degree positively affected adoption, while risk behavior, farm experience and gender negatively affected adoption. With regard to the land allocation decision, factors such as farm income and gender positively affected land allocation decisions, whereas percentage of land rented on a crop share basis, profit ratio (wheat/canola) and livestock ownership negatively affected land allocation decisions. © 2018

AB  - Triacylglycerol (TAG) and starch produced by micro-algae are potential sources of biofuel. Our previous studies showed that the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas debaryana NIES-2212, which is a rare species of Chlamydomonas that possesses phosphatidylcholine (PC), is a seed organism for the development of biofuel producers. This alga accumulates large amounts of TAG and starch under completely photo-autotrophic conditions during stationary phase without nutrient deprivation. The present study was performed to optimize the growth conditions of this alga with regard to light intensity and CO2 concentration to improve the efficiency of TAG and starch production. The growth rate of C. debaryana was greater at higher light intensity, although there was no significant difference in the final cell density of the culture. The highest contents of TAG and starch, approximately 200 fmol cell–1 and 600 pg cell–1, respectively, were achieved with a light intensity of 200 μmol m–2 s–1 bubbled with air containing 5.0% CO2. These results suggest that optimization of light intensity and CO2 concentration can enhance the productivity of TAG and starch by C. debaryana NIES-2212. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Energy economics is a vast topic. Many applied and agricultural economists today work on fuel economy, fossil fuel energy issues, energy sector economic analysis, electricity sector economic and policy issues, techno-economic analyses of energy alternatives as well as agricultural energy issues such as biofuels, and energy use in agriculture. Energy economists also employ a wide variety of modeling and analytical tools. We cover six broad topics: externalities, policy analysis, energy demand and supply analyses, electricity pricing, biofuels, and techno-economic analysis. Applied and agricultural economists have made and will continue to make major contributions to the literature and policy analysis in these areas. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been promoted as a potential feedstock for cellulosic biofuel in the United States. Switchgrass is known to respond to N fertilizer, but optimal rates remain unclear. Given the potential nonlinear response of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to N inputs, N additions to switchgrass above optimal levels could have large impacts on the greenhouse gas balance of switchgrass-based biofuel. Additionally, N additions are likely to have large impacts on switchgrass production costs. Yield, N removal, and net returns were measured in switchgrass receiving 0 to 200 kg N ha-1 in Manhattan, KS, from 2012 to 2014. Emissions of N2O were measured in the 0- to 150-kg N ha-1 treatments. Total emissions of N2O increased from 0.2 to 3.0 kg N2O-N ha-1 as N inputs increased from 0 to 150 kg N ha-1. The 3-yr averages of fertilizer-induced emission factors were 0.7, 2.1, and 2.6% at 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha-1, respectively. Removal of N at harvest increased linearly with increasing N rate. Switchgrass yields increased with N inputs up to 100 to 150 kg N ha-1, but the critical N level for maximum yields decreased each year, suggesting that N was being applied in excess at higher N rates. Net returns were maximized at 100 kg N ha-1 at both a high and low urea cost (US$394.71 and $945.91 ha-1, respectively). These results demonstrate that N inputs were necessary to increase switchgrass productivity, but rates exceeding optimal levels resulted in excessive N2O emissions and increased costs for producers. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - We conduct meta-analyses of the estimated impacts of corn ethanol on food and fuel prices, as well as greenhouse gases, and analyze the implications for the balance of trade. The meta-analyses suggest that corn ethanol has minor effects on greenhouse gas emissions and significant yet moderate effects on food and fuel prices. However, corn ethanol has a relatively significant impact on fuel security in terms of reductions in the import of oil to the U.S. and its overall effect on the U.S. balance of trade. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Although there is now widespread evidence of substantial variability in economic agents' responses to economic drivers in many applied economics fields, this variability has been largely overlooked by econometric agricultural production models. This article sets out to fill this gap by providing methodological contributions and empirical results. First, we consider panel data multicrop models featuring random intercept and slope parameters to account for the heterogeneous responses of crop producers to economic drivers. Second, we show that Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithms are particularly well-suited to estimating this type of model. Third, based on an application of our empirical modeling framework with a sample of French grain crop producers, we demonstrate substantial variability in farmers' responses to economic incentives. Fourth, we use the estimated model and a simple "statistical calibration" procedure to build farm-specific simulation models, which are then used to evaluate the effects of the rapeseed price increase induced by European Union (EU) biofuel support. Our simulation results demonstrate that ignoring the variability in the considered farmers' responses to the economic incentives results in significant overestimation of the increases in rapeseed yield levels and variable input use levels induced by EU biofuel support, as well as significant underestimation of the variability in the congruent increases in rapeseed acreages. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Wood is a renewable resource that can be employed for the production of second generation biofuels by enzymatic saccharification and subsequent fermentation. Knowledge on how the saccharification potential is affected by genotype-related variation of wood traits and drought is scarce. Here, we used three Populus nigra L. genotypes from habitats differing in water availability to (i) investigate the relationships between wood anatomy, lignin content and saccharification and (ii) identify genes and co-expressed gene clusters related to genotype and drought-induced variation in wood traits and saccharification potential. The three poplar genotypes differed in wood anatomy, lignin content and saccharification potential. Drought resulted in reduced cambial activity, decreased vessel and fiber lumina, and increased the saccharification potential. The saccharification potential was unrelated to lignin content as well as to most wood anatomical traits. RNA sequencing of the developing xylem revealed that 1.5% of the analyzed genes were differentially expressed in response to drought, while 67% differed among the genotypes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules of co-expressed genes correlated with saccharification potential. These modules were enriched in gene ontology terms related to cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and modification and vesicle transport, but not to lignin biosynthesis. Among the most strongly saccharification-correlated genes, those with regulatory functions, especially kinases, were prominent. We further identified transcription factors whose transcript abundances differed among genotypes, and which were co-regulated with genes for biosynthesis and modifications of hemicelluloses and pectin. Overall, our study suggests that the regulation of pectin and hemicellulose metabolism is a promising target for improving wood quality of second generation bioenergy crops. The causal relationship of the identified genes and pathways with saccharification potential needs to be validated in further experiments. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Sugarcane is a highly productive, first generation biofuel feedstock, known for its remarkable efficiency in accumulating biomass. Hormones are important regulators for many biological processes in plants, especially in plant development and plant growth, which are crucial for plant biomass traits. To understand how hormones regulatory mechanisms contribute to sugarcane lignocellulose yield, we studied the transgressive segregation on biomass yield in the F2 population derived from a cross between Saccharum officinarum ‘LA Purple’ and Saccharum robustum ‘MOL5829’. Gene expression profiling was used to detect genes involved in three important hormone-related pathways, auxin, ethylene and gibberellin, to find out how they are differently regulated between the extreme segregants of high and low biomass yield groups. We identified seventeen differentially expressed genes in auxin, one in ethylene and one in gibberellin related signaling and biosynthesis pathways, which could potentially regulate biomass yield. Differentially expressed genes, PIF3 and EIL5, involved in gibberellin and ethylene pathway could play an important role in biomass accumulation. These plant hormone-related genes could serve as candidate genes in genetic modification and breeding programs to develop high yielding energy cane. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Transnational investments in farmland in developing economies are recent and controversial. While they bring developmental opportunities including capital deepening, new technology, and employment opportunities, there are also concerns about the dislocation of local farmers and insufficient compensation for land use. This paper investigates how these seemingly conflicting effects interact in the process of economic growth by fitting a dynamic general equilibrium model to Ghanaian data. The differing effects of two common foreign investment activities, grain farming and biofuel production, are investigated. Grain farming investments tend to promote capital accumulation and increase income and consumption over the transition, whereas labor income is adversely affected. Biofuel projects induce the reverse. Results identify the relative labor intensity of technology on foreign-operated farms, which affects the returns to domestic capital and the pace of capital deepening, as a major determinant of the long-term effect of farmland investments. © 2018 Institute of Developing Economies

AB  - Although dedicated energy crops will probably be an important feedstock for future cellulosic bioenergy production, it is unknown how they can best be integrated into existing agricultural systems. Here we use the DayCent ecosystem model to simulate various scenarios for growing switchgrass in the heterogeneous landscape that surrounds a commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol biorefinery in southwestern Kansas, and quantify the associated fuel production costs and lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We show that the GHG footprint of ethanol production can be reduced by up to 22 g of CO2 equivalent per megajoule (CO2e MJ-1) through careful optimization of the soils cultivated and corresponding fertilizer application rates (the US Renewable Fuel Standard requires a 56 gCO2e MJ-1 lifecycle emissions reduction for 'cellulosic' biofuels compared with conventional gasoline). This improved climate performance is realizable at modest additional costs, less than the current value of low-carbon fuel incentives. We also demonstrate that existing subsidized switchgrass plantings within this landscape probably achieve suboptimal GHG mitigation, as would landscape designs that strictly minimize the biomass collection radius or target certain marginal lands. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Premise of the Study: The relative ease of high throughput sequencing is facilitating comprehensive phylogenomic and gene expression studies, even for nonmodel groups. To date, however, these two approaches have not been merged; while phylogenomic methods might use transcriptome sequences to resolve relationships, assessment of gene expression patterns in a phylogenetic context is less common. Here we analyzed both carbon assimilation and gene expression patterns of closely related species within the Agavoideae (Asparagaceae) to elucidate changes in gene expression across weak and strong phenotypes for Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Methods: Gene expression patterns were compared across four genera: Agave (CAM), which is paraphyletic with Polianthes (weak CAM) and Manfreda (CAM), and Beschorneria (weak CAM). RNA-sequencing was paired with measures of gas exchange and titratable acidity. Climate niche space was compared across the four lineages to examine abiotic factors and their correlation to CAM. Key Results: Expression of homologous genes showed both shared and variable patterns in weak and strong CAM species. Network analysis highlights that despite shared expression patterns, highly connected genes differ between weak and strong CAM, implicating shifts in regulatory gene function as key for the evolution of CAM. Variation in carbohydrate metabolism between weak and strong CAM supports the importance of sugar turnovers for CAM physiology. Conclusions: Integration of phylogenetics and RNA-sequencing provides a powerful tool to study the evolution of CAM photosynthesis across closely related but photosynthetically variable species. Our findings regarding shared or shifted gene expression and regulation of CAM via carbohydrate metabolism have important implications for efforts to engineer the CAM pathway into C3 food and biofuel crops. © 2018 Heyduk et al.

AB  - The world is faced with a difficult multiple challenge of meeting nutritional, energy, and other basic needs, under a limited land and water budget, of between 9 and 10 billion people in the next three decades, mitigating impacts of climate change, and making agricultural production resilient. More productivity is expected from agricultural lands, but intensification of production could further impact the integrity of our finite surface water and groundwater resources. Integrating perennial bioenergy crops in agricultural lands could provide biomass for biofuel and potential improvements on the sustainability of commodity crop production. This article provides an overview of ways in which research has shown that perennial bioenergy grasses and short rotation woody crops can be incorporated into agricultural production systems with reduced indirect land use change, while increasing water quality benefits. Current challenges and opportunities as well as future directions are also highlighted. WIREs Energy Environ 2018, 7:e275. doi: 10.1002/wene.275.

AB  - Many rural communities no longer have abundant forest areas for firewood collection. Based on this scenario, we evaluated how the scarcity of forest environments influences the collection and use of this resource in rural areas. A community located in the Atlantic Forest region of northeastern Brazil, which already lacks forest areas for firewood, was selected for field research. We observed that despite this context of forest scarcity, firewood remains the main source of fuel energy in the community. In total, 27 species of wood were cited, with an emphasis on exotic species in terms of number of citations. The perceived wood quality explained the frequency of plant use, but not the number of consumers. This can be explained by the difficulty of access to some species considered of better quality, because in the studied region, the plants are usually collected in private areas. Efforts in conservation strategies are recommended to encourage an increase in the frequency of use of the available exotic species in order to safeguard the native ones. © 2018, The New York Botanical Garden.

AB  - The assessment of biomass at high spatial resolution is critical to manage supply risks and to identify optimal plant sites for producing sustainable biofuels and co-products. The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI– R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The success of bioenergy efforts will depend, in part, on interested, engaged, and informed landowners who are willing and equipped to grow the appropriate feedstocks. We surveyed landowners in Washington State to gain insight on their knowledge of and interest in bioenergy crops, with a special focus on growing hybrid poplar for bioenergy. The responses indicate that the majority of landowners surveyed are not familiar with bioenergy crops and almost half of the respondents are not interested in growing a bioenergy crop. The most important consideration for growing any type of crop is profit, followed by soil preservation and land conservation. Linear regression analysis showed that interest in growing bioenergy crops is correlated with the perceived importance of profit, tradition, soil preservation and a way to make money specifically from bioenergy crops in cropping decisions. An interest in growing bioenergy crops is the primary landowner attitude connected with the likelihood of growing a bioenergy crop and willingness to specifically grow poplar. The results suggest that increased education about bioenergy crops targeting certain types of landowners may generate greater interest and willingness to grow bioenergy crops, should a market develop. The study findings will help shape outreach efforts and communication with landowners about bioenergy crops, as well as provide increased understanding of the perceived challenges and advantages to growing bioenergy crops. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The net primary production (NPP) of a maize (Zea mays L.) field in Poland was estimated, in weather conditions close to those predicted for the middle of the century, given the ongoing changes in the global climate. The average temperature during the maize cropping period (May–September) was 16.9 °C and the total rainfall was 392.5 mm. In such conditions maize NPP reached exceptionally high levels – 3.29 kg m−2, on average. Such an unprecedented level of NPP was achieved as a result of climatic conditions favourable to C4 photosynthesis. The above-ground biomass of maize made up 78% of the total NPP, while the below-ground production was only 7.7% of NPP; weed production was very low, only slightly exceeding 8 g m−2 14.5% of the total NPP consisted of dying and decomposing biomass. Conducted under conditions close to those foreseen for the mid-21st century, this field study enabled NPP levels as well as future relations between plants in different photosynthetic pathways to be predicted. The expected changes in climatic conditions offer good prospects for maize cropping. The beneficial relationship between the above- and below-ground parts of maize and the low percentage of dying and decomposing biomass mean that this plant can be used for silage or biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) intercropping is a novel forest management practice for biomass production intended to generate cellulosic feedstocks within intensively managed loblolly pine-dominated landscapes. These pine plantations are important for early-successional bird species, as short rotation times continually maintain early-successional habitat. We tested the efficacy of using community models compared to individual surrogate species models in understanding influences on nest survival. We analysed nest data to test for differences in habitat use for 14 bird species in plots managed for switchgrass intercropping and controls within loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in Mississippi, USA. We adapted hierarchical models using hyper-parameters to incorporate information from both common and rare species to understand community-level nest survival. This approach incorporates rare species that are often discarded due to low sample sizes, but can inform community-level demographic parameter estimates. We illustrate use of this approach in generating both species-level and community-wide estimates of daily survival rates for songbird nests. We were able to include rare species with low sample size (minimum n = 5) to inform a hyper-prior, allowing us to estimate effects of covariates on daily survival at the community level, then compare this with a single-species approach using surrogate species. Using single-species models, we were unable to generate estimates below a sample size of 21 nests per species. Community model species-level survival and parameter estimates were similar to those generated by five single-species models, with improved precision in community model parameters. Covariates of nest placement indicated that switchgrass at the nest site (&lt;4 m) reduced daily nest survival, although intercropping at the forest stand level increased daily nest survival. Synthesis and applications. Community models represent a viable method for estimating community nest survival rates and effects of covariates while incorporating limited data for rarely detected species. Intercropping switchgrass in loblolly pine plantations slightly increased daily nest survival at the research plot scale (0.1 km2), although at a local scale (50 m2) switchgrass negatively influenced nest survival. A likely explanation is intercropping shifted community composition, favouring species with greater disturbance tolerance. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of direct application of thin stillage on soil residual available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content along with some selected soil chemical (organic carbon, pH, electrical conductivity, metals content) and biological (dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass) properties after crop harvest in a two-year field study. The experimental treatments included injected TS, broadcasted and incorporated TS and urea fertilizer with 3 application rates equivalent to 50, 100, and 200 kg available N ha−1 in addition to a control. Overall, NO3−-N content in TS treated soil was higher in the second year, but was not significantly different from that of urea treatments. Soil available P content increased in both years, but was greater in the second year, indicating the high release of N and P nutrients through TS organic matter decomposition after application to soil. In selected treatments, microbial biomass was higher in TS than urea treatments, but not significantly different from the control. The other measured soil parameters remained unchanged for both years. This study indicates that application of TS for two years did not contribute to NO3−-N accumulation in soil beyond the year of application when compared to urea fertilizer. Further studies with longer-term need to be conducted to monitor possible build-up of NO3−-N and P in soil via carryover of unused inorganic forms and also possibly through increased microbial mineralization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aquatic plant Azolla became increasingly popular as bioenergy feedstock because of its high growth rate, production of biomass with high levels of biofuel-producing molecules and ability to grow on marginal lands. In this study, we analysed the contribution of all organs of Azolla to the total yield of lipids at vegetative and reproductive stages and in response to stress. Triacylglycerol-containing lipid droplets were detected in all (vegetative and reproductive) organs with the highest level in the male microsporocarps and microspores. As a result, significantly higher total yields of lipids were detected in Azolla filiculoides and Azolla pinnata at the reproductive stage. Starving changed the yield and composition of the fatty acid as a result of re-direction of carbon flow from fatty acid to anthocyanin pathways. The composition of lipids, in regard the length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acids, in Azolla meets most of the important requirements for biodiesel standards. The ability of Azolla to grow on wastewaters, along with their high productivity rate, makes it an attractive feedstock for the production of biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - It is important to understand switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) productivity with relation to diverse nutrient deficiency conditions in order to optimize continuous biomass production in marginal lands. This study was conducted on a wasteland sandy soil (Aridosol) to assess biomass yield, nutrient uptake and nitrogen (N) recovery of switchgrass, and soil nitrate-N (NO3 −-N) accumulation responses to N (120 kg N ha−1), phosphorus (P, 100 kg P2O5 ha−1), and potassium (K, 45 kg K2O ha−1) applications during 2015 and 2016 in Inner Mongolia, China. The experiment layout was a randomized complete block design with fertilizer mixture treatments of N, P, and K (NPK), P and K (PK), N and K (NK), N and P (NP), and a control with no fertilizer input (CK). Plant height and stem diameter remained unaffected by the different fertilizer treatments. Biomass yield with the NPK treatment in 2015 was 8.9 Mg ha−1 and in 2016 it was 7.3 Mg ha−1. In 2015, compared with the NPK treatment, a significant yield reduction of 33.7% was found with PK, 22.5% with NK, 28.1% with NP, and 40.5% with CK; however, in 2016, yield declined significantly only with CK compared to the rest of the fertilizer treatments, for which yields were statistically similar. Plant N content was reduced for the treatment PK (i.e. N omission); conversely, plant P and K content remained unaffected with P and K omission treatments. Plant nutrient uptake, particularly of N and K, was severely decreased by the nutrient omission treatments when averaged across 2 years. Apparent N recovery (ANR; quantity of N uptake per unit of N applied) was reduced for the NP and NK treatments, which led to an increase in soil NO3 −-N accumulation in the top 0–20 cm layer, compared with the NPK treatment. However, ANR was the highest (37.2% in 2015) with the NPK treatment, which also reduced soil NO3 −-N accumulation. A balanced N, P, and K fertilizer management approach is suggested to sustain switchgrass yield and stand persistence on semiarid, marginal, sandy wasteland. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Land degradation due to elevated salinity and sodicity is a serious problem affecting many irrigated regions of the world. Salinity coupled with freshwater scarcity has forced many farmers in arid regions to abandon agricultural lands. This study evaluated irrigation potential of marginal quality treated urban wastewater to produce bioenergy sorghum on saline soils collected from an abandoned degraded salt affected lands in Texas and New Mexico under greenhouse conditions. Study results indicated that the energy sorghum biomass production and quality under wastewater irrigation were comparable to that irrigated with freshwater on nonsaline soils. Soil salinity especially in the subsurface increased over time under wastewater irrigation compared to that under freshwater irrigation. Soil sodicity (measured by sodium adsorption ratios) increased over time in all water–soil treatment combinations. Sodicity values were higher in treatments that received wastewater irrigation with no addition of calcium to counter sodium. Although sodicity exceeded the threshold value, no impairment in soil permeability was observed. Study results indicated a great potential for marginal quality water irrigation to improve degraded saline land productivity. Further field studies are required to confirm our greenhouse study results and the potential of bioenergy crops especially on saline soils and to highlight treated wastewater as a potential irrigation source.

AB  - This study examines the potential contribution to biogas national production, by cultivating sunflower, using modern techniques, in the plains of the prefecture of Karditsa, Greece. The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential quantity of biogas that could be eventually produced in the plains, by applying the latest methods to the cultivation, growth and harvesting of the sunflower. Using regional and national data, this study ranked the agricultural areas of the prefecture of Karditsa and created a suitability map on the needs of the sunflower. The illustrated results provide some support for the future investors or the present farmers in the area. The developed GIS maps may become a useful tool for the prediction of the income from the calculated quantity and quality of sunflower crops’ seeds or biogas production. Spatial planning analysis for the determination of the installation of a biogas’ facility centre, where sunflower's derivatives will be processed for ethanol production was also implemented. On the basis of the results of this research, it can be concluded that Karditsa's plains have a great potential for producing 3818 ktoe of biogas and succeed Greece's 2020s goal on biofuel production (10% of total fuel consumption) by utilizing the maps and the techniques presented on this study. A supplementary study of converting waste (household bio-waste) to bioethanol and the future potentials of the process were illustrated and presented, based on the fact that bio-waste production is and will continue to increase. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - As the availability of water decreases, deficit irrigation is an essential approach for optimizing water use efficiency. Limited or deficit irrigation may significantly affect crop yields, grain quality, and end uses. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of irrigation capacity on physiochemical properties, bioconversion efficiency, and bioethanol yield of drought tolerant (DT) and conventional corn. Both DT and conventional corn were planted at Southwest Research-Extension Center near Garden City, Kansas with five different irrigation levels (1 inch every 4, 6, 8,10, or 12 days) and dryland in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. It was found that test weight of corn increased as irrigation capacity increased. Starch and protein contents of corn ranged from 67.41 to 72.67 and 7.63 to 9.75%, respectively. Starch pasting temperature and peak time of pasting decreased as irrigation level increased. Irrigation capacity had a positive impact on bioethanol yield, whereas the corn hybrid and year did not significantly affect bioethanol yield resulting from above normal rainfall received during the growing seasons. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The transport sector involves high consumption of fossil fuels being a cornerstone sector to foster energy reduction. This goal can be achieved through the introduction of alternative and sustainable energy sources such bio-electricity and biofuels. To attain a viable and sustainable introduction of these energy sources into the market, the whole supply chain must be evaluated. This paper presents an extension of a multi-period and spatially explicit features, which are embodied in a mixed integer linear programming framework, in order to optimize a multi-echelon supply chain simultaneously in terms of economic (net present value) and environmental performance (greenhouse gases emissions), considering biomass cultivation, transport, conversion into bioethanol or bioelectricity, distribution and final usage in alternative vehicles. Bioethanol and bioelectricity supply chains are assessed considering corn, stover, Arundo donax, Miscanthus, poplar and wood residues as possible biomass feedstock, for multiple first and second generation conversion technologies. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effect of uncertainty associated with some economic and environmental parameters. Results are also compared with those from previous studies. Results show the effectiveness of the model at providing decision makers with a quantitative analysis to optimize the economic and environmental performance of different design configurations. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This study conducted the updated simulations to depict a life cycle analysis (LCA) of the biodiesel production from soybeans and other feedstocks in the U.S. It addressed in details the interaction between LCA and induced land use change (ILUC) for biodiesel. Relative to the conventional petroleum diesel, soy biodiesel could achieve 76% reduction in GHG emissions without considering ILUC, or 66–72% reduction in overall GHG emissions when various ILUC cases were considered. Soy biodiesel's fossil fuel consumption rate was also 80% lower than its petroleum counterpart. Furthermore, this study examined the cause and the implication of each key parameter affecting biodiesel LCA results using a sensitivity analysis, which identified the hot spots for fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions of biodiesel so that future efforts can be made accordingly. Finally, biodiesel produced from other feedstocks (canola oil and tallow) were also investigated to contrast with soy biodiesel and petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This paper analyses the cross-sectoral integration of the water-energy nexus in Brazil. Recent droughts resulted in unprecedented water scarcity. This caused water shortages for population and agriculture, as well as for electricity production (hydropower being the main source of electricity production). As a result, the system became more vulnerable to blackouts. To alleviate the problem, fossil fuels were used as a back up. Droughts, floods and other water-related problems will not dissipate as time goes by in Brazil. The dependency on one single predominant source (hydropower) makes Brazil’s electricity supply vulnerable. This study shows through data analysis, flow diagrams and metrics the interrelation between water and energy. Based on historical data, the analysis shows the importance of the water demand for hydropower, cooling for thermal plants, and the extraction and production of biofuels, as well as of the energy demand of water services (water supply, wastewater treatment). © 2018, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - As a renewable energy, biofuel has greatly attracted worldwide attention due to the growing demands for cleaner sources of energy as an intervention to mitigate the serious environmental problems associated with fossil fuel consumption. As an important non-food biodiesel plant, Pistacia chinensis has a promising prospect for bioenergy development. Based on the principles of multifactor integrated assessment, this paper provides an operational method for comprehensively evaluating the marginal land resources suitable for developing the plantation of Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province, China. The results show that the areas of marginal land resources suitable and fairly suitable for growing Pistacia chinensis in Shaanxi province are 1.21 million hectares and 4.45 million hectares, respectively. The suitable land resources are mainly located in Hanzhong (0.44 million hectares), Ankang (0.30 million hectares), and Shangluo (0.31 million hectares), most of which are moderate dense grassland (accounting for 50.65%), dense grassland (accounting for 21.83%), shrub land (accounting for 8.62%), and sparse forest land (accounting for 15.32%). The comparison between the results and field work data suggests that the pixel size of spatial data and soil organic matter content have important impacts on the final results. The outcome of this research can be used to implement specific policies for developing Pistacia chinensis in China and other countries especially the countries along the Silk Road.

AB  - Wood is considered an important renewable energy resource with a variable elemental chemical composition, which may change according to environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation, altitude). In this study, we evaluated how heating value (HV), elemental chemical composition, and main thermoenergetic parameters of Abies religiosa wood change along an altitudinal gradient. To evaluate these parameters, wood samples were collected from six independent trees in an altitudinal gradient (3000–3500 masl) every 100 m of altitude (36 trees) and their respective HV (higher and low), thermogravimetric and immediate analysis, specific carbon energy (SCE), and fuel value index (FVI) were determined. We found that the higher and lower heating values, elemental chemical composition and the majority of the studied parameters were significantly different (p < 0.05) between altitudes. Our results suggest that A. religiosa wood from 3300 masl has more energy content than wood from 3200 and 3500 masl. Additionally, FVI showed that wood from 3500 masl is the best feedstock in order to use as a solid biofuel. Finally, the results suggest that the altitude at which A. religiosa is grown significantly affects the energetic content of their wood and throughput as a solid biofuel. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aim: Land use and land cover changes (LCLUC) are among the most important driving forces that alter terrestrial ecosystem functions and their feedbacks to climate systems, but reliable, spatially explicit datasets over century-long periods are still lacking for fine-scale earth system modeling. We aimed to combine multiple data sources and reconstruct long-term land use history in the continental U.S., examining cropland expansion and abandonment since 1850. Location: Conterminous U.S. Time period: 1850 to 2016. Major taxa studied: Cropland. Methods: Cropland density maps, displaying the distribution and percentage of cultivated land each year (excluding summer idle/fallow, cropland pasture), were reconstructed by harmonizing multiple sources of inventory data and high-resolution satellite images. The cropland data are freely available to the public. Results: In total, national cropland expansion was 104 million hectares (Mha) from 1850 to 2016 and peaked at about 127 Mha in 1920. Forests and shrublands were the dominant land cover types that croplands were converted from during 1850 to 1880, which may be primarily attributed to agriculture development in the northeast U.S. Croplands began to expand into grasslands from 1870 onwards and the encroached area dramatically increased, mainly due to cultivation development in the Great Plain and midwestern areas. In comparison, the area of abandoned cropland in the U.S. was 65 Mha during the study period. We found cropland abandonment mostly occurred in the central and southeast U.S., while cropland expansion was centered upon the midwestern states, central California, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Main conclusions: Nationally, cultivated lands shifted from the eastern to midwestern U.S. during the study period, contributing to the increasingly important role of the Midwest in the rise of food and biofuel production, enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and high nitrogen loads into the Gulf of Mexico. Our cropland database is essential for modeling assessments of LCLUC impacts, crop production estimation and socioeconomic analysis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Although a relatively small contributor to annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions (~2.6%), commercial aviation activity is growing at ~5% per annum. As a result, alternative jet fuel (AJF) technologies have garnered interest as a means to achieve large, near-term emissions reductions for the industry. This analysis quantifies the potential for AJF to reduce aviation's CO2 emissions by assessing: the availability of AJF feedstock; AJF volumes that could be produced from that feedstock; the lifecycle emissions of AJF compared to petroleum-derived jet fuel; and the number of bio-refineries and capital investment required to achieve the calculated emission reductions. We find that, if the use of AJF is to reduce aviation's lifecycle GHG emissions by 50% or more by 2050, prices or policies will have to significantly incentivize the production of bioenergy and waste feedstocks, and AJF production will need to be prioritized over other potential uses of these resources. Reductions of 15% by 2050 would require construction of ~60 new bio-refineries annually (similar to growth in global biofuel production capacity in the early 2000s), and capital investment of ~12 billion USD2015 per year (~1/5 of annual capital investment in petroleum refining). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Separation of volatile methyl siloxanes from landfill gas using fixed adsorption beds was modeled with the objective of identifying appropriate technology and the economics associated with this purification step. A general adsorption model assuming plug flow and radial symmetry was developed and used to conduct a parametric sweep of 162 unique cases. The varied parameters were adsorbent type (activated carbon and silica gel), bed height (3.05–9.15 m/10–30 ft), inlet siloxane concentration (5–15 mg/m3), moisture content (0–100% relative humidity at STP or RH), and siloxane tolerance limit (0.094–9.4 mg/m3) that correlated to three distinct energy conversion technologies (electricity production using engines or fuels cells or catalytic conversion to liquid hydrocarbon fuels). Due to the detrimental effect of RH on siloxane absorption, the maximum allowable moisture content of LFG before purification is 50% RH and moisture removal processes are also required. The design calculations using a selected case study show that the adsorption bed height required needed for 6 months minimum breakthrough time for catalytic fuel production is twice that for engine applications. Fuel cell applications require 3 times the bed height compared to engine applications. However, the purification costs amounted to 94%, 16% and 52% of recovered product value for engine, liquefaction, and fuel cell applications, respectively indicating the need for a high value product to justify purification costs. The approaches and conclusions can be extended to specific process conditions for landfill gas purification and to other processes that use biogas produced from waste as a feedstock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Contamination of soil is a major problem globally with colligated danger for ecosystem and human health. Chromium (Cr) is a toxic heavy metal and caused harmful effect on growth and development of plants. Phytostabilization reduced the mobility of heavy metals with addition of amendments which can significantly decrease metal solubility in soil. Phytostabilization can be achieved by application of biogas slurry (BGS) and endophytic bacteria as amendments in the contaminated soils. The present study revealed that the Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN and BGS improved the growth, physiology, and antioxidant activity and reduced Cr uptake under a pot experiment spiked with Cr (20 mg kg−1 soil). The experiment was designed under completely randomized design, four treatments with three replications in normal and Cr-contaminated soil. The inoculation of endophytic bacteria improved the growth and physiology of Brassica. This study showed that the inoculation of endophytic bacteria stabilized the Cr levels in soil and minimized the uptake by the plant shoots and roots in BGS-amended soil. Similarly, activity of antioxidants such as catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione s-transferase (GST) was decreased to normal with combined treatment of BGS and endophytic bacteria in Cr-stressed soil. Overall, the best results were analyzed by combined treatment of BGS and endophytic bacteria to improve growth, physiology, and antioxidant activity of Brassica and immobilize Cr in soil. Moreover, results emphasized the need to use BGS alone or in combination with endophytic bacteria to optimize crop performance, stabilize Cr concentration, and improve environmental efficiency. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Precision agriculture technologies allow producers to identify areas of fields that are underperforming and unprofitable. If these less productive parts of the field could be converted to a bioenergy crop through subfield management strategies (landscape design), there may be potential gains to farmer revenue, biomass availability, and reduced adverse environmental impacts. Switchgrass is considered as a potential energy crop due its ability to thrive in marginal conditions. Previous studies have examined switchgrass production and breakeven costs, but have not looked at how production costs may change when produced in a landscape design situation. Adapting costs to the partial field situation, this paper determines the switchgrass breakeven prices ($ ton−1) which equate producers’ net revenues in a base case (all corn) and landscape design case. That breakeven price is the price at which the farmer would be indifferent between the base and landscape design cases. We examine the case of a general, 100-acre field in Iowa, with 15 acres converted to switchgrass production, as well as 11 actual fields in Central Iowa where unprofitable subfields are assumed to be converted to switchgrass production, and the remaining portion of the field remains in corn. We find an average switchgrass breakeven price of $173 ton−1 when land costs are included, and an average of $114 ton−1 when no land costs are considered. A stochastic analysis to obtain a distribution of switchgrass breakeven prices under uncertainty is performed, producing distributions of switchgrass breakeven prices of $65–$266 ton−1 and $108– $432 ton−1 with and without land costs, respectively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The salt-tolerant capability of the candidate bioenergy crop prairie cordgrass greatly surpasses that of previously characterized prairie grass species and most other plants. To understand the mechanism of inherited salt tolerance, we compared phenotypic and genetic qualities in half-sib families of prairie cordgrass after salt treatment. Each family was treated with a 400 mM NaCl solution or a water control and then measured for various health phenotypes. Phenotypes associated with salt tolerance were shown to be moderately heritable between parent and offspring. RNA-seq analysis revealed differential regulation in unique pathways including metabolism, signaling, photosynthesis, and the circadian rhythm. The studies herein suggest that alternative regulation of the photosynthetic pathway could confer increased salt resistance in halophytes and can be monitored phenotypically or genetically in breeding programs. The improvement of salt-tolerant traits in prairie cordgrass would increase its potential to be grown as a bioenergy crop on lands that are not suitable for the growth of food crops. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Corn stover is expected to supply much of the cellulosic biomass required to meet the 61 billion liters per year target under the US Energy Independence and Security Act. The Act also requires that cellulosic biofuels achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of 60% compared to gasoline. If corn stover is harvested for biofuels, it can no longer help replenish soil organic matter, and net soil carbon emissions increase. So meeting the GHG reduction target is a concern. We studied the effect of stover removal on overall GHG emissions of corn stover ethanol systems in the 12-state Corn Belt region. Even at a stover removal rate of 66%, no more than 20 billion liters can be annually produced while simultaneously satisfying the 60% GHG reduction. Moreover, no GHG reduction relative to gasoline occurs in short time periods. The GHG benefits of corn stover ethanol only appear after longer time periods. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In 2014, the European standards of solid biofuel classification have been replaced by the International ISO standards. Considering wood chips, the main change concerns the definition of particle size distribution classes. This change in the quality, as a consequence of the new standard rules, has been quantified using 206 wood chips samples. The results show an improved classification of particle size distribution of woodchips with a reduction of not classified samples from 40 to 14% and an increase in samples belonging to the dimensionally smaller particle size classes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Renewable energy generation through biorefineries is increasingly considered as more sustainable in comparison with fossil-based fuels as well as single-product renewable energy systems. However, biorefineries have many system variations, and therefore, the evaluation of their environmental performance and comparison with conventional systems before large-scale deployment is essential. In this paper, the sustainability of three different biorefiney scenarios (Sc-1, Sc-2, and Sc-3) based on Eruca sativa (ES) as feedstock were investigated using a life cycle assessment approach from energy balance and environmental point of views. Biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, glycerol, and/or biomethane were the marketable products taken into account under the conditions of these scenarios. According to the results obtained, we argue that although biorefineries offer unique features as most effective alternatives for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the selection of biomass processing options and management decisions can widely affect the final evaluation results. Overall, providing transportation fuel through Sc-2 in which biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, heat, and glycerol were produced could decrease GHG emissions by approximately 140% compared with the combustion of neat diesel while also offering a total net energy gain (NEG) of 4.94E+08 MJ/yr. Nevertheless, if biorefineries are to be used for future transportation fuel production, a great deal of efforts should still be made to achieve better environmental performance in the Human Health and Ecosystem quality damage categories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crop simulation models are increasingly being used to understand the feasibility of large-scale cellulosic biofuel production along with the multi-dimensional impacts on environmental sustainability. However, how the uncertainty in model parameters impacts model performance for sustainability is unclear. In this case study, sensitivity analyses were conducted for three switchgrass sustainability metrics: total biomass production, nitrogen loss, and soil carbon change using the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) model. Fifteen out of the 45 parameters (25 crop growth (CROP) parameters and 20 additional model parameters (PARM)) were identified as influential for the three sustainability metrics for three lowland genotypes (WBC, AP13, and KAN) across two locations (Temple, TX, and Austin, TX). Our sensitivity results showed that parameter importance was not dependent on the genotypes but depended on the variables of interest, and differed only slightly between locations. Influential belowground-related CROP and PARM parameters were identified for each sustainability metric, indicating that belowground-related parameters are just as important as commonly measured aboveground CROP parameters. Further investigation of the linear or non-linear relationships and the two-way interactions between each of the individual influential parameters with the three sustainability metrics reflected the functions and characteristics within the APEX model and the interrelations among different processes. Strong interactions between the most influential parameters for total biomass, nitrogen loss, and soil carbon change also highlighted the importance of accurately setting these parameters. Identification of influential model parameters for switchgrass sustainability may help guide field measurements and provide further understanding of the interrelated processes in the APEX model. Furthermore, future field experiments can be designed to measure these influential parameters and understand the non-linear relationships identified between influential parameters and response variables. More accurate model parameterization will help improve APEX model performance and our understanding of the possible underlying physiological mechanisms. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The levels of heavy metals that accumulated in stemwood of mature trees grown for 20 years in a plantation in an abandoned peat quarry in areas that were fertilized with different amounts of domestic sewage sludge (180, 360, and 720 Mg ha−1 on a dry basis) were compared with trees grown in a reference nonfertilized area. Included in the study was a hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) developed for use as an energy crop, three local tree species and one introduced tree species. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the stemwood of the trees grown in the fertilized and nonfertilized fields were determined, and found to be significantly lower than their respective concentrations in the soil. Cd and Cr were found only in several wood samples at concentrations close to the limits of detection or qualification; therefore, they were not analyzed further. A correlation analysis suggested that 75% of the correlations between the concentrations of heavy metals in the stemwood and the concentrations in the soil were negative. The ability of trees to accumulate the metals from soil in most cases decreased for Cu and Ni; however, the correlations were not as clear for Pb and Zn. The following sequence for the levels of heavy metals found in the stemwood of the analysed trees was Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Cu &gt; (Cr, Cd). The results of this study showed that the levels of heavy metals in the studied wood would not exceed the permitted limits of heavy metal pollution in the air and ash when used for energy production. © 2017, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Background: The cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis shows promise as a carbohydrate feedstock for biofuel production. The glycogen accumulated in A. platensis can be extracted by lysozyme-degrading the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell walls. The extracted glycogen can be converted to ethanol through hydrolysis by amylolytic enzymes and fermentation by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, in the presence of lysozyme, a recombinant yeast expressing α-amylase and glucoamylase can convert A. platensis directly to ethanol, which would simplify the procedure for ethanol production. However, the ethanol titer and productivity in this process are lower than in ethanol production from cyanobacteria and green algae in previous reports. Results: To increase the ethanol titer, a high concentration of A. platensis biomass was employed as the carbon source for the ethanol production using a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast. The addition of lysozyme to the fermentation medium increased the ethanol titer, but not the ethanol productivity. The addition of CaCl2 increased both the ethanol titer and productivity by causing the delamination of polysaccharide layer on the cell surface of A. platensis. In the presence of lysozyme and CaCl2, ethanol titer, yield, and productivity improved to 48 g L-1, 93% of theoretical yield, and 1.0 g L-1 h-1 from A. platensis, corresponding to 90 g L-1 of glycogen. Conclusions: We developed an ethanol conversion process using a recombinant amylase-expressing yeast from A. platensis with a high titer, yield, and productivity by adding both lysozyme and CaCl2. The direct and highly productive conversion process from A. platensis via yeast fermentation could be applied to multiple industrial bulk chemicals. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - To meet the growing need for raw materials to produce pellets and wood-based biofuels, trees killed by natural disturbances have increasingly been considered as potential feedstock in bioenergy development scenarios in the Western U.S. And Canada. While much research has focused on utilization of beetle-killed and fire-salvaged timber from federal lands in this region, small private landowners make up a large portion of land holdings in the Rocky Mountain Region and may also provide an important potential supply of uniform feedstock pellets in decentralized energy supply systems in the future. In this paper, we evaluated the quality of pellets produced from green, beetle-killed, and burned lodgepole pine with and without bark using a chipper, hammer mill, and pellet mill intended for use by small landowners. Results show that green, beetle-killed, and fire-salvaged lodgepole pine produced by small landowners, including material with bark, are suitable as feedstock for pellet production. Further, pellet quality can be varied through the blending of source lodgepole pine products when needed to meet pellet quality standards. © 2018 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transport biofuels derived from biogenic material are used for substituting fossil fuels, thereby abating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous competing conversion options exist to produce biofuels, with differing GHG emissions and costs. In this paper, the analysis and modeling of the long-term development of GHG abatement and relative GHG abatement cost competitiveness between crop-based biofuels in Germany are carried out. Presently dominant conventional biofuels and advanced liquid biofuels were found not to be competitive compared to the substantially higher yielding options available: sugar beet-based ethanol for the short- to medium-term least-cost option and substitute natural gas (SNG) for the medium to long term. The competitiveness of SNG was found to depend highly on the emissions development of the power mix. Silage maize-based biomethane was found competitive on a land area basis, but not on an energetic basis. Due to land limitations, as well as cost and GHG uncertainty, a stronger focus on the land use of crop-based biofuels should be laid out in policy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - For cost-effective lignocellulosic biofuel/chemical production, consolidated bioprocessing (CBP)-enabling microorganisms utilizing cellulose as well as producing biofuel/chemical are required. A novel strain Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 isolated from sediment was found to be not only as a cellulose degrader under both aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions but also as a producer of cellulosic biofuel/chemicals. Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 secreted cellulolytic enzymes by its own secretion system and produced ethanol as well as short-chain organic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid) from cellulose. Cellulolytic activity of the strain was significantly enhanced by expressing a heterologous endoglucanase 168Cel5 from Bacillus subtilis under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The strain harboring the 168cel5 gene revealed 2-fold bigger halo zone on Congo-red plate and 1.75-fold more aerobic cellulose utilization in liquid medium compared with the negative control. Notably, under anaerobic conditions, the recombinant strain expressing 168Cel5 consumed 1.83-fold more cellulose (5.10 g/L) and produced 5-fold more ethanol (0.65 g/L) along with 5-fold more total acids (1.6 g/L) compared with the control, resulting 2.73-fold higher yields. This result demonstrates the potential of Paenibacillus sp. CAA11 as a suitable aerobic and anaerobic CBP-enabling microbe with cellulolytic production of ethanol and short-chain organic acids. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes an agent-based simulation model to study the biomass supply contract pricing and policy making in the biofuel industry. In the proposed model, the agents include farmers and a biofuel producer. Farmers' decision-making is assumed to be profit driven, which is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization model, and the biofuel producer's pricing decision is represented with a linear equation with an objective to maximize profits. A case study based on Iowa has been developed to analyze the interactions between the stakeholders and assist determination of the optimal pricing equation for the biofuel producer. Simulation results show that under such a pricing strategy, the biofuel producer can achieve higher profitability than using a fixed price. The impact of government environmental regulations on farmers' decision-making and biomass supply has also been analyzed, and managerial insights have been derived. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper examines alternative strategies for eliminating the use of oil for passenger transportation in light duty vehicles (LDVs: cars, SUVs and light trucks) by 2060, namely, deep reductions in the energy intensity (MJ/vkm) of LDVs combined with a shift to hybrid and/or all-electric vehicles, or combined with a shift of the residual fuel requirements to C-free fuels (either renewable biofuels or hydrogen produced from C-free energy sources, and used in a fuel cell). Different combinations of these measures have dramatically different implications concerning land area requirements (for biofuels), additional electricity requirements (for electric vehicles or to produce hydrogen electrolytically), and in the demand for potentially limiting metals (Pt, Ru, Li and Nd in particular). Recent estimates of battery, fuel cell and motor sizes in advanced vehicles, and corresponding material loadings, are combined with scenarios for the growth of the global vehicle fleet and recycling potential to estimate future material requirements. For any of the alternative to fossil fuels to be sustainable over the next century, it is essential that LDV energy intensity be pushed to the lowest technically achievable potential, that significant reductions in precious metal loadings be achieved, and that 90% or better recycling efficiency be achieved. Even then, longer term sustainability is not guaranteed, which implies that the primary emphasis in urban development and redevelopment over the next century should be to create cities with little to no dependence on the private automobile for transportation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas slurry and residue contaminated with antibiotics are widely used as fertilizers in vegetable crop planting. However, their impact on the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in vegetable fields is still largely unknown. In the present study, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), ARGs and bacterial communities from pig manure to fields were monitored by using viable plate counts, high-throughput fluorescent quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Eighty-three ARGs and 3 transposons genes were detected. Anaerobic digestion reduced relative abundance of tetracycline and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin (MLSB) resistance genes. However, the number of ARB and the relative abundance of sulfa, aminoglycoside and florfenicol, chloramphenicol, and amphenicol (FCA) resistance genes, respectively, enriched up to 270 times and 52 times in biogas residue. Long-term application of biogas slurry and residue contaminated with antibiotics in fields increased the rate of ARB as well as relative abundance of ARGs and transposons genes. Additionally, bacterial communities significantly differed between the soil treated with biogas slurry and residue and the control sample, especially the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Based on network analysis, 19 genera were identified as possible hosts of the detected ARGs. Our results provide an important significance for reasonable application of biogas slurry and residue. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper aims at assessing the carbon and energy footprint of an energy process, in which the energy excess from intermittent renewable sources is used to produce hydrogen which reacts with the CO2 previously separated from an innovative biogas upgrading process. The process integrates a hydrate-based biogas upgrading section and a CO2 methanation section, to produce biomethane from the biogas enrichment and synthetic methane from the CO2 methanation. Clathrate hydrates are crystalline compounds, formed by gas enclathrated in cages of water molecules and are applied to the selective separation of CO2 from biogas mixtures. Data from the experimental setup were analyzed in order to evaluate the green-house gas emissions (carbon footprint CF) and the primary energy consumption (energy footprint EF) associated to the two sections of the process. The biosynthetic methane production during a single-stage process was 0.962 Nm3, obtained mixing 0.830 Nm3 of methane-enriched biogas and 0.132 Nm3 of synthetic methane. The final volume composition was: 73.82% CH4, 19.47% CO2, 0.67% H2, 1.98% O2, 4.06% N2 and the energy content was 28.0 MJ/Nm3. The functional unit is the unitary amount of produced biosynthetic methane in Nm3. Carbon and energy footprints are 0.7081 kgCO2eq/Nm3 and 28.55 MJ/Nm3, respectively, when the electric energy required by the process is provided by photovoltaic panels. In this scenario, the overall energy efficiency is about 0.82, higher than the worldwide average energy efficiency for fossil methane, which is 0.75. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Lignin is a natural polymer that is interwoven with cellulose and hemicellulose within plant cell walls. Due to this molecular arrangement, lignin is a major contributor to the recalcitrance of plant materials with respect to the extraction of sugars and their fermentation into ethanol, butanol, and other potential bioenergy crops. The lignin biosynthetic pathway is similar, but not identical in different plant species. It is in each case comprised of a moderate number of enzymatic steps, but its responses to manipulations, such as gene knock-downs, are complicated by the fact that several of the key enzymes are involved in several reaction steps. This feature poses a challenge to bioenergy production, as it renders it difficult to select the most promising combinations of genetic manipulations for the optimization of lignin composition and amount. Results: Here, we present several computational models than can aid in the analysis of data characterizing lignin biosynthesis. While minimizing technical details, we focus on the questions of what types of data are particularly useful for modeling and what genuine benefits the biofuel researcher may gain from the resulting models. We demonstrate our analysis with mathematical models for black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), alfalfa (Medicago truncatula), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and the grass Brachypodium distachyon. Conclusions: Despite commonality in pathway structure, different plant species show different regulatory features and distinct spatial and topological characteristics. The putative lignin biosynthes pathway is not able to explain the plant specific laboratory data, and the necessity of plant specific modeling should be heeded. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Growing demand for meat and dairy products (MDP), biofuels, and scarcity of agricultural land are drivers of global land use competition. Impacts of policies targeting demand for MDP or biofuels have only been analysed separately. We use the computable general equilibrium model DART-BIO to investigate combined effects, since MDP and biofuel production are closely related via feestock use and co-production of animal feed. We implement four scenarios: (a) a baseline scenario; (b) halving MDP consumption in industrialised countries by a tax; (c) abolishing current biofuel policies; and (d) no exogenous land use change. We find that a MDP tax and exogenous land use change have larger effects on land use and food markets than biofuel policies. International trade is affected in all scenarios. With respect to combined effects of a MDP tax and biofuel policies, we find decreasing biodiesel but increasing bioethanol production. In addition, the MDP tax decreases the impact of biofuel policies on agricultural markets and land use. Our results highlight the importance of a detailed representation of different vegetable oils used in biodiesel production and related by-products. Finally, since the MDP tax increases the use of fossil fuels, the net climate mitigation potentials of such a tax should be investigated further. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the fossil energy consumption and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of polyol fuel produced via corn stover fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading based on life cycle assessment (LCA). The required material and energy inputs involved in the unit processes of LCA are taken from Aspen Plus simulation models established according to a demonstration plant with annual polyol output of 1000 tonnes. The eBalance software with a Chinese Life Cycle Database (CLCD) is employed to perform this task. The research results show the net fossil energy input (FEI) and the net global warming potential (GWP) of polyol fuel are respectively 0.760 MJ and 0.0444 kgCO2,eq per MJ energy output under the proposed production pathway. Compared to petroleum-based gasoline and diesel, the net FEI of polyol fuel reduces by 42.9% and 42.2% respectively and the net GWP of polyol fuel decreases by 55.1% and 56.9% accordingly. Sensitivity analysis indicates the data uncertainty of the polyol yield and the electricity consumption for bio-oil production has significant impact on the GHG emissions. The polyol fuel is expected to partly replace petroleum-based fuels. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Enzymatic degradation of cellulosic waste to generate renewable biofuels has offered an attractive solution to the energy problem. Synergistic hydrolysis of cellulose residues requires the participation of three different types of cellulases – endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and β-glucosidases (Bgl). Our group has been interested in using Bgl of Cellulomonas biazotea in studies designed to investigate cooperative action among different cellulases. We previously have cloned bgl genes encoding Cba and Cba3, which are C. biazotea Bgl isozymes representing two different Bgl families, respectively; specifically, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 3 (GH3) and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 1 (GH1). To gain an understanding of the complexity of Bgl in C. biazotea, we analyzed E. coli clones containing plasmids into which C. biazotea DNA had been inserted; these clones could hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (MUG) supplemented in solid agar media, suggesting they might contain bgl genes. Through restriction analysis and DNA sequencing, two novel bgl genes, designated cba4 and cba5 and encoding Cba4 (484 amino acids) and Cba5 (758 amino acids) were identified. Cba4 and Cba5 appear to be members of GH1 and GH3, respectively. Both Cba4 and Cba5 were concluded to be genuine cellobiases as each was found to enable their E. coli hosts to survive on media in which cellobiose was the sole carbon source. Despite lacking a typical secretory signal sequence, Cba4 and Cba5 are secretory proteins. Although they are isoenzymes, Cba, Cba3, Cba4, and Cba5 were shown to possess distinct substrate specificities. These four Bgl members may play important roles in hydrolyzing a wide variety of β-glucosides including cellobiose and non-cellulosic substrates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Cellulose represents a major source of fermentable sugars in lignocellulosic biomass and a combined action of hydrolytic enzymes (exoglucanases, endoglucanases and β-glucosidases) is required to effectively convert cellulose to glucose that can be fermented to bio-ethanol. However, in-order to make the production of bio-ethanol an economically feasible process, the costs of the enzymes to be used for hydrolysis of the raw material need to be reduced and an increase in specific activity or production efficiency of cellulases is required. Among the cellulases, β-glucosidase not only hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose but it also reduces the cellobiose inhibition, resulting in efficient functioning of endo-and exo-glucanases. Therefore, in the current study kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of highly active β-glucosidase from randomly mutated Aspergillus niger NIBGE-06 have been evaluated for its industrial applications. Objective: The main objective of this study was the identification of mutations and determination of their effect on the physio-chemical, kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of β-glucosidase activity and stability. Methods: Pure cultures of Aspergillus niger NIBGE and its 2-Deoxy-D-glucose resistant γ-rays mutant Aspergillus niger NIBGE-06 were grown on Vogel’s medium containing wheat bran (3% w/v), at 30±1 °C for 96-108 h. Crude enzymes from both strains were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on Fast Protein Liquid Chromatog-raphy (FPLC) system. The purified β-glucosidases from both fungal sources were characterized for their native and subunit molecular mass through FPLC and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The purified enzymes were then comparatively characterized for their optimum temperature, activation energy (Ea), temperature quotient (Q10), Optimum pH, Heat of ionization (ΔHI) of active site residues, Michaelis-Menten constants (Vmax, Km, kcat and kcat/Km) and thermodynamics of irreversible inactivation through various enzyme assays. The genomic DNA from both fungal strains was also extracted by SDS-method and full length β-glucosidase genes (bgl) were amplified through PCR. The PCR products were cloned in TA cloning vector followed by the sequencing of potentially full length clones using the commercial services of Macrogen, Korea. The in silico analyses of the sequences thus obtained were also performed using various online tools such as blastn, blastp, GeneWise, SignalP, Inter-ProScan. Results: The extracellular β-glucosidases (BGL) from both fungal sources were purified to homogeneity level by ammonium sulfate precipitation and FPLC system. The BGLs from both strains were dimeric in nature, with subunit and native molecular masses of 130 kDa and 252 kDa, respectively. The comparative analysis of nucleotides of bgl genes revealed 8 point mutations. Significant improvement was observed in the kinetic properties of the mutant BGL relative to the wild type enzyme. Arrhenius plot for energy of activation (Ea) showed a biphasic trend and ES-complex formation required Ea of 50 and 42 kJ mol-1 by BGL from parent and mutant, respectively. The pKa1 and pKa2 of the active site residues were 3.4 &amp; 5.5 and 3.2 &amp; 5.6, respectively. The heat of ionization for the acidic limb (ΔHI-AL) and the basic limb (ΔHI-BL) of BGL from both strains were equal to 56 &amp; 41 and 71 &amp; 45 kJ mol-1, respectively. Kinetic constants of cellobiose hydrolysis for BGL from both strains were determined as follows: kcat = 2,589 and 4,135 s-1, Km = 0.24 and 0.26 mM cellobiose, kcat/Km = 10,872 and 15,712 s-1 mM-1 cellobiose, respec-tively. Thermodynamic parameters for cellobiose hydrolysis also suggested that mutant BGL is more efficient compared to the parent enzyme. Comparative analysis of Ea(d), ΔH* and ΔG* for irreversible thermostability indicated that the thermostabiliza-tion of mutant enzyme was due to higher functional energy (free energy), which enabled the enzyme to resist against unfolding of its transition state. Conclusion: Physiochemical and thermodynamic characterization of extracellular β-glucosidases (BGL) from 2-Deoxy-D-glucose resistant mutant derivative of A. niger showed that mutagenesis did not greatly affect the physiochemical properties of the BGL enzyme, like temperature optima, pH optima and molecular mass, while the catalytic efficiency for cellobiose hydrolysis was significantly improved (High kcat and kcat/Km). Furthermore, the mutant BGL was more thermostable than the parent enzyme. This shows that random mutagenesis has changed the BGL structural gene, resulting in improvement within its stabil-ity-function characteristics. Hence, directed evolution or random mutagenesis with careful selection can result in the engineering of highly efficient enzymes for intended industrial applications. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Via image-based macroscopic, analysis of a briquettes' surface structure, particle size, and distribution was determined to better understand the behavioural pattern of input material during agglomeration in the pressing chamber of a briquetting machine. The briquettes, made of miscanthus, industrial hemp and pine sawdust were produced by a hydraulic piston press. Their structure was visualized by a stereomicroscope equipped with a digital camera and software for image analysis and data measurements. In total, 90 images of surface structure were obtained and quantitatively analysed. Using Nikon Instruments Software (NIS)-Elements software, the length and area of 900 particles were measured and statistically tested to compare the size of the particles at different surface locations. Results showed statistically significant differences in particles' size distribution: Larger particles were generally on the front side of briquettes and vice versa, smaller particles were on the rear side. As well, larger particles were centred in the middle of cross sections and the smaller particles were centred on the bottom of the briquette. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Large-scale 2nd generation bioenergy deployment is a key element of 1.5 °C and 2 °C transformation pathways. However, large-scale bioenergy production might have negative sustainability implications and thus may conflict with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda. Here, we carry out a multi-criteria sustainability assessment of large-scale bioenergy crop production throughout the 21st century (300 EJ in 2100) using a global land-use model. Our analysis indicates that large-scale bioenergy production without complementary measures results in negative effects on the following sustainability indicators: deforestation, CO2 emissions from land-use change, nitrogen losses, unsustainable water withdrawals and food prices. One of our main findings is that single-sector environmental protection measures next to large-scale bioenergy production are prone to involve trade-offs among these sustainability indicators - at least in the absence of more efficient land or water resource use. For instance, if bioenergy production is accompanied by forest protection, deforestation and associated emissions (SDGs 13 and 15) decline substantially whereas food prices (SDG 2) increase. However, our study also shows that this trade-off strongly depends on the development of future food demand. In contrast to environmental protection measures, we find that agricultural intensification lowers some side-effects of bioenergy production substantially (SDGs 13 and 15) without generating new trade-offs - at least among the sustainability indicators considered here. Moreover, our results indicate that a combination of forest and water protection schemes, improved fertilization efficiency, and agricultural intensification would reduce the side-effects of bioenergy production most comprehensively. However, although our study includes more sustainability indicators than previous studies on bioenergy side-effects, our study represents only a small subset of all indicators relevant for the SDG agenda. Based on this, we argue that the development of policies for regulating externalities of large-scale bioenergy production should rely on broad sustainability assessments to discover potential trade-offs with the SDG agenda before implementation. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Land-use decisions are made at the local level. They are influenced both by local factors and by global drivers and trends. These will most likely change over time e.g. due to political shocks, market developments or climate change. Hence, their influence should be taken into account when analysing and projecting local land-use decisions. We provide a set of mid-term scenarios of global drivers (until 2030) for use in regional and local studies on agriculture and land-use. In a participatory process, four important drivers are identified by experts from globally distributed regional studies: biofuel policies, increase in preferences for meat and dairy products in Asia, cropland expansion into uncultivated areas, and changes in agricultural productivity growth. Their impact on possible future developments of global and regional agricultural markets are analysed with a modelling framework consisting of a global computable general equilibrium model and a crop growth model. The business as usual (BAU) scenario causes production and prices of crops to rise over time. It also leads to a conversion of pasture land to cropland. Under different scenarios, global price changes range between -42 and +4% in 2030 compared to the BAU. An abolishment of biofuel targets does not significantly improve food security while an increased agricultural productivity and cropland expansion have a stronger impact on changes in food production and prices. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The use of food crops to produce biofuels has been subject of interest in literature. The relationship between food and fuel prices can remarkably affect production strategies. These prices are subject to high uncertainty and producers must adopt hedging and storage strategies in order to avoid financial losses. This study investigates the effect of uncertainty on production, storage and hedging of ethanol and sugar in Brazilian mills. A robust optimization model to define production, storage and hedging strategies is proposed. Uncertainty sets on returns are constructed based on a state space model (Kalman Filter). The presented model was applied to Brazilian ethanol and sugar markets in different economic scenarios. The study analyses efficient frontiers and optimal strategies and the results indicate that, even adopting good price forecast models, the optimal strategies can be deeply affected by uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cellulosic plant biomass is a promising sustainable resource for generating alternative biofuels and biochemicals with microbial factories. But a remaining bottleneck is engineering microbes that are tolerant of toxins generated during biomass processing, because mechanisms of toxin defense are only beginning to emerge. Here, we exploited natural diversity in 165 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from diverse geographical and ecological niches, to identify mechanisms of hydrolysate-toxin tolerance. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to identify genetic variants underlying toxin tolerance, and gene knockouts and allele-swap experiments to validate the involvement of implicated genes. In the process of this work, we uncovered a surprising difference in genetic architecture depending on strain background: in all but one case, knockout of implicated genes had a significant effect on toxin tolerance in one strain, but no significant effect in another strain. In fact, whether or not the gene was involved in tolerance in each strain background had a bigger contribution to strain-specific variation than allelic differences. Our results suggest a major difference in the underlying network of causal genes in different strains, suggesting that mechanisms of hydrolysate tolerance are very dependent on the genetic background. These results could have significant implications for interpreting GWA results and raise important considerations for engineering strategies for industrial strain improvement. © 2018 Sardi et al.

AB  - United States mandated the production of biofuel from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Nonetheless, the cultivation of these feedstocks may produce debates, as agricultural land is scarce and it is primarily needed for food production and grazing. Thus, it is thought that biofuel production should be placed on land with low economical value (i.e., marginal land). At the same time, depending on what land is considered marginal and therefore available for lignocellulosic crops, different greenhouse gas impacts will be generated upon land use change. Here, we attempted to estimate the biomass production and soil greenhouse gas emissions of the cultivation of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and giant reed (Arundo donax L.) in the U.S. Southeast, when converting distinct former land uses. We employed the NLCD and the SSURGO databases to select grasslands, shrublands, and marginal croplands and to then allocate switchgrass and giant reed on this land basing on biophysical parameters included in the Land Capability Classification. After calibration, the DAYCENT model was employed to simulate 15-year cultivation of both crops in the U.S. Southeast. Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina were the States with the highest availability of land, thus the highest potential for biofuel production. Among scenarios, the one converting poor grazing land and marginal croplands yielded the greatest benefits: converting 3.6 Mha of land, 44 Mt/year of dry biomass could be produced, storing 0.05 Mt/year of soil organic C at the same time. In this scenario, considering 80-km supply areas, nineteen biorefineries could deliver 7,124 Ml/year of advanced ethanol across the region. When minimizing giant reed invasion risks through reallocating giant reed outside flooded areas, 4,695 Ml/year of advanced ethanol could be still delivered from thirteen biorefineries, but the scenario turned in a biogenic greenhouse gas source (3.2 Mt CO2eq/year). © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and the Association of Applied Biologists.

AB  - The present study was conducted on a pilot scale level using a solar still unit to separate olive mill wastewater (OMW) into condensate and solid residue. The prevailing conditions inside the solar still, rates of distillation and a number of quality parameters for condensate [pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total-phenols] were evaluated to assess the system performance. The solid residue was evaluated as well for its utility as a potential biofuel. The condensate is acidic (pH 3.8), colourless, transparent and free of suspended solids. The turbidity and EC were reduced in the condensate by 100 and 99%, respectively, while the loads of COD, TOC, TN and T-phenols were reduced by 90, 98, 99.9 and 99.96%, respectively. Almost 0.04% of initial total phenols found in OMW were recovered in the condensate. High calorific value (23.5 kJ/g) and combustible portion (84%) of solid residue suggests its applicability as a potential biofuel. © 2017 CIWEM

AB  - In this study a natural mix of microalgae grown in wastewater of municipal character was co-digested with sewage sludge in mesophilic conditions, in both batch and semi-continuous modes. The semicontinuous experiment was divided into two periods with OLR1 (organic loading rate) of 2.4 kg volatile solids (VS) m-3 d-1 and HRT1 (hydraulic retention time) of 15 days, and OLR2 of 3.5 kg VS m-3 d-1 and HRT2 of 10 days, respectively. Results showed stable conditions during both periods. The methane yield was reduced when adding microalgae (from 200±25 NmL CH4 g VSin -1, to 168±22 NmL CH4 g VSin -1) but VS reduction was also decreased by 51%. This low digestibility was confirmed in the anaerobic batch test. However, adding microalgae improved the dewaterability of the digested sludge. The high heavy metals content in the microalgae resulted in a high heavy metals content in the digestate, making it more difficult to reuse the digestate as fertilizer on arable land. The heavy metals are thought to originate from the flue gas used as a CO2 source during the microalgae cultivation. Therefore the implementation of CO2 mitigation via algal cultivation requires careful consideration regarding the source of the CO2-rich gas. © 2018 IWA Publishing.

AB  - Semi-continuous reactor systems were used to compare a three-stage system with inter-stage thermophilic aerobic digestion with single-stage anaerobic digestion based on organic matter removal and CH4 production. Inter-stage thermophilic aerobic digestion combined with anaerobic digestion in a three-stage system can substantially improve organic matter removal from sludge while matching single-stage CH4 production. Even with low RTs, first- and second-stage anaerobic reactors provided relatively stable performance. Results showed that the inter-stage system provided better sludge destruction without a decrease in total biogas production.

AB  - Ten cereal straws and stovers from India were treated using the ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) technique to explore the effectiveness of the AFEX technique for releasing sugars from structural carbohydrates and for the upgrading of cereal crop residues as livestock feed. Recovery of glucose and xylose in AFEX treated material was about three times the recovery in untreated material. AFEX treatment increased recovery of glucose between 60 and 85% and of xylose between 50 and 85% of their theoretical yields. AFEX treatment increased average crude protein (CP) by 260% (CP content: 62 vs 161 g/kg). Cell wall content as estimated by NDF decreased on average by 47 g/kg (NDF: 656 vs 609 g/kg) while cellulose contents estimated as ADF apparently increased by 23 g/kg (ADF: 443 vs 466 g/kg). Lignin contents estimated as ADL did not significantly differ between untreated and treated material. Measured after 24 h of incubation, AFEX treatment consistently and significantly increased in vitro gas production (42.9 vs 33.3 ml/200 mg), in vitro apparent digestibility (493 vs 630 g/kg) and true digestibility (624 vs 755 g/kg) and in vitro metabolizable energy content (6.9 vs 8.6 MJ/kg). Treatment changes in digestibility estimated based on in vitro gas production generally agreed with gravimetric estimates based on undigested residues, making it unlikely that the effect of AFEX treatment on digestibility was overestimated by unrecovered soluble but un-fermentable substrate. Increases in CP content and in vitro digestibilities upon AFEX treatment were unrelated to CP content and in vitro organic matter digestibilities (IVOMD) of untreated base material, though increases in IVOMD upon treatment tended (P = 0.07) to be lower in material with high (>530 g/kg) baseline IVOMD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is produced by transesterification of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from oleaginous microalgae feedstock. Biodiesel fuel properties were studied and compared with biodiesel standards. Qualitative analysis of FAME was done while cultivating mixed microalgae consortia under three concentrations of coal fired flue gas (1%, 3.0% and 5.5% CO2). Under 1% CO2 concentration (flue gas), the FAME content was 280.3 μg/mL, whereas the lipid content was 14.03 μg/mL/D (day). Both FAMEs and lipid contents were low at other CO2 concentrations (3.0 and 5.5%). However, mixed consortia in the presence of phosphate buffer and flue gas (PB + FG) showed higher saturated fatty acids (SFA) (36.28%) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (63.72%) versus 5.5% CO2 concentration, which might be responsible for oxidative stability of biodiesel. Subsequently, higher cetane number (52) and low iodine value (136.3 gI2/100 g) biodiesel produced from mixed consortia (PB + FG) under 5.5% CO2 along with 50 mM phosphate buffer were found in accordance with European (EN 14214) standard. Results revealed that phosphate buffer significantly enhanced the biodiesel quality, but reduced the FAME yield. This study intended to develop an integrated approach for significant improvement in biodiesel quality under surplus phosphorus by utilizing waste flue gas (as CO2 source) using microalgae. The CO2 sequestration from industrial flue gas not only reduced greenhouse gases, but may also ensure the sustainable and eco-benign production of biodiesel. © 2018

AB  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular chlorophyte alga that is widely studied as a reference organism for understanding photosynthesis, sensory and motile cilia, and for development of an algal-based platform for producing biofuels and bio-products. Its highly repetitive, ~205-kbp circular chloroplast genome and ~15.8-kbp linear mitochondrial genome were sequenced prior to the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Here, high coverage shotgun sequencing was used to assemble both organellar genomes de novo. These new genomes correct dozens of errors in the prior genome sequences and annotations. Genome sequencing coverage indicates that each cell contains on average 83 copies of the chloroplast genome and 130 copies of the mitochondrial genome. Using protocols and analyses optimized for organellar transcripts, RNA-Seq was used to quantify their relative abundances across 12 different growth conditions. Forty-six percent of total cellular mRNA is attributable to high expression from a few dozen chloroplast genes. RNA-Seq data were used to guide gene annotation, to demonstrate polycistronic gene expression, and to quantify splicing of psaA and psbA introns. In contrast to a conclusion from a recent study, we found that chloroplast transcripts are not edited. Unexpectedly, cytosine-rich polynucleotide tails were observed at the 3’-end of all mitochondrial transcripts. A comparative genomics analysis of eight laboratory strains and 11 wild isolates of C. reinhardtii identified 2658 variants in the organellar genomes, which is 1/10th as much genetic diversity as is found in the nucleus. © 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - To investigate the effect of seasonal variation on macroalgae biomass characteristics and its related energy content, four different algae species, two from the Fucales order (Fucus vesiculosus and Ascophyllum nodosum), and two from the Laminariales order (Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta), were harvested during spring, summer, autumn and winter over one year. The biomethane potential and the elemental composition were determined for all samples. Both Fucales species showed low biodegradability (&lt;30%) with methane yields consistently below 20 Nm3 per wet tonne. Laminariales species, however, allowed up to 80% biodegradation efficiency, with methane yields varying between 20 and 70 Nm3 per wet tonne depending on the harvesting season. For each of the four algae the biomass concentrations of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium, sulphur, aluminium and iron was higher during spring/summer compared to autumn/winter. For heavy metals, variation was seen mainly for arsenic with higher values during autumn/winter. The highest values were observed for Laminariales (30–120 mg/kg total solids). Modelling the co-digestion of each algae with municipal wastewater sludge showed Laminariales species having the greatest potential as a profitable substrate for additional biomethane production generating up to 0.38 million Euro. However, seasonal variation could affect this expected income over 60% due to fluctuation in biomethane yields and biodegradability efficiency. Furthermore, the additional loading of cadmium and arsenic into the AD process suggested possible limitation for digestate utilisation in arable lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of bioethanol was studied by the cultivation of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 31924 in MTC medium including crystalline cellulose as the sole substrate. The effects of key operational parameters that affect bioethanol production from microcrystalline cellulose were optimized. Under optimum conditions (pH 8.0, temperature 55 °C, inoculum size 4% (v/v) and 0.5% (w/v) substrate concentration), a maximum ethanol yield of 0.30 g ethanol/g cellulose consumed and 95.32% cellulose conversion was obtained. An inclusion of modest acetate concentration in the medium showed that carbon flux shifted away from lactate accompanied by 20% increase in ethanol production. It suggests that strain ATCC 31924 differed in its cellulose conversion efficacy and optimum pH requirements compared to the other reported strains of Clostridium thermocellum. The purified cellulosome of strain ATCC 31924 found to be rich in both cellulase and xylanase enzymes emphasizing the importance of this strain for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Given the expected rise in the importance and rate of decisions being made in the biofuel sector and the complexity of the system, this paper is focused on an analysis that, although well-established in economic and environmental evaluation theory, has not been widely used yet to assess biodiesel production. The aim of this study, in particular, is to analyze, from a quantitative point of view, the water footprint resulting from the use of various types of crops for the production of Italian biodiesel, combining it with the import costs of these crops, based on the current trade partners, and the crop energy conversion efficiency. The problem from the importing country's point of view is to minimize the total cost related to the import of crop products and, at the same time, to minimize the overall water footprint, ensuring a quantity of biodiesel produced at least equal to the pre-defined target set by the European Union for 2020. The paper provides a first glance at addressing optimal resource allocation and the design of biodiesel imports in the EU regulation context, contributing to reducing the water footprint, without ignoring the economic aspects. The study represents an original contribution for the identification of potential environmental policy drivers in the context of an economic sector characterized by potential growth, serving as a guide for the resolution of the trade-offs between biodiesel demand, import costs of feedstocks and water impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis, with high solids loading, of two species of cactus pear for bioethanol production was tested evaluating the influence of surfactant Tween 80 and pretreatment with H2O and H2SO4 (1% v/v) (50 °C, 150 rpm, 3 h). XRD and FTIR analyzes were performed. Afterwards, the influence of the factors cellulase (FPU g−1), pectinase (U g−1) and solids load (% w/v), on the hydrolysis of varieties (50 °C, 150 rpm, 48 h), and the fermentation of the optimal point (33 °C, 8 h) were evaluated. The pretreatments and the Tween 80 did not increase the hydrolysis yields and Rotacional Central Compound Design indicated that the pectinase factor was not significant. The best cellulase and solids load conditions were 10 FPU g−1 of biomass and 30% w/v for both species. The fermentation efficiency of hydrolysates for Nopalea cochenillifera and Opuntia ficus-indica were 76.3% and 82.8%, respectively, showing their potential for bioethanol production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enhancement of soil fertility and mitigation of atmospheric greenhouse gases are potential benefits of biochar amendments with proximate links to microbiological processes, yet the impact of biochar on the soil microbial community is poorly resolved. Here, we assessed changes in bacterial community composition and microbial assemblage patterns with biochar amendment in two soils with contrasting fertility under two cropping systems; perennial grass and annual sweet corn rotation at two time periods. Overall, soil type exerted the greatest effect on the soil microbial community, followed by sampling time and cropping system which exerted a greater effect on the microbial community than biochar treatment. The influence of biochar on community composition was most pronounced in the highly weathered, low fertility Oxisol, than the high fertility Mollisol. We further investigated microbial assemblage architecture using random-matrix theory based molecular ecological network analyses. Microbial assemblage complexity increased with biochar amendment, with the largest impact associated with the Oxisol, accompanied by more negative OTU co-variations, indicating enhanced competition and/or niche partitioning in concert with an increase in the number of putative “keystone species”. Network analysis suggests that biochar addition, especially in the highly weathered, low fertility Oxisol, confers higher-level organization, competition, and complexity to the soil microbiome that may result in higher resistance to change due to environmental perturbation and thereby increase system sustainability. © 2017

AB  - Biofuels have been promoted as a sustainable energy carrier, able to supply fuels while reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGs) within the energy sector. It is also believed that biofuels will offer new income opportunities to farmers and create new jobs in rural areas. I argue that this may be a far too optimistic picture. Biofuels have poor energy performance (in actual fact, their use requires a high volume of subsidies), are potentially in conflict with food production and have high environmental impacts, especially on soil, forests and natural resources. Large scale biofuels production may cause detrimental effects on those key ecosystem services that we should strive to preserve, in particular when considering soil health. Assessing the sustainability of energy carriers requires a comprehensive assessment able to address multiple issues at the same time. It is necessary to rethink biofuels policy in view of preserving soil heath and key ecosystem services. Agricultural policies would better focus on supporting farmers in the adoption of more sustainable farming practices. Policies aiming at preserving forests are also necessary. Subsidies could be used to explore different renewable energy sources, with a lower impact on our support systems, and more sustainable agricultural practices. Eventually, rethinking our development patterns may become necessary in order to cope with the Earth's limited resources and reduce the alarming trends associated with the environmental impact of human global societal metabolism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental economists might recommend a cap-and-trade program as a good way to lower emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but US carbon cap-and-trade legislation was proposed and failed to become law. Instead, the biofuel use mandate is the primary existing GHG reduction program in the United States. The mandate effectively requires a rising amount of GHG abatement each year, but allows regulated parties to buy and sell credits to meet annual obligations. Although many aspects of the biofuel mandate look similar to a cap-and-trade program, there are additional requirements, such as feedstock eligibility limitations and waivers. The existence of the mandates is presumably conditional on all the legal requirements, but these conditions represent a departure from a strict GHG cap-and-trade program. We estimate GHG abatement costs of the mandate and compare them to a hypothetical cap-and-trade program targeting vehicle fuels. The mandate abatement cost is found to be higher than a hypothetical GHG cap-and-trade. Our results show that the RFS might be judged as a feasible substitute for a cap-and-trade regime that can deliver GHG reductions, but at a higher cost reflecting its multiple objectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding how changes to habitat characteristics affect behaviors is necessary to integrate biodiversity goals with land management. Managed forests are a significant landscape component in the southern United States and provide opportunities for conservation alongside production of wood products. We investigated behavioral responses of rodents to differences in understory habitat characteristics from intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a native biofuel feedstock, in intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands. Previous research indicated that planting switchgrass increased rodent population abundance but reduced recruitment and community diversity. To understand potential mechanisms underlying our previous results, we measured behaviors of individual cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), a grassland specialist, to planted switchgrass. We hypothesized that female territory size, foraging activity, overlap with other adult females, and reproduction indices would differ among treatments (switchgrass monocrop, intercropped switchgrass, and control plots) due to variation in grass abundance and vertical vegetation cover. We conducted live-trapping, radio telemetry, and foraging activity surveys on cotton rats during summers of 2013–2015. We found no treatment effect on territory size, but foraging activity was 2 times higher in monocrop than control plots. We also found a positive relationship between female spatial overlap and percentage of grass in control plots and evidence for higher reproductive indices in control than monocrop plots. Our results suggest that cotton rats in monocrop plots exhibited unexpected behaviors, and monocrop plots may serve as population sinks with low rodent diversity. Overall, results from this replicated experiment suggested that intercropping provides adequate food and cover to maintain rodent populations and produce forest products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Until today, first generation (1G) biofuels dominate the market for alternative fuels. The European Commission decided to cap 1G biofuels and promote second generation (2G) biofuels with the intention to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to limit the competition of food, feed and biofuels, as well as to improve societal approval. The assessment of consequences entailed to a shift from 1G to 2G biofuels is required to judge whether such a shift is advisable or not. According to the renewable energy directive (RED), GHG savings, need to be determined for all biofuels. By the end of 2020, fuel blends need to achieve a GHG reduction of 6%. Thus, GHG savings will determine the quantity of biofuel to be blended with fossil fuels and thereby eventually define the demand for biofuels. In this paper, the consequences of a shift from a 1G to a 2G biofuel is assessed by the example of bioethanol from wheat grains and straw. In total, three concepts of 2G ethanol production from wheat straw are considered: fermentation of C6-sugars with (1) co-production of feed, (2) coupled with biogas production and (3) co-fermentation of C5- and C6-sugars with co-production of feed. To determine the effect of the introduction of 2G ethanol, GHG savings according to RED are calculated first, and, in a second step, consequences of the shift from 1G to 2G ethanol are assessed by accounting for substitution mechanisms and emissions from direct and indirect land-use change (LUC). GHG savings of these 2G concepts according to RED methodology range from 103 to 105%. The shift from 1G ethanol to these 2G concepts is assessed by two scenarios: (1) additional production of 2G ethanol and (2) the replacement of 1G ethanol by 2G ethanol. Results indicate that GHG emissions decrease in scenario 1 if all surplus ethanol replaces fossil fuels. Under the given assumptions, the reduction in emissions ranges from 9.0 to 12.1 kg CO2-eq./GJ ethanol-gasoline blend. If 1G ethanol is replaced by 2G ethanol, GHG emission increase in a range from 7.5 to 16.5 kg CO2-eq./GJ fuel blend. This is mainly due to the provision of feed that needs to be supplied as a consequence of the shift in production: 1G ethanol production provides a high protein feed that needs to be provided by other means. Hence, the main driver for an increase in emissions is the provision of soybean meal and entailed emissions from LUC. A sensitivity analysis shows that these results are robust regarding input parameters and LUC assumptions. These findings point out that it is of utmost importance to assess changes induced by the introduction of novel fuels rather than assessing them isolated from market conditions. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that current and proposed legislation might trigger effects opposed to those intended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuel crop Jatropha curcas has been promoted in developing countries as a means of improving the livelihoods of rural populations. In Mexico, despite the initially assumed economic, environmental, and social benefits of the crop, many farmers have abandoned jatropha cultivation. Here, we analyse the factors that influence farmers' decision to abandon jatropha cultivation by using a generalized linear modelling approach in combination with qualitative research methods. The deterioration in perception of jatropha profitability, the non-payment of expected subsidies and the wealth position of the household played a major role in determining abandonment. The perception of pest and disease damage, although stated by farmers as the second most frequent reason to disadopt, was not correlated with this decision in the generalized linear model. This research might help energy policy makers in identifying key elements to prevent failure of promotion programmes. The result of this study also may be useful for an international audience to reflect on the appropriateness of promoting a new crop at the farmer level before realistically evaluating the economic viability of its cultivation. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are important biofuel precursors. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a sustainable electron and carbon donor for fatty acid elongation, since it is metabolized to MCFA precursors, it is toxic to most methanogens, and it is a waste product generated in the gasification of waste biomass. The main objective of this work was to determine if the inhibition of methanogenesis through the continuous addition of CO would lead to increased acetate or MCFA production during fermentation of ethanol. The effects of CO partial pressures (PCO; 0.08–0.3 atm) on methanogenesis, fatty acids production, and the associated microbial communities were studied in batch cultures fed with CO and ethanol. Methanogenesis was partially inhibited at PCO ≥ 0.11 atm. This inhibition led to increased acetate production during the first phase of fermentation (0–19 days). However, a second addition of ethanol (day 19) triggered MCFA production only at PCO ≥ 0.11 atm, which probably occurred through the elongation of acetate with CO-derived ethanol and H2:CO2. Accordingly, during the second phase of fermentation (days 20–36), the distribution of electrons to acetate decreased at higher PCO, while electrons channeled to MCFA increased. Most probably, Acetobacterium, Clostridium, Pleomorphomonas, Oscillospira, and Blautia metabolized CO to H2:CO2, ethanol and/or fatty acids, while Peptostreptococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and other Clostridiales utilized these metabolites, along with the provided ethanol, for MCFA production. These results are important for biotechnological systems where fatty acids production are preferred over methanogenesis, such as in chain elongation systems and microbial fuel cells. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Sweden has ambitions to phase out fossil fuels and significantly increase the share of biofuels it uses. This article focuses on Stockholm County and biogas, with the aim to increase the knowledge about regional preconditions. Biogas-related actors have been interviewed, focusing on the demand side. Biogas solutions play an essential role, especially regarding bus transports and taxis. Long-term development has created well-functioning socio-technical systems involving collaboration. However, uncertainties about demand and policy cause hesitation and signs of stagnating development. Public organizations are key actors regarding renewables. For example, Stockholm Public Transport procures biogas matching the production at municipal wastewater treatment plants, the state-owned company Swedavia steers via a queuing system for taxis, and the municipalities have shifted to “environmental cars”. There is a large interest in electric vehicles, which is expected to increase significantly, partially due to suggested national policy support. The future role of biogas will be affected by how such an expansion comes about. There might be a risk of electricity replacing biogas, making it more challenging to reach a fossil-free vehicle fleet. Policy issues strongly influence the development. The environmental car definition is of importance, but its limited focus fails to account for several different types of relevant effects. The dynamic policy landscape with uncertainties about decision makers’ views on biogas seems to be one important reason behind the decreased pace of development. A national, long-term strategy is missing. Both the European Union and Sweden have high ambitions regarding a bio-based and circular economy, which should favor biogas solutions. © 2017

AB  - In order to reduce the economic and environmental consequences caused by spent car catalyst, we herein report for the first time a novel promising multi-metal catalyst prepared from spent car catalytic converters to upgrade the pyrolysis bio-oils. The physico-chemical properties of prepared catalyst were characterized by XRD, EDS, FESEM, and FT-IR analyses. The thermal stability of the multi-metal catalyst was studied with TGA. To investigate the activity of the catalyst, Conversion of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) into bio-products was carried out via a fixed bed reactor with and without catalyst at the temperature of 500 °C. Although the catalyst didn't catalyze the gasification reaction, bio-oil was upgraded over the catalyst. The main effect of the catalyst on the bio-oil components is deoxygenating of nitrogen compounds and promotion the ketonization reaction, which converts acid to ketone and declines the corrosive nature of bio-oil. © 2017

AB  - Based on continuous anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure with available carbon slowly released corn straw, the effect of adding available carbon quickly released fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) was explored, meanwhile microbial community variation was studied in this study. When the FVW added was 5% and 1%, the methane production of the cow manure and corn straw was improved, and the start-up process was shortened. With higher proportion of FVW to 5%, the performance was superior with a mean methane yield increase of 22.4%, and a greater variation of bacterial communities was observed. FVW enhanced the variation of the bacterial communities. The microbial community structure changed during fermentation and showed a trend toward a diverse and balance system. Therefore, the available carbon quickly released FVW was helpful to improve the anaerobic co-digestion of the cow manure and available carbon slowly released corn straw. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas has been introduced as a low-cost energy crop in Burkina Faso for the production of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and biodiesel. It is cultivated in different plantation systems including smallholder inter-plantings with annual crops, large-scale monoculture, afforestation on marginal land, in traditional hedge systems along contour stone walls, and in living fences. We performed Life Cycle Assessment of these Jatropha systems using empirical data on yields and carbon stocks, and accounting for changes in agro-ecosystem provisioning and regulating services that occurred after the land conversion to Jatropha. The study found that all J. curcas production pathways substantially reduced greenhouse gas emission (68–89%) and saved energy (65–90%) compared to diesel fuel. Highest values are achievable under the assumption that by-products (husks, seed cake, glycerin) are used for energy generation. The decentralized production of SVO supplied by feedstocks from intercropping and hedgerow systems seems to be most promising option. However, very low land-use efficiency (6.5–9.5 GJ ha− 1 production) characterized Jatropha intercropping and monoculture plantations, rendering the plant a competitor to food crops and increasing the risk of conversion of savanna land to Jatropha cultivation. Jatropha plantings on marginal lands largely failed. High labor requirements constrain integration of Jatropha plantation systems within small farmholdings. Currently, the traditional hedge systems show the lowest land-use replacement potential and labor needs while providing multiple ecosystem services, but alone cannot satisfy rural energy needs. In order to reach energy supply targets without claiming more land and compromising other ecosystem services, the J. curcas plantation systems in Burkina Faso need to be made more efficient through plant breeding and improved agronomic management. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Few microorganisms have been examined for current generation under thermophilic (40–65 °C) or hyperthermophilic temperatures (≥ 80 °C) in microbial electrochemical systems. Two iron-reducing archaea from the family Archaeoglobaceae, Ferroglobus placidus and Geoglobus ahangari, showed electro-active behavior leading to current generation at hyperthermophilic temperatures in single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). A current density (j) of 0.68 ± 0.11 A/m2 was attained in F. placidus MECs at 85 °C, and 0.57 ± 0.10 A/m2 in G. ahangari MECs at 80 °C, with an applied voltage of 0.7 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that both strains produced a sigmoidal catalytic wave, with a mid-point potential of − 0.39 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for F. placidus and − 0.37 V for G. ahangari. The comparison of CVs using spent medium and turnover CVs, coupled with the detection of peaks at the same potentials in both turnover and non-turnover conditions, suggested that mediators were not used for electron transfer and that both archaea produced current through direct contact with the electrode. These two archaeal species, and other hyperthermophilic exoelectrogens, have the potential to broaden the applications of microbial electrochemical technologies for producing biofuels and other bioelectrochemical products under extreme environmental conditions. © 2017

AB  - Large quantities of biofuel production are expected from bioenergy crops at a national scale to meet US biofuel goals. It is important to study biomass production of bioenergy crops and the impacts of these crops on water quantity and quality to identify environment-friendly and productive biofeedstock systems. SWAT2012 with a new tile drainage routine and improved perennial grass and tree growth simulation was used to model long-term annual biomass yields, streamflow, tile flow, sediment load, and nutrient losses under various bioenergy scenarios in an extensively agricultural watershed in the Midwestern US. Simulated results from bioenergy crop scenarios were compared with those from the baseline. The results showed that simulated annual crop yields were similar to observed county level values for corn and soybeans, and were reasonable for Miscanthus, switchgrass and hybrid poplar. Removal of 38% of corn stover (3.74 Mg/ha/yr) with Miscanthus production on highly erodible areas and marginal land (17.49 Mg/ha/yr) provided the highest biofeedstock production (279,000 Mg/yr). Streamflow, tile flow, erosion and nutrient losses were reduced under bioenergy crop scenarios of bioenergy crops on highly erodible areas and marginal land. Corn stover removal did not result in significant water quality changes. The increase in sediment and nutrient losses under corn stover removal could be offset with the combination of other bioenergy crops. Potential areas for bioenergy crop production when meeting the criteria above were small (10.88 km2), thus the ability to produce biomass and improve water quality was not substantial. The study showed that corn stover removal with bioenergy crops both on highly erodible areas and marginal land could provide more biofuel production relative to the baseline, and was beneficial to water quality at the watershed scale, providing guidance for further research on evaluation of bioenergy crop scenarios in a typical extensively tile-drained watershed in the Midwestern U.S. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been evaluated as one potential source for cellulosic biofuel feedstocks. Planting switchgrass in marginal croplands and waterway buffers can reduce soil erosion, improve water quality, and improve regional ecosystem services (i.e. it serves as a potential carbon sink). In previous studies, we mapped high risk marginal croplands and highly erodible cropland buffers that are potentially suitable for switchgrass development, which would improve ecosystem services and minimally impact food production. In this study, we advance our previous study results and integrate future crop expansion information to develop a switchgrass biofuel potential ensemble map for current and future croplands in eastern Nebraska. The switchgrass biomass productivity and carbon benefits (i.e. NEP: net ecosystem production) for the identified biofuel potential ensemble areas were quantified. The future scenario-based (‘A1B’) land use and land cover map for 2050, the US Geological Survey crop type and Compound Topographic Index (CTI) maps, and long-term (1981–2010) averaged annual precipitation data were used to identify future crop expansion regions that are suitable for switchgrass development. Results show that 2528 km2 of future crop expansion regions (~3.6% of the study area) are potentially suitable for switchgrass development. The total estimated biofuel potential ensemble area (including cropland buffers, marginal croplands, and future crop expansion regions) is 4232 km2 (~6% of the study area), potentially producing 3.52 million metric tons of switchgrass biomass per year. Converting biofuel ensemble regions to switchgrass leads to potential carbon sinks (the total NEP for biofuel potential areas is 0.45 million metric tons C) and is environmentally sustainable. Results from this study improve our understanding of environmental conditions and ecosystem services of current and future cropland systems in eastern Nebraska and provide useful information to land managers to make land use decisions regarding switchgrass development. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Green cane (unburnt) harvesting of sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) deposits between 6 and 24 Mg/ha of extraneous leaf material (residue) on the surface of soil. The removed leafy material has value as biomass for use as a potential second generation biofuel or bioproduct feedstock. Negative aspects of crop residue removal, however, are well documented and include reduced subsequent crop ratoon yields, reduced soil quality, increased soil erosion, and loss of soil fertility. The objective of the study was to determine the yield and nutrient content of sugarcane leaf material harvested from three Louisiana, USA, commercial sugarcane varieties HoCP 96-540, L 99-233, and L 99-226. Leafy material was harvested five times across two growing seasons: 2009 and 2010. Data varied by year due to weather conditions, but overall HoCP 96-540, L 99-226, and L 99-233 leaf yields were 11.5, 12.4, and 8.36 Mg/ha, respectively. Energy yields for HoCP 96-540, L 99-233, and L 99-226 were 190, 134, and 205 GJ/ha, based on bomb calorimeter measurements of leaf material valued at 16.5 MJ/kg. Average nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium leaf nutrient yields that would not be returned to the soil were 74.0, 8.6, and 83.0 kg/ha/yr, respectively. Replacing these nutrients with chemical fertilizers would increase yearly fertilizer costs significantly. Overall, yields, and nutrient and energy contents of the sugarcane leaf material were similar to other potential second generation cellulosic feedstocks for biofuels, and bioproducts. Since only the leaf material would be used as a biofeedstock, sugarcane harvest for sugar would not be affected. Thus, multiple land use criteria could be achieved. © 2017, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AB  - Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) represents a promising source for biofuel production and other bioactive compounds because of their high availability and high biomass yield. The present work aims to determine the possibility for biofuel production and other active compounds from seasonally collected water hyacinth. The water hyacinth samples were collected at four seasons (2014/2015) from River Nile, Giza, Egypt, and the biofuel (biodiesel and bioethanol), lipids, glycerol content, carbohydrates and other biochemical compounds were determined in addition to physico-chemically characterized of produced biodiesel The obtained results indicated that, water hyacinth samples showed variable lipid contents (6.79–10.45%), which by transesterification produced biodiesels (3.22–6.36%) and sediment (pigments+glycerol). Biodiesel composed either totally of saturated fatty acids (Myristic acid) of winter and autumn samples, However, Myristic and Stearic acids with small proportion of pentadecanoic acid of summer and spring samples by 8.1 and 7.9% respectively. The monounsaturated fatty acid, Oleic, was only recorded in the summer sample by11.6%. So biodiesels produced from water hyacinth have good stability and acceptability to be used in diesel engines, the co-products (sediment) composed of pigments and glycerol reached to 4.69 mg/g and 1.05 mmol/L respectively in winter season. Also, pretreatment of water hyacinth by acid at mild conditions was found to be effective with high yield of fermentable sugars and production of ethanol during 120–180 min for different seasonally collected plants. From the results, we can conclude that the produced biodiesel (from water hyacinth) was within the recommended standards and met the criteria required to be a diesel substitute compared with the Egyptian fuel standards In addition, it is possible to use its pigments as natural coloring substances in food industry, and glycerol can be incorporated in different petrochemical industries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The close link between scientific knowledge, learning, and beliefs is particularly relevant in environmental policymaking and the interaction of environmental with economic development-focused policies. This article contributes to a more refined understanding of the links among scientific knowledge, belief changes, and the move from a collaborative to an adversarial policy subsystem within the Advocacy Coalition Framework. It analyzes the process of drafting and negotiating the biofuels aspects of the European Renewable Energy Directive, which was dominated by political disagreements between two advocacy coalitions. Their initial agreement on increasing the share of renewable energies in transport turned into conflict after new scientific evidence emerged on the negative environmental and climate change impacts of crop-based biofuels. The environmental coalition changed its empirical policy beliefs to reflect normative policy beliefs on environmental protection. This change in empirical policy beliefs uncovered a pre-existing conflict with the normative policy beliefs of the economic development-focused coalition. As a consequence, the collaborative policy subsystem shifted to an adversarial policy subsystem. © 2016 Policy Studies Organization

AB  - The use of Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) as biofuel is currently increasing in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Jatropha species are well known for synthesizing various toxicants. However, the effects of Jatropha plantation on soil microbiota have barely been investigated. Hence, in current experiment, we had investigated the effects of Jatropha cultivation on soil microbial and biochemical properties in winter, summer and wet seasons after 9 years of plantation with different plant population densities. A nearby uncultivated area was included as the control site. Soil organic carbon was found to increase, while carbon: nitrogen ratio (C:N) decreased under Jatropha plantation as compared to control. Irrespective of seasons, mean microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N increased under Jatropha plantation. The microbial quotient calculated as the percentage of MBC to soil organic carbon was lowest in summer and relatively constant in other two seasons. There was a significant increase in urease and dehydrogenase enzyme activities due to Jatropha plantation. The rate of decomposition of soil organic matter was faster under Jatropha cultivation compared to the control. The study revealed that irrespective of population density of Jatropha, there was improvement of soil health in terms of biochemical and microbial characteristics. These findings suggest that Jatropha can be used in the bunds of agricultural lands or in the degraded lands without any harmful effects on the soil microbial community. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - With the increase in human demands for energy, purpose-grown woody crops could be part of the global renewable energy solution, especially in geographical regions where plantation forestry is feasible and economically important. In addition, efficient utilization of woody feedstocks would engage in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing the challenge of food and energy security, and resolving the conflict between land use for food or biofuel production. This review compiles existing knowledge on biotechnological and genomics-aided improvements of biomass performance of purpose-grown poplar, willow, eucalyptus and pine species, and their relative hybrids, for efficient and sustainable bioenergy applications. This includes advancements in tree in vitro regeneration, and stable expression or modification of selected genes encoding desirable traits, which enhanced growth and yield, wood properties, site adaptability, and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Genetic modifications used to alter lignin/cellulose/hemicelluloses ratio and lignin composition, towards effective lignocellulosic feedstock conversion into cellulosic ethanol, are also examined. Biotech-trees still need to pass challengeable regulatory authorities' processes, including biosafety and risk assessment analyses prior to their commercialization release. Hence, strategies developed to contain transgenes, or to mitigate potential transgene flow risks, are discussed. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This paper aims to estimate the costs and CO2 emissions of wood biomass co-firing in the Tohoku region of Japan. A woody biomass supply system is designed, which comprises of four processes: collection, resource transportation, preprocessing, and fuel transportation. Preprocessing is further divided into two processes: drying and fuel production. Sawmill residue, construction waste, forest residue, thinning residue, and fruit-tree pruning residue are treated as raw materials. Wood chips, pellets, and torrefied pellets (known as black pellets) are regarded as bio-fuels. The raw-material and bio-fuel transportation pathways are optimized using a geographical information system (GIS). In the Tohoku area, the availability of raw-material is 3.6 PJ/y, and the results indicate that the preprocessing plant locations should be widely distributed in that region, because the resource transportation costs have a significantly greater influence on the costs and emissions than the scale effect of the preprocessing facilities. The chip production case exhibits the smallest energy consumption of 3.8 GJ/t, the lowest supply cost of 1558 JPY/GJ, and the largest CO2 reduction of 252 × 103 t CO2/y, whereas the pellet production case exhibits a supply cost and CO2 reduction of 1643 JPY/GJ and 229 × 103 t CO2/y, respectively. The energy consumption, energy waste, and cost of torrefaction are greater than the reductions in the transportation energy and cost due to wider distribution of the preprocessing plants; thus, the black pellet case has a larger supply cost than the chip and pellet cases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coffee is one of the most popular beverages, directly linked with tradition, highlighting its cultural and social effect worldwide. Coffee consumption has been continuously increasing, generating huge amounts of solid residues in return in the form of Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG). In recent years, global environmental awareness and strict legislation have driven research towards the implementation of sustainable processes. Innovative and environmentally sound methodologies for the exploitation of waste-streams have gained interest among the scientific community. In the frame of circular economy, wastes are perceived as sources for the recovery of high value-added compounds. In this review, several scenarios, regarding the exploitation of this low-cost feedstock with huge valorization potential, are being presented via either physicochemical or biotechnological routes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Analysis of agricultural production with life cycle based methodologies is data demanding. To build comprehensive life cycle inventories, secondary datasets are commonly used when primary data are not available. However, different inventory data and modelling approaches are used to populate secondary datasets, leading to different results. The present study analyses the features of twelve secondary datasets to support datasets selection and proper interpretation of results. We assess twelve datasets for arable crop production in France, as modelled in three databases often used in the LCA field (Agri-footprint, ecoinvent and AGRIBALYSE). First, we compared system boundaries and general assumptions. Second, we focused on foreground systems comparing, inventory data, data sources and modelling approaches. Third, we performed a contribution analysis of impact assessment results to identify modelling choices that contribute most to differences in the results. Nine relevant elements were identified and assessed: definition of system boundaries and modelling of agricultural practices, characteristics of inventory data, agricultural operations, fertiliser application and fate, plant protection products application and fate, heavy metals inputs to the agricultural system and fate, irrigation assumptions, land use and transformation. The datasets differ greatly with respect to these elements. Hence, recommendations are drawn from the datasets comparison, supporting the selection of the datasets coherently with the goal and scope of a study and interpretation of results. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Ensuring secure access to food and energy worldwide relies on win-win share of sectoral use of constrained natural resources such as land and water, taking also into account the crucial role of ecosystems and their services. The increase in global population and the related growing demand for food and other services are exerting unsustainable pressures on natural resources, compromising their use within the ecosystems’ carrying capacity. Progressively, studies and initiatives have been developed with the aim of identifying win-win share strategies, which may compensate the sectoral demands of natural resources, addressing the need of a holistic and interdisciplinary nexus approach. In this study, thus emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach and highlighting the fundamental role of ecosystems, we propose a synthesis matrix system that describes the complex and closely bound relationship between natural resources use for food (specifically water, land), energy (defined as ecosystem service flows in our matrix system) and ecosystems, along the lines of the concept of ecosystem-water-food-land-energy nexus. The synthesis matrix system could be defined for different scales, both from the global to the local scale and has been designed to include impacts and nexus with climate change. The matrix aims at integrating quantitative and qualitative aspects, which are often neglected in traditional approaches of impact assessment. The complexity of the interactions between the different components of the nexus requires relying not only on quantitative evidences but also on expert judgment. A sensitivity check has been conducted to illustrate how to verify the convergence of expert-judgment from different experts. Moreover, being the matrix meant for supporting holistic assessment of supply chain, in the present study, the integration of the matrix within life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed. However, in order to support the analysis of interconnections among impacts, further methodological development of the LCA methods is needed. An illustrative example related to the competition for water, land and food bioenergy production is depicted. The matrices show that there are predominantly negative impacts given by sectoral uses of resources on the provision of ecosystem services, an issue that requires most focus on resource efficiency and on the environmental and economic impacts of natural resources use while reducing the trade-offs between the sectoral demands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The competitiveness of conventional and advanced (second generation) biofuels is a critical issue for the implementation of a sustainable transport strategy. We model biofuel competition under different feedstock cost development scenarios, assessing what costs and cost developments can be expected for energy crops in Germany and how these feedstock cost developments affect the competitiveness between biofuels. Perennial poplar was found to be the least-cost energy crop, with non-perennial silage maize being strongly competitive at increasing feedstock price developments. Assuming increasing feedstock costs for the future, neither conventional biodiesel from rape seed nor advanced biodiesel were found to be competitive in the long run. Feedstock costs were found to overshadow all other factors, leading to costs for advanced biodiesel to be between 27.0 and 53.6€ GJ−1 in 2030, which is above most expectations. Of the advanced biofuels, only synthetic natural gas was cost-competitive under some circumstances, but biomethane from silage maize and bioethanol from sugar beet were the strongest options, as they combine high yields with high conversion efficiencies while avoiding the high upfront costs of advanced biofuels and the risk of switching to perennial crops. However, such a transition leads to less mobile feedstocks being used than presently and in the case of gaseous fuels requires stimulation of the demand side in order to function. The high dependence on and increasing relevance of feedstock costs is characteristic for the biobased renewables only and is detrimental and inhibiting for investments and research and development efforts, in contrast to for e.g. wind and solar photovoltaics, and must be considered when designing policy for any sector of the bioeconomy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to provide more useful information for the decision makers in China to implement sustainable energy policies and to identify which region in China is most suitable to build the biofuel production plants for fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of corn stover, the present study has evaluated the production efficiency and sustainability of large-scale transportation fuel production via fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing of corn stover in China using emergy analysis approach. Both the hydrogen production scenario (i.e. oil hydroprocessing using the hydrogen derived from bio-oil reforming) and the hydrogen purchase scenario (i.e. oil hydroprocessing using the hydrogen purchased from market) in three regions of China (Northeast China Plain (NECP), North China Plain (NCP) and Shaanxi Province (SXP)) have been investigated. The results have shown that maize production, and fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing are the two biggest emergy input stages of the biofuel production system. The comparison of the emergy indices of all of the six cases investigated indicates that the hydrogen purchase scenario in NCP is the best biofuel production case due to its second best sustainability and the second highest production efficiency. In comparison to bioethanol from cassava chips and wheat and biodiesel from jatropha curcas L, the hydrogen purchase scenario in NCP is also the most sustainable plan for a biofuel production plant in China. As water, fertilizer and hydrogen are the three biggest emergy inputs in this case, improvements on the water management, fertilizer management and hydrogen production technology have been discussed. In order to further increase the efficiency and sustainability of the hydrogen purchase scenario in NCP, some of the necessary efforts required from the relevant sectors have also been put forward based on the results of the emergy analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) as a potential low carbon intensity (CI) fuel feedstock, assuming sugar beet production in California and simulating a facility that exemplifies opportunities for biofuel producers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve fossil-fuel efficiency, and minimize waste. The strategies explored in this study—utilizing byproducts and agricultural residues for renewable process energy and recycling water and nutrients—are not unique to sugar beet-ethanol. As such, the results from this study could be applied to different biofuel pathways to improve greenhouse gas performance. Sugar beets grown in California have unique potential as a biofuel feedstock. Although a mature agricultural product with well-developed supply chains, sugar beet production in California has contracted over recent decades as market demand for sugar production fell. As a consequence, despite their advantages for use in rotation, growers have turned to other crops and a new market for sugar beet products, such as ethanol, is needed before they are again widely planted. California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is a fuel-neutral performance standard and one of the first regulations requiring the use of life cycle assessment to evaluate CI for specific fuel pathways. The average CI of ethanol used in California in 2015 is approximately 20% lower than California gasoline blendstock, as assessed under the LCFS. CI results in this study are designed to be comparable with the analyses performed under the LCFS. The CI of sugar beet ethanol determined in this study, 28.5 g CO2e/MJEtOH, excluding indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions, is 44% lower than the 2015 average CI of ethanol (adjusted to exclude ILUC), and 71% lower than gasoline used in California. Commercial production of this modeled pathway could help achieve the greenhouse gas reduction targets of the LCFS as well as the Advanced Biofuel target set by the federal Renewable Fuels Standard. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of farm biomass is growing importance as it offers environmental benefits and the biogas produced from AD which can be used as fuel for co-generation of heat and electricity. The study aimed to explore the viability of energy recovery from bio-waste on a small-scale dairy farm to produce biogas using AD and the gas used as biofuel to fuel a combined heat and power (CHP) which generated electrical power and heat for the farm. The AD and the CHP system was designed and simulated using ECLIPSE software. Various ages of cow manure were sampled, analysed and used as an AD feedstock and it was found that as cow manure aged the amount biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was decreased; a reduction in biogas production of 5.76% was found over two months, and in the subsequent two months the reduction rate was found to accelerate, leading to a 16.92% reduction after four months. It was found that 1 t fresh manure as the feedstock produced 58.6 m3 of biogas. That means cow manure should be used as an AD feedstock as soon as possible, as carbon lost in the form of methane (CH4) occurs naturally in the atmosphere, accelerating over time. The rate of CH4 emission is increased by 3 fold (i.e. 21,196 kg per year) if the annual manure mass is left uncovered for four month. Early insertion of fresh manure into an anaerobic digester can significantly increase biogas production and subsequently reduce emissions of CH4, which has a global warming potential (GWP) of twenty-five times that of carbon dioxide (CO2). The simulation results indicated that enough energy can be recovered from the quantity of cow manure available on the farm to provide the electrical and heating energy demands of the farmyard and the attached dwellings, thus creating a sustainable farming system. In combination with the environmental benefits, it was determined that a substantial annual revenue could be generated from utility bill savings and current favourable incentive rates available to promote renewable energy technologies in farming industry in the UK. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic material is one of the most promising feedstock frequently investigated for the biochemicals and biofuels industries. Palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) are the abundant lignocellulosic residues from the palm oil/biodiesel industry, which require special disposal and utilisation. Therefore, the valorisation of EFB as a multi-product bio-refinery feedstock promises to be economically and environmentally attractive. However, it requires further investigation and feasibility assessment. This study conducts techno-economic and life-cycle assessments in Brazil of two EFB-based biorefinery scenarios producing fuel ethanol, heat and power, and C5 syrup (as feed for cattle). In terms of environmental impact, both scenarios show a significant reduction in climate change and fossil fuel depletion. Nevertheless, the economic prospects of the biorefinery scenarios and their benefits for toxicity and eutrophication are limited under the considered conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gas fermentation is an attractive route to produce alternative fuels and chemicals from non-food feedstocks, such as waste gas streams from steel mills and synthesis gas produced from agricultural residues through gasification. An improved strain of Clostridium autoethanogenum, an acetogenic bacteria, was developed by LanzaTech and shows high potential in production of ethanol and 2,3-butanediol from industry waste gas (mainly CO/CO2) via gas fermentation. In this study, a spatiotemporal metabolic model was formulated and evaluated using steady-state CO fermentation data collected from a laboratory-scale bubble column reactor. The spatiotemporal model was comprised of a genome-scale reconstruction of Clostridium autoethanogenum metabolism and multiphase convection-dispersion equations that govern transport of CO, secreted byproducts and biomass. The model provided good agreement with measured ethanol, acetate and biomass concentrations obtained at a single gas flow rate. Then to obtain satisfactory steady-state predictions at three gas flow rates, the upper bound of the proton exchange flux in the genome-scale reconstruction was correlated with the gas flow rate as an indirect means to account for the effects of acetate secretion on extracellular pH. We believe the modeling method established by this work has strong potential to facilitate commercial-scale design of gas fermentation processes for production of biofuel and biochemicals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To harvest more biofuel from forests, tree stumps are sometimes extracted after clearcutting. Species in different organism groups rely on deadwood, and biofuel extraction reduces their substrate. Our aim was to investigate the potential landscape effects of stump extraction, and compare the effects among trophic levels of deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles. We sampled saproxylic beetle species in clearcut stumps using bark sieving. We did the study in 2013 in 49 clearcuts (1–4 years old) in three regions in central Sweden where stump extraction had been performed for six years prior to sampling. We selected landscape buffers with 500 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m radius with different intensities of stump extraction (0–100%). We show for the first time, based on empirical data, that increasing stump extraction can affect deadwood-dependent species at the landscape level. On average, obligate predators were more negatively affected than cambivores and facultative predators. The 34 studied saproxylic beetle species showed varied responses to stump extraction in the surrounding landscape, including stable (no response), negative, or positive responses. Positive responses could be due to a crowding effect, indicating a time-lagged response to habitat loss. Since stump extraction in the study area started just six years prior to sampling, time-lags in population-level responses could be expected. The age of the sampled clearcuts influenced the abundance of eleven species, but other local factors had little effect on abundance. Our results suggest that if stump extraction is widely introduced, deadwood retention—planned for both spatial and temporal continuity—should be an integrated part of intensified forest management. We suggest monitoring the long-term effects of stump extraction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Producing renewable fuel from dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, has the potential to generate localized environmental benefits. This study uses high-resolution spatial data for west Tennessee to quantify the effects of producing switchgrass for cellulosic ethanol on the grey water footprint (GWF), or the amount of freshwater needed to dilute nitrate leachate to a safe level, relative to existing agricultural production. In addition, the estimated cost and GWF are incorporated in a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization model to derive the efficient frontier of the feedstock supply chain and determine a switchgrass supply chain that achieves the greatest reduction in GWF at the lowest cost. Results suggest that background nitrate concentration in ambient water and the types of agricultural land converted to switchgrass production influence the extent of the GWF. The average GWF of switchgrass in the study area ranges between 131.8 L L−1 and 145.9 L L−1 of ethanol, which falls into the range of estimated GWF of other lignocellulosic biomass feedstock in the literature. Also, the average cost of reducing GWF from the feedstock supply chain identified by the compromise solution method is $0.94 m−3 in the region. A tradeoff between biofuel production costs and reduced nitrate loading in groundwater is driven by differences in the agricultural land converted to feedstock production. Our findings illustrate the energy-water-food nexus in the development of a local bioenergy sector and provide a management strategy associated with land use choices for the supply of energy crops. However, the water quality improvements associated with displacing crop with feedstock production in one region could be offset by expanded or more intensive agricultural production in other regions. © 2017

AB  - During the last decades, global cyanobacteria biomass increased due to climate change as well as industrial usage for production of biofuels and food supplements. Thus, there is a need for thorough characterization of their potential health risks, including allergenicity. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize similarities in allergenic potential of cyanobacteria originating from the major ecological environments. Different cyanobacterial taxa were tested for immunoreactivity with IgE from allergic donors and non-allergic controls using immunoblot and ELISA. Moreover, mediator release from human FcεR1-transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells was measured, allowing in situ examination of the allergenic reaction. Phycocyanin content and IgE-binding potential were determined and inhibition assays performed to evaluate similarities in IgE-binding epitopes. Mass spectrometry analysis identified IgE-reactive bands ranging between 10 and 160 kDa as phycobiliprotein compounds. Levels of cyanobacterial antigen-specific IgE in plasma of allergic donors and mediator release from sensitized RBL cells were significantly higher compared to non-allergic controls (p < 0.01). Inhibition studies indicated cross-reactivity between IgE-binding proteins from fresh water cyanobacteria and phycocyanin standard. We further addressed IgE-binding characteristics of marine water and soil-originated cyanobacteria. Altogether, our data suggest that the intensive use and the strong increase in cyanobacterial abundance due to climate change call for increasing awareness and further monitoring of their potential health hazards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The industrial cultivation of microalgae can produce oil and protein rich biomass at areal yields higher than those of conventional agriculture. Given that algae has been demonstrated as both a potential biofuel and a food product, it is important to consider the environmental and economic tradeoffs associated with these uses. Here we evaluate the financial value of capital options for three processing strategies that produce food and fuel from algae. We show, in stochastic price regimes for production inputs and outputs, that the greatest returns are achieved when algal biomass is valorized as a high value fishmeal replacement. A co-production technology strategy that valorizes extracted oils as fuel and residual biomass as fishmeal replacement can enable the economic production of a renewable biofuel. Consistent with other studies, fuel-only production remains uneconomical, but becomes preferred if a low value commodity crop substitute is considered as the rendered food product. Potential improvements in capital and operational costs to enable economic production of fuel and low-value food are explored. Multimodal biorefineries ensure continued production during periods that are economically unfavorable with a single-mode approach, but have lower returns due to larger upfront capital investment. An analysis of a biorefinery with fuel, food, and coproduction modes demonstrated that mode selection was mostly influenced by output product prices when food and energy prices were competitive. Nitrogen fertilizer prices had a moderate influence on mode selection, while other inputs (phosphorus, electricity, natural gas) had negligible influence. The application of a carbon tax places a penalty on food production, but improves returns when renewable electricity is utilized in production. This analysis demonstrates an approach for evaluating financial tradeoffs at the food-energy nexus under uncertain market conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Predictions show that pressure on already limited water and energy resources is expected to increase in many parts of the world as a result of growing populations, rapid urbanization, increasing pollution and climate change impacts. With water and energy playing a critical role in socio-economic development, ensuring resource security is a top policy concern. However, achieving this efficiently requires taking into account the various links between the two sectors through their joint management. Feedback between the water and energy sectors exists across system life-cycles and links the resources both spatially and temporally. Tracking the impacts of policies made in one sector on the other can thus be complicated and several ‘nexus’ methodologies have been developed to try and address these issues. However, the different physical, temporal and spatial characteristics of the water and energy systems present several hurdles in analyzing the two resources simultaneously. This paper overcomes many of these problems with a new, fully coupled water-energy optimization model. Based on a review of contemporary literature, the model develops an original methodology to hard-link the two systems in detail across spatial and temporal scales, as well as between individual system processes throughout the life-cycle of each resource. In addition, the model also tracks changes in water quality through each process, allowing for detailed accounting of the energy needs for water treatment. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate various cross-sectoral issues and policies such as: water availability and temperature impacts on power plant cooling; emission constraint and biofuel expansion planning impacts on water resources; and the implications of water infrastructure expansion on the energy system. The capabilities of the coupled model are investigated in an example case study for Spain. An integrated approach is shown to have several benefits including lower total costs, better resource efficiency and improved robustness for a wide range of variations in several uncertain parameters. Coupled water-energy planning thus provides a critical opportunity to improve resource security and prevent inefficient decisions which could exacerbate problems even further. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

In this article, the authors review the literature on agricultural reform and rural livelihoods in South Africa and analyse case studies from elsewhere in Africa in an attempt to draw lessons for South Africa. They argue that biofuel production does potentially threaten certain rural livelihood strategies.

AB  - Policymakers in many countries are facing the challenge of phasing out fossil fuels from the vehicle fleet. Until 2008, Sweden seemed to have managed a shift toward flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), i.e. vehicles that can be driven on a combination of ethanol and gasoline. Every year, sale shares increased, reaching in 2008 almost 25% of the market. But then, the sales dropped to 5% of new sold cars in 2011. In this paper, the development of the flex-fuel market is analyzed by studying the underlying factors such as the market of FFVs and other “green vehicles,” fuel prices, national and local incentives, fueling stations, and the reporting of ethanol as a fuel in media. These factors are then analyzed through econometric analysis of a time series of share of FFVs sales in Sweden between 2002 and 2011 and descriptive statistics of municipal data of share of FFVs sales between 2005 and 2011. Findings show that fuel-efficient diesels entering the market, E85 (ethanol mixed with 15% gasoline) losing its economic advantage, and changes in the rebate structure have been the most significant factors for the decline. The effect of local incentives such as parking subsidies, fueling stations, and exemption from the congestion charging in Stockholm is harder to establish. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In December 2010, the German government increased the maximum ethanol content that can be blended with petrol from 5% to 10%, which facilitated the introduction of the ethanol–petrol blend E10. The revised ethanol–petrol blend was introduced with ambitions towards decarbonizing the transport sector as well as to support energy security and rural development. While usually supportive of actions aimed to combat climate change, the great majority of German motorists have refused to buy E10. The lacking demand for E10 is the empirical phenomenon addressed by this study. How did the fuel suppliers comply with the policy provisions? Which actors made attempts to influence the motorists’ demand for the new ethanol–petrol blend? Which actor was assigned the responsibility for the problems that occurred upon the rollout of the new fuel type? These research questions guide this study, which concentrates on the behaviour of transport fuel suppliers and consumers in mandated markets, that is, markets created by policy provisions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Microalgae have been suggested as promising feedstocks of significant biotechnological interest due to their enormous potential for the sustainable production of industrially valuable compounds such as lipids/fatty acids, proteins, metabolites, pigments, and biofuels. However, exploitation of algal biomass for commercial purposes is still in its infancy due to the dearth of the knowledge regarding state-of-the-art sophisticated technologies. Objectives: The main objective of the study was to review the explosions of innovative strategies that biological sciences have witnessed over the past several years, enabling the scientific community and research-based organizations to scrutinize entire classes of biomolecules from a cell type or whole organism, collectively titled as 'Omics, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and lipidomics. Methods: An effort has been made to analyze the relative advantages and drawbacks of these technologies by reviewing and consulting the available literature. Results: Nevertheless, these 'Omics strategies have played a key role in the better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of specific gene products, regulatory constraints, metabolic pathways and potential genes and protein targets which might be employed in tailoring microalgae for enhanced productivity. In this critical review, an understanding of recent omics technologies, their potential applications, and limitations for microalgae-based fuel and other commodity chemicals are comprehensively discussed. Conclusion: In the scenario of uncertain petro-based reserves, global warming and energy insecurity, the exploration of metabolic potentialities of microalgae using “Omics” are believed to be a green and environmentally-responsive approach that will further expand its industrial and environmental scope. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The increasing production of biofuels has promoted a debate on the effect of biofuels on food prices. This paper examines the impact of Brazilian domestic ethanol production on several local agricultural food commodities, using a structural autoregressive model with error correction (VECM). Other variables are included in the model, such as oil prices and exchange rate. Overall, results indicate that Brazilian ethanol has a low impact on domestic food commodity prices, even less than impacts of oil and exchange rate. Simulated price shocks for ethanol do not seem to have significant influence overestimated commodity prices. Results suggest that concerns expressed in the biofuel-food debate have little relevance in the Brazilian ethanol context © 2019, Universidade de Sao Paolo.

AB  - Algae biofuels represent one of the most promising solutions to the current global energy crisis and climate change because of their potentially high yield, high production rate, biodegradability, non toxicity, carbon neutrality, and low emission profile. Moreover, non-arable land and non-potable water can be used for the production of algae biofuel with minimal attention and resource consumption. In this study, we compared algae biofuel and other conventional biofuels in terms of performance as well as combustion and emission characteristics of compression ignition engines. A thorough review of the available relevant literature and a critical analysis has been presented. The study results indicate that algae biofuel blends can be efficiently used as an alternative, renewable, and eco-friendly fuels without major modification to the existing engine. Algae biofuels contain an optimal combination of unsaturated fatty acids and oxygenated nature, the presence of excess oxygen molecules facilitates complete combustion of fuel resulting in better thermal performance along with reduced undesirable emission. This clean and green fuel is definitely the fuel of the future. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Crop-based bioethanol has raised concerns about competition with food and feed supplies, and technologies for second- and thirdgeneration biofuels are still under development. Alternative feedstocks could fill this gap if they can be converted to biofuels using current sugar- or starch-to-ethanol technologies. The aim of this study was to enhance carbohydrate accumulation in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana by simultaneously expressing the maize Corngrass1 miRNA (Cg1) and E. coli ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glgC), both of which have been reported to enhance carbohydrate accumulation in planta. Our findings revealed that expression of Cg1 alone increased shoot branching, delayed flowering, reduced flower organ size, and induced loss of fertility. These changes were fully restored by coexpressing Escherichia coli glgC. The transcript level of miRNA156 target SQUAMOSA promoter binding-like (SPL) transcription factors was suppressed severely in Cg1-expressing lines as compared to the wild type. Expression of glgC alone or in combination with Cg1 enhanced biomass yield and total sugar content per plant, suggesting the potential of these genes in improving economically important biofuel feedstocks. A possible mechanism of the Cg1 phenotype is discussed. However, a more detailed study including genome-wide transcriptome and metabolic analysis is needed to determine the underlying genetic elements and pathways regulating the observed developmental and metabolic changes.

AB  - Macroalgae (or seaweeds) are considered potential biomass feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. Their sugar composition is different from that of lignocellulosic biomasses, and in green species, including Ulva lactuca, the major sugars are L-rhamnose and D-glucose. C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 utilized these sugars in a U. lactuca hydrolysate to produce acetic acid, butyric acid, isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (IBE), and 1,2-propanediol. D-Glucose was almost completely consumed in diluted hydrolysates, while L-rhamnose or D-xylose was only partially utilized. In this study, the metabolism of L-rhamnose by C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 was investigated to improve its utilization from natural resources. Fermentations on D-glucose, L-rhamnose, and a mixture of D-glucose and L-rhamnose were performed. On L-rhamnose, the cultures showed low growth and sugar consumption and produced 1,2-propanediol, propionic acid, and n-propanol in addition to acetic and butyric acids, whereas on D-glucose, IBE was the major product. On a D-glucose- L-rhamnose mixture, both sugars were converted simultaneously and L-rhamnose consumption was higher, leading to high levels of 1,2-propanediol (78.4 mM), in addition to 59.4 mM butanol and 31.9 mM isopropanol. Genome and transcriptomics analysis of D-glucose- and L-rhamnose-grown cells revealed the presence and transcription of genes involved in L-rhamnose utilization and in bacterial microcompartment (BMC) formation. These data provide useful insights into the metabolic pathways involved in L-rhamnose utilization and the effects on the general metabolism (glycolysis, early sporulation, and stress response) induced by growth on L-rhamnose. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - To examine the chemical composition and ethanol production of feedstocks grown on marginal lands, prairie cordgrass and switchgrass from waterlogged land, saline land, and saline water irrigated land were evaluated. Samples were pretreated using 1% w w -1 dilute acid at 160°C for 10 min, and simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation was conducted using industrial engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Samples grown on land irrigated with saline water had 2.8-fold higher total ash content compared to the other types of land, resulting in lower carbohydrate concentrations. Yeast fermented glucose and xylose simultaneously; almost all of the sugars were consumed, indicating that salts present in biomass ash did not inhibit yeast performance. Ethanol production from the waterlogged and saline lands was 2,500 to 4,700 L ha -1 , which is comparable to that of samples grown on other agricultural lands. Prairie cordgrass and switchgrass grown on marginal lands could be potential feedstocks for cellulosic biofuel. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - A strong interest in renewable energy is currently a world-wide trend. The European Union stresses the importance of the biomass application and diverse development opportunities and promotes the use of plant biomass as a renewable energy source. The short rotation energy plants, including willow and poplar are promising in this respect. This research aims to explore the changes in biomass dry matter yield and other biometric characteristics of three willow (Salix spp.) cultivars ‘Tora’, ‘Tordis’ and ‘Gudrun’ as influenced by nitrogen fertilization rates, cutting frequency, planting density and year of growing. A field trial was performed at the Vokė Branch of Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry on a light textured soil, sandy loam Haplic Luvisol (LVha) in the climatic zone of south-eastern region of Lithuania during 2005–2014. In the spring of 2005, cuttings of willow were planted in rows at 0.65 and 0.50 m distances. Before planting, the entire field was fertilized once with mineral P K (60 kg ha -1 P O, 80 kg ha -1 K O) rate. In May, when cuttings fully took roots, the following rates of nitrogen were 60 80 applied once according 2 5 to the 2 experimental design: N (unfertilized), N (30 kg ha -1 N), N (60 kg ha -1 N), N (90 kg ha -1 N) and N (120 kg ha -1 N). In 2006, 2012, 2013 0 and 2014 the 30 plants were repeatedly 60 fertilized. In early 90 spring of 2006, part 120 of the willows were cut, others were left to grow. Salix spp. cultivars ‘Tora’ and ‘Tordis’ produced higher biomass dry matter yields than ‘Gudrun’ (p &lt; 0.05). The longest shoots were produced by ‘Tora’ and ‘Tordis’. N and N fertilizer rates had the strongest impact on biomass dry matter yield of willows and increased biomass 90 yield. 120 Biomass dry matter yield of willows, cut after the first growing year (in spring 2006), was greater than that of not cut ones. Maximum biomass dry matter yield was produced in the plots, where willows had been planted in rows at a distance of 0.5 m between the plants. © 2018, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry; Vytautas Magnus University.

AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important bioenergy crop. Its biomass mainly consists of the cellulosic and non-cellulosic polysaccharides, both which can be converted to biofuels. The biosynthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides involves several glycosyltransferases (GT) families including GT47. However, there was no systemic study on GT47 family in sorghum to date. Here, we identified 39 sorghum GT47 family members and showed the functional divergences of MURUS3 (MUR3) homologs. Sorghum GT47 proteins were phylogenetically clustered into four distinct subfamilies. Within each subfamily, gene structure was relatively conserved between the members. Ten gene pairs were identified from the 39 GT47 genes, of which two pairs might be originated from tandem duplication. 25.6% (10/39) of sorghum GT47 genes were homologous to Arabidopsis MUR3, a xyloglucan biosynthesis gene in primary cell walls. SbGT47_2, SbGT47_7, and SbGT47_8, three most homologous genes of MUR3, exhibited different tissue expression patterns and were selected for complementation into Arabidopsis mur3-3. Physiological and cell wall analyses showed that SbGT47_2 and SbGT47_7 may be two functional xyloglucan galactosyltransferases in sorghum. Further studies found that MUR3-like genes are widely present in the seed plants but not in the chlorophytic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results provide novel information for evolutionary analysis and functional dissection of sorghum GT47 family members. © 2018 Xu, Ding, Chen, Marowa, Wang, Chen, Hu, Kong, O’Neill, Chai and Zhou.

AB  - Vegetable oil is an important renewable resource for dietary consumption for human and livestock, and more recently for biodiesel production. Lipid traits in crops are controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and each of them has a small effect on lipid traits. So far, there is limited success to increase lipid yield and improve lipid quality in plants. Here, we reported the identification of a homolog of APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor WRINKLED1 (JcWRI1) from an oleaginous plant Jatropha curcas and characterized its function in Jatropha and Arabidopsis thaliana. Using physical mapping data, we located JcWRI1 in a QTL region specifying high oleate and lipid content in Jatropha. Overexpression of JcWRI1 in Jatropha elevated seed lipid content and increased seed mass. Lipid profile in seeds of over-expression plants showed higher oleate content which will be beneficial to improve biodiesel quality. Overexpression of JcWRI1 activated lipid-related gene expression and JcWRI1 was shown to directly bind to the AW-box of promoters of some of these genes. In conclusion, we were able to increase seed lipid content and improve seed lipid quality in Jatropha by manipulating one key transcription factor JcWRI1. © 2018 Ye, Wang, Sun, Qu, Mao and Chua.

AB  - This paper focuses on designing mathematical model ofan integrated bioethanol supply chain (IBSC) that will account for economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to design an optimal IBSC. Bioethanol production from renewable biomass has experienced increased interest in order to reduce Bulgarian dependence on imported oil and reduce carbon emissions. Concerns regarding cost efficiency and environmental problems result in significant challenges that hinder the increased bioethanol production from renewable biomass. The model considers key supply chain activities including biomass harvesting/processing and transportation. The model uses the delivered feedstock cost, energy consumption, and GHG emissions as system performance criteria. The utility of the supply chain simulation model is demonstrated by considering a biomass supply chain for a biofuel facility in Bulgarian scale. The results show that the model is a useful tool for supply chain management, including selection of the optimal bioethanol facility location, logistics design, inventory management, and information exchange. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria.

AB  - Background: Rising environmental concerns and recent global scenario of cleaner production and consumption are leading to the design of green industrial processes to produce alternative fuels and chemicals. Although bioethanol is one of the most promising and eco-friendly alternatives to fossil fuels yet its production from food and feed has received much negative criticism. Objective: The main objective of this study was to present the noteworthy potentialities of lignocellulosic biomass as an enormous and renewable biological resource. The particular focus was also given on engineering ligninolytic consortium for bioconversion of lignocelluloses to ethanol and chemicals on sustainable and environmentally basis. Methods: Herein, an effort has been made to extensively review, analyze and compile salient information related to the topic of interest. Several authentic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier, Springer, Bentham Science and other scientific databases were searched with utmost care, and inclusion/ exclusion criterion was adopted to appraise the quality of retrieved peer-reviewed research literature. Results: Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass can largely satisfy the possible inconsistency of first-generation ethanol since it utilizes inedible lignocellulosic feedstocks, primarily sourced from agriculture and forestry wastes. Two major polysaccharides in lignocellulosic biomass namely, cellulose and hemicellulose constitute a complex lignocellulosic network by connecting with lignin, which is highly recalcitrant to depolymerization. Several attempts have been made to reduce the cost involved in the process through improving the pretreatment process. While, the ligninolytic enzymes of white rot fungi (WRF) including laccase, lignin peroxidase (LiP), and manganese peroxidase (MnP) have appeared as versatile biocatalysts for delignification of several lignocellulosic residues. The first part of the review is mainly focused on engineering ligninolytic consortium. In the second part, WRF and its unique ligninolytic enzyme-based bio-delignification of lignocellulosic biomass, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation of hydrolyzed feedstock are discussed. The metabolic engineering, enzymatic engineering, synthetic biology aspects for ethanol production and platform chemicals production are comprehensively reviewed in the third part. Towards the end information is also given on futuristic viewpoints. Conclusion: In conclusion, given the present unpredicted scenario of energy and fuel crisis accompanied by global warming, lignocellulosic bioethanol holds great promise as an alternative to petroleum. Apart from bioethanol, the simultaneous production of other value-added products may improve the economics of lignocellulosic bioethanol bioconversion process. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - In the boreal plains ecozone, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) peatlands can represent large parts of the expanding wildland–urban interface (WUI) and wildland–industry interface (WII). The boreal plains wildfire regime is predicted to increase in areal extent and intensity, amplifying the need for wildfire management to protect the WUI and WII. Forested peatland ecosystems can burn at high intensity and present challenges for wildfire managers such as severe smouldering combustion and large carbon loss. Fuel management techniques such as mulching treatments (converting surface and canopy fuel to a masticated fuelbed) can be applied to black spruce peatlands, yet the impact on fuel load, condition, and peat burn severity is unclear. Using observations from an experimental fire, we found that a mulch-thinning fuel treatment could reduce peat depth of burn. However, where peat bulk density was increased by compaction, this led to an increased peat combustion carbon loss relative to the control. Furthermore, near-total combustion of the mulch layer resulted in significantly more surface fuel carbon emission from thinned and stripped fuel-treated areas compared with the control. We argue that although fuel treatment may benefit smouldering combustion suppression efforts, surface fuel carbon loss should be considered before treatments are implemented on a large scale. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been identified as a valuable crop for biomass and liquid biofuels, as a viable summer forage for cattle, and as a dual-use crop for both applications. The objective of this research was to evaluate trends throughout the growing season in biomass and forage quality of two switchgrass cultivars in central Kentucky over a 2-yr period. Consistent with observed trends about these cultivars, Cave-in-Rock yielded moderate total biomass and had relatively good forage quality through early-mid season growth. Alamo accumulated high total biomass, but demonstrated marginal forage suitability. This research produced trends predicting biomass and forage quality by accumulated growing degree days, and these trends will aid producers in managing switchgrass for biomass and/or forage utilization. © 2018 American Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of America 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Forest trees are valued sources of pulp, timber and biofuels, and serve a role in carbon sequestration, biodiversity maintenance and watershed stability. Examining the relationships among genetic, phenotypic and environmental factors for these species provides insight on the areas of concern for breeders and researchers alike. The TreeGenes database is a web-based repository that is home to 1790 tree species and over 1500 registered users. The database provides a curated archive for high-throughput genomics, including reference genomes, transcriptomes, genetic maps and variant data. These resources are paired with extensive phenotypic information and environmental layers. TreeGenes recently migrated to Tripal, an integrated and open-source database schema and content management system. This migration enabled developments focused on data exchange, data transfer and improved analytical capacity, as well as providing TreeGenes the opportunity to communicate with the following partner databases: Hardwood Genomics Web, Genome Database for Rosaceae, and the Citrus Genome Database. Recent development in TreeGenes has focused on coordinating information for georeferenced accessions, including metadata acquisition and ontological frameworks, to improve integration across studies combining genetic, phenotypic and environmental data. This focus was paired with the development of tools to enable comparative genomics and data visualization. By combining advanced data importers, relevant metadata standards and integrated analytical frameworks, TreeGenes provides a platform for researchers to store, submit and analyze forest tree data. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - A new class of renewable diesel fuels has been synthesized by acid catalyzed condensation of 2-tridecanone with a series of diols that can be generated from biomass. These fuels exhibit comparable net heats of combustion (NHOCs) to conventional biodiesel, while maintaining derived cetane numbers between 82-91, values which are 20-30 units higher than conventional biodiesel and 40-50 units higher than petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The short combustion delays of the dioxolane fuels make them compelling blendstocks to enhance the combustion efficiency of petroleum-derived diesel fuel by increasing the cetane number and oxygen content of the blends. In addition, careful selection of the renewable diol allows for custom tailoring of viscosity and freezing point. Unlike conventional biodiesel which is often generated from plant or animal derived triglycerides, 2-tridecanone and other methyl ketones, along with the diols, can be efficiently generated from biomass sugars or CO 2 /H 2 via fermentation with metabolically engineered microorganisms. This biosynthetic approach may allow for the generation of these fuels on industrially relevant scales while eliminating competition with food sources and promoting responsible use of land resources. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Decease of natural resources and increase of price of fossil fuels at growing energy con-sumption, toughening of ecological standards and necessity of the increase of the level of energet-ics diversification motivates mankind to more wide usage of renewable energy resources includ-ing the solid fuel of biological origin. The potential of biofuel usage is rather considerable be-cause the energy equivalent of the biomass harvest on the land exceeds the worldwide energy consumption several times as much. The biomass application as a renewable fuel is already a re-ality worldwide with the development of policies and technologies that turn viable the transfor-mation of biomass into energy. The aims of this work is to present a literature experimental re-view on the studies concerning to the use of fluidized beds taking into account their design and scale-up. Initially, the usual solid particle terminology and some important biomass properties are presented. A brief description of conversion technologies and the fluidization phenomena are in-troduced, followed by an explanation of the different experimental techniques. The characteristic velocities (initial, apparent, of segregation, and complete) are discussed based on different bio-mass properties, as well as a number of empirical correlations for these velocities are described. Finally, some considerations are made about characteristic bed porosities (apparent and com-plete) and bed expansion. Based on the literature analysis, an improvement has been done on the understanding of the biomass fluidization phenomena, however, further research is needed to comprehend the effect of biomass characteristics on the bed operational parameters, besides more accurate and general correlations must be developed to improve these technologies. © 2018, Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology.
Сокращение запасов и увеличение стоимости ископаемого топлива на фоне ро-ста потребления энергии, ужесточения экологических стандартов и необходимость по-вышения уровня диверсификации энергетики побуждает человечество к более широкому использованию возобновляемых энергоресурсов, в том числе твердых видов топлива био-логического происхождения. Потенциал использования биотоплива весьма значителен, так как энергетический эквивалент земного урожая биомассы на суше в несколько раз превышает общемировое потребление энергии. Применение биомассы в качестве возоб-новляемого топлива стало уже мировой реальностью в связи с развитием стратегий и технологий, которые жизнеспособны для превращения биомассы в энергию. Цель данной работы - представить обзор литературных источников по экспериментальным иссле-дованиям, касающихся использования для этих целей аппаратов с кипящим слоем, при-нимающих во внимание их конструкции и масштабные переходы. Сначала представлена традиционная терминология, касающаяся твердых частиц и важных свойств частиц биомассы. Приведено краткое описание технологий конверсии биомассы и явлений, воз-никающих при ее псевдоожижении, с последующим объяснением различных экспери-ментальных техник. Обсуждены характеристические скорости (начальная, кажущая-ся, сегрегационная и полная) для различных свойств биомассы и многочисленные эмпи-рические формулы для этих скоростей. Наконец, высказаны некоторые соображения о порозности кипящего слоя (кажущейся и полной) и расширения слоя. На основе литера-турного анализа достигнуто лучшее понимание явлений, возникающих при псевдоожи-жении биомассы. Однако необходимы дальнейшие исследования, чтобы осмыслить вли-яние характеристик биомассы на рабочие слои. Кроме того, более точные и обобщенные эмпирические корреляции должны быть получены, чтобы усовершенствовать эти тех-нологии.

AB  - As the EU is moving towards a low carbon economy and seeks to further develop its renewable energy policy, this paper quantitatively investigates the impact of plausible energy market reforms from the perspective of bio-renewables. Employing a state-of-the-art biobased variant of a computable general equilibrium model, this study assesses the perceived medium-term benefits, risks and trade-offs which arise from an advanced biofuels plan, two exploratory scenarios of a more 'sustainable' conventional biofuels plan and a 'no-mandate' scenario. Consistent with more recent studies, none of the scenarios considered present significant challenges to EU food-security or agricultural land usage. An illustrative advanced biofuels plan simulation requires non-trivial public support to implement whilst a degree of competition for biomass with (high-value) advanced biomass material industries is observed. On the other hand, it significantly alleviates land use pressures, whilst lignocellulose biomass prices are not expected to increase to unsustainable levels. Clearly, these observations are subject to assumptions on technological change, sustainable biomass limits, expected trends in fossil fuel prices and EU access to third-country trade. With these same caveats in mind, the switch to increased bioethanol production does not result in significant market tensions in biomass markets. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - �The world’s non-renewable energy resources continually decline and therefore there is an urgent need to seek and use any available renewable energy sources. An alternative to conventional fuels can be the usage of plant biomass for energy purposes. This particularly relates to plants with C4 photosynthesis, a large increase in biomass, low habitat requirements, and high resistance to diseases and pests. All these characteristics are met, among others, by switchgrass which in many countries occurs as a common wild plant. In agricultural production, switchgrass does not pose many agronomic problems; moreover, it is a very durable plant that can be used in one stand for even 10 years and can be grown in all soils, even contaminated ones. Effective use of switchgrass for bioethanol, biogas or syngas production provides measurable ecological benefits and in the long term offers a chance to maintain a sustainable national energy balance, given the continuously shrinking non-renewable fuel resources. Due to the multifaceted use of this plant and a number of features important from the point of view of the power generation industry, it is worth having a closer look at the possibility of spreading the cultivation of this species. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - We present a quantitative analysis of global and regional food supply to reveal the flows of calories, protein and the micro-nutrients Vitamin A, iron and zinc, from production through to human consumption and other end points. We quantify the extent to which reductions in the amount of human-edible crops fed to animals and, less importantly, reductions in waste, could increase food supply. The current production of crops is sufficient to provide enough food for the projected global population of 9.7 billion in 2050, although very significant changes to the socio-economic conditions of many (ensuring access to the global food supply) and radical changes to the dietary choices of most (replacing most meat and dairy with plant-based alternatives, and greater acceptance of human-edible crops currently fed to animals, especially maize, as directly-consumed human food) would be required. Under all scenarios, the scope for biofuel production is limited. Our analysis finds no nutritional case for feeding human-edible crops to animals, which reduces calorie and protein supplies. If society continues on a 'business-as-usual' dietary trajectory, a 119% increase in edible crops grown will be required by 2050. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Ukraine is the only major agricultural country whose production of biofuels has declined since 2010. Nevertheless, it has set a target of 11.5 percent of primary energy supply from biomass, biofuels and waste by 2035. Agricultural land needed to produce biofuels feedstock is calculated for two scenarios based on its current 11.5 percent target and previous 5.0 percent target specified as a share of transport energy consumption. The export orientation of Ukraine's crop sector and resulting foreign currency earnings pose trade-offs if crops are diverted from exports to biofuel feedstocks. Given these trade-offs, policy options for developing a biofuels industry while satisfying Ukraine's export and domestic markets are to (1) bring land not currently cultivated into production and (2) increase yield. Both options are found to have substantial potential. © The author(s) 2018.

AB  - The paper analyzes the role of biofuel sector in three major regions (USA, European Union and Brazil). It focuses on the links between volatility in the yields of feedstock and how these yields feed through to changes in the prices of biofuel crops under different rules for managing biofuel mandates. Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model has been calibrated for the years 2007-2012 to derive, endogenously, biofuel production in each year for all the three regions. Further, the study examines four different volatility variations of possible shocks to yields as representative of natural variations in the production of the feedstocks. It analyzes the impacts of changes in the mandated biofuel under the four variations to see what impact they would have principally on the prices of the key agricultural inputs linked to the biofuel sector. The model results indicate that current mandates have significant impact on the biofuel crops. The world biofuels production is expected to increase by 54% by year 2020. EU ethanol from grains and biodiesel are expected to grow by 85% and 49% respectively. The analysis observes high elasticity of substitution between fossil fuel and biofuels, which results in a greater demand for biofuels when yields of feedstocks rise and prices of feedstocks fall. © 2018 the Author(s).

AB  - The two datasets outlined in this paper contain information related to (a) the local impacts of biofuel feedstock production, and (b) the factors that influence the adoption and/or sustained use of ethanol stoves in southern Africa. The first dataset was generated through extensive household surveys around four operational jatropha and sugarcane production sites in Malawi, Mozambique, and Swaziland. This project aimed to examine the local impacts of the most prominent modes of existing or intended biofuel feedstock production in southern Africa. The resulting dataset contains information about impacts on rural livelihoods, ecosystem services, food security and poverty alleviation. The second dataset is the outcome of research into factors that influence the adoption and sustained use of ethanol stoves. This dataset was collected through a household survey in Maputo city where the only large-scale ethanol stove dissemination programme in Africa has been implemented. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Despite growing awareness about its detrimental effects on tropical biodiversity, land conversion to oil palm continues to increase rapidly as a consequence of global demand, profitability, and the income opportunity it offers to producing countries. Although most industrial oil palm plantations are located in Southeast Asia, it is argued that much of their future expansion will occur in Africa. We assessed how this could affect the continent's primates by combining information on oil palm suitability and current land use with primate distribution, diversity, and vulnerability. We also quantified the potential impact of large-scale oil palm cultivation on primates in terms of range loss under different expansion scenarios taking into account future demand, oil palm suitability, human accessibility, carbon stock, and primate vulnerability. We found a high overlap between areas of high oil palm suitability and areas of high conservation priority for primates. Overall, we found only a few small areas where oil palm could be cultivated in Africa with a low impact on primates (3.3 Mha, including all areas suitable for oil palm). These results warn that, consistent with the dramatic effects of palm oil cultivation on biodiversity in Southeast Asia, reconciling a large-scale development of oil palm in Africa with primate conservation will be a great challenge. © National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Thermophilic microorganisms are capable of growing on polymeric substrates and have been intensively studied for their enzymes, thermostable hydrolases (glycosidases, proteinases, lipases), which have important applications in many fields of bioindustry: production of detergents, food processing, paper and textile industry, biofuel formation from organic wastes, etc.1. The advantages of thermostable enzymes application are in their higher stability not only against temperature, but also against high or low pH, presence of detergents, etc. High temperature increases solubility of substrates2, thus making them more available, and significantly decreases the contamination risks. Many highly stablehydrolases,producedby thermophilicbacteria and archaea have been discovered3-6; however, due to continuous industrial demand and our knowledge that natural environments are a significant reservoir of genetic and hence functional diversity7, new thermophilic organisms producing hydrolytic enzymes are still of high interest. Here we present our achievements in isolation of novel thermophilic bacteria and archaea with various hydrolytic activities. © 2018 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on biomass composition of plants collected from saline habitats, Phragmites karka (Retz.) Trin. ex Steud. has emerged as a suitable feedstock for biofuel. In the present study, plant growth, eco-physiological responses and bioenergy characteristics of P. karka grown under conditions ranging from non-saline to ~80% seawater salinity are reported. Moderate salinity (NaCl at 100 molm-3) increased plant fresh weight (20%), number of leaves (25%) and specific plant length, which were directly linked with increased net photosynthetic rate (25%) and stomatal conductance (25%) compared with the non-saline control. Higher photosynthetic efficiency was achieved by increasing electron transport rate (ETR, 20%), effective quantum yield (YII, 21%) and maximum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm, 20%). Decreased non-photochemical quenching (Y(NPQ)) and malondialdehyde content (18%) indicated an oxidative balance, which was also reflected in total carotenoids and chlorophylls. These eco-physiological parameters worked together to increase cellulose (34%) and hemicellulose (70%) at NaCl concentrations up to 200 molm-3. Decreased growth under higher salinity could be linked with photosynthesis inhibition, due to stomatal closure and co-occurring reduction in CO2 uptake. Lower stomatal conductance increased water-use efficiency but led to over-production of reactive oxygen species, which disturbed oxidative stability (increasing ETR/PN) and imposed membrane leakage. Consequently, plants accumulated more carotenoids and soluble carbohydrates to stabilise PSII machinery (Fv/Fm, YII and Y(NPQ)), and to survive under high salinity. Such adaptations, however, led to growth penalty and reduced quality of lignocellulosic biomass. The above findings suggest that P. karka qualifies as a suitable raw material for biofuel under moderate salinity. © CSIRO 2018.

AB  - Due to its wide distribution across the world, the snail Radix auricularia plays a central role in the transferal of energy and biomass by consuming plant biomass in freshwater systems. The gut microbiota are involved in the nutrition, digestion, immunity, and development of snails, particularly for cellulolytic bacteria, which greatly contribute to the digestion of plant fiber. For the first time, this study characterized the gut bacterial communities of R. auricularia, as well as predicted functions, using the Illumina Miseq platform to sequence 16S rRNA amplicons. Both juvenile snails (JS) and adult snails (AS) were sampled. The obtained 251,072 sequences were rarefied to 214,584 sequences and clustered into 1,196 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% sequence identity. The predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (JS: 36.0%, AS: 31.6%) and Cyanobacteria (JS: 16.3%, AS: 19.5%), followed by Chloroflexi (JS: 9.7%, AS: 13.1%), Firmicutes (JS: 14.4%, AS: 6.7%), Actinobacteria (JS: 8.2%, AS: 12.6%), and Tenericutes (JS: 7.3%, AS: 6.2%). The phylum Cyanobacteria may have originated from the plant diet instead of the gut microbiome. A total of 52 bacterial families and 55 genera were found with > 1% abundance in at least one sample. A large number of species could not be successfully identified, which could indicate the detection of novel ribotypes or result from insufficient availability of snail microbiome data. The core microbiome consisted of 469 OTUs, representing 88.4% of all sequences. Furthermore, the predicted function of bacterial community of R. auricularia performed by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States suggests that functions related to metabolism and environmental information processing were enriched. The abundance of carbohydrate suggests a strong capability of the gut microbiome to digest lignin. Our results indicate an abundance of bacteria in both JS and AS, and thus the bacteria in R. auricularia gut form a promising source for novel enzymes, such as cellulolytic enzymes, that may be useful for biofuel production. Furthermore, searching for xenobiotic biodegradation bacteria may be a further important application of these snails. © 2018 Hu et al.

AB  - The sewage treatment process is inherently associated with formation of sewage sludge, which has to be managed properly due to its properties. The paper presents a possibility of application of sewage sludge in the cultivation of Jerusalem artichoke as an energy crop. The experiment consisted in single application of sewage sludge pads with varied thickness under the sod-humic horizon of silty fallow soil. Physicochemical and chemical analyses of the sewage sludge and soil treated with the pads were carried out in accordance with legal guidelines. The results of the experiment were compared with the control, i.e. an object without the application of the sewage sludge pad. The paper presents the effect of the addition of sewage sludge on the yield and energy parameters (moisture and ash content, HHV, LHV) in the aboveground biomass of Jerusalem artichoke. The content of moisture and ash as well as HHV and LHV, i.e. biofuel parameters, were determined in accordance with Polish Standards. It was found that the yield of aboveground biomass of Jerusalem artichoke increased with the thickness of the sewage sludge pads and the yield potential of this plant increased with years. Additionally, the aboveground Jerusalem artichoke biomass was characterized by generally favorable energy parameters of biofuels, e.g. low moisture or ash content. The investigations have demonstrated that the application of sewage sludge can be a good alternative to mineral fertilization of energy crops. © Copyright by Polish Academy of Sciences and Institute of Environmental Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Zabrze, Poland 2018

AB  - Amongst renewable energies, the use of biomass for fuel production is certainly one of the most controversially discussed forms. Although biofuels have been criticized for years, the EU and its member states persistently support this alternative fuel. The politically-driven development of biofuels has, especially in Germany, grown very fast in the years 1995 to 2012. This study is interested in the discursive environment that contributed to this growth. By applying a media discourse analysis, we investigated the perception of biofuels, discourse coaltions, and why some actors managed to dominate the public debate on biofuels. As our results show, biofuel supporters were most successful as 1. they found several advocates across different policy areas, 2. made use of the most significant frame within the debate, and 3. used a variety of arguments in a broad, but still incorporated set of frames. © 2018 J.

AB  - We investigate the public preference heterogeneity of planting genetically improved poplar trees for biofuel production on public land in western Canada. Using a sample of the public from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, respondents were asked to vote in a series of hypothetical referenda comparing the new, proposed forest policies with the current policy (base scenario). Proposed policies varied based on poplar breeding method (traditional, genomics, or genetic modification) and whether poplars may be used for biofuel production. A respondents’ segmentation framework with cluster analysis and probit model was applied to data of respondents to uncover the heterogeneity of public’s perception. The results of this study reveal that positive and negative perceptions about planting genetically improved poplar trees in the region create a division of respondents into Environmentalists, Knowledgeable, Challengers, and Supporters. Respondents from British Columbia and Manitoba are identified as Environmentalists and Challengers, respectively, of the new policy of planting genetically improved poplar trees on public land. Conversely, respondents from Saskatchewan and Alberta are identified as Supporters and Knowledgeable, respectively, of the new policy. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - To provide an excellent way for the remediation of Cd-contaminated cropland in northen China, the bottom ash of the biomass power plant in northen China was selected to produce a heavy metal deactivator (HMD). Isothermal adsorption experiments, pot experiments, and in situ experiments were conducted. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cd was over 10 mg·g1 and was much higher than that of coal fly ash; the contribution rate of precipitation to total adsorption was less than 30% when the pH of adsorption equilibrium solution was neutral. According to the results of the pot experiments, with the amendment of 3% W/W HMD to soil, the Cd in rice decreased over 80%, and with the amendment of 2% W/W HMD, the Cd in cabbage leaves decreased over 90%. The in situ experiments showed that, with the amendment of 1% W/W HMD, the Cd and Pb in corn root decreased by 53.5% and 64.4%, respectively, and production increased by 20.5%; whereas with the amendment of 2% W/W HMD, the Cd in wheat seed decreased by 33% and production increased by 72.5%. The main chemical composition of HMD made by the bottom ash of the biomass power plant in northen China is silicon, potassium, and calcium, and the risk from its heavy metal content is very low. © 2018 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

AB  - Egypt is one of the countries that suffer from a deficit in the trade balance due to the high value of imports of crops used for the production of biofuels, which account for about 40% of the deficit in the trade balance. It also suffers from the high value of petroleum imports, which amounted to about 17% of the deficit in the trade balance. The problem of the study is the energy crisis and the increasing deficit in the trade balance. The objective of the study is cultivate non-food plants, such as jatropha for biofuel production, which contains about 35-40% of the oil in the seed. A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using jatropha as one of the sources of bio-fuel production, The most important results show that the Jatropha plant project is profitable and economically feasible, as the sensitivity analysis proved the resilience of this project against the risk, such as increasing costs and decrease in revenue at the same time.Net profit is about 3391.92 pounds, Also, the oil extraction project of the seeds of Jatropha proved economically feasible. Therefore, the study is recommends adopting and applying bio-fuel production from Jatropha plant. © 2018 ISISnet: Innovative Scientific Information Services Network. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the context of large scale investments on agricultural land for biofuels, this paper analyses the creation and distribution of value added and gross margins along the emerging Chisumbanje sugarcane bio-ethanol value chain in Zimbabwe. Using empirical data collected using different approaches, the study customised inputoutput modelling and multiple gross margin analysis to analyse wealth creation and distribution along this chain. The evidence shows that income distribution is skewed towards vertically integrated large corporates and this value chain in general is not inclusive of smallholder farmers. The private investor is getting more than seventy-three percent of the income that is generated along the whole chain while the rest is shared among the settler farmers, war veterans and the government agency. The pricing of US$4 per tonne makes primary production of sugarcane a loss-making enterprise, systematically this disincentivising any potential entrants into primary sugarcane production. The emerging sugarcane bio-ethanol value chain is not inclusive. © Kamla-Raj 2018.

AB  - This study assesses greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation options for the agriculture sector. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model was used to develop a framework to assess future trends in energy demand and associated GHG emissions for the agriculture sector and to assess various GHG mitigation options associated with energy consumption. A business-as-usual (reference) scenario and 32 GHG mitigation scenarios were developed for the years 2009-2050 using the LEAP model. A case study for Alberta, Canada, was conducted. In the model, GHG mitigation scenarios were developed for the energy demand side (e.g., farm machines, farm transportation, lighting, and ventilation) based on efficiency improvements and the use of renewable energy. The mitigation scenarios were divided into two planning horizons based on technology penetration: slow penetration (2009-2050) and fast penetration (2009-2030). For each planning horizon, 16 scenarios were assessed. Of all farm machines, efficient diesel tractors have the highest GHG mitigation potential: 12.35 MT of CO2 equivalent by 2050 and 4.7 MT of CO2 equivalent by 2030. In addition, GHG abatement cost curves show that biodiesel tractors and efficient diesel tractors have the highest GHG mitigation potential, with attractive abatement costs of -$62 and -$11 tonne-1 of CO2 mitigated by 2050, respectively. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Events of mass malformations in amphibian populations that have exceeded historical records have been reported over the past thirty years. Many of these events have been linked to human activities that occurred near amphibian breeding habitats. The rise in biofuels has promoted, and continues to promote, the growth of sugarcane plantations in Brazil, with the northwest region of São Paulo State having experienced the largest sugarcane expansion over the past few decades. In this region, we sampled temporary ponds located in agroecosystems dominated to different degrees by sugarcane. We found several larvae of Scinax fuscovarius with eye malformations (anophthalmia, aphakia, microphthalmia and sub-development). In this study, we assessed whether the distance from the ponds to the nearest sugarcane crop, the proportion of sugarcane surrounding the ponds, the presence of pesticides in the ponds, or the proportion of land uses with potential teratogens that surround the ponds were related to the frequencies of amphibian eye malformations. We found pesticides present in 11 of the 18 ponds, but none of the predictor variables was associated with the frequencies of amphibian eye malformations. Thus, our results suggest that the observed frequencies of amphibian eye malformations could be a consequence of natural mutation rates, and these data could be used as a malformation baseline for the region. This malformation baseline is the first reported for amphibians in South America and may be useful in future surveys on amphibian populations in tropical agroecosystems. © Copyright 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Despite their advantages when replacing fossil fuels, biofuels have faced some concerns related to their expansion within the so-called “food vs. bioenergy” debate. This debate relies on the premise that the use of food crops and/or the increase of land use for bioenergy production would affect food availability and price. Nevertheless, it is worth to mention that livestock production is the largest anthropic use of land resources worldwide. In Brazil, livestock production mainly consists of extensive management with low technology level, which results in a low average productivity. The intensification of this system would release pasture areas to expand cropland for biofuels production. In this way, the integration of sugarcane ethanol and livestock production would allow taking advantage of the synergies between both systems; for instance, using sugarcane agroindustrial residues as animal feed ingredients in feedlot systems. In addition, ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstock (second-generation process) is also a possible solution towards a productive land use, since a larger amount of biofuels can be produced per crop area. This work focuses on the sustainability assessment of a first- and second-generation (1G2G) ethanol facility that produces animal feed using sugarcane by-products integrated to livestock production in feedlots. The Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) – a computer framework that simulates the entire production chain and assesses the sustainability impacts of different biorefinery alternatives/routes – was used in this work. This paper indicates that the integration of a future 1G2G sugarcane mill with intensive livestock system may be a feasible alternative. Regarding the economic performance, verticalization of a mill with intensive livestock is preferable when compared to extensive cattle production. Integrated scenarios also have environmental advantages, such as the production of more outputs using the same area, as well as more efficient technologies that may represent lower emissions. In addition, this paper revealed that it is possible to sustainably produce biofuels without displacing food crops or livestock production, which otherwise could advance, for example, in forest areas.

AB  - Biofuels are an important alternative to diversify the national energy system improving the sustainable level for supply the energy requirements of the country. Energy crops have become the new trend for several types of biofuels. Nevertheless, in Colombia this sector uses as raw materials first generation crops, despite the agricultural land available to implement fast-growing species. In a general way, there is a lack of information related to the energetic potential of native and foreign species in Colombia. Almost all previous works have been focused on residual biomass from agricultural sectors. This work includes a general evaluation in order to determine species stablished in Colombia and species not yet reported with potential to be energetically valorized. This evaluation was carried out using the Colombia’s Biodiversity Information System database (SIB by its Spanish acronym) and previous worldwide works of energetic crops reported in similar latitudes. In addition, physicochemical information such as the percentage of hemicelullose, dry matter, ashes, and apparent humidity was obtained. Eleven (11) families of crops were selected and compiled in twenty two (22) species and then were classified having into account soil type and crop requirements. The cultivation areas were calculated analyzing the Geographic Information System including the information related to crop requirements, protected zones, urban zones and fresh water sources. Specifically, in Cundinamarca were identified species related to families Fabaceae, Pinaceae and Poaceae. The species Arundo donax L. (Pinaceae family) has the higher specific area for this group of species with a value of around 213.000 hectares in the department of Cundinamarca which corresponds thirty five (35) percentage of the total area in the basin. Nevertheless, the energy potential calculated as a function of available areas and physicochemical properties is in the range of 18,000 TJ/year less than other species evaluated in this work. The technologies identified to carry out the energetic valorization of the crops are a function of their content of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. In this sense, families with a lignin content around 25 % (Salicaceae and Pinaceae) could be used as raw materials to gasification and pyrolysis processes and families with cellulose and hemicellulose content around 48 and 64 % (Myrtaceae and Poaceae) could be valorized through fermentation processes after a pretreatment of the biomass obtained in the Bogota´s river basin. In this case Furans could be a high value product. From them, high octane fuels can be obtained. In a general way, there is a huge potential in the department of Cundinamarca to implement energetic crops in, which can avoid food competition, contribute to sustainable development and improve the quality of life of the citizens.

AB  - Arid lands in EU MED areas are increasing in extension year by year, as it is well documented by many studies of International Institutions (as EC-JRC, EEA, etc). EU MED farmers face the dramatic effects of extended drought conditions, that combined with extreme phenomena as floodings or thunderstorms make economic profitability of agriculture very low or even negative. This is associated with a clearly increasing abandonment rate of agricultural land in EU. The most EU critical areas are located in Spain, but also Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as in the non-EU Southern rim of the MED basin. Biochar could represent an effective approach to fight desertification, together with other agronomic practices which can vary depending on the specific location or crops. Biochar can be cheaply produced from residual biomass through processes such as slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization, and its combination with compost obtained from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) or digestate from anaerobic digestion can offer both a short and a medium-to-long term effect in dryland agriculture. These lands, that otherwise would inevitably leave the active utilisation in conventional agriculture, would be suitable for energy crop cultivation, as drought resistant oil crop, well meeting the latest indications in the EC REDII proposal. Through biochar (and derived product) application, the loss of Utilised Agricultural Land in EU MED drylands can be prevented. From the policy side, it thus makes sense to investigate if existing policies are sufficient to facilitate the wide market deployment of biochar, or if new instruments are needed. Our analysis demonstrates that currently operational EU policies, could be well used to implement biochar related actions in arid lands. However, most often these measures are not transferred into concrete programmes at regional level, especially in the agricultural sector. In fact, EU and Member States already have quite a large number of instruments that can directly or indirectly support actions targeted to increase the resilience of these arid lands to Climate Change, generating a significant impact on the environmental and socio-economic situation. Policy should support initiatives that can provide clear evidences, be cost- and environmentally-effective, and adapted to local conditions. The present work investigated EU/MS policies that could potentially support the improvement of soil resilience to climate change in EU MED region, by enabling widespread diffusion of biochar. The EU legislative elements that were considered are the EU agricultural policy, the EU Carbon sequestration & storage policy (seen in the framework of the COP21 agreement and its core goals), and the EU renewable energy policy, even if others would also apply. We considered sunflower cultivation in dry land of Central area (Tuscany) of Italy. Results showed that marginal land could be seen as an opportunity to produce low-ILUC biofuels (as mentioned in the EC REDII proposed Directive), without conflicting with food production or generating negative effects on GHG emissions. The Long-term storage of C in the soil through biochar would perfectly match with the Climate strategy defined at International level (Paris COP21 and following). Soil, after ocean, is the second most abundant C sink: Paris-COP21 called for C-negative actions (and not just C-neutral ones). In this respect, the proposed approach would perfectly match with EU (ETS) and International (COP21) policy for the coming decades. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - With the transportation sector growing considerably and demand for transport fuels rising globally, this study looks at the current and future status and technical/economic potential of lignocellulosic biofuels in India in a business-as-usual (BAU), national policy on biofuel (NPB) and 2 ° C climate stabilization scenarios. It identifies key challenges in achieving the country's biofuel targets, and analyses their role in India's long-term transport scenarios. In this study, we have used ANSWER MARKAL model to assess the economic potential of biofuels obtained through lignocellulosic agricultural residues. The results indicate that the current ethanol and biodiesel availability in India through the first generation biofuel route is not sufficient to meet the country's biofuel target. On the other hand, lignocellulosic agricultural residues can produce 38 and 51 billion litres of lignocellulosic ethanol/BTL in 2020 and 2030, respectively, which would be sufficient to meet the NPB's 20 percent blending by 2030. Apart from biofuel availability, we assess the investment requirement for second generation biofuel industry, reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and impact on rural employment in different scenarios. © 2018 the Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review and examine the recent investment trends of firms operating in the food, feed and biofuel production and processing sectors in Latin America. The inter-related nature of these three sub-sectors and the great expansion they have gone through in the last decade showcases a series of socioeconomic and environmental policy challenges thus making it relevant to identify their different business models through a typology. Design/methodology/approach: The paper first presents an unprecedented literature review based on field observations and media coverage of agri-business strategies of the food, feed and biofuel production in the region. It then moves to an in-depth analysis of investment operations that serve to classify such firms into a business model typology considering degree of internationalization and integration. The typology is a useful mechanism to enhance public policy analysis and uncover market or government incentives behind business decisions. Findings: By focusing on investment strategies, the paper illustrates how both market and government incentives shape and affect the performance and consolidation of different players in the food, feed and biofuel sub-sectors in Latin America. The resulting effects have strong economic as well as social and environmental implications because such economic activities have an impact on global food and energy security. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include a reliance on largely qualitative evidence and research methods due to unavailability of consistent numerical data in these specific agri-business sub-sectors. Originality/value: This paper is unique in its focus on business models in a particularly relevant set of agri-business sub-sectors in Latin America and its implications to promote investment and innovation in value chain development while considering regional-specific challenges. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Based on the concept of environmental policy integration, qualitative expert interview and participative mapping, this paper focuses on the causes and consequences of environmental impacts on mangroves triggered by ill-coordinated public policies at México’s southern Pacific coast. In this context, we identified not only the specific measures applied by governmental institutions and their impacts, but also other crucial political, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, which determined the scale and spatial extension of ecosystem degradation. As a result, public policies lacking environmental integration, particularly stream straightening and incentivesto promote the production of biofuel made form African oil palms, were the decisive triggers, but not the sole agents of mangroves’ degradation. The scale and spatial extension of observed impacts rather depend on multiply factors, not necessarily related to public policies. Moreover, an explicitly spatial dimension to the qualitative results is provided. © 2018, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., popularly known as the physic nut, is a monoecious, perennial lactiferous species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. Recently, interest in this species has been growing, due to its ability to flourish on degraded land and in soils with low natural fertility, the high oil content of its seeds, its rapid growth and easy propagation, and the identification of several secondary metabolites with medicinal importance. This study aims to report the main trends and gaps in the global scientific literature about J. curcas L, using a scientometric analysis. We have carried out this scientometric analysis on the global literature to identify: 1) temporal publication trends; 2) the quality of scientific production, estimated using citation numbers and journal impact factors; 3) the main journals and countries interested in this topic and the language of scientific divulgation; 4) the main research fields; 5) the use of wild or commercial cultivars; and 6) average authorship levels and international collaboration networks. Our findings have revealed a continuous increase in both quantitative and qualitative parameters in studies about J. curcas. The main trends in physic nut studies involve biofuel production and the plant’s agronomic characteristics. The main knowledge gaps relating to J. curcas are in the fields of forestry, sustainability, animal nutrition, and genetic improvement. Another problem identified in this study is a lack of commercial seeds; none of the studies analyzed have used commercial seeds. India, Brazil, and China together are responsible for 55% of the knowledge about this species, obtained through scientific production. Only moderate international collaboration has been observed between countries, perhaps as consequence of conflicts of interest. Despite an increasing number of articles, some countries have stopped producing J. curcas L, and the worldwide crop production has decreased. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

AB  - The future supply of energy to meet growing energy demand of rapidly exapanding populations is based on wide energy resources, particularly the renewable ones. Among all resources, lignocellulosic biomasses such as agriculture, forest, and agro-industrial residues are the most abundant and easily available bioresource for biorefineries to provide fuels, chemicals, and materials. However, pretreatment of biomass is required to overcome the physical and chemical barriers that exist in the lignin–carbohydrate composite and pretreatment facilitate the entry of biocatalysts for the conversion of biomass into fermentable sugars and other by-products. Therefore, pretreatment of the biomass is necessary prerequisite for efficient hydrolysis of lignocelluloses into different type of fermentable sugars. The physiochemical, biochemical and biological pretreatment methods are considered as most promising technologies for the biomass hydrolysis and are discussed in this review article. We also discussed the recent advancements and modern trends in pretreatment methods of lignocelluloses conversion into ethanol with special focus on fermentation methods. © 2018 Frontiers in Bioscience.

AB  - Detrital soil contamination during wood harvesting cannot be avoided without a further cleaning step. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of Piedmont soil on pinewood pyrolysis products. Ash content was varied at 0.56%, 1.16%, 2.77%, 4.40%, 6.87%, 8.35%, and 15.52% by adding soil to woodchips to mimic the highly soilcontaminated biomass that can be found in biorefineries. This study found that bio-oil yield decreased from 47.1% to 26.3% with an increase in ash content from 0.56% to 15.52%. However, the oxygen content of the bio-oil decreased and the carbon content increased, which led to an increase in heating value from 22.5 to 24.9 MJ kg-1. Inorganics in the soil aided in the catalytic cracking and dehydration reactions for bio-oil formation. A slight increase in the total acid number (106 to 117 mg KOH g-1) and water content (20.72% to 24.99%) was observed with more soil inclusion in the pyrolysis. The effect of soil on biochar O/C and H/C ratios was minimal even though the heating value decreased with an increase in soil content. This study showed that soil (4%wt to 7%wt) in the biomass assisted in deoxygenating the bio-oil and lowered the total mass yield while keeping the total energy yield almost constant. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The article analyses the effects of the development of biofuel production in the EU (European Union) countries. For this purpose, the authors develop and adapt methodology to determine biofuel production effects considering resource prices, the areas of distribution and employment in the EU. Twenty-seven EU member states are selected for empirical research. Over 98% of production is devoted to first-generation biofuels; therefore, second- and third-generation biofuels are not analysed. The empirical study is carried out by analysing the dynamics of quantitative indicators, and we assess changes in direction by setting the values of qualitative indicators. Quantitative and qualitative indicators are calculated using correlation analysis. The results suggest that the fastest growth of ethanol production in the EU took place in Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands. During the analysed period, Germany and France were the largest producers of ethanol and biodiesel. The regression analysis showed a very strong correlation between the number of jobs created and biofuel production. There is also a very strong correlation between the volume of production of biofuels and land used for biofuel feedstock production. The production of biofuel does not significantly affect food and feed crop prices. © 2018, Agricultural Economics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Even though it is regarded as a crucial economic activity worldwide, mining has a significant negative impact on environment. Due to its nature, especially opencast mining inevitably leads to serious degradation on ecological and aesthetic values of the landscape. Topography and drainage, air, soil and water quality, vegetation including forest ecosystems, noise levels and ground vibrations, human health and habitation can be listed as the typical parameters that are mainly affected by opencast mining activities. When the extraction of reserve is over, the altered landscape has to be reclaimed in order to relieve the damaging effects of opencast mining and restore the landscape and its immediate surroundings. Biomass as an energy source is an alternative to fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas). Burning either fossil fuels or biomass releases carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the plants that are the source of biomass capture a nearly equivalent amount of CO2 through photosynthesis while they are growing, which can make biomass a carbon-neutral energy source. © 2018, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Biofuels have expanded across the globe, generating a range of concerns in the places of production. One approach to controlling the effects of biofuel production has been sustainability standards. This article takes a 'seeing like' approach to analyse how the EU Sustainability standard contributes to narrowing the vision of what sustainable biofuels are. Six biofuel cases in Africa are examined through the lens of the standard, using remote sensing to investigate the criteria on land use and canopy cover change. The standard view is also compared to on ground views regarding the sustainability of the projects. The effects of seeing like the EU standard are two: 1) diluted seeing, which prioritises global environmental problems over more nuanced social and institutional aspects; and 2) distributed seeing, which transforms standardised sustainable biofuels into multiple, uncertain forms because of hybrid governance. High carbon losses due to biofuel projects were detected, but at the same time, the standard simplifies and skips over wider problems related to unsustainable biofuel projects. © 2018, Okanagan University College.

AB  - Recent advances in land system science and in institutional analysis provide complementary, but still largely disconnected perspectives on land use change, governance, and sustainability in social-ecological systems, which are interconnected across distance. In this paper we bring together the emerging concept of telecoupled land systems and the established concept of polycentric governance to support the analysis and the development of sustainable land governance in interconnected social-ecological systems. We operationalize the two concepts by analyzing networks of action situations in which interactions between proximate and distant actors as well as socioeconomic and ecological processes cause land use change and affect the sustainability of land systems. To illustrate this integrated approach empirically, we analyze a case of transnational biofuel investment in Sierra Leone. We identify the characteristics of, and activities in, networks of action situations that affect the sustainability of land systems related to this case. Integration of the two concepts of telecoupled land systems and polycentric governance enables analysts to identify interactions in polycentric governance systems (1) as drivers of telecoupled sustainability problems and (2) as transformative approaches to such problems. The method provides one way for linking place-based analysis of land change with process-based analysis of land governance. © 2018 by the author(s).

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly necessary, if we are to achieve the changes required to address the impacts of global warming. Biomass is the most common form of renewable energy, widely used in the third world but until recently, less so in the Western world. Latterly much attention has been focused on identifying suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs, to replace conventional fossil fuel energy sources. The type of biomass required is largely determined by the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. The potential of reclaimed land of mines to act as a biofuel source, providing fuel to supplement conventional power stations, is examined, together with the replacement of fuels in gas or diesel boilers for the production of thermal energy. © 2018, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Contamination of agricultural soil is a worldwide problem, with heavy metals being a major part of the concern. Bioenergy crop production is also a profitable phytoremediation strategy using biofuel crops for both utilization and remediation of contaminated soil. To investigate lead (Pb) accumulation and tolerance of three different energy crop cultivars, three-week-old healthy seedlings were grown in Hoagland solution supplemented with five different concentrations of Pb 0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg. At the end of 30 days, Pb content and translocation, tolerance index, bioconcentration factor, and growth parameters of the plants were evaluated in the study. Results showed that increasing Pb concentrations did not affected the growth and development of Sunburst (Panicum virgatum L.) and Dinçer (Carthamus tinctorius L.) cultivars. The highest Pb contents were also found in roots and shoots of Sunburst and Tarsan-1018 (Helianthus annuus L.) cultivars. Dinçer cultivar has a high ability to transfer Pb from root to shoot when compared to others. These results suggest that these cultivars may be good candidates for remediation of Pb-contaminated areas for use in biofuel production. © 2018, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cellulosomes are multienzyme complexes produced by anaerobic, cellulolytic bacteria for highly efficient breakdown of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Clostridium clariflavum is an anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium that produces the largest assembled cellulosome complex in nature to date, comprising three types of scaffol-dins: a primary scaffoldin, ScaA; an adaptor scaffoldin, ScaB; and a cell surface anchoring scaffoldin, ScaC. This complex can contain 160 polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. In previous studies, we proposed potential types of cellulosome assemblies in C. clariflavum and demonstrated that these complexes are released into the extracellular medium. In the present study, we explored the disposition of the highly structured, four-tiered cell-anchored cellulosome complex of this bacterium. Four separate, integral cellulosome components were subjected to immunolabeling: ScaA, ScaB, ScaC, and the cellulosome’s most prominent enzyme, GH48. Imaging of the cells by correlating scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that some of the protuberance-like structures on the cell surface represent cellulosomes and that the components are highly colocalized and organized by a defined hierarchy on the cell surface. The display of the cellulosome on the cell surface was found to differ between cells grown on soluble or insoluble substrates. Cell growth on microcrystalline cellulose and wheat straw exhibited dramatic enhancement in the amount of cellulosomes displayed on the bacterial cell surface.IMPORTANCE Conversion of plant biomass into soluble sugars is of high interest for production of fermentable industrial materials, such as biofuels. Biofuels are a very attractive alternative to fossil fuels, both for recycling of agricultural wastes and as a source of sustainable energy. Cellulosomes are among the most efficient enzymatic degraders of biomass known to date, due to the incorporation of a multiplicity of enzymes into a potent, multifunctional nanomachine. The intimate association with the bacterial cell surface is inherent in its efficient action on lignocellulosic substrates, although this property has not been properly addressed experimentally. The dramatic increase in cellulosome performance on recalcitrant feedstocks is critical for the design of cost-effective processes for efficient biomass degradation. © 2018 Artzi et al.

AB  - International institutions are proliferating over a wide range of issue areas, creating what have recently been described as regime complexes. More than complicated arrangements, regime complexes are structures: they are more than the sum of their parts, i.e. individual international regimes. While the concept of international regimes holds strong promise in this direction, academic research on regime complexes has mostly focused on how agents shape regime complexes but less on how complexes influence agents. This contribution aims at filling this gap by studying the effects that regime complexes might have on global governance, focusing more narrowly on the effects of regime complexes on non-state actors' (NSAs) strategies with regard to agenda setting for new international regulations. More precisely, we hypothesise that regime complexes create an 'emulsifying effect' for pro-active NSAs to push for new regulations whereby the collective effect of non-state actors within and across regime complexes become greater than the sum of their individual effects within individual regimes. We use the examples of food security and biofuels regulations at the international level as a case study with a special focus on the European Union. © 2018 University Association for Contemporary European Studies.

AB  - The importance of biodiesel production was studied and analyzed based on research papers and theses published by different authors in various e-journals. The hike in fossil fuel prices with increase in usage demands, has forced the research to find new alternatives to petroleum fuels. Despite this, there is a crucial need to protect the environment from harmful effects of fossil fuels. Biodiesel is a renewable alternate fuel substitute that can be obtained by using various chemical methods such as transesterification, acid-catalyzed methanolysis etc. detailed survey of available literature is taken to review the different research achievements on different aqueous as well as land species for producing biodiesel as an alternative fuel for a compression ignition engine, problems associated with their production, such as the oil quality and quantity and also the methodology used for their production. In addition to this, general properties of oils taken from different natural species as well as techniques of biodiesel production and utilization have been collected. © 2018 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - Development of rapid and efficient propagation methods for Jatropha curcas are highly desirable since its seed oil can be used as biofuel and hence of high economic value. Dormancy, decreased viability with age, and low germination rate are amongst the common problems associated with its conventional propagation through seeds. In vitro germination of seeds, specifically during the dormant periods by using some pretreatments were therefore focused to help resolve some of these limiting issues. Pretreatments included presoaking of seeds in water overnight, scarification, stratification and removal of seed coats. It was observed that the orientation of the seeds on the culture media also had an effect on its germination rate. Disinfection of naked seeds could not support germination so the seeds were disinfected before removing the seed coats. It was observed that the removal of seed coats only could break the dormancy of seeds to get 100% In vitro germination on full strength MS medium kept in the dark at 25 ± 2˚C in the months of December to January. Such seedlings were shifted in light conditions (16h photoperiod) after the root emergence at the same temperature to support chlorophyll development. Seedlings were successfully acclimatized by shifting to a mixture of peat, clay and silt (1:1:1 v/v) in greenhouse. It is expected that the reported method of propagation would help to develop suitable tissues for germplasm preservation, large scale rapid plant propagation and may find its application in crop improvement and hence profitability in a broader sense. © 2018, Pakistan Botanical Society.

AB  - This study describes properties of biomasses of Moringa oleifera Lamarck for energetic applications of production of biodiesel and briquettes. The seeds collected of the mature pods were the initial biomasses used of this plant. The seeds were separated into husks and oilseed grains, from which the oils were extracted by mechanical pressing and by solvent extraction. The crude oilmixed (of pressing and by solvent) was degummed, neutralized,washed, dried and characterized. The purified oilwas converted into methyl biodiesel in homogeneous alkaline transesterification, which was purified and characterized. The residual peels and pies had their calorific powersmeasured and compared with classic agricultural residues: firewood, sugarcane bagasse and coconut husks.Moringa culture was compared to soybeans in agricultural and biodiesel production perspectives. The analytical results show that the biomasses of the moringa are favorable as renewable biofuels like biodiesel or briquettes due to the good calorific power and simple and accessible productive technology. The production of briquettes starting from the biomasses of the moringa would be recommended with the uses of the pod husks, seed peels and pies (cakes) of extraction of the oil. The agricultural management and the simple productive technologies applied to the moringa are favorable for social inclusion by enabling family agriculture. © F.S.G. Pereira et al.

AB  - A study was conducted to construct functions for aboveground biomass of different components (leaves, stems, and branches) of hazel (Corylus avellana L.), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), and alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) growing naturally under the stand canopy. The functions were designed to calculate the potential amount of biofuel produced from underbrush species in Lithuanian forests. Biomass production of common underbrush species was estimated in seven stands located in in southwestern Lithuania. The ages of the stands varied from 55-70 to 80-100 years. The biomass relationships with morphometric parameters were determined, including stem diameter at 1.3 m and 0.3 m above ground level, stem height, and crown length. The study findings showed that biomass relationships for underbrush species were not comparable to the same relationships for canopy trees. As the biomass changes for canopy trees are mostly caused by competition, and the growth of underbrush species depends more on the light regime. Therefore, stem diameter (D) rather than stem height (H) should be better used for estimating total aboveground biomass of underbrush. © 2018, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioenergy is booming as nations seek to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union declared biofuels to be carbon-neutral, triggering a surge in wood use. But do biofuels actually reduce emissions? A molecule of CO2 emitted today has the same impact on radiative forcing whether it comes from coal or biomass. Biofuels can only reduce atmospheric CO2 over time through post-harvest increases in net primary production (NPP). The climate impact of biofuels therefore depends on CO2 emissions from combustion of biofuels versus fossil fuels, the fate of the harvested land and dynamics of NPP. Here we develop a model for dynamic bioenergy lifecycle analysis. The model tracks carbon stocks and fluxes among the atmosphere, biomass, and soils, is extensible to multiple land types and regions, and runs in ≈1s, enabling rapid, interactive policy design and sensitivity testing. We simulate substitution of wood for coal in power generation, estimating the parameters governing NPP and other fluxes using data for forests in the eastern US and using published estimates for supply chain emissions. Because combustion and processing efficiencies for wood are less than coal, the immediate impact of substituting wood for coal is an increase in atmospheric CO2 relative to coal. The payback time for this carbon debt ranges from 44-104 years after clearcut, depending on forest type- A ssuming the land remains forest. Surprisingly, replanting hardwood forests with fast-growing pine plantations raises the CO2 impact of wood because the equilibrium carbon density of plantations is lower than natural forests. Further, projected growth in wood harvest for bioenergy would increase atmospheric CO2 for at least a century because new carbon debt continuously exceeds NPP. Assuming biofuels are carbon neutral may worsen irreversible impacts of climate change before benefits accrue. Instead, explicit dynamic models should be used to assess the climate impacts of biofuels. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The global agricultural system is an energy transfer system converting solar radiation to stored chemical energy in the biosphere through photosynthesis and animal metabolism. Stored energy in the agricultural system is principally in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and oils that humanity appropriates for food, fiber, and fuel. The total annual production of global agriculture was tabulated using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization from 1961 to 2013. Annual agricultural production for each agricultural item (T y−1) was converted to energy yield (kJ y−1) utilizing published proximate analyses (% moisture, % protein, % carbohydrate, % fat/lipid, and % ash). Global agricultural energy yield grew linearly over the 1961–2002 interval. From 2002 onward, global agricultural energy yield also grew linearly, but at a rate 2 times the 1961–2002 rate. Overall, agricultural energy yield more than tripled from 1961 to 2013. Unsurprisingly, energy output of global crops dominated, averaging 85.5 ± 0.4% of total energy output. Livestock and poultry production averaged 13.6 ± 0.4% of annual agricultural energy output, while world fisheries and aquaculture averaged 0.8 ± 0.1% of global energy output. From 1961 to 2013, the feeding potential of global agricultural energy yield exceeded the human metabolic energy requirement by an average multiple of 2.1 ± 0.18. Thus, agricultural production is more than sufficient to feed “The Global Mouth” into the future, and feeding world population is not a production problem per se. Instead, the inability of global agriculture to meet worldwide food requirements results from systemic energy losses associated with significant global food waste, diversion of food energy as feed to livestock and poultry, and appropriation of primary agricultural output for biofuels synthesis. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 108–121, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - Increased market viability of harvest residues as forest bioenergy feedstock may escalate removal of coarse woody debris in managed forests. Meanwhile, many forest invertebrates use coarse woody debris for cover, food, and reproduction. Few studies have explicitly addressed effects of operational-scale woody biomass harvesting on invertebrates following clearcutting. Therefore, we measured invertebrate community response to large-scale harvest residue removal and micro-site manipulations of harvest residue availability in recently clearcut, intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests in North Carolina (NC; n = 4) and Georgia (GA; n = 4), USA. We captured 39,794 surface-active invertebrates representing 171 taxonomic groups using pitfall traps situated among micro-site locations (i.e., purposefully retained piles of hardwood stems and piles of conifer stems and areas without coarse woody debris in NC; windrows and no windrows in GA). Micro-site locations were located within six, large-scale treatments (7.16-14.3 ha) in clearcuts. Large-scale treatments represented intensive harvest residue removal, 15% and 30% harvest residue retention, and no harvest residue removal. In NC, ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) were three times more abundant in treatments with no harvest residue removal than those with the most intensive harvest residue removal and were reduced in treatments that retained 15% or 30% of harvest residues, although not significantly. Invertebrate taxa richness was greater at micro-site locations with retained hardwood and pine (Pinus spp.) harvest residues than those with minimal amounts of coarse woody debris. In both states, relative abundances of several invertebrate taxa, including cave crickets (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae), fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae), millipedes (Diplopoda), and wood roaches (Blattodea: Ectobiidae), were greater at micro-site locations with retained harvest residues than those with minimal coarse woody debris. Intensified woody biomass harvesting without retention of ≥15% of harvest residue volume may reduce invertebrate taxa richness and abundances of some key invertebrate taxa in regenerating stands. Further, harvest residue management during and after woody biomass harvesting may be an important consideration for maintaining invertebrate diversity and conserving invertebrates that are influential in the maintenance of ecosystem function and integrity in young forests. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure was used to compare waste management options for kraft pulp mill sludge following its anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of sludge is advantageous because it produces biogas that may be used to generate electricity, heat and biofuels. However, adequate management of the digested sludge is essential. Landfill disposal is a non-sustainable waste management alternative. Kraft pulp mill digested sludge applied to land may pose risks to the environment and public health if the sludge has not been properly treated. This study is aimed to compare several recycling alternatives for anaerobically digested sludge from kraft pulp mills: land application, landfill disposal, composting, incineration, pyrolysis/gasification, and biofuel production by algae. The MCDA procedure considered nine criteria into three domains to compare digested sludge recycling alternatives in a kraft pulp mill: environmental (CO2 emission, exposure to pathogens, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery), economic (overall costs, value of products) and technical (maintenance and operation, feasibility of implementation). The most suitable management options for digested sludge from kraft pulp mills were found to be composting and incineration (when the latter was coupled with recycling ash to the cement industry). Landfill disposal was the worst option, presenting low performance in feasibility of implementation, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery. © 2018 Eikelboom et al.

AB  - Harnessing plant microbiota can assist in sustainably increasing primary productivity to meet growing global demands for food and biofuel. However, development of rational microbiome-based approaches for improving crop yield and productivity is currently hindered by a lack of understanding of the major biotic and abiotic factors shaping the crop microbiome under relevant field conditions. We examined bacterial and fungal communities associated with both aerial (leaves, stalks) and belowground (roots, soil) compartments of four commercial sugarcane varieties (Saccharum spp.) grown in several growing regions in Australia. We identified drivers of the sugarcane microbiome under field conditions and evaluated whether the plants shared a core microbiome. Sugarcane-associated microbial assemblages were primarily determined by plant compartment, followed by growing region, crop age, variety and Yellow Canopy Syndrome (YCS). We detected a core set of microbiota and identified members of the core microbiome that were influenced by YCS incidence. Our study revealed key hub microorganisms in the core microbiome networks of sugarcane leaves, stalks, roots and rhizosphere soil despite location and time-associated shifts in the community assemblages. Elucidating their functional roles and identification of the keystone core microbiota that sustain plant health could provide a technological breakthrough for a sustainable increase in crop productivity. © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Fundamental economic and societal transformations are necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. One broad policy approach that addresses the close relationship between conservation and climate change mitigation is based on correcting a market failure, that is, to establish a price signal for carbon, or more generally, greenhouse gas emissions. While many synergies between climate policy instruments and biodiversity conservation do exist, current policies often fall short of harvesting this potential. Here, we present six key challenges: (1) establishing a strong price signal for greenhouse gas emissions from all emission sources (including land-use and the terrestrial biosphere) that takes into account long-term societal and ecological costs; (2) expand carbon market instruments to cover the full range of greenhouse gases; (3) develop an ambitious, yet accountable architecture for rising emission prices; (4) develop guidelines and ensure enforcement to avoid greenhouse gas leakage; (5) improve greenhouse gas emission measurements from land-use and the biosphere; and (6) integrate emission reduction as a priority into relevant policies. Substantial synergies, but also trade-offs between climate policy and conservation exist, and we identify key risks and challenges. We call for (1) evidence-based evaluations of policy options; (2) avoiding too narrow framings of contested issues such as forest plantations, biofuels, or land-use decisions that exclude (or downplay) indirect effects (e.g., indirect land-use changes or creating carbon debts); and (3) strengthening integrated analyzes beyond sector policy goals. We conclude that avoiding bio-perverse impacts of climate policies on biodiversity will be crucial for the success of global climate change mitigation.

AB  - Biomass based biofuels are already an important energy source, and will increasingly be so in the future as the need for renewable energy rises. Due to their fast multiplication rates, algae can provide a sustainable supply of biomass, and are attractive because they do not compete with food crops for habitat. Here we show that biomass derived from Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis can be pretreated with low cost choline amino acid based ionic liquids to effectively yield lipids (30.6% and 51% total lipids) and sugars (71% and 26% total sugars). The ionic liquids dissolve the lipids, leaving behind a carbohydrate rich solid. The lipids were extracted with hexane, and the solid was subjected to enzyme hydrolysis to release fermentable sugars. These results open new pathways towards the dual production of biodiesel and bioethanol from algae, using low cost ionic liquids. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper analyzes the politics of oil palm expansion and state intervention in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Pará. The Workers' Party (PT) envisioned moving away from previous neoliberal policies by using state support to facilitate the coexistence and synergetic nexus between the state, family farmers and agribusiness, through the Sustainable Oil Palm Production Program (PPSOP) launched in 2010. Using a Gramscian approach, we examine PT's ability to impose its hegemonic project and the contradictions that emerged from its efforts to ease capital accumulation and to support marginalized family farmers to legitimize oil palm expansion. We argue that, in light of the articulations and fragmentation generated in the PPSOP intervention, the PT played a key role in providing a common framework that facilitated oil palm expansion in which all the actors involved could find a response to their claims. While agribusiness moved to participate in PPSOP to legitimatize the monoculture of palm in international markets and to create the material and infrastructural conditions for monocrop expansion, family farmers and popular movements granted support to this intervention based upon concerns for land access and titling, and with the hopes for alternative agricultural activities and job creation to improve their livelihoods. We show, however, that PPSOP intervention works to reinforce large-scale production and exclude family farmers and popular movements by promoting the concentration of land ownership and failing to improve the terms of incorporation of marginalized actors in the oil palm chain. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

To assess these impacts, we use a computable general equilibrium model and a regional energy systems model side-by-side. The former is extended with new sectors of lignocellulosic biofuels, bioelectricity, biochemicals, lignocellulosic biomass supply and tradeable pellets. Next to 1st generation biofuels and other renewable energy supply, the economic impacts of bioeconomy are assessed for technology development and trade openness scenarios. We demonstrate the macro-economic model by assessing developments of the Dutch bioeconomy in 2030. Under rapid technical growth and trade openness, the models consistently show increased biomass consumption and supply of bioenergy and biochemicals from lignocellulose through large-scale deployment of advanced biomass conversion technologies. Traditional fossil-based sectors are replaced by biomass, which brings additional macro-economic benefits on gross domestic product (0.8 bn€ a−1) and value added (0.7 bn€ a−1). Furthermore, it reduces projected decline in trade balance (0.7 bn€ a−1) and employment (2.5–4.5%) compared to low technology development. Extending the temporal scope to beyond 2030 may demonstrate additional macro-economic benefits of bioeconomy. This requires assessing the influence of improvements in the agricultural sector that may lower biomass prices, learning and other developments of promising biomass conversion technologies in the longer term. Uncertain fossil fuel and CO2 price developments necessitate additional sensitivity analysis. © 2017

AB  - The cultivation of energy cane throughout the Southeastern United States may displace grazed pastures on organic soil (Histosols) to meet growing demands for biofuels. We combined results from a field experiment with a biogeochemical model to improve our understanding of how the conversion of pasture to energy cane during early crop establishment affected soil GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) exchange with the atmosphere. GHG fluxes were measured under both land uses during wet, hot and cool, dry times of year, and following a fertilization event. We also simulated the impact of changes in precipitation on GHG exchange. Higher fertilization of cane contributed to greater emission of N2O than pasture during warmer and wetter times of the year. The model predicted that energy cane emitted more nitrogen than pasture during simulated wetter than drier years. The modeled emission factor for N2O was 20 to 30-fold higher than the default value from IPCC (1%), suggesting that the default IPCC value could dramatically underestimate the consequences of this land conversion on the climate system. Predicted soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes were higher in pasture than energy cane, and this difference was not affected by increasing precipitation. Model simulations predicted that soils under first year cane emit more GHGs than pasture, particularly during wet years, but this difference disappeared two years after energy cane establishment. Our results suggest that management practices may be important in determining soil GHG emissions from energy cane on organic soils particularly during the first year of cane establishment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The first step in biofuel and/or bio-based bulk chemical material production is assessing the amounts of useful substances in a potential biomass. Sugar, nutrients, ash, and functional ingredients (such as antioxidant compounds) in premature dent corn biomass cultivated as a catch crop (plant density; 60 shoots m−2) over different cultivation periods (29 days, 49 days, 83 days) were investigated. The sugar recovery amount was estimated by multiplying two regression curves (saccharification efficiency curve, quadratic regression curve; dry weight growth curve, Gompertz curve). A simple economic analysis for ethanol production from the catch crop biomass was also carried out using previously reported process costs and the estimated sugar recovery amount. High plant density led to accumulation of plant biomass providing high amounts of plant dry weight and derived sugars per unit area. About 2700 g DW m−2 (about 1400 g sugar m−2) was harvested in the 49-day cultivation. The amount is significant compared with biomass yields of other candidates for energy crops. The estimated sugar recovery amount reached its maximum value near the end of experimental period (79-day cultivation). The longer cultivation period was better for sugar recovery although there was a slight decrease in saccharification efficiency with cultivation time. Based on the economic analysis, a higher ethanol price (about 200% higher than the current wholesale price) would be required for catch crop financial independence with around 50-day cultivation. Production of ethanol from catch crop biomass would not be feasible in the current situation. However, condensed biomass production through catch crops is still attractive and requires further research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Willows (Salix) are the focus of investigation as renewable feedstock for bioenergy in the Northeastern region of the US. The potential increase of acreage for willow biofuel production requires new information about how yield is influenced by variances in soil factors. The objectives of this experiment were to compare yields across several different soil series and to identify factors that may influence plant productivity. Four cultivars of shrub willow were planted in 2011 at five sites in Connecticut. Biomass yields were measured at the end of the fourth growing season. The best conditions for willow growth were recorded on Watchaug soil series, where the highest yield values for ‘SX67’ and ‘SX61’ (17.3 and 14.4 Mg ha−1 yr−1, respectively) are setting benchmarks for the potential of willow yield in Connecticut. These two willows were the most productive cultivars across all sites. ‘Allegany’ and ‘SV1’ performed better on sites with specific soil characteristics, clearly demonstrating greater cultivar × site interactions. Important soil characteristics that correlated with willow growth were soil organic matter, pH, as well as phosphorus, iron, magnesium and aluminum availability. All cultivars responded similarly to aluminum toxicity: the yields increased when exchangeable soil aluminum levels were below 200 mg kg−1. The yields also increased for most cultivars when the phosphorus levels were high. The yields consistently reached a maximum when the phosphorus to aluminum ratio was greater than 0.05. This study showed that soil factors correlated with willow yields and revealed that soil amendments could be exploited for yield gains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tisochrysis lutea is a microalga species currently used in aquaculture as a feed for shellfish, oysters and shrimps. It also has many other potential industrial applications, such as the production of neutral lipids for biofuels or the production of ω-3 fatty acids for nutraceuticals (human food complements). To efficiently exploit the potential of this microalga, however, higher lipid productivities are needed. To this end, improvement programs need to be developed and optimized. The diversity of strains available in microalgae has not yet been exploited in such improvement programs. In this study, the intra-strain diversity was observed and exploited to increase neutral lipid productivity. New clonal strains with higher neutral lipid productivity were successfully selected. The best clonal strain selected accumulated 520% more triacylglycerols, with a similar growth rate to the wild-type strain in continuous light and nitrogen starvation conditions. In a photoperiod culture condition, this clonal stain also accumulated 84% more storage lipids and 30% less carbohydrates, compared to the wild-type strain. This clonal strain thus had a higher productivity which is of great interest for feed or biofuel applications. This study also focused on identifying the genomic mechanisms responsible for the improvements in these clonal strains. With this objective, the genome of Tisochrysis lutea was sequenced for the first time. It is the third genome of a Haptophyte microalga sequenced so far. Different genetic polymorphisms were identified between the sequenced genomes of the wild-type strain and clonal strains. Activity of transposable elements seems to have been involved in the genome reshuffling obtained through the improvement program. The contribution of transposable elements to the adaptive capacity of microalgae remains to be demonstrated. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Sugarcane straw mulch left in the field after its mechanical harvest has become very valuable raw material for second generation ethanol and bioelectricity production. However, little information is available on how much straw mulch is needed to be left in the field so that agricultural productivity is not affected and high sustainability is provided for the bioenergy production system. The objective of this work was to evaluate the productivity and industrial quality of sugarcane after five years of cultivation when different amount of straw mulch is removed from the field. The experiment was installed in clay texture Eutroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol). Six treatments were evaluated: 0%, 25% (5 t ha−1), 50% (10 t ha−1), 75% (15 t ha−1), 100% (20 t ha−1) of straw mulch and burnt cane harvesting (where 100% of the straw mulch was burned). Evaluated parameters included sugarcane productivity (tons/hectare) and its industrial quality (Pol, soluble solids (°Brix), apparent purity and total sugars (TS)). Productivity was calculated at the end of the cycle whereas industrial quality parameters were evaluated during three phases i.e. 180, 240 and 350 days after cutting (DAC). Straw mulch of 50 and 75% were statistically at par with each other but resulted in higher sugarcane production with 47% more productivity as compared to 0 and 25% of straw mulch as well as burned cane harvesting. Straw mulch didn't affect the industrial quality; however, higher sugar production was supported by higher agricultural productivity, under low moisture condition. It is possible to remove 50% of straw mulch from the field for the production of second generation ethanol or bioelectricity, without any damage to the crop. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The residual woody biomass (a.k.a. harvest slash) produced during forest harvest operations in the Pacific Northwest is generally collected into piles and burned and/or left on the forest floor to decompose. Producing drop-in biofuels from this residual cellulosic feedstock can provide an alternative use for this unused resource while simultaneously displacing petroleum based fuels. Utilizing a ‘Woods-to-Wake’ (WoTW) Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, which is comparable to a Well-to-Wake (WTW) LCA for petroleum based aviation fuel, this paper assesses the environmental implications of feedstock recovery, production, and utilization of residual woody biomass based biojet fuel. This paper also presents a comparative assessment of the environmental implications of substituting petroleum based jet fuel with that of residual woody biomass based biojet fuel. The bioconversion process presented in this paper uses a mild bisulfite pre-treatment of the feedstock to liberate the C5 and C6 sugars which then go through enzymatic hydrolysis and saccharification to produce fermentable sugars. The sugars are then converted to bio-jet fuel (iso-paraffinic kerosene, IPK) using a proprietary biocatalytic fermentation and oligomerization process. The WoTW environmental implications of producing woody biomass based jet-fuel are then compared to the WTW environmental impacts of producing petroleum based jet-fuel. The results reveal that the WoTW global warming impact of residual wood based bio-jet fuel represents a 78% improvement over the WTW global warming impact of petroleum-based jet fuel. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioethanol production potential from cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) and rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), pretreated by diluted acid hydrolysis (DAH), was studied and compared by both, separate enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) processes. DAH pretreatment allowed an increase of 5 fold to cardoon and 16 fold to rockrose in cellulose accessibility towards enzymatic hydrolysis. Both plants showed better overall fermentation efficiency and ethanol yield in SSF than in SHF also with shorter processing periods, 24 h against 72 + 24 h, respectively. Results obtained for rockrose are about half the concentration and volumetric productivity of ethanol and 60% of the overall fermentation efficiency of those obtained for cardoon. The recalcitrance of rockrose to enzymatic hydrolysis was explained by higher abundance of lignin and extractives than in cardoon. Comparing the steam explosion (SE) and DAH pretreatments, the former was more advantageous for the recalcitrant rockrose in terms of enzymatic saccharification yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the new frontier of energy, biofuels will play an important role in overcoming our dependence on fossil fuels and its associated environmental impacts. In the biofuels sector, the exploitation of microalgal biomass has the potential to be beneficial, as they do not compete on land use with food crops and their cultivation systems can be designed to have a lower water footprint. Even though a number of LCAs (Life Cycle Assessment) involving biofuel production from microalgae have been reported, few of them have focused on the use of by-product streams in algal biomass production, such as wastewater or waste CO2 recovered from flue gas, which could further reduce the environmental impact of the recovered biofuels, and none have considered a combination of different by-product streams. In this paper, an LCA is applied to compare 6 alternative scenarios, where the potential environmental benefits achievable using CO2 from different sources (commercial liquid CO2, CO2 recovered from flue gas and flue gas as is) and wastewater in the cultivation of microalgae for the production of biofuels are investigated. The analysis is based on a virtual, but realistic case, using an open microalgal cultivation pond facility located in Kingston (Canada). The results indicate that the source of CO2 is the most relevant factor affecting environmental impacts, and that the direct injection of flue gas into the algal pond and the use of wastewater represent the most environmentally friendly alternative. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scholarship on neo-extractivism agrees that this ‘post-neoliberal’ model of development is founded on an inherent contradiction between the commitment to continue natural resource extraction and the need to legitimize these activities by using their revenues for poverty reduction. Using the cases of the national biofuel policies of the ‘post-neoliberal’ governments of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, this article enquires why and how these policies emerged, how they were implemented, and how the resulting national experiences exemplify the inherent contradictions embedded in neo-extractivist policies. Adopting a strategic-relational approach to analyse state–society interaction, it is argued that the scope of progressive policies is conditioned to a large extent by pre-existing social structures, institutions and state–society interactions. The article shows how progressive reforms intersect with the prevailing interests of agribusiness and state actors and are recast and used for different ends as these interact with powerful actors such as the multinational soybean complex and agrarian movements. It is suggested that the prevailing over-emphasis in the neo-extractivist literature on the politics of domination and contestation overlooks the multiple and complex rural responses of the different progressive governments. It also obscures the possibilities to explore the ruptures and continuities of these countries’ governments with previous models, and therefore fails to recognize state advances. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies

AB  - Torrefaction is an option for improving biomass properties for fuel application. Biomass undergoes chemical changes reflected on the upgrading of its properties as a biofuel, such as higher calorific power, lower O/C and H/C ratios, lower higroscopicity or better grindability. Objectives of this experimental study were to analyze the effects of torrefaction, under standart conditions of 265 °C, and residence time of 15 min in a nitrogen atmosphere and during a total 1h45m heating period, on a set of sixteen woody biomasses provenient from poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) and other Portuguese roundwoods. Average mass loss was higher than 40%. The set of poplar clones and common broom provided torrefied products with higher quality than the set of roundwood forest species. The results on other parameters for proximate and ultimate analysis corroborate this global picture. Correlation analysis showed a higher degree of interconnectedness between LHV and proximate analysis results, for poplar clones and common broom, comparatively with roundwood biomasses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapidly increasing human population poses a serious risk of fast depletion of natural resources like fossil fuels. Therefore, production of ecofriendly renewable alternatives like biofuels from waste materials has sparked more curiosity from the industrialists as well as academicians. Similarly, production of bioenergy from agricultural wastes is gaining interest worldwide. In view of the above objective, cellulose degrading bacterium G9-KDP isolated from the crop fluid of giant African land snail, Achatina fulica was identified as Bacillus tequilensis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The B. tequilensis G9 produced cellulase with the highest activity of 956.9 IU/ml extract on 8th day of incubation when grown in BMS medium induced by sugarcane bagasse. The optimal temperature and pH of the organism were 60 °C and 6.6, respectively. It was observed that the activity of crude enzyme was affected to various extents by different metal ions. The activity was inhibited by Co2+ and Ca2+ at 5 mM concentrations but enhanced by K+ and Mn2+ ions. However, EDTA at 1% concentration increased the activity by 94% while SDS reduced it by 57% at the same concentration. Scanning electron microscopy of the filter paper used as substrate revealed significant structural modifications after the treatment with bacteria. The degradation of the various cellulosic compounds into simpler sugars by this isolate brands its potential applications in industrial biotechnology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assessed the effect of varying pig manure (PM)/food waste (FW) mixing ratio and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on methane yields, digestate dewaterability, enteric indicator bacteria and microbial communities during anaerobic co-digestion. Three 10 L digesters were operated at 39 °C, each with a PM/FW feedstock composition of 85%/15%, 63%/37% and 40%/60% (volatile solids basis). While the PM/FW ratio was different among reactors, the organic loading rate applied was equal, and increased stepwise with reducing HRT. The effects of three different HRTs were studied: 41, 29, and 21 days. Increasing the proportion of FW in the feedstock significantly increased methane yields, but had no significant effect on counts of enteric indicator bacteria in the digestate or specific resistance to filtration, suggesting that varying the PM/FW feedstock composition at the mixing ratios studied should not have major consequences for digestate disposal. Decreasing HRT significantly increased volumetric methane yields, increased digestate volatile solids concentrations and increased the proportion of particles >500 µm in the digestate, indicating that decreasing HRT to 21 days reduced methane conversion efficiency High throughput 16S rRNA sequencing data revealed that microbial communities were just slightly affected by changes in digester operating conditions. These results would provide information useful when optimizing the start-up and operation of biogas plants treating these substrates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels. A study was conducted to evaluate the capability of Arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production. The biomass of Arthrospira platensis was found to be 4.98 g L−1 and produced 30.23 wt% lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor. The extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel, although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard EN14214. It was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel, while the optimum CO2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols. The Arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aviation industry is committed to reducing its environmental impact and has established ambitious goals to decrease CO2 emissions by 50% by to 2050. The replacement of fossil fuels by jet-biofuels is one of the main strategies to attain the emission targets. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a detailed survey on land availability for sugarcane production, one of the most promising feedstock options for jet-biofuels, in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, where the technological resources are concentrated. This analysis was carried out by integrating georeferenced information on land use, protected areas, soil fertility, terrain slope and climatic conditions into a conditional decision support procedure, based on Boolean inference techniques. Our results showed that 3,501,590 ha would be potentially available for sugarcane expansion in the year 2013. Almost 80% of the mapped lands have high economic potential once they are located in a distance lower than or equal to 25 km from the processing units. If properly included in the productive sector, the available lands could increase sugarcane production by 73% in relation to current levels. That could lead to a growth of 147% (20.6 billion liters) in the ethanol production compared to the production obtained in 2015. Nevertheless, long-term policies, logistic improvements and environmental standard definitions on jet-biofuels still remain as major challenges to boost feedstock production, as well as, to implement financial and regulatory measures necessary to promote jet-biofuels production and use. © 2017

AB  - Low returns and volatility in agricultural prices have led farmers to pursue new cropping opportunities, including bioenergy and bioproduct industrial sugar precursors, such as energy beets. This article assesses the economic viability of energy beet production using integrated agronomic and economic geographic information systems based techniques to estimate yields and break-even prices in North Dakota. The results show that beet yields vary throughout the state, averaging 34.4 t/ha, and are highest in the East, in the Red River Valley, where soil quality is high, moisture is plentiful and heat is sufficient. Production is also viable in the central and northern regions of the state, where soil quality and moisture are less favorable than in the Red River Valley. A smaller scale ethanol plant (75 million liters) would be able to source sufficient materials for production in many locations throughout the state for prices around $30/t. © 2017

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) has been widely touted as a feedstock for biofuel production and way to combat rural poverty. In some cases, using Jatropha for rural economic development has led to unfulfilled expectations and failed programs. I investigated the expectations of an agricultural community in Nigeria toward a Jatropha biodiesel development project initiated by a private university and how community and project leaders perceived the impact of the program’s eventual abandonment. Willingness to adopt the project appeared largely due to its association with the university and expatriate staff. Community leaders’ enthusiastic support resulted in high expectations of poverty alleviation and community improvements. Given the community-perceived slow progress of the project and its ultimate dissolution, the community–university relationship and intra-community relations, including potential disempowerment of community leaders, were affected. The overall impact was, however, mitigated by other university-backed community programs and continued support by community leaders for using Jatropha for development. © 2017 Community Development Society.

AB  - Landfill is still the main technological facility used to treat and dispose municipal solid waste (MSW) worldwide. In developing countries, final dumping is applied without environmental monitoring and soil protection since solid waste is mostly sent to open dump sites while, in Europe, landfilling is considered as the last option since reverse logistic approaches or energy recovery are generally encouraged. However, many regions within the European Union continue to dispose of MSW to landfill, since modern facilities have not been introduced owing to unreliable regulations or financial sustainability. In this paper, final disposal activities and pre-treatment operations in an area in southern Italy are discussed, where final disposal is still the main option for treating MSW and the recycling rate is still low. Mechanical biological treatment (MBT) facilities are examined in order to evaluate the organic stabilization practices applied for MSW and the efficiencies in refuse derived fuel production, organic waste stabilization and mass reduction. Implementing MBT before landfilling the environmental impact and waste mass are reduced, up to 30%, since organic fractions are stabilized resulting an oxygen uptake rate less than 1600 mgO2 h−1 kg−1 VS, and inorganic materials are exploited. Based on experimental data, this work examines MBT application in contexts where recycling and recovery activities have not been fully developed. The evidence of this study led to state that the introduction of MBT facilities is recommended for developing regions with high putrescible waste production in order to decrease environmental pollution and enhance human healthy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form associations with plants and are ubiquitous in grassland and agriculture ecosystems. AMF are known to contribute to plant nitrogen (N) uptake, but the importance of AMF to ecosystem N cycling and overall plant N nutrition remains unclear, particularly in the context of agroecosystems. AMF abundance typically declines under N addition, but how this affects AMF function and subsequent N transfer to plants is unknown. We measured plant yield and plant N content in relation to AMF abundance and function under different soil N conditions, using both an N-addition experiment and a survey across perennial grassland sites with varying soil N levels. We used AMF root colonization to assess AMF abundance, but the presence of AMF does not necessarily relate to function (i.e. nutrient transfer with host plant), so we also used an allometric ratio of AMF structures and AMF fatty acid biomarkers as an index of AMF function. N addition significantly decreased AMF abundance by an average of 27%, and decreased function by an average of 42%, as measured by the allometric ratio. This pattern was supported by our survey study where soil N was negatively correlated with AMF abundance and function. In addition, plant N was positively related to higher levels of AMF allocation to nutrient transfer structures within host roots. Demonstrating these relationships across varying soil N levels at eight sites supported the hypothesis that AMF benefit perennial grasses by increasing N uptake. This is particularly important for perennial grasses grown for bioenergy because managing for higher AMF abundance and function may reduce or eliminate incentives for costly and environmentally problematic N addition. © 2017

AB  - Studies on the environmental analysis of biofuels by fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing (BFPH) have so far focused only on the environmental impacts from direct emissions and have included few indirect emissions. The influence of ignoring some indirect emissions on the environmental performance of BFPH has not been well investigated and hence is not really understood. In addition, in order to avoid shifting environmental problems from one medium to another, a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts caused by the processes must quantify the environmental emissions to all media (air, water, and land) in relation to each life cycle stage. A well-to-wheels assessment of the total environmental impacts resulting from direct emissions and indirect emissions of a BFPH system with corn stover is conducted using a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model combining the economic input–output LCA and the process LCA. The Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI) has been used to estimate the environmental impacts in terms of acidification, eutrophication, global climate change, ozone depletion, human health criteria, photochemical smog formation, ecotoxicity, human health cancer, and human health noncancer caused by 1 MJ biofuel production. Taking account of all the indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net GHG emissions (81.8 g CO2 eq/MJ) of the biofuels are still less than those of petroleum-based fuels (94 g CO2 eq/MJ). Maize production and pyrolysis and hydroprocessing make major contributions to all impact categories except the human health criteria. All impact categories resulting from indirect emissions except eutrophication and smog air make more than 24% contribution to the total environmental impacts. Therefore, the indirect emissions are important and cannot be ignored. Sensitivity analysis has shown that corn stover yield and bio-oil yield affect the total environmental impacts of the biofuels more significantly than the biomass transportation distance and biofuel transportation distance.

AB  - This study presents a GIS-based model developed for urban site-specific bioenergy production potential on marginal land parcels. The model is applied on a metropolitan region level, encompassing 101 cities and towns surrounding Boston in the northeastern United States. The ‘marginal’ land use category includes vacant and abandoned lands, portions of public and private lots, and degraded lands, with poor soil quality. Four different energy crops—miscanthus, switchgrass, poplar, and willow—were considered as biomass feedstocks for bioenergy production. A total marginal land area of 71,200 ha (712 km2) was identified that can be suitably used for bioenergy production, representing 20% of the total land area of the region. Spatial analysis revealed greatest marginal land densities close to the urban core. Statistical analysis found a weak positive correlation between population density and marginal land availability. Short-rotation hybrid poplar was identified as the highest yielding bioenergy crop for this region. Bioenergy potential calculations revealed that poplar can potentially yield up to 22 PJ (HHV) of yearly primary energy for this region that can be used for heat, conversion to transportation fuels, and/or electricity production. This is equivalent to &gt;50% of current biomass primary energy use in Massachusetts and could potentially fulfill all of the core city of Boston's heating demand. Hauling of biomass from the periphery to the urban core would add an estimated maximum of $7.20 per ton delivered. While the results reflect a maximum utilization scenario for marginal land, several logistical and social considerations are discussed that would impact practical implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three distinctive start-up strategies of biogas reactors fed with source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste were investigated to reveal the most reliable procedure for rapid process stabilization. Moreover, the experimental results were compared with mathematical modeling outputs. The initial inoculations to start-up the reactors were 10, 50 and 100% of the final working volume. While a constant feeding rate of 7.8 gVS/d was considered for the control reactor, the organic loading rate for fed-batch reactors with 10 and 50% inoculation was progressively increased during a period of 60 and 13 days, respectively. The results clearly demonstrated that an exponentially feeding strategy, considering 50% inoculation relative to final volume, can significantly decrease the alternatively prolonged period to reach steady conditions, as observed by high biogas and methane production rates. The combination of both experimental and modelling/simulation succeeded in optimizing the start-up process for anaerobic digestion of biopulp under mesophilic conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Secondary sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant is proposed as a promising alternative lipid feedstock for biodiesel production. A deep study combining different type of raw materials (sludge coming from the oxic, anoxic and anaerobic steps of the biological treatment) with different technologies (liquid–liquid and solid–liquid extractions followed by acid catalysed transesterification and in situ extraction-transesterification procedure) allows a complete comparison of available technologies. Different parameters – contact time, catalyst concentration, pretreatments – were considered, obtaining more than 17% FAMEs yield after 50 min of sonication with the in situ procedure and 5% of H2SO4. This result corresponds to an increment of more than 65% respect to the best results reported at typical conditions. Experimental data were used to propose a mathematical model for this process, demonstrating that the mass transfer of lipids from the sludge to the liquid is the limiting step. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis of several Tunisian Date Palm Wastes (DPW): Date Palm Rachis (DPR), Date Palm Leaflets (DPL), Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) and Date Palm Glaich (DPG) was run using a fixed-bed reactor, from room temperature to 500 °C, with 15 °C/min as heating rate and −5 °C as condensation temperature, in order to produce bio-oil, biochar and syngas. In these conditions, the bio-oil yield ranges from 17.03 wt% for DPL to 25.99 wt% for EFB. For the biochar, the highest yield (36.66 wt%) was obtained for DPL and the lowest one (31.66 wt%) was obtained from DPG while the syngas production varies from 39.10 wt% for DPR to 46.31 wt% DPL. The raw material and pyrolysis products have been characterized using elemental analysis thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The syngas composition has been characterized using gas analyzer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes are a potential source of solid biofuel from marginal, dry land. Experiments assessed the effects of temperature (180–250 °C), reaction time (0.5–3 h) and biomass to water ratio (B/W; 0.07–0.30) on chars produced via hydrothermal carbonization. Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that the three process parameters are critically important to hydrochar solid yield, while B/W drives energy yield. Heating value increased together with temperature and reaction time and was maximized at intermediate B/W (0.14–0.20). Microscopy shows evidence of secondary char formed at higher temperatures and B/W ratios. X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric data, microscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry suggest that calcium oxalate in the raw biomass remains in the hydrochar; at higher temperatures, the mineral decomposes into CO2 and may catalyze char/tar decomposition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Main conclusion: The foxtail millet NAC transcription factor NAC1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis NAP, is induced by ABA and senescence and accelerates leaf senescence by promoting ABA biosynthesis. Leaf senescence, a unique developmental stage involving macromolecule degradation and nutrient remobilization, is finely tuned and tightly controlled by different gene families. NO APICAL MERISTEM, ARABIDOPSIS ATAF1, and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (NAC) transcription factors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of leaf senescence in many land plant species. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.), an important food and fodder crop, has been studied for its strong stress tolerance and potential to be a biofuel model plant. However, the functional roles of senescence-associated NACs in foxtail millet are still unknown. In this study, we characterized a nuclear localized NAC transcription factor, SiNAC1, which is induced by senescence and concentrated in senescent leaves in foxtail millet. SiNAC1 also positively responds to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in foxtail millet. Moreover, SiNAC1 promotes the natural and dark-induced leaf senescence by an ABA-dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. NCED2 and NCED3 are elevated by SiNAC1 overexpression, which subsequently promotes ABA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Finally, as a homolog of AtNAP, SiNAC1 can partially rescue the delayed leaf senescence phenotype in atnap mutants. Overall, our results demonstrate that SiNAC1 functions as a positive regulator of leaf senescence and is involved in a positive feedback loop via ABA biosynthesis and leaf senescence. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of different agro-industrial wastes and their co-digestion potential has been exhaustively studied in this research. It explores variation of feedstock characteristics such as biodegradability and methane potential during AD and anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) of chicken litter (CL) with yoghurt whey (YW), organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), hay grass (HG) and wheat straw (WS) under mesophilic conditions. Comparative performance was made at different loading concentrations (2%, 3% and 4% VS) with 1:2 g/g VS of substrate to inoculum and carrying C/N ratio. Among different kinetic models, the AD of single substrates showed better fit to the modified Gompertz model (R2: 0.93–0.997) indicating variation in lag phase and methane production rate depend on the substrate characteristics. During ACoD, the methane yield improved by 9–85% through the addition of two, three or four substrates due to the synergistic effect as a result of increased biodegradability and optimum conditions (such as C/N ratio). A surface (optimisation) model indicated that maximum methane production can be achieved by blending chicken litter (30–35%) and a (65–70%) mixture of yoghurt whey, hay and wheat straw with a C/N ratio of (26–27.5). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This report proposes a new approach to evaluate the odour nuisance of cattle manure samples from three different cattle breeds (i.e., native cattle, beef cattle, and milk cow) by means of quantification and speciation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). To this end, non-catalytic esterification thermally induced in the presence of a porous material (silica) was undertaken, and the optimal operational parameters such as the derivatizing temperature (330 °C) for the maximum yield (≥ 99 ± 0.4%) of volatile fatty acid methyl esters (VFAMEs) were established. Among the VFA species in cattle manure based on quantification of VFAs, the major species were acetic, butyric and valeric acid. Considering the odour threshold of each VFA, our experimental results suggested that the major contributors to odour nuisance were C4–5 VFA species (i.e., butyric and valeric acid). Hydrothermal treatment was performed at 150 °C for 0–40 min to correlate the formation of VFAs with different types of cattle feed formulations. Our experimental data demonstrated that the formation of total VFAs is linearly proportional to the hydrothermal treatment duration and the total content of VFAs in native cattle, beef cattle, and milk cow manure samples reached up to ~ 1000, ~ 3200, and ~ 2800 ppm, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrated that the degree of VFA formation is highly dependent on cattle feed formulations, which rely significantly on the protein content. Furthermore, the hydrothermal treatment provides a favourable condition for generating more VFAs. In this context, producing cattle manure into refused derived fuel (RDF) via a hydrothermal treatment is not a viable option to control odour. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The potential ecological impacts of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), as a biofuel feedstock, have been assessed under different environmental conditions. However, limited information is available in understanding the integrated analysis of nitrogen (N) dynamics including soil nitrate ((Formula presented.)), nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and (Formula presented.) leaching under switchgrass land management. The specific objective was to explore N dynamics for 2009 through 2015 in switchgrass seeded to a marginally yielding cropland based on treatments of N fertilization rate (N rate; low, 0; medium, 56; high, 112 kg N ha−1) and landscape position (shoulder, backslope, and footslope). Our findings indicated that N rate impacted soil (Formula presented.) (0–5 cm depth) and surface N2O fluxes but did not impact (Formula presented.) leaching during the observed years. Medium N (56 kg N ha−1) was the optimal rate for increasing biomass yield with reduced environmental problems. Landscape position impacted the N dynamics. At the footslope position, soil (Formula presented.), soil (Formula presented.) leaching, and N2O fluxes were higher than the other landscape positions. Soil N2O fluxes and (Formula presented.) leaching had downward trends over the observed years. Growing switchgrass on marginally yielding croplands can store soil N, reduce N losses via leaching, and mitigate N2O emissions from soils to the atmosphere over the years. Switchgrass seeded on marginally yielding croplands can be beneficial in reducing N losses and can be grown as a sustainable bioenergy crop on these marginal lands. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Concerns about environmental and social effects have made Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) increasingly popular. Decision making in complex contexts often – possibly always – requires addressing an aggregation of multiple issues to meet social, economic, legal, technical, and environmental objectives. These values at stake may affect different stakeholders through distributional effects characterized by a high and heterogeneous uncertainty that no social actors can completely control or understand. On this basis, we present a new process framework that aims to support participatory decision making under uncertainty: the range-based Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (range-based MAMCA). On the one hand, the process framework explicitly considers stakeholders’ objectives at an output level of aggregation. On the other hand, by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, the method also provides an exploratory scenario approach that enables the capture of the uncertainty, which stems from the complex context evolution. Range-based MAMCA offers a unique participatory process framework that enables us (1) to identify the alternatives pros and cons for each stakeholder group; (2) to provide probabilities about the risk of supporting mistaken, or at least ill-suited, decisions because of the uncertainty regarding to the decision-making context; (3) to take the decision-makers’ limited control of the actual policy effects over the implementation of one or several options into account. The range-based MAMCA framework is illustrated by means of our first case study that aimed to assess French stakeholders’ support for different biofuel options by 2030. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ulva species have been considered as ideal candidates for carbon capture, bioremediation and biofuel production. However, little is known regarding the effects of simultaneous ocean warming, acidification and eutrophication on these capacities. In this study, Ulva rigida was cultivated under two levels of: temperature (14 °C (LT) and 18 °C (HT)); pH (8.10 and 7.70) by controlling pCO2 (LC, HC respectively); and nutrients (low (LN) – 50 μm N and 2.5 μm P and high (HN) – 1000 μm N and 50 μm P) for 6 weeks. During the first week of cultivation, HT, HC and HN increased biomass by 38.1%, 17.1% and 20.8%, respectively, while the higher temperature led to negative growth in weeks 2, 4 and 6 due to reproductive events. By the end of the cultivation, biomass under HTHCHN was 130.4% higher than the control (LTLCLN), contributing to a higher carbon capture capacity. Although the thalli at HT released nutrients to seawater in weeks 2, 4 and 6, the HTHCHN treatment increased the overall nitrate uptake rate over the cultivation period by 489.0%. The HTHCHN treatment also had an increased biochemical methane potential and methane yield (47.3% and 254.6%, respectively). Our findings demonstrate that the capacities for carbon and nutrient capture, and biomethane production of U. rigida in the future ocean may be enhanced, providing important insight into the interactions between global change and seaweeds. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The states of Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming comprise the Northern Great Plains region of the USA. The soil and water resources contained in this region have historically supported highly diverse and productive agriculture enterprises that provide a significant proportion of the food, feed, and oilseed for the nation. The region also provides ecological services that influence air, water, and soil quality along with biological diversity. Combined with livestock production and a biofuel industry, crop production forms an integrated system that can offer producers flexibility in management decisions. Projected climatic changes for this region include increasing atmospheric CO2, a longer, warmer growing season, and increased precipitation, likely received in more frequent extreme events. These changes will impact soil and water resources in the region and create opportunities and challenges for land managers. The objectives of this paper are to describe anticipated impacts of projected mid-(2050) and late-(2085) climatic changes on crop production systems in the Northern Great Plains and provide adaptation strategies that should be developed to take advantage of positive and mitigate negative changes. Projected climatic changes will influence agricultural productivity directly as well as indirectly due to changes in weed pressure, insect populations, and diseases. A warmer, longer growing season will change the crops and distribution of those crops grown within the region. An increase in the number of extreme temperature events (high daytime highs or nighttime lows) will decrease crop yields due to increased plant stress during critical pollination and grain fill periods. Adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of soil and water resources to projected climatic changes include increasing cropping intensity, reducing tillage intensity, and use of cover crops to provide surface cover to reduce erosion potential and improve nutrient and water use efficiency. Increased use of perennial forages, crop residue, and failed crops in integrated crop-livestock systems will add biological diversity and provide options for converting vegetation biomass into animal protein. Socio-economic changes will need to be incorporated into adaptation strategies planning to insure that sustaining ecosystem services and meeting desired production and conservation goals is accomplished. Education and extension services will be needed to transfer adaptive knowledge in a timely manner to producers in the field. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - Crop production in the Central High Plains is at an all-time high due to increased demand for biofuels, food, and animal products. Despite the need to produce more food by mid-century to meet expected population growth, under current management and genetics, crop production is likely to plateau or decline in the Central High Plains due to groundwater withdrawal at rates that greatly exceed recharge to the aquifer. The Central High Plains has experienced a consistent decline in groundwater storage due to groundwater withdrawal for irrigation greatly exceeding natural recharge. In this heavily irrigated region, water is essential to maintain yields and economic stability. Here, we evaluate how current trends in irrigation demand may impact groundwater depletion and quantify the impacts of these changes on crop yield and production through to 2099 using the well-established System Approach to Land Use Sustainability (SALUS) crop model. The results show that status quo groundwater management will likely reduce irrigated corn acreage by ~60% and wheat acreage by ~50%. This widespread forced shift to dryland farming, coupled with the likely effects of climate change, will contribute to overall changes in crop production. Taking into account both changes in yield and available irrigated acreage, corn production would decrease by approximately 60%, while production of wheat would remain fairly steady with a slight increase of about 2%. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In Greece, in many cities, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) operate their own anaerobic digestion (AD) facility in order to treat sewage sludge rather than achieve optimum biogas production. Nowadays, there is a growing interest regarding the addition of other co-substrates in these existing facilities in order to increase gas yield from the biomass. This practice may be possible by adding small amount of co-substrates which will not affect significantly in the designed hydraulic retention time. Nonetheless, the lack of experimental data regarding this option is a serious obstacle. In this study, the effect of co-digestion sewage sludge, with small amount of agro-industrial by-products and food wastes is examined in lab-scale experiments. Specifically, co-digestion of SS and food waste (FW), grape residues (GR), crude glycerol (CG), cheese whey (CW) and sheep manure (SM), in a small ratio of 5–10% (v/v) was investigated. The effect of agro-industrial by-products and food waste residues on biogas production was investigated using one 1 L and three 3 L lab-scale reactors under mesophilic conditions at a 24-day hydraulic retention time. The biogas production rate reached 223, 259, 406, 572, 682 and 1751 mlbiogas/lreactor/d for 100% SS, 5% SM &amp; 95% SS, 10% CW &amp; 90% SS, 5% FW &amp; 95% SS, 5% FW &amp; 5% CG &amp; 90% SS and 5% CG &amp; 95% SS respectively. Depending on the co-digestion material, the average removal of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) ranged between 20% (5% SM &amp; 95% SS) and 76% (5% FW &amp; 5% CG &amp; 90% SS). Reduction in the volatile solids ranged between 26% (5% SM &amp; 95% SS) and 62% (5% FW &amp; 5% CG &amp; 90% SS) for organic loading rates between 0.8 kgVSm−3 d−1 and 2.0 kgVSm−3 d−1. Moreover, co-digestion improved biogas production from 14% (5% SM &amp; 95% SS) to 674% (5% CG &amp; 95% SS). This work suggests that WWTPs in Greece can increase biogas production by adding other wastes to the sewage sludge without affecting the operation of existing digesters and without requiring additional facilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing demand for sustainable energy has led to research and development on the cultivation of diverse plant species for biomass production. To support the research and development required to domesticate and cultivate crops for bioenergy, we developed the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a centralized open-access repository that facilitates organization, discovery, and exchange of information about plant traits, crop yields, and ecosystem functions. BETYdb provides user interfaces to simplify storage and discovery as well as programming interfaces that support automated and reproducible scientific workflows. Presently, BETYdb contains over forty thousand observations of plant traits, biomass yields, and ecosystem dynamics collected from the published articles and ongoing field studies. Over half of these records represent fewer than ten genera that have been intensively evaluated for biomass production, while the other half represent over two thousand plant species reflecting research on new crops, unmanaged ecosystems, and land use transitions associated with bioenergy. BETYdb has been accessed over twenty-five thousand times and is used in the fields of bioenergy and ecosystem ecology to quantify yield potential and ecosystem functioning of crops and unmanaged systems under present and future climates. Here, we summarize the database contents and illustrate its applications. We show its utility in a new analysis that confirms that Miscanthus is twice as productive as switchgrass over a much wider range of environmental and management conditions than covered in previous analyses. We compare traits related to carbon uptake and water use of these species with each other and with two coppice shrubs, poplar and willow. These examples, along with a growing body of published research that used BETYdb, illustrate the scope of research supported through this open-access database. © 2017 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Four of five people in sub-Saharan Africa rely on the traditional use of solid biomass, mainly fuelwood, for cooking. In some areas, the current rate of fuelwood consumption will exhaust biomass reserves within the next decade or two. A largely unrecognized source of biomass are tropical wetland ecosystems which have been shown to be some of the most productive ecosystems globally, exhibiting rates of net primary productivity comparable with high-input, intensively managed agricultural systems. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) is an emergent sedge with C4 photosynthesis which is native to the wetlands, river valleys and lakes of central, eastern and southern Africa. The mean standing dry matter of culms and umbels measured at a number of locations throughout East Africa is 38.3 ± 21.6 tDM ha−1, and the aerial net primary productivity ranges between 25.9 and 136.4 tDM ha−1 yr−1. Papyrus vegetation can be harvested by hand and stacked on the rhizome mat for partial air-drying, and it has been demonstrated that an annual harvesting regime has no negative impacts on long-term productivity. The use of papyrus as a biofuel for cooking and heating depends on converting it to a suitably combustible form, such as compressed or carbonized briquettes with a calorific value approximately one-third less than wood charcoal. While papyrus has significant potential as a biofuel, we argue that an integrated management and decision-making framework for the sustainable utilization of papyrus wetlands is required, in which all ecosystem services including the provision of biomass energy need to be assessed. Sustainability of papyrus wetlands requires management which combines the strength of traditional communal governance and modern legislation to promote its utilization. In this way, local communities can benefit from the inherent advantages of tropical wetlands as very productive ecosystems. © 2016 The Authors.
