AB  - Anaerobic digestion of cow dung with new feedstock such as crop residues to increase the biogas potential is an option to help overcoming several issues faced by India. Anaerobic digestion provides biogas that can replace biomass cooking fuels and reduce indoor air pollution. It also provides digestate, a fertilizer that can contribute to compensate nutrient shortage on agricultural land. Moreover, it avoids the burning of rice straw in the fields which contributes to air pollution in India and climate change globally. Not only the technical and economical feasibility but also the environmental sustainability of such systems needs to be assessed. The potential effects of implementing community digesters co-digesting cow dung and rice straw on carbon and nutrients flows, human health, resource efficiency and climate change are analyzed by conducting a Substance Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment. The implementation of the technology is considered at the level of the state of Chhattisgarh. Implementing this scenario reduces the dependency of the rural community to nitrogen and phosphorus from synthetic fertilizers only by 0.1 and 1.6%, respectively, but the dependency of farmers to potassium from synthetic fertilizers by 31%. The prospective scenario returns more organic carbon to agricultural land and thus has a potential positive effect on soil quality. The implementation of the prospective scenario can reduce the health impact of the local population by 48%, increase the resource efficiency of the system by 60% and lower the impact on climate change by 13%. This study highlights the large potential of anaerobic digestion to overcome the aforementioned issues faced by India. It demonstrates the need to couple local and global assessments and to conduct analyses at the substance level to assess the sustainability of such systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work presents the first comprehensive study of DOC in rainwater in a tropical agro-industrial region in central São Paulo State. The DOC concentrations ranged from 15 to 4992 μmol C L− 1, with an overall volume weighted mean (VWM) of 288 ± 17 μmol C L− 1 (n = 881). The number of fire spots accumulated within each year of this study was positively correlated to the VWM concentration of DOC in rainwater. During the whole study period, higher VWM DOC concentrations were found during the dry months, despite the phasing out of agricultural fires in sugar cane plantations. The evidence suggested that inputs of atmospheric soluble organic carbon from biomass burning exceeded those from vehicular fuel combustion and biogenic sources. In most cases, dilution of DOC according to precipitation volume was minimal, showing that in-cloud processes were dominant for this species. In contrast, most of the volatile dissolved organic carbon (VDOC) appeared to be removed from the atmosphere in the first milliliter or so of rain, showing a dominance of below-cloud scavenging. VDOC contributed a significant fraction of the DOC for 62% of the samples analyzed, ranging from 5.1 to 488 μmol C L− 1 (n = 552). The average wet deposition flux of DOC was 49 kg C ha− 1 yr− 1, with VDOC accounting for 10% of the total. This dissolved carbon flux is higher than the estimated world average (34 kg C ha− 1 yr− 1). The DOC in the rainwater was mostly labile (75% on average) and rapidly bioavailable (within days to weeks), in contrast to refractory dissolved carbon found in rainwater from regions where fossil fuel combustion is the dominant source. The findings of this work indicate that biomass burning can lead to important atmospheric inputs of readily available organic matter to land and to the open ocean. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reducing meat consumption by humans and shifting to more efficient plant and animal protein sources could potentially free up large areas of pasture and feedcrop agricultural land for restoration or conversion to low-input high-diversity (LIHD) grasslands. LIHD grasslands improve biodiversity, carbon sequestration, erosion control, water storage, while also providing opportunities to produce biofuels. We examined the potential of converting pastures globally, and animal feedstock agricultural lands in the USA and Brazil, to LIHD biomass sources and the capacity of these systems to meet national energy demands via (1) cellulosic ethanol and (2) integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis (IGCC-FT) processing. Our analyses, which we argue are conservative, indicate that large amounts of energy, far in excess of many country's current demands, can potentially be produced from IGCC-FT processing of grassland biomass grown on converted pastures, especially in tropical developing countries. Over 40 countries could meet ≥ 100% of their domestic demands for electricity, gasoline, and diesel. If energy products were shared between countries, the 95 countries with positive energy production yields could meet 46%, 28%, and 39% of their combined electricity, gasoline, and diesel demands, respectively. While it is clearly unrealistic to propose a 100% conversion of pasture lands to biofuel production, these analyses highlight the potential gains in ecosystem services and energy production that could theoretically be achieved on already-managed lands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Public and private initiatives are actively exploring a range of forest-based bioenergy development options in the Inland Northwest of the United States. These efforts are motivated in part by the potential to generate renewable energy while creating a market for forest residues that would facilitate hazardous fuels reduction and provide economic opportunities. Understanding stakeholders’ perspectives is critical to the feasibility and long-term viability of bioenergy projects. This study presents stakeholder perspectives on forest-based bioenergy development strategies for communities in the forested areas of Idaho, western Montana, eastern Washington, and eastern Oregon. We developed three scenarios based on bioenergy initiatives currently being explored in the region: a decentralized mobile biochar and drop-in fuel scenario, a centralized bioaviation fuel scenario, and a centralized wood pellet scenario. We then asked a range of stakeholders to identify and assess the tradeoffs they associated with each scenario during in-depth interviews. Participants were generally supportive of any viable scenario that supports forest restoration and economic development, but many favored small-scale, locally oriented bioenergy development similar to what has occurred in some rural communities related to local food systems. © 2017 Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Blending petroleum fuels with biofuels is likely to become increasingly important over the years to come. Butyl butyrate has promising characteristics as a blend component in diesel and can be synthesized by lipase-catalyzed esterification of 1-butanol and butyric acid, which both can be derived from fermentation technologies. In the current study, the enzyme load and reaction temperature were optimized for the production of butyl butyrate with Novozyme 435 (immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B) directly in diesel at a substrate concentration of 1 m using a molar ratio of 1:1 between n-butanol and butyric acid. Optimum conditions were found by using a central composite design at an enzyme load of 12 % of substrate weight and a temperature of 57 °C, giving 90 % yield conversion in 30 min, corresponding to a butyl butyrate productivity of 1.8 mol L−1 h−1. Diesel blended with 5, 10, and 30 % butyl butyrate was tested in a heavy-duty diesel engine under two load cases. The ignition properties of the blended fuels were very similar to pure diesel, making butyl butyrate an interesting diesel substitute. The emission analysis demonstrated lower soot and CO emissions, similar hydrocarbons levels and slightly increased NOx levels compared with using pure diesel. The high activity of lipase in diesel and the compatibility between diesel and butyl butyrate opens up the possibility to develop fuel blending systems where the synthesis of the blend-in component occurs directly in the fuel. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biofuel policies in the U.S. and Brazil can influence two-way ethanol trade, in which the countries export to and import from each other simultaneously. A multi-market, multi-region partial equilibrium economic model is used to assess the interactions of the biofuel policies and markets of these two countries. The market effects are converted to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission effects using calculations that include the emissions associated with the transportation of ethanol between Brazil and the U.S. Results show that under certain conditions ethanol and feedstock producer prices decrease in a “No Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)” scenario, while GHG emission could rise. If the RFS is maintained in the U.S., but Brazilian gasoline prices are allowed to move freely with rising global crude oil prices, then ethanol and feedstock prices increase and GHG emissions decrease as the use of ethanol increases. We find that two-way ethanol trade can have important, if moderate, GHG emission impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Shrub lands could provide an almost unexplored biomass resource of increasing potential in the EU, particularly in Mediterranean countries. Its collection and transformation into solid biofuels will help to reduce the adverse effects associated with frequent shrub land fires. The objective of this study is to examine the pre-treatment and combustion of biomass obtained from broom plant clearings to assess the feasibility of utilising it as a fuel in commercial combustion applications. Above ground broom biomass was collected with a harvester-baler machine. Afterwards, in a milling installation and a pilot pelletisation plant two fuels were obtained: 30 mm milled material and pellets, which were used in two commercial grate boilers (40 kWth and 500 kWth). We conclude that biomass from broom clearings could be used to produce solid biofuels for commercial boilers. Milling and pelletisation did not entail difficulties and the pellets could be classified as B (ISO 17225-2:2014). During combustion, no operating problems related to the fuel were observed. However, due to its high potassium content, special attention should be paid to the tendency to produce deposits and to particle emission and it would be advisable to control the working temperature to avoid slag formation in the burner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Second generation biofuels offer the opportunity to mitigate emissions from the growing transportation sector while respecting the scarcity of arable land in agriculture. Biomass-to-liquid (BtL) concepts based on large-scale gasification are capable of using low-quality residual feedstock, such as wheat straw or forest residues, for the production of transportation fuels. However, large amounts of biomass feedstock are required to achieve the economic capacity of a synthesis plant. Depending on the steepness of the terrain and the role of feedstock owners, biomass potentials can only be utilized to a large extent at increasing costs per ton. Such diseconomies of scale are particularly problematic in the presence of already established value chains consuming the easily accessible and low-cost feedstock. As a result, second-generation biofuel supply chains face steep supply curves with sharply increasing unit costs. This article investigates the impact of established utilization paths on a large-scale biofuel production value chain. To do so, a mixed-integer linear model is presented which first determines the allocation of biomass resources to CHP plants and domestic consumers. Based on the resulting costs and supply curves, the model then determines the optimum configuration of the synfuel supply chain including locations and capacities of conversion plants, feedstock procurement and transportation. The model is applied to a case study covering six regions in south-central Chile. The total supply chain cost for the production of synthetic gasoline is estimated to amount to 0.8–0.9 € per liter. Feedstock costs of the synfuel supply chain are 20–50% higher in comparison to the price paid by CHP plants and households. The results indicate that both torrefaction and fast pyrolysis can be applied beneficially to utilize remote biomass resources which are less in demand by established consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The success and sustainable operation of a commercial cellulosic biorefinery are highly dependent on price, quality, and availability of feedstocks. Currently, corn stover is a primary feedstock choice for cellulosic ethanol production and the same feedstock can be used for butanol production, which is a potential alternative biofuel. However, butanol production requires different levels of feedstock and logistical resources when compared to ethanol due to about 20% lower theoretical yield. A thorough analysis of cost, life-cycle energy use and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with a feedstock supply logistics system for butanol production is yet to be done. Additionally, quality standards for corn stover feedstock are yet to be determined, which could determine cost of the feedstock for commercial applications. Thus, this study aimed to fulfill these research gaps using techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment methodologies. Variability in logistical resources and other input parameters gathered from recent literature were used for analyses in this study. Average corn stover supply logistics cost ($/metric ton(t), dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) were 86.9, 1073.7 and 83.8, which could increase at 95% certainty to 159–504, 1672–3817 and 138–271, respectively, depending on the types of probability distributions of the input parameters. However, the mode value of logistics cost ($/t, dry), life-cycle energy use (MJ/t, dry) and life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e/t, dry) of 80–120, 913–1231 and 79–120, respectively, closely represents the results of the static model. The average estimated feedstock cost for butanol production was about 1.3 times and the minimum 95% certainty value is about 2 times more than the targeted feedstock cost ($/metric ton, dry) of 66.4, excluding preprocessing. Overall, the location of the biorefinery, quality of corn stover, sustainable agricultural practices, and optimum utilization of transportation resources were key factors that enable a sustainable feedstock supply logistics system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental concerns and energy security have led to growing interest to second-generation biofuel production from non-edible feedstock such as switchgrass. In this article, sustainable and ecological indicators are introduced to evaluate the candidate locations efficiency for switchgrass cultivation. To optimize the candidate locations, a novel data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency model is proposed which attempts to maximize output worst-cases of all candidate locations. Moreover, in order to consider both mean and standard deviation of candidate locations cross-efficiencies, a new ranking measure is presented. The performance of proposed model is investigated in comparison with several models through a real case study in Iran. The efficiency values of Iran provinces are calculated by several DEA cross-efficiency models. The numerical results show that proposed model manages to evaluate the candidate locations efficiency more moderate than other models. Besides, the standard deviation of cross-efficiencies for this model are lower than that of other models. The obtained findings from introduced DEA model reveal that based on the defined ranking measures, Khouzesan and Fars provinces are non-dominate locations for switchgrass cultivation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Softwood lignin was pyrolyzed to afford a “bio-oil” distillate in which phenols were major products. Extraction with alkali gave a range of lignin-related phenols having molecular weights (MWs) from 110 to 344 amu. The total phenolic extract was at least equal in antioxidant activity to the synthetic compound 2,6-di(tert)butyl-4- methylphenol (BHT). The extract was separated by chromatographic techniques to characterize components potentially responsible for the activity. A series of phenols in the extract exhibited MWs of 274, 302, 316, 330, and 344 and are likely to be dimers responsible for the majority of the observed antioxidant properties. Several of these compounds appear by mass spectrometry to be bifunctional phenolic compounds containing catechol or guaiacol groups. We hypothesize that a type of effective antioxidant for fatty acid esters will contain one phenolic hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonded to the ester and another at a radical-quenching site; monophenols are likely to be ineffective in this system due to the predominance of hydrogen bonding (kinetic solvent effect). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich by-product of the thermal conversion of organic feedstocks and is primarily used as a soil amendment. Identification and quantification of biochar properties are important to ensure optimal outcomes for agricultural or environmental applications. Advanced spectroscopic techniques have recently been adopted in biochar characterization. However, biochar characterization approaches rely entirely on the user's choice and accessibility to the new technology. The selection of proper methods is vital to accurately and consistently assess biochar properties. This review critically evaluates current biochar characterization methods of proximate, ultimate, physicochemical, surface and structural analyses, and important biochar properties for various applications. © 2017, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Taiwan is an island in East Asia that strongly depends on imported fossil fuels. To reduce emissions and pollutants, there is interest in wind and solar energy. The current solar energy systems convert solar energy into electricity with high capital cost because of their low efficiency and high operational costs. This paper presents the position of renewable energy methods in Taiwan and the benefits of its expansion. This research suggests that the use of Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors and wind turbines can provide appropriate solutions for electricity production due to the benefits of the long duration of insolation of solar collectors and the energy density of wind turbines. However, there are several challenges and problems that must be solved (land conditions and geographical positions are not appropriate for PV/T installation and wind energy system, respectively). Finally, a series of suggestions is presented to solve the economic problems associated with wind and solar energy systems. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulose originating from renewable and sustainable biomass is a promising alternative resource to produce biofuel. However, the complex component, especially high moisture content, leads to a higher cost of transportation and processing. The instant catapult steam explosion (ICSE) pretreatment can exploit the intracellular water of lignocellulosic materials and convert into vapors leading towards the breakdown of the feedstock during the explosion process. However, it is necessary to study the impact of moisture content on the pretreatment. Results: The sugar yield of wet feedstock after ICSE pretreatment reached 88.05%, which was higher when compared to dried and untreated biomass. The utilization of wet feedstock decreased the production of inhibitor and improved the carbohydrate content in ICSE-treated biomass. There occurred a shrinkage of feedstock after drying process and the mechanical breakage upon ICSE pretreatment. Moreover, not all water was converted into vapor to cause breakage in the lignocellulose. Conclusion: ICSE has shown to be preferably suitable to pretreat wet sweet potato vine with high moisture content, either fresh or soaked biomass that has been dried before. By using these materials, it would have a higher sugar yield and lower inhibitor production after pretreatment. Based on these advantaged aspects of ICSE platform, two potential strategies are proposed to improve the economic and environmental impacts of pretreatment.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) aims to incentivize the production of biomass for bioenergy and bioproducts. This paper investigates the potential effectiveness of BCAP in stimulating biomass production. We find that the effectiveness of BCAP is significantly affected by program design, farmers' risk and time preferences, credit availability, and biomass prices. The impact of a budget-constrained BCAP on incentivizing biomass production is much larger under a program design that enrolls land with the largest incremental biomass production per BCAP payment dollar (IBP-Max design) than under a design that enrolls land with the lowest cost of production (COP-Min design). The effectiveness of BCAP in inducing biomass production is highest when farmers are credit constrained, have a high degree of risk aversion, and a high rate of time preference under the IBP-Max design. The mix of feedstocks induced by the BCAP also varies as the biomass price increases; at low prices much of the biomass induced is from crop residues, while at high prices it is from perennial energy crops. The additional biomass production induced by the BCAP ranges from 0.1% to 62% of total biomass production without BCAP under the IBP-Max design, and from 0.1% to 3% under the COP-Min design. However, the volume of biomass production induced by BCAP is small even in the credit constrained, high-risk aversion, and high discount rate scenario (2.7 million metric tons annually) due to the limited program budget of $125 million BCAP budget under the 2014 Farm Bill. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Alternatives to the restoration of cutaway peatlands include afforestation, energy forests, agricultural production, wetland restoration (restoration of peataccumulating function), reed canary grass (energy mower) or wild berries (blueberry, cranberry) cultivation, protected area for birds, and artificial lakes. Investigations made in several countries suggest that one of the most promising ways of regenerating cutaway peatlands is afforestation. The re-vegetation of Estonian cutaway peat production fields is mainly the result of natural processes, which are generally very slow: vegetation covers only 10-20% of a peat field. Carbon dioxide is not bound anymore in cutaway peatlands where vegetation layer has been destroyed and therefore photosynthetical processes no more occur. Using biofuel ashes (wood ash, etc.) for the afforestation of cutaway peatlands helps to balance the content of nutrients in peat substrate, which improves the survival of planted seedlings and significantly increases bioproduction. Drained and mined peatlands have become a significant source of CO2 but stimulated woody biomass production can be helpful to balance CO2 emission from cutaway peatlands. Because of the limited resources of fossil fuels and negative impacts on the environment in recent decades alternative sources of energy have been actively looked for. In Scandinavia a lot of attention has been paid to finding possibilities for using biofuels. The situation in Estonia is that only very few types of ashes (for example certified oil shale fly ash with product name Enefix) have been founded to be suitable for utilization and have been used for recycling in agriculture. © 2017 Katri Ots et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the cause of a growing food price volatility. We analyse whether food price volatility is mainly induced by transfer of the oil price shock or if it is the consequence of a rising and competitive biofuel production. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of biofuels on land use as well. Food prices have lately surged and declined sharply and become more volatile. High fuel prices combined with a rising biofuel production created a link between crude oil and food prices. We investigated the impact of a biofuel production on an increased volatility in oil and food prices, and found correlations between cereals, sugar and vegetable oil price index and crude oil prices from 2003 to 2016. Our results show that the main driver for food price fluctuation is mainly the oil price shock. The increasing biofuel output has been associated with a rising protein-rich animal feed production. The use of co-products as animal feed has land use implications including GHG emission savings because co-products reduce land and the demand for chemical inputs required in the feed production. © 2017 Journal of Competitiveness.

AB  - Biomass is a crucial energy resource used for the generation of electricity and transportation fuels. Microalgae exhibit a high content of biocomponents which makes them a potential feedstock for the generation of ecofriendly biofuels. Biofuels derived from microalgae are suitable carbon-neutral replacements for petroleum. Fermentation is the major process for metabolic conversion of microalgal biocompounds into biofuels such as bioethanol and higher alcohols. In this review, we explored the use of all three major biocomponents of microalgal biomass including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids for maximum biofuel generation. Application of several pretreatment methods for enhancement the bioavailability of substrates (simple sugar, amino acid, and fatty acid) was discussed. This review goes one step further to discuss how to direct these biocomponents for the generation of various biofuels (bioethanol, higher alcohol, and biodiesel) through fermentation and transesterification processes. Such an approach would result in the maximum utilization of biomasses for economically feasible biofuel production. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Within developing countries, there is an appeal to use waste biomass for energy generation in the form of bio-briquettes. This study investigated the potential use of bio-briquettes that are produced from the waste biomass of the following tropical fruits: durian (Durio zibethinus), coconut (Cocos nucifera), coffee (Coffea arabica), cacao (Theobroma cacao), banana (Musa acuminata) and rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum). All fruit waste biomass samples exhibited an extremely high level of initial moisture content (78.22% in average). Fruit samples with the highest proportion of fruit waste biomass (of total unprocessed fruit mass) were represented by cacao (83.82%), durian (62.56%) and coconut (56.83%). Highest energy potentials (calorific value) of fruit waste biomass were observed in case of coconut (18.22 MJ·kg-1), banana (17.79 MJ·kg-1) and durian (17.60 MJ·kg-1) fruit samples, whereas fruit waste biomass with the lowest level of ash content originated from the rambutan (3.67%), coconut (4.52%), and durian (5.05%) fruit samples. When investigating the energy demands to produce bio-briquettes from such feedstock materials, the best results (lowest amount of required deformation energy in combination with highest level of bio-briquette bulk density) were achieved by the rambutan, durian and banana fruit waste biomass samples. Finally, all investigated bio-briquette samples presented satisfactory levels of bulk density (&gt;1050 kg·m-3). In conclusion, our results indicated the practicability and viability of such bio-briquette fuel production, as well as supporting the fact that bio-briquettes from tropical fruit waste biomass can offer a potentially attractive energy source with many benefits, especially in rural areas. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Prescribed fire is widely applied in western US forests to limit future fire severity by reducing tree density, fuels, and excessive seedlings. Repeated prescribed burning attempts to simulate historical fire regimes in frequent-fire forests, yet there is limited long-term information regarding optimal burn season and frequency. In addition, burns are operationally feasible only in the spring and late fall, largely outside the historical wildfire season. This study quantifies the effect of seasonal reburns on woody surface fuels, forest floor fuels, and understory tree regeneration abundance in six previously thinned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) stands in the southern Blue Mountain Ecoregion of Oregon, USA. Each stand consisted of an unburned control, and four season by reburn treatments: spring 5 yr, spring 15 yr, fall 5 yr, and fall 15 yr. We evaluated season and frequency of reburn for woody surface fuel (1 hr to 1000 hr), forest floor fuel (litter and duff, undifferentiated), and understory conifer seedling density (regeneration). Burning was initiated in the fall of 1997 and spring of 1998; we present results in this pa- per through 2014 for fuel, and 2015 for seedlings. All reburn treatments reduced the forest floor depth compared to those areas not burned (controls). Fall burning, regardless of frequency, generated 1000 hr fuel primarily from overstory mortality resulting from the initial entry burns and subsequent snag and branch fall. But, for the other woody fuel types, reburning had minimal impact, regardless of season or frequency. All reburn treatments reduced regeneration survival, but 5 yr fall reburning was most effective in reducing excessive conifer seedlings. Repeated spring or fall reburns following thinning will reduce forest floor depth but, to achieve low woody fuel loads and control excessive conifer regeneration, it may be necessary to conduct reburns using different timing, such as during drier periods when wildfire ignitions by lightning occurred historically. © 2017 Association for Fire Ecology.

AB  - Commercial scale production of biofuels from lignocellulosic feed stocks has been hampered by the resistance of plant cell walls to enzymatic conversion, primarily owing to lignin. This study investigated whether DypB, the lignin-degrading peroxidase from Rodococcus jostii, depolymerizes lignin and reduces recalcitrance in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). The protein was targeted to the cytosol or the ER using ER-targeting and retention signal peptides. For each construct, five independent transgenic lines were characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Our findings reveal that expression of DypB in the cytosol and ER does not affect plant development. ER-targeting increased protein accumulation, and extracts from transgenic leaves showed higher activity on classic peroxidase substrates than the control. Intriguingly, in situ DypB activation and subsequent saccharification released nearly 200% more fermentable sugars from transgenic lines than controls, which were not explained by variation in initial structural and non-structural carbohydrates and lignin content. Pyrolysis-GC-MS analysis showed more reduction in the level of lignin associated pyrolysates in the transgenic lines than the control primarily when the enzyme is activated prior to pyrolysis, consistent with increased lignin degradation and improved saccharification. The findings reveal for the first time that accumulation and in situ activation of a peroxidase improves biomass digestibility. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Estimates of the climate-change mitigation benefits of biofuels are varied and controversial. Some analysts rely on attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA), limiting the analytic scope to the direct supply chain, whereas others supplement an ALCA result with an estimate of land-use change (LUC) emissions intensity. Other analysts have used consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA), with methods ranging from static market assessments to identify the likely marginal product and supplier, to running partial and general equilibrium models to estimate changes in global production and consumption. In this article, we consider another alternative—using an integrated assessment model (IAM) as a platform for CLCA of biofuels. In this article (part I of II), we focus on the methodological challenges of this approach. In part II, we present a case study using one IAM—the global change assessment model (GCAM)—to estimate the climate effects of several biofuels. © 2016 by Yale University

AB  - Algal biofuels have been offered as an alternative to fossil fuels, based on claims that microalgae can provide a highly productive source of compounds as feedstocks for sustainable transport fuels. Life cycle analyses identify algal productivity as a critical factor affecting commercial and environmental viability. Here, we use mechanistic modelling of the biological processes driving microalgal growth to explore optimal production scenarios in an industrial setting, enabling us to quantify limits to algal biofuels potential. We demonstrate how physiological and operational trade-offs combine to restrict the potential for solar-powered algal-biodiesel production in open ponds to a ceiling of ca. 8000 L ha−1 year−1. For industrial-scale operations, practical considerations limit production to ca. 6000 L ha−1 year−1. According to published economic models and life cycle analyses, such production rates cannot support long-term viable commercialisation of solar-powered cultivation of natural microalgae strains exclusively as feedstock for biofuels. The commercial viability of microalgal biofuels depends critically upon limitations in microalgal physiology (primarily in rates of C-fixation); we discuss the scope for addressing this bottleneck concluding that even deployment of genetically modified microalgae with radically enhanced characteristics would leave a very significant logistical if not financial burden. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The implications and value of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)-based simulations of the productive potential and water quality impacts associated with switchgrass, Miscanthus, or corn stover removal biofuel cropping systems are discussed. Specifically, the three accompanying studies describe the water quality implications of adopting the three biofuel-cropping systems via large-scale conversion of cropland or targeting to marginal lands for three smaller watersheds located in the western or eastern Corn Belt, or across the Upper Mississippi and Ohio-Tennessee River Basins. Other results such as climate change related impacts for two eastern Corn Belt watersheds are also discussed. These studies are supported by the CenUSA Bioenergy coordinated agricultural project funded by the USDA to develop a regional system for producing cellulosic biofuels. A description of the evolving federal policy related to cellulosic biofuel production and consumption is provided as are other potential drivers for encouraging the adoption of stover removal, switchgrass, and Miscanthus as perennial feedstocks. Findings from the SWAT studies and their implications for environmental and economic performance in their respective agroecosystems are discussed, and commonalities and divergences in results are identified. The potential for policy design to improve the performance of these systems based on the findings of these modeling studies, and continuing research needs and directions for improved policy design are discussed.

AB  - Several biofuel cropping scenarios were evaluated with an improved version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as part of the CenUSA Bioenergy consortium for the Boone River Watershed (BRW), which drains about 2,370 km2 in north central Iowa. The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland ≥2% slope or ≥7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

AB  - Land use change can significantly affect the provision of ecosystem services and the effects could be exacerbated by projected climate change. We quantify ecosystem services of bioenergy-based land use change and estimate the potential changes of ecosystem services due to climate change projections. We considered 17 bioenergy-based scenarios with Miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover as candidate bioenergy feedstock. Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability. Overall, ecosystem services of heavily row cropped Wildcat Creek watershed were lower than St. Joseph River watershed which had more forested and perennial pasture lands. The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline. For St. Joseph watershed, Miscanthus in marginal lands (18% of total area) improved FWPI by 87% and ERI by 23% while decreasing FPI by 46%. The relative impacts of land use change were considerably larger than climate change impacts in this paper.

AB  - Most climate change mitigation scenarios that are consistent with the 1.5-2 °C target rely on a large-scale contribution from biomass, including advanced (second-generation) biofuels. However, land-based biofuel production has been associated with substantial land-use change emissions. Previous studies show a wide range of emission factors, often hiding the influence of spatial heterogeneity. Here we introduce a spatially explicit method for assessing the supply of advanced biofuels at different emission factors and present the results as emission curves. Dedicated crops grown on grasslands, savannahs and abandoned agricultural lands could provide 30 EJBiofuel yr-1 with emission factors less than 40 kg of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions per GJBiofuel (for an 85-year time horizon). This increases to 100 EJBiofuel yr-1 for emission factors less than 60 kgCO2e GJBiofuel -1. While these results are uncertain and depend on model assumptions (including time horizon, spatial resolution, technology assumptions and so on), emission curves improve our understanding of the relationship between biofuel supply and its potential contribution to climate change mitigation while accounting for spatial heterogeneity. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Wood represents a promising source of sugars to produce bio-based renewables, including biofuels. However, breaking down lignocellulose requires costly pretreatments because lignocellulose is recalcitrant to enzymatic saccharification. Increasing saccharification potential would greatly contribute to make wood a competitive alternative to petroleum, but this requires improving wood properties. To identify wood biomass traits associated with saccharification, we analyzed a total of 65 traits related to wood chemistry, anatomy and structure, biomass production and saccharification in 40 genetically engineered Populus tree lines. These lines exhibited broad variation in quantitative traits, allowing for multivariate analyses and mathematical modeling. Modeling revealed that seven wood biomass traits associated in a predictive manner with saccharification of glucose after pretreatment. Four of these seven traits were also negatively associated with biomass production, suggesting a trade-off between saccharification potential and total biomass, which has previously been observed to offset the overall sugar yield from whole trees. We therefore estimated the "total-wood glucose yield" (TWG) from whole trees and found 22 biomass traits predictive of TWG after pretreatment. Both saccharification and TWG were associated with low abundant, often overlooked matrix polysaccharides such as arabinose and rhamnose which possibly represent new markers for improved Populus feedstocks. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aims: Aim of the paper was to assess the feasibility of producing hydrogen as a biofuel by photofermentation of fermented water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) waste biomass, after a nitrogen-stripping treatment. Methods and Results: A natural (42OL) and an engineered strain (CGA676, with low-ammonium sensitivity) of Rhodopseudomonas palustris were used for producing hydrogen. The stripping procedure was highly effective for ammonium removal, with an acceptable selectivity (91% of ammonium was removed; only 14% of total organic acids were lost). Both strains were able to produce hydrogen only in the nitrogen-stripped substrate. The natural strain R. palustris 42OL showed a higher Biochemical Hydrogen Potential (1224 ml l−1 vs 720 ml l−1; 50·0 mol m−3 vs 29·4 mol m−3), but at a lower rate (5·6 ml l−1 h−1 vs 7·3 ml l−1 h−1; 0·23 mol m−3 h−1 vs 0·29 mol m−3 h−1) than strain CGA676. Conclusions: Water lettuce waste biomass can be used for biofuel production, after hydrolization, fermentation and nitrogen stripping. Significance and Impact of the Study: The investigation on novel, low cost and sustainable biomasses as feedstocks for biofuel production is a priority. Aquatic plants do not compete for arable land. Moreover, water lettuce is a floating and invasive weed, thus its biomass must be harvested when detrimental, and can now be biotransformed in clean hydrogen. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Aims: Evaluate the use of polyethyleneimines (PEIs) as membrane permeabilizers to improve the responses and sensitivity of a bacterial bioreporter strain to viologens. Methods and Results: The responses from E. coli str. EBS, i.e., E. coli BW25113 carrying plasmid pSDS, when exposed to five different viologens were characterized, as were the toxicities of seven different PEIS, including two linear and five branched species. Based on these results, benzyl viologen led to the greatest responses, and 0·8-kDa branched PEI (BPEI) was the least toxic of the PEIs tested and, therefore, both were selected for the subsequent tests. The bioluminescence and relative responses from E. coli str. EBS exposed to various concentrations of 0·8 kDa BPEI identified 400 mg l−1 as the optimal concentration. Using this concentration, tests were performed with all five of the viologens. Conclusions: The responses from E. coli str. EBS to the viologens were improved, with the maximum relative bioluminescence values increasing between 5·6 and 16·5-fold. The minimum detectable levels for four of the viologens were likewise improved 2- to 4-fold. Significance and Impact of Study: Improving bacterial membrane permeability in a controlled manner using BPEIs can improve biosensing of toxic compounds, as well as be used in biofuel and bioenergy applications where membrane permeability to a solute is important. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - The Upper Mississippi River Basin and Ohio-Tennessee River Basin comprise the majority of the United States Corn Belt region, resulting in degraded Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico water quality. To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

It is particularly unclear how governments worldwide, especially in middle-income countries such as Brazil, Thailand, and Mexico, could enroll so many smallholders in biofuel cropping projects. Conventional views see yields and economic returns as main drivers for smallholder participation in biofuel production but ignore the role played by power and politics. This paper analyses the rapid biofuel expansions (oil palm, jatropha) in the southern Lacandon rainforest in Chiapas (Mexico) and their partial failure (jatropha) from a political ecology perspective. Our findings indicate that biofuel expansions in this region not only occurred for productive reasons, but also because biofuel programmes provided prospects for political gains through strengthened rural organisations. In contrast with emphasis on state coercion and local resistance—common in political ecology—the biofuel expansion relied, in this case, upon a ‘politics of consent’ in which both the state and rural organisations, albeit in a power-laden relationship, sought to achieve their own goals by supporting the planting of biofuel crops. These findings suggest the need to rethink how particular approaches within political ecology apply Gramsci's notions of power and hegemony and, more broadly, to consider the importance of politics in explaining why certain forms of agricultural production become dominant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the main causes of biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems is instream habitat change associated with land-use change in the drainage basin. Biofuel crop production is an increasingly important driver of land-use change in existing agricultural drainage basins. Conceptually, biofuels such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.: Poaceea) can provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, but little is known about the consequences of biofuel crop production for biodiversity. Thus, our aim was to investigate if and how the degree of further environmental changes at regional and local scales can influence taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages in agroecosystem streams. We quantified drainage basin land use, instream and riparian habitat, and fish assemblages in 38 agroecosystem streams in Brazil with drainage basins experiencing rapid expansion of sugarcane production, and calculated degree of environmental change and corresponding response in taxonomic and functional structure of stream fish assemblages. Procrustes and redundancy analyses tested for correlation between land use and instream habitat and environmental factors correlated with fish assemblage structure, respectively. Previous studies demonstrated relationships between land-use change, instream habitat change and taxonomic and functional structure of stream fish assemblages. Therefore, we used regression to test the hypothesis that degree of environmental change is positively correlated with magnitude of change in taxonomic and functional structure of fish assemblages. Primary gradients of environmental change included conversion of pasture to sugarcane and reduction of stream width, depth and volume. Although drainage basin and instream attributes were not correlated within a year, we detected a legacy effect of land use on instream habitat. The degree of environmental change was not significantly correlated with taxonomic or functional changes in stream fish assemblages in most cases. However, abundances of resistant taxa increased, whereas nektonic functional groups decreased, and the biological response also presented evidence of a legacy effect. Our findings demonstrate that instream habitat and aquatic biodiversity in streams with agricultural drainage basins undergoing rapid conversion to biofuel production likely will not experience the full magnitude of responses in the short term. Therefore, repeated sampling of sufficient duration to account for legacy effects or time lags is needed to test for effects of biofuel expansion on biodiversity, and similarly to assess whether management practices such as riparian zone preservation can benefit biodiversity in agroecosystems. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The production of biomass feedstock from marginal land has attracted much attention as a means of avoiding conflict between the production of food and fuel. Yield potentials from marginal lands have generally not been quantified although it is generally assumed that lower biomass yields can be expected from marginal lands. A three year study was conducted in Ireland in order to determine if grass yields of perennial rhizomatous grasses (cocksfoot, tall fescue, reed canary grass, festulolium) for anaerobic digestion from three marginal land sites (very wet site, very dry site, site prone to flooding) could match yields from better soils. Randomised complete block designs were established on each site in 2012 with two varieties of each grass species as treatments. Three grass harvests were taken from each site in 2013 and in 2014. There was no significant difference between yields from the control site and those from the very dry site and the site prone to flooding. Biomass yields from the very wet site were 85% of those from the control site. Highest yields were obtained from festulolium which were significantly higher than yields from perennial ryegrass. An energy analysis showed that maximising the production of grass from low lying mineral marginal grassland in Ireland could provide enough energy to meet the energy requirements of both the private car fleet and the heavy goods vehicle fleet while avoiding conflict with food production which could be concentrated on conventional land. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land use conversion of row crops to bioenergy cropping systems in the southeastern United States (U.S.) creates concerns associated with water use and NO3-N leaching. Production of energy from biomass is associated with large amounts of byproducts generated during biofuel processing. Biochar and vinasse are two nutrient rich byproducts that could be land-applied to bioenergy crops to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizer. However, effects on water dynamics of applying these byproducts to support biomass production is poorly understood, particularly when bioenergy crops replace traditional row crops. Thus, this study aimed to compare a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) rotation to sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] receiving annual applications of biochar and vinasse, on biomass yield, crop evapotranspiration, water use efficiency (WUE), NO3-N leaching, and soil volumetric water content. A field study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 to assess the following treatments: cotton + 150 kg N ha−1 (COT), peanut + 30 kg N ha−1 (PEA), and sweet sorghum receiving one of the following i) 30 kg N ha−1 (S30); ii) 30 kg N ha−1 + biochar (S30B); iii) 30 kg N ha−1 + vinasse (S30V); and iv) 150 kg N ha−1 (S150). Similar aboveground dry matter yields were obtained in 2013 and 2015 for cotton and all sweet sorghum treatments and were on average 19 Mg ha−1 for both years. S30 and S150 achieved similar yields. Sweet sorghum and COT exhibited the highest WUE (∼5 g kg−1). S30B increased soil moisture retention at 0–0.2 m depth 36, 29, and 24% in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Biochar incorporated at 0.15 m soil depth increased soil moisture retention down to 0.4 m. Low N rate application combined with biochar in S30B could represent an alternative management practice to minimize N leaching, recycle nutrients, and increase soil water retention if sweet sorghum were to be widely adopted by farmers in the southeastern U.S. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The contribution of the rhizome to productivity of fermentable sugars and the detailed composition of rhizomes were analyzed in three mature stands of Arundo donax L. cultivated in three locations of variable fertility in the South of Italy. Although the average yearly aboveground dry biomass and rhizome amount showed large and significant differences among sites, (15.3 and 2.6 Mg ha−1 year−1 of rhizomes in the most and less productive sites respectively), rhizomes of all sites had more than 30% of the dry matter (DM) as non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Sucrose and starch were the most abundant NSC but measurable amounts of glucose, fructose, galactose and of the valuable trisaccharide raffinose were also present. The amount of NSC in rhizomes affected their content of dry mater, and water extractives. The ash content also varied significantly among cultivation sites; the highest amount was recorded in rhizomes of the most productive site (Acerra). The abundance in cell wall components of rhizomes was similar to that of published values for the above ground biomass. The present results demonstrate that NSC content in rhizomes of mature stands is a conserved trait. Hence, rhizome biomass, thanks to its quantity and high fermentable sugars content, should be considered as a relevant fraction of the A. donax crop product whose utilization can increase the productivity and the environmental fingerprint of this crop, in view of its biomass utilization in biorefinery. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agriculture is the key for achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals: food security and climate action. To achieve these targets “climate-smart” agricultural practices need to be developed. Life cycle assessment and product carbon footprints are well established and internationally recognized tools to assist the process of improving environmental performance. However, there is room for methodological improvement of agricultural life cycle assessments and product carbon footprints. For agronomists, it is widely known that crop rotations and crop residues do fulfill important agronomic functions, but they are not adequately represented in current life cycle assessment and product carbon footprint modeling practice. New methods tested in this study allow the inclusion of crop rotation effects and crop residues as co-products, whilst keeping at the same time the product focus. Product carbon footprints are calculated with and without consideration of these effects; results are compared. If crop rotations are considered, wheat bread, cow milk, and rapeseed biodiesel have lower product carbon footprints (− 11, − 22, and − 16%, respectively). The product carbon footprint of straw bioethanol significantly increases (+ 80%) when considering straw as an agricultural co-product instead of as waste. Ignoring crop rotation effects underestimates the annual greenhouse gas savings of EU-28 rapeseed biodiesel by 1.67 million t CO2e and 20%, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that crop rotations and straw harvest should be considered for the product carbon footprints of bread, milk, and first- and second-generation biofuels. Since crop rotations and straw harvest are performed worldwide, the findings are relevant to all regions in the world. Comparing crop rotations and identifying climate-smart agricultural practices without losing the production orientation are key challenges for environmental assessments of agriculture in order to achieve the challenging combination of the food security and climate action sustainable development goals. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.

AB  - Although the understanding of biochar stability in soil has improved in recent years, there is a lack of knowledge about how both the soil and biochar carbon (C) mineralisations are affected as a function of biochar amount applied to soil. Thus, increasing amounts of biochar were added to a Quartzipsamment in order to evaluate its priming effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. We hypothesised that biochar will increase negative priming on native SOC mineralisation as function of its application rate to soil. The biochar was produced from sugarcane straw through slow pyrolysis at 450 °C, and a laboratory incubation was conducted for 90 days with the following treatments: soil-alone (C3 source), biochar-alone (C4 source) and soil with biochar at rates equivalent to 0.4% (T1), 0.8% (T2) and 1.9% (T3) (w/w). In the first day of incubation, biochar amendment reduced soil C mineralisation rates from 58 to 88% compared to the soil-alone as a function of increasing biochar application rates. This reduction was mainly attributed to the mineralisation of easily available substrates from incomplete pyrolysis, which were preferentially used by soil micro-organisms at early stages of incubation. This effect, however, subsided after 7 days of incubation and it was not sufficient to induce co-metabolism of SOC decomposition, which were 43% (T1)-71% (T3) lower compared to the control (soil-alone) after 90 days of incubation. This was reflected in the priming effect data, which confirmed the hypothesis that increasing application rates of biochar to soil induce stronger negative priming on SOM mineralisation. The predicted size of recalcitrant biochar C pool varied from 98.8% (T1) to 99.9% (T3) of the total biochar C with respective mean residence time of 454 and 1539 years. It was concluded that increasing rates of biochar application to soil induce stronger negative priming effect on SOC due to the higher proportional quantity of biochar labile C and preferential utilisation of this easily available C source by micro-organisms. However, the size and long residence time of the recalcitrant C pool of biochar confirm its stability in soil, thus being considered an opportunity for C sequestration in OC-poor soils. Additionally, this study draws encouraging perspectives on the evaluation of sugarcane straw as a chemical feedstock and an alternative biofuel through pyrolysis, providing appreciable amounts of a renewable product with a great potential for carbon storage. © 2017 NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).

AB  - Microalgae are promising feedstocks for the production of biofuels thanks to their high biomass yield and the lack of competition with food crops for arable land. Algal industrial exploitation, however, still needs to address several technological challenges to reach energetic and economic sustainability. Genetic improvement of microalgae strains is seminal to fully exploit the potential of these organisms. In this work, we investigated how key environmental parameters affected productivity of a promising genetically modified algal strain cultivated in industrially relevant conditions. We observed that intensive growth conditions strongly influenced algae biology as evidenced by molecular and functional analyses. We also showed that specific operational conditions significantly affected performances, enhancing or reducing the advantages of the strains genetic modification, such as the chlorophyll content per cell and the abundance of photosynthetic apparatus components. This work demonstrates the presence of a strong influence of cultivation environment on the phenotype of improved strains, suggesting that operational parameters have a seminal influence on algae performances and must be taken into full account during strains development efforts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Converting riparian buffers in agricultural areas from annual row crops to short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) grown for biofuel can provide both water quality benefits and a financial incentive for buffer adoption among agricultural producers. A randomized complete block design was used to determine water quality changes resulting from converting plots previously cultivated in corn to SRWC willow (Salix. spp) adjacent to a stream in Storrs, CT. Both overland flow and ground water samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Additionally, overland flow was analyzed for suspended solids concentration (SSC) and ground water samples were analyzed for nitrate + nitrite (NO2+NO3-N). Lower (p = 0.05) concentrations of TN (41%) and TP (53%) were observed in overland flow from willow plots than from corn plots. Shallow ground water concentrations at the edge of willow plots were lower in TN (56%) and NO3+NO2-N (64%), but 35% higher in TP, than at the edge of corn plots. SSC was also lower (71%) in overland flow associated with willow compared to corn. The treatment had no effect on the depth or volume of overland flow or mass export. The changes in concentrations resulting from conversion of corn to SRWC in a riparian buffer are similar to those observed in restored and established buffers. © 2017

AB  - Miscanthus species are important energy crops, due to their high yield of biomass, used for combustion, biofuel fabrication and as a feedstock for various products. They can be also utilised for phytoremediation and other ecological programmes. Extensive needs require considerable amounts of planting material, which can be provided by in vitro micropropagation. A new effective and simple regeneration system of M. sinensis, M. × giganteus and M. sacchariflorus was developed, which comprises just two media supplemented exclusively with growth regulators and lasts for 5 months. Significant differences in regeneration capacity were observed between species, genotypes, and initial explants, and also in the effects of media and growth regulators. Embryogenic callus was induced on explants excised from whole immature inflorescences for M. sinensis and M. × giganteus, or inflorescence axes for M. sacchariflorus, implanted on C17 medium with 90 g l−1 maltose, 5.0 mg l−1 2,4-D and 0.5 mg l−1 BAP. Plant regeneration, tillering, and rooting were conducted on 190-2 medium with 30 g l−1 sucrose, 0.5 mg l−1 KIN and 0.5 mg l−1 NAA. The system produces about 7–20 plantlets per a single explant depending on responsiveness of a genotype of M. sinensis, M. × giganteus and M. sacchariflorus. This indicates the potential scale of direct production at 1500–2000 plantlets from a donor clump. The presented system may provide a large number of plants for field trials and physiological research, as well as facilitate the application of biotechnological methods to improve utility traits of bioenergy crops. © 2017

AB  - Emerging biofuel feedstock systems are well suited for use on less productive marginal soils in the Midwestern USA. The systems could replace commodity crop agriculture that may not be economically feasible on these soils with current input and output prices, and meet a growing renewable energy demand. Three annual bioenergy crops, maize (Zea mays L.), sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and high biomass sorghum (HBS) were grown in rotation with soybean (Glycine max L.) for five years on marginal soils at two locations. Maize aboveground dry matter (DM) yield and grain yield, sweet sorghum aboveground DM yield, and juice yield and Brix, and HBS DM yield were evaluated and used to calculate theoretical ethanol yields. Intermittent drought occurred at both sites during three of the five years notably reducing yield; a terminal drought in 2011 reduced sorghum yields and inhibited maize grain development at both sites. Theoretical ethanol yields averaged across years from sweet sorghum and HBS were greater than from maize at both locations, and indicate that sweet sorghum has the greatest yield potential, but HBS yield was the most stable. The central Missouri site maintained greater dry matter yield, and theoretical ethanol yield than the southwestern Missouri site. Due to the occurrence of drought during the study, the findings have relevance for evaluating marginal land management for annual bioenergy crops in differing rainfall patterns with climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of algal biofuels have typically ignore direct land use change impacts (DLUC), although a few papers have recently shown that the carbon lost from removing the original biomass and disrupting soil organic carbon (SOC) during pond construction can significantly contribute to the climate change impacts. In this study, LCA methods were developed to integrate climate change impacts of DLUC associated with cultivation of microalgae in open ponds and the effects of temporal and geographic variables on algal growth. In addition to direct land use change impacts due to loss of original biomass and the disruption of SOC, this study presents DLUC impacts caused by changing the surface albedo of an area and changing the carbon flux on the land. The methodology is presented with two LCA cases for the production of renewable gasoline from microalgae in climatically similar regions: the Everglades ecoregion and the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain ecoregion. These were chosen to isolate the differences in DLUC impacts that are created by different land cover types, equalizing the life cycle impacts caused by temperature and solar radiation on algal growth. The DLUC impacts arising from albedo change and carbon flux change contributed significantly to the life cycle climate change impacts and differed between the two climatically similar regions. The baseline life cycle climate change impacts with DLUC impacts in the Everglades are 46.7% higher than those of conventional gasoline, while production in the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain leads to a 3.0% reduction. The inclusion of albedo change impacts into the DLUC impacts contributed 10.2% of the life cycle climate change impacts in the Everglades and 36.4% in the Tamaulipas. This methodology can help assess the geographically specific sustainability of algal biofuels on a life cycle basis and can guide siting decisions for algal biofuel feedstock production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Marginal agricultural land provides opportunities to diversify landscapes by producing biomass for biofuel, and through floral provisioning that enhances arthropod-mediated ecosystem service delivery. We examined the effects of local spatial context (adjacent to woodland or agriculture) and irrigation (irrigation or no irrigation) on wildflower bloom and visitation by arthropods in a biofeedstocks-wildflower habitat buffer design. Twenty habitat buffer plots were established containing a subplot of Napier grass (Pennisetum perpureum Schumach) for biofeedstock, three commercial wildflower mix subplots, and a control subplot containing spontaneous weeds. Arthropods and flowers were visually observed in quadrats throughout the season. At the end of the season we measured soil nutrients and harvested Napier biomass. We found irrespective of buffer location or irrigation, pollinators were observed more frequently early in the season and on experimental plots with wildflowers than on weeds in the control plots. Natural enemies showed a tendency for being more common on plots adjacent to a wooded border, and were also more commonly observed early in the season. Herbivore visits were infrequent and not significantly influenced by experimental treatments. Napier grass yields were high and typical of first-year yields reported regionally, and were not affected by location context or irrigation. Our results suggest habitat management designs integrating bioenergy crop and floral resources provide marketable biomass and habitat for beneficial arthropods. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - We completed a field-scale experiment to determine the thickness thresholds of covers of organic residuals required to grow biofuel crops over low-sulfur metal mine tailings with high metal content. An organic-rich mix made of municipal yard waste composts and wood waste was spread up to ∼70 cm thick over low sulfur Ni-Cu tailings. We seeded and fertilized biofuel crops of canola and sunflower across this gradient. We measured biomass production and concentrations of nutrients and trace metals in tailings, organic residuals, and plants. Below the threshold organic cover thickness of 15 cm, macronutrient content was reduced and bioavailable Fe, Ni and Cu were 5–50 times higher as compared to thicker organic covers, apparently as a result of tillage. Bioavailable K and Na increased by an order of magnitude and Mo doubled with increasing thickness of organic covers from 5 and 70 cm thick. The plants showed limited uptake of Ni and Cu, with bioconcentration factors of near 1 for sunflower and 0.6 for canola. Biomass production was not affected by the thickness of the organic cover. Plant rooting depth was deeper over thin organic covers, extending up to 15 cm into the tailings. Low stem Fe in plants over thin covers indicated a potential interaction between trace metals and Fe nutrition. These results support the use of covers of organic residuals as thin as 15 cm thick to grow biofuel crops over circumneutral metal mine tailings. Thin covers will make this approach more economical for mine reclamation managers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The global interest in biofuels has increased significantly in recent years, mainly due to the concern about climate change. In Brazil, the land area under sugarcane cultivation has expanded in unprecedented ways to meet the increasing ethanol demand of both the domestic and international markets. São Paulo is the Brazilian state with the highest production of sugarcane, and the expansion of this activity can impact both the environment and society. The purpose of this paper was to assess and map the sensitivity of the areas used for sugarcane cultivation in São Paulo state and to provide a holistic approach to sugarcane production from the sustainability perspective by integrating indicators of the environmental, social and economic spheres without focusing on one single element. Five environmental indicators (related to water resources, slope, environmental conservation areas, land use and agricultural potential) and six socioeconomic indicators (related to employment, income, education, gender equality, child labor and forced labor) were selected for the analysis. The methodology comprised the Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA) technique and the spatialization of results in a Geographic Information System. The resulting maps of sensitivity show the patterns of the three retained principal components and provide an information-rich tool that the government can use in decision making, policy formulation and the integrated planning of land use, thereby enabling the identification of both hotspots and which issues should be prioritized. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity is frequently used to assess the mitigation potential of biofuels; however, failure to quantify other environmental impacts may result in unintended consequences, effectively shifting the environmental burden of fuel production rather than reducing it. We modeled production of E85, a gasoline/ethanol blend, from forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. photoperiod LS) grown, processed, and consumed in California's Imperial Valley in order to evaluate the influence of nitrogen (N) management on well-to-wheel (WTW) environmental impacts from cellulosic ethanol. We simulated 25 N management scenarios varying application rate, application method, and N source. Life cycle environmental impacts were characterized using the EPA's criteria for emissions affecting the environment and human health. Our results suggest efficient use of N is an important pathway for minimizing WTW emissions on an energy yield basis. Simulations in which N was injected had the highest nitrogen use efficiency. Even at rates as high as 450 kg N ha−1, injected N simulations generated a yield response sufficient to outweigh accompanying increases in most N-induced emissions on an energy yield basis. Thus, within the biofuel life cycle, trade-offs across productivity, GHG intensity, and pollutant loads may be possible to avoid at regional to global scales. However, trade-offs were seemingly unavoidable when impacts from E85 were compared to those of conventional gasoline. The GHG intensity of sorghum-derived E85 ranged from 29 to 44 g CO2 eq MJ−1, roughly 1/3 to 1/2 that of gasoline. Conversely, emissions contributing to local air and water pollution tended to be substantially higher in the E85 life cycle. These adverse impacts were strongly influenced by N management and could be partially mitigated by efficient application of N fertilizers. Together, our results emphasize the importance of minimizing on-farm emissions in maximizing both the environmental benefits and profitability of biofuels. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Improving plant characteristics for better environmental resilience and more cost-effective transformation to fuels and chemicals is one of the focus areas in biomass feedstock development. In order to bridge lignin engineering and conversion technologies, this study aimed to fractionate and characterize lignin streams from wild-type and engineered switchgrass using three different pretreatment methods, i.e., dilute sulfuric acid (DA), ammonium hydroxide (AH), and aqueous ionic liquid (IL). Results demonstrate the low lignin content and high S/G ratio switchgrass mutant (4CL) was more susceptible to pretreatment and subsequently more digestible by enzymes as compared to wild-type switchgrass and AtLOV1 mutant. In addition, when compared to DA and AH pretreatment, aqueous IL (cholinium lysinate) was demostrated to be an efficient lignin solvent, as indicated by the high (> 80%) lignin solubility and reduced lignin molecular weight. FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry measurements suggest that pretreatment chemistry greatly influenced the structural and compositional changes and thermal properties of the pretreated switchgrass and recovered lignin-rich streams. The comparative data obtained from this work deepen our understanding of how lignin modification impacts the fractionation and properties of biomass feedstocks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Surface water retention systems act to reduce nutrient pollution by collecting excess nutrients within a watershed via runoff. Harvesting aquatic biomass, such as the invasive cattail, from retention systems removes nutrients absorbed by the plant from the ecosystem permanently. Harvested biomass can be used as a renewable energy source in place of fossil fuels, offsetting carbon emissions. The purpose of this research was to simulate cattail harvest from surface water retention systems to determine their ability to provide suitable growing conditions with annual fluctuations in water availability. The economic and environmental benefits associated with nutrient removal and carbon offsets were also calculated and monetized. A proposed upstream and existing downstream water retention system in southern Manitoba were modelled using a system dynamics model with streamflow inputs provided by a physical hydrologic model, Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire - Surface and Hydrology (MESH). Harvesting cattail and other unconventional feedstocks, such as reeds, sedges, and grasses, from retention systems provided a viable revenue stream for landowners over a ten-year period. This practice generates income for landowners via biomass and carbon credit production on otherwise underutilized marginal cropland invaded with cattail. The economic benefits promote wetland habitat restoration while managing cattail growth to maintain biodiversity. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus are also removed from the ecosystem, reducing downstream nutrient loading. Utilizing surface water retention systems for cattail harvest is a best management strategy for nutrient retention on the landscape and improving agricultural resilience. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass estimation plays of crucial role in agriculture and agro-based industries. The macauba, Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lood., ex Mart., is a palm species that has been a focal point for research and development of an alternative biomass-bioenergy crop for the tropics. The macauba fruit components (exocarp, mesocarp, endocarp and seed/kernel) present different constitutional characteristics and their biomass determination, by traditional methods, is labor-consuming. Therefore, the validation of procedures that can streamline this process is relevant, since it can reduce costs and time for both breeding programs and industries. This study tested the efficacy of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on biomass prediction of the macauba fruit components by comparing it to the multiple linear regression method. The data used came from fruits collected in 18 localities, distributed throughout the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. According to their provenance, the matrices were clustered into two groups with the k-means method for posterior ANN cross-validation. Each group was interchangeably used for both training and validation purposes. The ANN was more efficient than multivariate linear model in the predictions of dry weight of the fruit́s four components and oil content of the mesocarp and seed. As for variables related to dry weight, ANN reached 98% predictive accuracy (i.e., 98% accuracy of the value predicted by the network), and for variables related to oil contents, accuracy was around 90%. Additionally, non-invasive measurements of the fruit (i.e., low-cost and low-time measurement variables) were adequate enough to predict most of the variables of interest. These results show the ANN's prediction potential, saving time and efforts for the consolidation of macauba as a crop. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) residue removal at high rates can result in negative impacts to soil ecosystem services. The use of cover crops could be a potential strategy to ameliorate any adverse effects of residue removal while allowing greater removal levels. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine changes in water erosion potential, soil organic C (SOC) and total N concentration, and crop yields under early- and late-terminated cover crop (CC) combined with five levels of corn residue removal after 3 years on rainfed and irrigated no-till continuous corn in Nebraska. Treatments were no CC, early- and late-terminated winter rye (Secale cereale L.) CC, and 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% corn residue removal rates. Complete residue removal reduced mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates (5 cm depth) by 29% compared to no removal at the rainfed site only, suggesting increased water erosion risk at rainfed sites. Late-terminated CC significantly increased MWD of water-stable aggregates by 27 to 37% at both sites compared to no CC, but early-terminated CC had no effect. The increased MWD with late-terminated CC suggests that CC when terminated late can offset residue removal-induced risks of water erosion. Residue removal and CC did not affect SOC and total soil N concentration. Particulate organic matter increased with late-terminated CC at the irrigated site compared to no CC. Complete residue removal increased irrigated grain yield by 9% in 1 year relative to no removal. Late-terminated CC had no effect on corn yield except in 1 year when yield was 8% lower relative to no CC due to low precipitation at corn establishment. Overall, late-terminated CC ameliorates residue removal-induced increases in water erosion potential and could allow greater levels of removal without reducing corn yields in most years, in the short term, under the conditions of this study. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This research measured greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from well-drained soil after using two forms of vinasse (in natura and digested) as fertilizer and the interaction of both with urea. Although carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content in digested vinasse was two times less than in the normal vinasse (part of the N was lost during filtration and used by cellular synthesis of reactor biomass), N2O emissions were four-fold higher in the treatment with digested vinasse plus urea (302.8 mg N-N2O m− 2) than in the treatment with normal vinasse amended with urea (70.9 mg N-N2O m− 2). Differently from all the other treatments, digested vinasse alone resulted in positive emissions of CH4. CO2 emissions follow vinasse in natura &gt; vinasse in natura + urea &gt; digested vinasse + urea &gt; urea &gt; control &gt; digested vinasse, contradicting again the paradigm of C availability and N2O emissions. Many efforts have been made to describe models with an input of nutrients, their availability and N2O release. It can be concluded that the amount of nutrients is not sufficient and microbiological factors may contribute to improve GHG emission estimates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The global palm oil market experienced a remarkable boom since the year 2000. Since palm oil can be used for biodiesel production, the global expansion of oil palm cultivation has been associated with the global biofuel boom. Biofuel policies—especially those adopted in the European Union (EU)—have been blamed for the socio-environmental impacts of oil palm expansion. We explore how the global biofuel boom interacts with national geographies and social-economic and political processes to produce country-specific trajectories of biofuel crops expansion. We analyse the expansion of oil palm cultivation in Colombia between 2000 and 2010 from a political ecology perspective. Methods: The analysis is based on a framework that positions expansion of commodity frontiers within the ‘space-of-flows’ and the ‘space-of-place’. Through this approach, we identify the markets and geographies that define the country-specific trajectories of expansion of oil palm in Colombia, and their connections with general patterns of land control. The empirical analysis is based on primary data collected during fieldwork, and on an extensive review of secondary data about the palm oil sector and the socio-environmental effects of oil palm expansion in the country. Results: The contemporary oil palm expansion in Colombia was not specifically influenced by the international biofuel market. Expansion was characterized by an increasing production of palm oil for biodiesel, to supply a policy-driven national biofuel market controlled by national palm oil producers. The evidence shows that this oil palm expansion proceeded through a variety of land control practices that constitute forms of ‘accumulation by dispossession’ and ‘assimilation’. These are embedded in contextual factors that include the agrarian history of Colombia, the armed conflict, and government policies. Conclusions: Our study shows that the ways in which expansion of biofuel crops unfold in each producing country depend not only on the global biofuel market. They are also shaped by the country-specific geographies and political economies. Therefore, research and policies on the global expansion of energy crops should account for the complex and interrelated factors that mediate the specific ways in which the global demand for biofuels creates biofuel crop booms at country level. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - This study addresses the uncertainties related to potential changes in land use and management and associated impacts on hydrology and water quality resulting from increased production of biofuel from the conventional and cellulosic feedstock. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts on regional and field scale evapotranspiration, soil moisture content, stream flow, sediment, and nutrient loadings in the Ohio River Basin. The model incorporates spatially and temporally detailed hydrologic, climate and agricultural practice data that are pertinent to simulate biofuel feedstock production, watershed hydrology and water quality. Three future biofuel production scenarios in the region were considered, including a feedstock projection from the DOE Billion-Ton (BT2) Study, a change in corn rotations to continuous corn, and harvest of 50% corn stover. The impacts were evaluated on the basis of relative changes in hydrology and water quality from historical baseline and future business-as-usual conditions of the basin. The overall impact on water quality is an order of magnitude higher than the impact on hydrology. For all the three future scenarios, the sub-basin results indicated an overall increase in annual evapotranspiration of up to 6%, a decrease in runoff up to 10% and minimal change in soil moisture. The sediment and phosphorous loading at both regional and field levels increased considerably (up to 40–90%) for all the biofuel feedstock scenario considered, while the nitrogen loading increased up to 45% in some regions under the BT2 Study scenario, decreased up to 10% when corn are grown continuously instead of in rotations, and changed minimally when 50% of the stover are harvested. Field level analyses revealed significant variability in hydrology and water quality impacts that can further be used to identify suitable locations for the feedstock productions without causing major impacts on water quantity and quality. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: To mitigate climate impacts associated with energy consumption, renewable fuel policies have been established in the USA that encourage production and use of corn ethanol. Current fuel usage of corn ethanol is approximately 15 billion gallons/year (57 billion liters/year), with nearly all of this in the form of E10 (10% blend in gasoline). There is now interest in increasing fuel ethanol usage to achieve nationwide levels of E20 or greater. Due to lack of capacity and poor economics, cellulosic ethanol cannot contribute significantly to increased fuel ethanol production in the near term. Thus, rapid growth of fuel ethanol usage implies expansion of corn ethanol beyond current levels. The objective of this study was to assess the potential water requirements of expanding corn ethanol to provide for nationwide E20 fuel by 2025. Methods: A simple modeling approach was used to assess the water requirements for producing 12.5 billion gallons (47.3 billion liters) corn ethanol in the baseline year of 2013 and 24.3 billion gallons (92.0 billion liters) in three future year scenarios of 2025. Irrigation water and process water were considered but not natural rainfall. Baseline inputs regarding corn acreage, crop yields, and irrigation patterns were obtained from the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for each of the 29 corn-producing states in the USA. The three future year scenarios differed in how the required expansion of corn cropping was allocated across the states, thereby resulting in different irrigation patterns. Results: As a consequence of differing irrigation requirements, the water intensity of corn ethanol (L water/L ethanol) varied by approximately two orders of magnitude over the 29 corn-producing states. In the 2013 baseline, the water intensity of corn ethanol in Iowa (with 1% irrigated corn acreage) was 5.5 L/L, while that in neighboring Nebraska (with 56% irrigated corn acreage) was 427 L/L. All three future year scenarios result in substantial increases in total volumetric water requirements—from 62 to 161% compared to the 2013 baseline. Conclusions: Increasing ethanol blend fuels from E10 to E20 in the near future will require significant expansion of corn cropping in the USA, which will increase irrigation demands. The amount of increased water usage will depend upon the geographic distribution of the cropping expansion. Expansion into already water-stressed areas will exacerbate existing water concerns. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Yield improvement of woody bioenergy crops has been the major focus of breeding programs, but biomass quality is also important for conversion to biofuels. Using high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis, the composition of biomass samples from two shrub willow (Salix spp.) yield trial networks representing two distinct datasets were examined. Dataset 1 consisted of 12 yield trials containing 10 genotypes that mainly represented early cultivars from the US breeding program. Dataset 2 consisted of five trial locations containing 19 genotypes from later breeding efforts. Variation in ash and hemicellulose content were largely controlled by genetic factors, while cellulose and lignin content were heavily influenced by environmental effects. Mean biomass composition traits for dataset 1 were 2.1% ash, 42.4% cellulose, 18.7% hemicellulose and 25.5% lignin. For dataset 2 mean traits were 1.9% ash, 43.2% cellulose, 17.7% hemicellulose and 25.7% lignin. Yield was negatively correlated with lignin content and positively correlated with cellulose content at the level of environment. Elite triploid hybrid cultivars have the potential to produce more cellulose per unit area because of higher yields and/or greater cellulose content. These findings suggest that selection of genotypes for improved yield, as well as selection of growing environment, can improve feedstock quality for biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Across energy, agricultural and forestry landscapes, the production of biomass for energy has emerged as a controversial driver of land-use change. We present a novel, simple methodology, to probe the potential global sustainability limits of bioenergy over time for energy provision and climate change mitigation using a complex-systems approach for assessing land-use dynamics. Primary biomass that could provide between 70 EJ year−1 and 360 EJ year−1, globally, by 2050 was simulated in the context of different land-use futures, food diet patterns and climate change mitigation efforts. Our simulations also show ranges of potential greenhouse gas emissions for agriculture, forestry and other land uses by 2050, including not only above-ground biomass-related emissions, but also from changes in soil carbon, from as high as 24 GtCO2eq year−1 to as low as minus 21 GtCO2eq year−1, which would represent a significant source of negative emissions. Based on the modelling simulations, the discussions offer novel insights about bioenergy as part of a broader integrated system. Whilst there are sustainability limits to the scale of bioenergy provision, they are dynamic over time, being responsive to land management options deployed worldwide. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Application of fish sludge as fertiliser to agricultural land can contribute to closing nutrient cycles in fish farming. The effect of different treatment technologies on the nitrogen fertilisation effects of fish sludge was studied by a bioassay with barley (Hordeum vulgare), an incubation and a field experiment. Dried fish sludge resulted in relative agronomic efficiency of 50–80% compared with mineral fertiliser. The anaerobic digestate based on fish sludge (20 vol%) and dairy manure did not increase nitrogen uptake in barley. Increasing the ratio of fish sludge in the digestate increased the fertilisation effect, but requires optimisation of the biogas process. A simple logistics analysis conducted for a case hatchery showed that on-site drying and co-digestion of fish sludge in a central biogas plant can be regarded as equal in terms of costs. Norway can become an exporter of fish sludge-based recycling fertilisers if current regulations are modified to facilitate nutrient recycling. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Bioenergy crops are well known for their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the soil carbon stock. Although such crops are often held to be in competition with food crops and thus raise the question of current and future food security, at the same time mitigation measures are required to tackle climate change and sustain local farming communities and crop production. However, in some cases the actions envisaged for specific pedo-climatic conditions are not always economically sustainable by farmers. In this frame, energy crops with high environmental adaptability and yields, such as giant reed (Arundo donax L.), may represent an opportunity to improve farm incomes, making marginal areas not suitable for food production once again productive. In so doing, three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations would be met, namely SDG 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture, SDG 7 on reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13 on action to combat climate change and its impacts. In this work, the response of giant reed in the marginal areas of an agricultural district of southern Italy (Destra Sele) and expected farm incomes under climate change (2021–2050) are evaluated. The normalized water productivity index of giant reed was determined (WP; 30.1 g m− 2) by means of a SWAP agro-hydrological model, calibrated and validated on two years of a long-term field experiment. The model was used to estimate giant reed response (biomass yield) in marginal areas under climate change, and economic evaluation was performed to determine expected farm incomes (woodchips and chopped forage). The results show that woodchip production represents the most profitable option for farmers, yielding a gross margin 50% lower than ordinary high-input maize cultivation across the study area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The anaerobic treatment of raw vinasse in a combined system consisting in two methanogenic reactors, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) + anaerobic packed bed reactors (APBR), was evaluated. The organic loading rate (OLR) was varied, and the best condition for the combined system was 12.5 kg COD m−3day−1 with averages of 0.289 m3 CH4 kg COD r−1for the UASB reactor and 4.4 kg COD m−3day−1 with 0.207 m3 CH4 kg COD r−1 for APBR. The OLR played a major role in the emission of H2S conducting to relatively stable quality of biogas emitted from the APBR, with H2S concentrations &lt;10 mg L−1. The importance of the sulphate to COD ratio was demonstrated as a result of the low biogas quality recorded at the lowest ratio. It was possible to develop a proper anaerobic digestion of raw vinasse through the combined system with COD removal efficiency of 86.7% and higher CH4 and a lower H2S content in biogas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Black carbon - a primary component of particulate matter emitted from an incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass, and biofuels - has been found to have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment. Since black carbon emissions data are not readily available, no measures are implemented to reduce black carbon emissions. The temporal and seasonal variations of black carbon concentrations were evaluated during 2012–2014. The data were collected in the highly polluted European city – Ostrava, Czech Republic, surrounded by major highways and large industries. Significantly higher black carbon concentrations were obtained in Ostrava, relative to other European cities and the magnitude was equivalent to the magnitude of black carbon concentrations measured in Poland and China. The data were categorized to heating and non-heating seasons based on the periodic pattern of daily and monthly average concentrations of black carbon. A higher black carbon concentration was obtained during heating season than non-heating season and was primarily associated with an increase in residential coal burning and meteorological parameters. The concentration of black carbon was found to be negatively correlated with temperature and wind speed, and positively correlated with the relative humidity. Other black carbon sources potentially included emissions from vehicle exhaust and the local steel-producing industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perennial bioenergy systems, such as switchgrass and restored prairies, are alternatives to commonly used annual monocultures such as maize. Perennial systems require lower chemical input, provide greater ecosystem services such as carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation and support greater biodiversity of beneficial insects. However, biomass harvest will be necessary in managing these perennial systems for bioenergy production, and it is unclear how repeated harvesting might affect ecosystem services. In this study, we examined how repeated production-scale harvesting of diverse perennial grasslands influences vegetation structure, natural enemy communities (arthropod predators and parasitoids), and natural biocontrol services in two states (Wisconsin and Michigan, USA) over multiple years. We found that repeated biomass harvest reduced litter biomass and increased bare ground cover. Some natural enemy groups, such as ground-dwelling arthropods, decreased in abundance with harvest, whereas others such as foliar-dwelling arthropods increased in abundance. The disparity in responses is likely due to how different taxonomic groups utilize vegetation and differences in dispersal abilities. At the community level, biomass harvest altered community composition, increased total arthropod abundance and decreased evenness but did not influence species richness, diversity or biocontrol services. Harvest effects varied with time, diminishing in strength both within the season (for total abundance and evenness), across seasons (for evenness) or were consistent throughout the duration of the study (for community composition). Greater functional redundancy and compensatory responses of the different taxonomic groups may have buffered against the potentially negative effects of harvest on biocontrol services. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that in the short-term, repeated harvesting of perennial grasslands (when insect activity is low) consistently altered vegetation structure but had mixed effects on natural enemy communities and no discernible effects on biocontrol services. However, the long-term effects of repeated harvesting on vegetation structure, natural enemies and other arthropod-derived ecosystem services such as pollination and decomposition remain largely unknown. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Since the early 2000s, biofuel production has been developed in West Africa with the encouragement and support of notably Europe, Brazil, and China. Yet the development of biofuels can also be viewed from the angle of West African interests. The principle arguments advanced in favor of biofuels pointed to their potential to reduce oil trade deficits and improve the populations’ access to ready, cheap energy. Biofuels consequently began to be put on the political agendas of West African countries. Ten years after the first Jatropha plantations for energy use were established in West Africa, and in the light of the uneven development of the biofuel sector across the region, we analyze the factors that surprisingly led to policy inaction in many of these countries. Methods: We used the concept of policy cycle stages to analyze the involvement of stakeholders in building biofuel policy and the factors behind incomplete public policies. The methods and tools that have been defined for the analysis of the relationships and interplay between actors are based on an analysis of the positions and interests of different stakeholders and on the comparison of their influence and importance in the design and implementation of projects, programs and policies. Our approach is inspired by the literature on Stakeholder Analysis, but also draws from the field of New Institutional Economics. We developed our own analytic framework (the “4C”) which breaks down the interplay between different types of stakeholders and into four types of relationships: coordination, concertation, cooperation and contractualization. Our research process was based on a ranging study conducted between 2011 and 2014. Multilevel approaches were used to understand multi-scale and multi-sector biofuel issues. The analysis employed a large range of methods, including the reading of reports and political texts and conducting interviews. The documentary analysis helped to identify stakeholder groups for the stakeholder analysis. We then carried out interviews with a panel of stakeholders. Results: The study shows that it was the energy ministries of West African countries, encouraged by international cooperation agencies, which stepped forward to establish biofuel strategies, paying little attention to the issues at stake for agricultural producers or local communities. Around the same time, increases in food prices on the international market began to damage the image of biofuels, which came to be perceived as a threat to the food security of populations in developing countries. In several countries dependent on outside technical and financial support, this shift in the international discourse influenced the position of agriculture ministries, which became lukewarm or even opposed to biofuels. An outstanding result of the study is that the double talk at the international level—favorable and unfavorable to biofuels—and power games inside the countries crippled the coordination of public action to support the sector, generated an institutional vacuum, led to conflicts between stakeholders, and hampered the sustainable development of biofuel projects and sectors in several West African countries. In conclusion, we then emphasize the need to turn inaction into action: regulation frameworks must be implemented if the biofuel sector is to survive in West Africa. Conclusions: The development of biofuels in the majority of West African countries suffers from an absence of a clear vision shared by all stakeholders and a lack of coordination between public actors. An institutional vacuum has taken hold which prevents investments in and the sustainable development of the biofuel sector and respectful of the interests of family farmers, who represent the majority of the population. The governments in these countries mainly worked through the ministries in charge of energy, which have become the leaders on the biofuel question. National biofuel policies are thus primarily focused on the energy potential of biofuels and on technical and economic dimensions of processing Jatropha seeds into oil and biodiesel rather than on upstream and downstream social objectives. If the biofuel sector is to survive in West African countries, the inaction of public actors has to be reversed by establishing the institutional frameworks needed to facilitate such development. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Crude rubber seed oil is a potential source for biofuel production. However it contains undesirable impurities such as peroxides and high oxidative components that not only affect the oil stability, colour and shelf-life but promote insoluble gums formation with time that could cause deposition in the combustion engines. Therefore to overcome these problems the crude rubber seed oil is refined by undergoing degumming and bleaching process. The effect of bleaching earth dosage (15–40 wt %), phosphoric acid dosage (0.5–1.0 wt %) and reaction time (20–40 min) were studied over the reduction of the peroxide value in a refined crude rubber seed oil. The analysis of variance shows that bleaching earth dosage was the most influencing factor followed by reaction time and phosphoric acid dosage. A minimum peroxide value of 0.1 milliequivalents/gram was achieved under optimized conditions of 40 wt % of bleaching earth dosage, 1.0 wt % of phosphoric acid dosage and 20 min of reaction time using Response Surface Methodology design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Intensively managed grasslands are dominated by highly productive grass-clover mixtures. Increasing crop diversity by inclusion of competitive forbs may enhance biomass production and sustainable biofuel production. Here we examined if one or all of three forbs (chicory, Cichorium intybus L.; caraway, Carum carvi L.; plantain, Plantago lanceolata L.) included in ryegrass-red clover mixtures enhanced above- A nd below-ground productivity, and assessed their biofuel potentials, based on a three-year experiment with and without fertilisation as cattle slurry. We determined herbage yield, standing root biomass, and estimated methane energy output and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per energy unit using life cycle assessment. Results showed that plantain-containing grass-clover mixtures significantly increased herbage yield, while chicory- or caraway-containing mixtures maintained similar yields to the grass-clover mixture. Standing root biomass of the grass-clover mixture was enhanced by inclusion of caraway and plantain, with that of plantain further enhanced by fertilisation. The highest methane energy output was achieved in plantain-containing grass-clover mixtures. All unfertilised mixtures achieved the 60% reduction in GHG emissions compared to fossil fuel, whereas all fertilised mixtures did not meet the 60% reduction target. These findings suggest that including competitive forbs such as plantain in grass-clover mixtures enhances productivity, supporting low-carbon footprint bioenergy production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Cyanobacteria have the potential to produce bulk and fine chemicals and members belonging to Nostoc sp. have received particular attention due to their relatively fast growth rate and the relative ease with which they can be harvested. Nostoc punctiforme is an aerobic, motile, Gram-negative, filamentous cyanobacterium that has been studied intensively to enhance our understanding of microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation. The genome of the type strain N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 was sequenced in 2001 and the scientific community has used these genome data extensively since then. Advances in bioinformatics tools for sequence annotation and the importance of this organism prompted us to resequence and reanalyze its genome and to make both, the initial and improved annotation, available to the scientific community. The new draft genome has a total size of 9.1 Mbp and consists of 65 contiguous pieces of DNA with a GC content of 41.38% and 7664 protein-coding genes. Furthermore, the resequenced genome is slightly (5152 bp) larger and contains 987 more genes with functional prediction when compared to the previously published version. We deposited the annotation of both genomes in the Department of Energy’s IMG database to facilitate easy genome exploration by the scientific community without the need of in-depth bioinformatics skills. We expect that an facilitated access and ability to search the N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 for genes of interest will significantly facilitate metabolic engineering and genome prospecting efforts and ultimately the synthesis of biofuels and natural products from this keystone organism and closely related cyanobacteria. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgae are considered to be the future promising sources of biofuels and bio products. The algal carbohydrates can be fermented to bioethanol after pretreatment process. Efficient pretreatment of the biomass is one of the major requirements for commercialization of the algal based biofuels. In present study the microalga, M. aeruginsa was used for pretreatment optimization and bioethanol production. Treatment of algal biomass with CaO before acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis enhanced the degradation of algal cells. Monomeric sugars yield was increased more than twice when biomass was pretreated with CaO. Similarly, an increase was noted in the amount of fermentable sugars when biomass was subjected to invertase saccharification after acid or lysozyme pretreatment. Highest yield of fermentable sugars (16 mM/ml) in the centrifuged algal juice was obtained. 4 Different microorganisms’ species were used individually and in combination for converting centrifuged algal juice to bioethanol. Comparatively higher yield of bioethanol (60 mM/ml) was obtained when the fermenter microorganisms were used in combination. The results demonstrated that M. arginase biomass can be efficiently pretreated to get higher yield of fermentable sugars for enhanced yield of bioethanol production. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Efficient deconstruction and bioconversion of solids at high mass loadings is necessary to produce industrially relevant titers of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. To date, only a few studies have investigated the effect of solids loadings on microorganisms of interest for consolidated bioprocessing. Here, the effects that various switchgrass loadings have on Clostridium thermocellum solubilization and bioconversion are investigated. Results: Clostridium thermocellum was grown for 10 days on 10, 25, or 50 g/L switchgrass or Avicel at equivalent glucan loadings. Avicel was completely consumed at all loadings, but total cellulose solubilization decreased from 63 to 37% as switchgrass loadings increased from 10 to 50 g/L. Washed, spent switchgrass could be additionally hydrolyzed and fermented in second-round fermentations suggesting that access to fermentable substrates was not the limiting factor at higher feedstock loadings. Results from fermentations on Avicel or cellobiose using culture medium supplemented with 50% spent fermentation broth demonstrated that compounds present in the supernatants from the 25 or 50 g/L switchgrass loadings were the most inhibitory to continued fermentation. Conclusions: Recalcitrance alone cannot fully account for differences in solubilization and end-product formation between switchgrass and Avicel at increased substrate loadings. Experiments aimed at separating metabolic inhibition from inhibition of hydrolysis suggest that C. thermocellum's hydrolytic machinery is more vulnerable to inhibition from switchgrass-derived compounds than its fermentative metabolism. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The impact of water use in areas with abundant freshwater resources should not be the same as areas with limited resources. This impact is quantified as water scarcity footprint. The monthly water stress index with reference to environmental water requirement is proposed as a characterization factor. The biofuel policies of Thailand-cassava and sugarcane for bioethanol, and oil palm for biodiesel-were selected for the assessment based on land expansion and displacement scenarios. Cultivation was found to be the most water intensive phase in producing both biodiesel and bioethanol. Thus, the proposed index was applied for assessing and selecting areas having low values of the water scarcity footprint. The results showed low values for expanding oil palm plantations on abandoned land and displacing plantation areas with low yields of maize and pineapple with sugarcane and cassava. Additionally, shifting the crop calendar could be considered to reduce the stress situation such as the central region can avoid the water scarcity footprint by 38% from shifting sugarcane cultivation. Consequently mitigating this potential impact and threats to the ecosystem based on specific circumstances and context would be achieved through applying the proposed index in water resource and land suitability planning. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The gas industry is going to be revolutionized by being able to generate bioenergy from biomass. The production of biomethane – a green substitute of natural gas – is growing in Europe and the United-States of America. Biomethane can be injected into the gas grid or used as fuel for vehicles after compression. Due to various biomass inputs (e.g. agricultural wastes, sludges from sewage treatment plants, etc.), production processes (e.g. anaerobic digestion, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills), seasonal effects and purification processes (e.g. gas scrubbers, pressure swing adsorption, membranes for biogas upgrading), the composition and quality of biogas and biomethane produced is difficult to assess. All previous publications dealing with biogas analysis reported that hundreds of chemicals from ten chemical families do exist in trace amounts in biogas. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study reported a detailed analysis or the implementation of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) for biogas matrices. This is the reason why the benefit of implementing two-dimensional gas chromatography for the characterization of biogas and biomethane samples was evaluated. In a first step, a standard mixture of 89 compounds belonging to 10 chemical families, representative of those likely to be found, was used to optimize the analytical method. A set consisting of a non-polar and a polar columns, respectively in the first and the second dimension, was used with a modulation period of six seconds. Applied to ten samples of raw biogas, treated biogas and biomethane collected on 4 industrial sites (two MSW landfills, one anaerobic digester on a wastewater treatment plant and one agricultural biogas plant), this analytical method provided a “fingerprint” of the gases composition at the molecular level in all biogas and biomethane samples. Estimated limits of detection (far below the μg Nm−3) coupled with the resolution of GC × GC allowed the comparison of the real samples considered. This first implementation of GC × GC for the analysis of biogas and biomethane demonstrated unambiguously that it is a promising tool to provide a “fingerprint” of samples, and to monitor trace compounds by families. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) at 200 and 250 °C was combined with acetic acid and NaOH (changing feedwater pH from 2 to 12) to treat woody biomass for enhancing its pelletization and fuel properties. The treated biomass (hydrochar) was characterized by composition analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, after which the energy consumption of pelletization; tensile strength; fuel properties, including proximate, elemental analysis, and mass density; and combustion characteristics of corresponding pellets were analyzed. The results showed that both the acetic acid and NaOH-aided HTC processes decreased the energy consumption of hydrochar compression. Weakly basic or acidic feedwater decreased the tensile strength of hydrochar pellets, but it increased at pH 2 and 12. The changes in treatment pH from 4 to 9 had little effect on the O/C and H/C content of the hydrochar pellets, while the addition of acetic acid enhanced oxygen and hydrogen loss more than NaOH. The heating values of hydrochar pellets produced at pH 2 from 200 and 250 °C were 20.7 and 22.8 MJ/kg, respectively. Hydrochar pellets produced from HTC at 250 °C and pH 2 had higher mass density and lower equilibrium water content than those produced under other conditions. The combustion process was promoted with reduced ignition temperature, maximum weight loss rate, and burnout temperature. These findings demonstrate that acetic acid-aided HTC of woody biomass was more suitable than NaOH for producing hydrochar pellets for use as a biofuel. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial grass that has been selected as a candidate bioenergy crop for USA in the early 80s, while the research in Europe started a decade later. A long-term study on switchgrass had been carried out (1998–2015) on a marginal area in Greece comparing five varieties (having lowland or upland ecotype) at increasing nitrogen fertilization rates (0, 75 and 150 kg N ha−1). Due to the successful establishment of the plantation quite satisfactory yields were recorded even at the establishment year (8.9 Mg DM ha−1) and the ceiling yields were recorded in the 2nd year and came up to 20 Mg DM ha−1. The under study lowland varieties (Alamo, Kanlow and Pangburn) were more productive compared to the upland varieties (Blackwell and CIR) with mean dry yields 12.37 and 11.39 Mg ha−1, respectively and showed higher resistance to lodging. Among the five under study varieties, Alamo was the best performing giving an average yield of 12.7 Mg DM ha−1, averaged over all treatments and years, while CIR was the least performing producing a corresponding average yield of 10.8 Mg DM ha−1. From the fourth growing season and onwards significantly higher yields were recorded under increasing N fertilization up to 150 kg N ha−1 with an average yield of 13.9 Mg DM ha−1 (150 kg N/ha) over all varieties and years. The corresponding yields for the other two tested nitrogen rates (0 and 75 kg N/ha) were 10.31 and 11.69 Mg DM ha−1, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the environmental load of a prospective local bioethanol (EtOH) production system in Southern Italy by using lignocellulosic Fiber sorghum (FS) feedstock. A two steps analysis was carried out considering: (i) a “cradle-to-farm gate” LCA to investigate thoroughly the FS cultivation on hilly marginal land and (ii) a “cradle-to-wheels” system boundary encompassing the environmental pressure of the whole EtOH supply-use chain. Primary data related to lignocellulosic biomass production were combined with experimental feedstock conversion processes through advanced second generation technology. The purpose was the evaluation of the environmental performance of different EtOH-gasoline mixtures in midsize passenger cars: E10 (10% of EtOH and 90% of gasoline) and E85 (85% of EtOH and 15% of gasoline). N fertilization appeared as the prevailing contributor of the crop phase. The “cradle-to-wheels” results concerning E10 passenger car disclosed that the main hotspots were represented by the input of low sulphur petrol (66%) and the linked tailpipe emissions (15%), for almost all the impact categories. Otherwise, for E85 flex-fuel vehicle, the major drivers were represented by the feedstock production (46%) and the imported electricity used in the conversion facility (18%). The FS EtOH blends entailed potential environmental benefits compared with the fossil counterpart (gasoline) for climate change, ozone and fossil depletions. Otherwise, they evidenced a worse profile in terms of acidification, eutrophication and particulate matter formation. Within the context of a the prospective territorial bio-refinery network, the comparison of the annual FS bioethanol based systems with similar EtOH scenarios from giant reed perennial crops highlighted: (i) the importance to optimize the N-management for FS feedstock cultivation and (ii) the need to increase the use of the renewable energy carriers along the industrial conversion pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluates the environmental impacts of biorefinery products using consequential (CLCA) and attributional (ALCA) life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches. Within ALCA, economic allocation method was used to distribute impacts among the main products and the coproducts, whereas within the CLCA system expansion was adopted to avoid allocation. The study seeks to answer the questions (i) what is the environmental impacts of process integration?, and (ii) do CLCA and ALCA lead to different conclusions when applied to biorefinery?. Three biorefinery systems were evaluated and compared: a standalone system producing bioethanol from winter wheat-straw (system A), a standalone system producing biobased lactic acid from alfalfa (system B), and an integrated biorefinery system (system C) combining the two standalone systems and producing both bioethanol and lactic acid. The synergy of the integration was the exchange of useful energy necessary for biomass processing in the two standalone systems. The systems were compared against a common reference flow: “1 MJEtOH + 1 kgLA”, which was set on the basis of products delivered by the system C. Function of the reference flow was to provide service of both fuel (bioethanol) at 99.9% concentration (wt. basis) and biochemical (biobased lactic acid) in food industries at 90% purity; both products delivered at biorefinery gate. The environmental impacts of interest were global warming potential (GWP100), eutrophication potential (EP), non-renewable energy (NRE) use and the agricultural land occupation (ALO). Regardless of the LCA approach adopted, system C performed better in most of the impact categories than both standalone systems. The process wise contribution to the obtained environmental impacts also showed similar impact pattern in both approaches. The study also highlighted that the recirculation of intermediate materials, e.g. C5 sugar to boost bioethanol yield and that the use of residual streams in the energy conversion were beneficial for optimizing the system performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major practical limitation of the logistics of cellulosic feedstocks, such as corn stover, for use in biorefineries is their low bulk density. This could be improved by densifying feedstock through methods like baling and pelletization, which also have environmental footprint. Thus, this study assessed the environmental impacts of three potential corn stover feedstock supply scenarios incorporating baling and pelletization for a cellulosic biorefinery of 114 million liters per year capacity in the U.S. Midwest. Scenarios included feedstocks transported in bale and pellet formats with and without storage at distributed storage and processing sites. For the three feedstock supply scenarios, the estimated ranges of global warming potential, acidification potential and resource depletion environmental impacts per ton of delivered biomass (at 0% moisture content) were 20–73 kg carbon dioxide equivalent, 0.1–0.2 kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, and 36–52 MJ surplus, respectively, with pelletization process contributing to higher emissions. For supply system with pellets, electricity required for pellet production was the major contributor to the overall emissions. For the geographic locations with higher share of renewable energy mix in the electricity grid (e.g., Western Electricity Coordinating Council grid, Norway), the emissions from all three scenarios were close. With technology advancement in future, larger capacity biorefineries with increased biomass supply area and transportation distance are possible. In such case, enhanced densification, such as pelletization, could further lower the environmental impacts of biomass feedstock supply systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2), as implemented, has introduced uncertainty into US ethanol producers and the supporting commodity market. First, the fixed mandate for what is mainly cornstarch-based ethanol has increased feedstock price volatility and exerts a general effect across the agricultural sector. Second, the large discrepancy between the original Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) intentions and the actual RFS2 implementation for some fuel classes has increased the investment uncertainty facing investors in biofuel production, distribution, and consumption. Here we discuss and analyze the sources of uncertainty and evaluate the effect of potential RFS2 adjustments as they influence these uncertainties. This includes the use of a flexible, production dependent mandate on corn starch ethanol. We find that a flexible mandate on cornstarch ethanol relaxed during drought could significantly reduce commodity price spikes and alleviate the decline of livestock production in cases of feedstock production shortfalls, but it would increase the risk for ethanol investors. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Some eukaryotes are able to gain access to well-protected carbon sources in plant biomass by exploiting microorganisms in the environment or harbored in their digestive system. One is the land pulmonate Arion ater, which takes advantage of a gut microbial consortium that can break down the widely available, but difficult to digest, carbohydrate polymers in lignocellulose, enabling them to digest a broad range of fresh and partially degraded plant material efficiently. This ability is considered one of the major factors that have enabled A. ater to become one of the most widespread plant pest species in Western Europe and North America. Using metagenomic techniques we have characterized the bacterial diversity and functional capability of the gut microbiome of this notorious agricultural pest. Analysis of gut metagenomic community sequences identified abundant populations of known lignocellulose-degrading bacteria, along with well-characterized bacterial plant pathogens. This also revealed a repertoire of more than 3,383 carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) including multiple enzymes associated with lignin degradation, demonstrating a microbial consortium capable of degradation of all components of lignocellulose. This would allow A. ater to make extensive use of plant biomass as a source of nutrients through exploitation of the enzymatic capabilities of the gut microbial consortia. From this metagenome assembly we also demonstrate the successful amplification of multiple predicted gene sequences from metagenomic DNA subjected to whole genome amplification and expression of functional proteins, facilitating the low cost acquisition and biochemical testing of the many thousands of novel genes identified in metagenomics studies. These findings demonstrate the importance of studying Gastropod microbial communities. Firstly, with respect to understanding links between feeding and evolutionary success and, secondly, as sources of novel enzymes with biotechnological potential, such as, CAZYmes that could be used in the production of biofuel. © 2017 Joynson, Pritchard, Osemwekha and Ferry.

AB  - Brazil plays a major role in the global biofuel economy as the world's second largest producer and consumer and the largest exporter of ethanol. Its demand is expected to significantly increase in coming years, largely driven by national and international carbon mitigation targets. However, biofuel crops require significant amounts of water and land resources that could otherwise be used for the production of food, urban water supply, or energy generation. Given Brazil's uneven spatial distribution of water resources among regions, a potential expansion of ethanol production will need to take into account regional or local water availability, as an increased water demand for irrigation would put further pressure on already water-scarce regions and compete with other users. By applying an environmentally extended multiregional input-output (MRIO) approach, we uncover the scarce water footprint and the interregional virtual water flows associated with sugarcane-derived biofuel production driven by domestic final consumption and international exports in 27 states in Brazil. Our results show that bio-ethanol is responsible for about one third of the total sugarcane water footprint besides sugar and other processed food production. We found that richer states such as São Paulo benefit by accruing a higher share of economic value added from exporting ethanol as part of global value chains while increasing water stress in poorer states through interregional trade. We also found that, in comparison with other crops, sugarcane has a comparative advantage when rainfed while showing a comparative disadvantage as an irrigated crop; a tradeoff to be considered when planning irrigation infrastructure and bioethanol production expansion. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The production of alternative fuels via the solar thermochemical pathway has the potential to provide supply security and to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. H2O and CO2 are converted to liquid hydrocarbon fuels using concentrated solar energy mediated by redox reactions of a metal oxide. Because attractive production locations are in arid regions, the water footprint and the land requirement of this fuel production pathway are analyzed. The water footprint consists of 7.4 liters per liter of jet fuel of direct demand on-site and 42.4 liters per liter of jet fuel of indirect demand, where the dominant contributions are the mining of the rare earth oxide ceria, the manufacturing of the solar concentration infrastructure, and the cleaning of the mirrors. The area-specific productivity is found to be 33-»362 liters per hectare per year of jet fuel equivalents, where the land coverage is mainly due to the concentration of solar energy for heat and electricity. The water footprint and the land requirement of the solar thermochemical fuel pathway are larger than the best power-to-liquid pathways but an order of magnitude lower than the best biomass-to-liquid pathways. For the production of solar thermochemical fuels arid regions are best-suited, and for biofuels regions of a moderate and humid climate. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuels present an opportunity to meet a significant fraction of liquid transportation fuel demand with renewable, low-carbon alternatives. Certain ionic liquids (ILs) have proven effective at facilitating hydrolysis of lignocellulose to produce fermentable sugars with high yields. Although their negligible vapor pressure and low flammability make ILs attractive solvents at the point of use, their life-cycle environmental impacts have not been investigated in the context of cellulosic biorefineries. This study provides the first life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and water use inventory for biofuels produced using IL pretreatment. We explore two corn stover-to-ethanol process configurations: the conventional water-wash (WW) route and the more recently developed integrated high gravity (iHG) route, which eliminates washing steps after pretreatment. Our results are based on the use of a representative IL, cholinium lysinate ([Ch][Lys]). We find that the WW process results in unacceptably high GHG emissions. The iHG process has the potential to reduce GHG emissions per megajoule of fuel by ∼45% relative to gasoline if [Ch][Lys] is used. Use of a protic IL with comparable performance to [Ch][Lys] could achieve GHG reductions up to 70-85%. The water intensities of the WW and iHG processes are both comparable to those of other cellulosic biofuel technologies. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The increasing biofuel production from agricultural crops has been suggested to cause indirect land use change (iLUC). This increases interest in biofuel feedstocks that qualify as iLUC-free: (1) residues without a market, (2) crops from previously unused arable land, (3) additional crops and (4) biomass from intensified production. In the present study, biofuel potential from such feedstocks was quantified for Sweden and compared against the predicted biofuel demand from agricultural resources in 2030. The results indicate that straw (category 1) could cover up to 37% of future biofuel demand. Grass leys from intensified production (category 4), set-aside and abandoned land (category 2) and excess grass silage (category 1) could cover up to 79%. Intermediate and ecological focus area crops (category 3) could contribute up to 21%. To realize the biofuel targets, a high implementation rate of additional iLUC-free feedstock is needed. Future studies need to investigate impacts of low-iLUC policies. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In Brazil, the main biofuel crop is sugarcane, and with its rapid expansion, there is much debate about what land uses and land covers it is replacing, and what are the associated environmental and social impacts. Some argue sugarcane is mainly replacing cattle pasture, thus having minimal impacts on native vegetation and small-scale family farming. In contrast, others claim sugarcane is replacing cropland traditionally under soybeans, rice, beans, and corn. Thus, food security is negatively affected and small-scale family farming livelihoods and culture are threatened. This is a proof-of-concept paper illustrating methods contributing toward the resolution of such debates. First we map land use and cover change in areas undergoing sugarcane expansion using satellite data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer); second, we test the hypothesis that sugarcane is replacing traditional annual crops using intensity analysis, via a case study of land change in the municipality of Pedro Afonso, Tocantins in northern Brazil between the 2008–2013 crop years. Maps matched reference data with overall agreements between 87–91%. Intensity analysis confirmed sugarcane is replacing annual crops much more than cattle pasture and other land uses and covers, pointing to particular economic and social processes driving land change. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The expansion of sugarcane production in the Brazilian Cerrado has resulted in indirect land use change (ILUC), occurring when displaced land uses in one location are reallocated to another. Studies, however, usually identify ILUC at the regional or national level far from the original area of a displaced land use. This study examines the occurrence of ILUC due to sugarcane expansion for ethanol production at the farm level in the Brazilian Cerrado. It fills a gap in the literature by examining socioeconomic, policy and farm-level factors that influence ILUC at the farm level in the Brazilian Cerrado using face-to-face enumerated surveys. Results indicate that ILUC did occur at the farm (producer) scale and farmers who undertook ILUC intensified agricultural production on their farms. Results inform policymakers on how the intensification of agricultural practices may make it potentially difficult to keep protected lands out of production, reducing the environmental benefits from sugarcane-based biofuel production. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Agro-industries have been widely acknowledged as a way to kick-start agricultural development in developing regions. A number of pro-poor organizations promote production models that include the engagement of smallholder farmers as potential enablers for employment generation, economic development and livelihood improvements. Initiatives such as this appear in Sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on food and bioenergy crops. However, the large-scale production of cash crops, such as sugarcane, also raises concerns. A critical aspect is the impact of land-use on food security, particularly if local communities are constrained in cultivating traditional crops. In this paper, we explore the relationship between a sugarcane mill and smallholder farmers in Maputo province, Mozambique. Our main goal was to investigate some key characteristics of sugarcane outgrower schemes and the implications for sustainable local development. We also complemented local findings with lessons learnt from other regions, such as Brazil. In August 2015, a field assessment examined the interplay between the sugarcane industry and local communities in southern Mozambique. We interviewed three smallholders' associations of sugarcane producers in Xinavane, together with researchers, non-governmental organizations and agricultural government bodies. Our assessment finds that the impacts of sugarcane remain somewhat unclear. Government bodies and some of the consulted NGOs claim benefits, both on income and local food production. However, these benefits are less evident to farmers. While they acknowledge labour and social services as opportunities brought by the sugar mill, progress on capacity building and irrigated areas for food production fall short of expectations. Moreover, there is also tension as to the sugarcane outgrower contract. Incomplete information seems to undermine trust from farmers who become increasingly sceptical of their contracts with the sugarcane mill, especially the payment system. Transparency, coupled with more effective food production strategies, are decisive to ensure sustainable agroindustrial development along with poverty reduction. © 2016 Informa Plc.

AB  - Drawing on the literature on the market and normative power of the EU, we document and explain the limited success of the EU in transferring its environmental standards with respect to sustainable biofuels governance to the world's two largest biofuels producers – the US and Brazil – and to two international standard setting organizations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP). Our explanation highlights four factors: first, the extent to which EU strategies to strengthen its market power can undermine its normative power; second, the limits to EU policy influence posed by other actors' use of their own market and normative power resources; third, the diminished influence of a late policy-mover; and fourth, the difficulty of establishing normative leadership in a policy field subject to epistemic contestation. © 2017 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) of a four-stage biorefinery concept, coined H-M-Z-S, that converts 1 t of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) into bioenergy and bioproducts was performed in order to determine whether it could be an alternative to common disposal of OFMSW in landfills in the Mexican reality. The OFMSW is first fermented for hydrogen production, then the fermentates are distributed 40 % to the methane production, 40 % to enzyme production, and 20 % to the saccharification stage. From hydrogen and methane, up to 267 MJ and 204 kWh of gross heat and electricity were produced. The biorefinery proved to be self-sustainable in terms of power (95 kWh net power), but it presented a deficit of energy for heating services (−155 MJ), which was partially alleviated by digesting the wastes from the bioproducts stages (−84 MJ). Compared to landfill, biorefinery showed lower environmental impacts in global warming (down to −128 kg CO2-eq), ozone layer depletion (2.96 × 10-6 kg CFC11-eq), and photochemical oxidation potentials (0.011 kg C2H4-eq). The landfarming of the digestates increased significantly the eutrophication impacts, up to 20 % below the eutrophication from landfilling (1.425 kg PO4-eq). These results suggest that H-M-Z-S biorefinery could be an attractive alternative compared to conventional landfilling for the management of municipal solid wastes, although new alternatives and uses of co-products and wastes should be explored and tested. Moreover, the biorefinery system would benefit from the integration into the market chain of the bioproducts, i.e., enzymes and hydrolysates among others. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The application of biocatalysts in the transesterification process of triglycerides (TG) allows integrating the glycerol in the form of monoglyceride (MG), sharply increasing the yield and the environmental sustainability of the conventional biodiesel production process. This is known as Ecodiesel. To overcome the inconvenient of the high cost of the currently employed highly purified commercial enzymes, the use of scarcely purified extracts obtained from standard strains of the same species of commercial lipases currently applied in this process is being investigated. Thus, Candida antarctica type B (CALB) was chosen to determine the optimal conditions of culture of this yeast. The standard strain was obtained from the Spanish Type Microbial Cultures Collection (CECT) and has been used to carry out several studies to elucidate its optimum growth conditions. Through a process of lyophilization with prior dialysis of the liquid cultures, the enzymatic extracts were obtained. The different obtained cultures have been applied as biocatalysts in the 1,3-selective transesterification reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol to obtain Ecodiesel (FAEE + MG). Selectivity and reaction yields were obtained by gas chromatography. Acceptable yields are obtained during the reaction time as well as in successive reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of using these CALB enzymatic extracts as biocatalysts. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - New data on biogas production and treatment of cattle wastewater were registered using an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket-anaerobic filter hybrid reactor under mesophilic temperature conditions (37°C). The reactor was operated in semi-continuous mode with 6, 5, 3, and 2 day hydraulic retention times and 3.8, 4.6, 7.0, and 10.8 kg COD/cu m-d organic loading rates. Biogas volumes of 0.6-0.8 cu m/cu m-d and 1.2-1.4 cu m/cu m-d, with CH4 concentrations between 69% and 75%, were obtained. The removal of organic matter with 60%-81% (CODt) and 51%-75% (CODs) allowed 0.155-0.183 cu m CH4/kg CODt CH4 yields and 0.401-0.513 cu m CH4/kg CODs to be obtained. Volatile solids (VS) were removed in 34% to 69%, with corresponding CH4 yields of 0.27 to 0.42 cu m CH4/kg VSremoved. The good performance of the novel hybrid reactor was demonstrated by biogas outputs higher than previously reported, along with the quality of the gas obtained in the various experimental phases. The hybrid reactor displays comparative advantages, particularly in relation to conventional complete mixture units, considering economic factors, e.g., energy consumption, reactor volume, and installation area.

AB  - How to select locations for biofuel production is still a critical consideration for balance of crop and biofuel productions as well as of energy consumption and environmental conservation. Biofuels are widely produced all over the world, but this practice in China is still at the initial stage. Based on China's current stage on food security and changing biofuel demands, this paper selected agro-environmental and socio-economic factors of biofuel production, and simulated and spatially allocated areas suited for biofuel production under the two scenarios of planning-oriented scenario (PoS) and biofuel-oriented scenario (BoS) by the target year 2020. It also estimated biofuel production potentials and zones across China's provinces. The results show that land suited for biofuel production is primarily located in Northwestern, Northern, Northeastern, Central and Southwestern China, with relatively good agro-environmental conditions and medium population density, but also lower competition with crop production, aiming at facilitating governmental policy-making and multi-purpose allocation of land. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A β-xylosidase gene, xyl43C, from Clostridium clariflavum was heterogeneously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Xyl43C showed strong activity toward xylobiose, with specific activity of 76.6 U/mg and Km of 4.97 mM. The optimal pH and temperature of Xyl43C were pH 6.0 and 60 °C, respectively. Xyl43C retained 94.4% activity after incubation at 55 °C for 1 h, and 75.4% at 60 °C for 1 h. It also showed xylose tolerance with IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of approximately 100 mM. It nearly completely hydrolyzed 2 g/L of xylobiose at enzyme load of 2.51 mg/g xylobiose within 30 min and converted 40 g/L of corncob xylan into xylose at enzyme load of 1.48 mg/g xylan, with a yield of 60.9%. In conclusion, Xyl43C is an efficient xylose-tolerant β-xylosidase, with promising application potential in saccharification of xylan in biofuels industry.

AB  - There is growing interest in microalgal biotechnologies for biofuel production and nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment. Often overlooked is the exudation of extracellular organic matter (EOM) in algal reactors and its influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics and photochemical processes. This study reports photosensitized production of excited triplet state dissolved organic matter (3DOM∗), hydroxyl radicals (HO), and singlet oxygen (1O2) under simulated sunlight in photobioreactor extracellular matrices. Reactive species were measured in irradiated supernatant from batch cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii throughout lag (1.2-1.9 mg-C L-1 as DOCEOM), exponential (1.9-8.1 mg-C L-1), early stationary (carbon accumulation; 8.1-21.4 mg-C L-1), and late stationary (21.4-108 mg-C L-1) growth phases, and in solutions amended with Suwannee river natural organic matter (SRNOM) as a benchmark. DOCEOM represented 1.0-8.6% of fixed carbon (cellular organic carbon + EOM) across algal phases of growth. EOM solutions exhibited lower light absorption and reactive species production than SRNOM solutions per mg-C L-1. However, photosensitized 3DOM∗ quantum yield coefficients in EOM solutions during all growth phases and HO apparent quantum yields observed during exponential and early stationary phases were greater than in SRNOM solutions. Additionally, 1O2 apparent quantum yields in EOM solutions during exponential and late stationary phases were similar to SRNOM solutions. EOM solutions also photoproduced reactive species at levels comparable to natural waters. These results suggest sensitized photochemical processes involving EOM and growth medium constituents may contribute to DOM bleaching and mineralization, nutrient cycling, pathogen inactivation, and fate of trace organic contaminants in engineered algal systems.

AB  - The mandate by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to increase renewable fuel production in the USA has resulted in extensive research into the sustainability of perennial bioenergy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus× giganteus). Perennial grassland crops have been shown to support greater aboveground biodiversity and ecosystem function than annual crops. However, management considerations, such as what crop to plant or whether to use fertilizer, may alter belowground diversity and ecosystem functioning associated with these grasslands as well. In this study, we compared crop type (switchgrass or miscanthus) and nitrogen fertilization effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) and soil nematode abundance, activity, and diversity in a long-term experiment. We quantified AMF root colonization, AMF extra-radical hyphal length, soil glomalin concentrations, AMF richness and diversity, plant-parasitic nematode abundance, and nematode family richness and diversity in each treatment. Mycorrhizal activity and diversity were higher with switchgrass than with miscanthus, leading to higher potential soil carbon contributions via increased hyphal growth and glomalin production. Plant-parasitic nematode (PPN) abundance was 2.3 × higher in miscanthus plots compared to switchgrass, mostly due to increases in dagger nematodes (Xiphinema). The higher PPN abundance in miscanthus may be a consequence of lower AMF in this species, as AMF can provide protection against PPN through a variety of mechanisms. Nitrogen fertilization had minor negative effects on AMF and nematode diversity associated with these crops. Overall, we found that crop type and fertilizer application associated with perennial bioenergy cropping systems can have detectable effects on the diversity and composition of soil communities, which may have important consequences for the ecosystem services provided by these systems. © 2017 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Green macroalgae represent an attractive source of renewable carbon. Conversion of green algal biomass to useful products requires depolymerisation of the cell wall polysaccharide ulvan. The enzymatic depolymerisation of ulvan is not fully understood and only few enzymes involved in this process have been reported. In this study the first model for ulvan depolymerisation and utilization was built based on a polysaccharide utilization locus from the alga-associated flavobacterium Formosa agariphila. It was also shown that F. agariphila, is able to grow using biomass from the green macroalga Ulva lactuca as its sole carbon source, and enzymes with ulvanase activity are induced by the presence of algal biomass in the culture medium. Enzymes for ulvan depolymerisation from F. agariphila, including an ulvan lyase, an unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, a xylosidase and two rhamnosidases, were cloned using the PaperClip DNA assembly method and expressed in active form in Escherichia coli. These results represent a first step for the design of a microorganism capable of utilizing green macroalgal biomass for the production of biofuels and other valuable bio-products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study provides a comparative assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when converting a reclaimed minesoil that was previously under meadow to miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and maize (Zea mays L.) land uses in Ohio, USA. Additionally, effluent from an anaerobic digester at rates of 0, 75, 150, and 225 kg N ha−1 rates was also assessed for C and nutrient fertilization. Results from the study show that land use conversion to maize had the highest net release of GHG equivalent of 6·6 Mg CO2equ ha−1 y−1, on average, across effluent application rates. Under miscanthus land use with no and high effluent application rates, net GHG equivalent on average was 4·3 Mg CO2equ ha−1 y−1, which was larger when compared with that under the meadow land use (1·6 Mg CO2equ ha−1 y−1). Miscanthus land use under medium rates of effluent application had similar net GHG equivalent (7·1 Mg CO2equ ha−1 y−1) to the maize land use. The application of effluent did increase CO2–C and N2O–N emissions; but increases in above-ground–below-ground biomass production (1·6 Mg C ha−1) in the meadow land use and C input from effluent retained in the soil in the miscanthus and maize land uses offset most of the effluent-induced GHG equivalent emissions. Contribution of cumulative N2O–N to GHG equivalent emissions in general was 11% when no effluent was applied and 22% when effluent was applied across land uses. Findings from this study show that land use changes from antecedent meadow to maize and miscanthus during the first year of establishment would result in net increase of GHG emissions.

AB  - Xylose is the second most abundant sugar derived from lignocellulose; it is considered less desirable than glucose for fermentation, and strategies that specifically increase xylose utilization in wild-type cells are goals for biofuel production. Xylose consumption, butanol production, and hydrogen production increased in both Clostridium beijerinckii and a novel solventogenic bacterium (strain DC-1) when anthraquinone-2,6,-disulfonate (AQDS) or riboflavin were used as redox mediators to transfer electrons to poorly crystalline Fe(OH)3 as an extracellular electron sink. Strain DC-1 was most closely related to Rhizobiales bacterium Mfc52 based on 95% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, which demonstrates that this response is not limited to a single genus of xylose-fermenting bacteria. Xylose utilization and butanol production were negligible in control incubations containing cells plus 3% (w/v) xylose alone during a 10-day batch fermentation, for both strains tested (n-butanol titers of 0.05 g L−1). Micromolar concentrations of AQDS and riboflavin were added as electron shuttling compounds with poorly crystalline Fe(OH)3 as an insoluble electron acceptor, and respective n-butanol titers increased to 6.35 and 7.46 g L−1. Increases in xylose consumption for the iron treatments were relatively high, from less than 0.49 g L−1 (xylose alone, no iron or electron shuttling molecules) to 25.98 and 29.15 g L−1 for the AQDS and riboflavin treatments, respectively. Hydrogen production was also 3.68 times greater for the AQDS treatment and 5.27 greater for the riboflavin treatment relative to controls. Strain DC-1 data were similar, again indicating that the effects are not specific to the genus Clostridium. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Purpose: Renewable energy sources, particularly biofuels, are being promoted as possible solutions to address global warming and the depletion of petroleum resources. In this context, biodiesel is a solution to the growing demand for renewable fuels. Beef tallow is the second leading raw material after soybean oil used in biodiesel production in Brazil. Evaluating and addressing the environmental impacts of beef tallow biodiesel are of great importance for its life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Methods: Inventory data on tallow and biodiesel production were collected from the literature and from a primary data source provided by a Brazilian biodiesel plant. The modeled system represents the Brazilian reality for the 2005–2015 decade. Subsequently, the environmental impacts of beef tallow biodiesel production were characterized for a selection of environmental impact indicators: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and water footprint (assessed based on blue water use (BWU) and blue water consumption (BWC) indicators). From the characterization of these environmental burdens, the main sources of environmental impact were evaluated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify the influence of key parameters (emission factor, energy consumption, and prices) on changes in the environmental load of beef tallow biodiesel. Results and discussion: Carbon flux results indicate that beef tallow biodiesel production acts as a carbon source. Namely, pasture carbon uptake (91% of all carbon input) is lower than combined biogenic and fossil CO2 emissions, which are controlled by cattle enteric fermentation as methane (72%) and by thermal energy processes (25%). Otherwise, thermal energy production accounts for 80% of total AP emissions, and cattle urine and manure are responsible for 70% of total EP emissions. The BWC and BWU water footprints of the whole process are controlled by electricity usage, which was greater than 90% for each indicator due to the high proportion of total energy (70%) derived from hydropower in Brazil. The environmental burden from transportation is minimal compared to other processes. Tallow biodiesel GWP can be improved if the carbon uptake potential from grass and low fertilizer utilization are accurately considered, as observed in the sensitivity analysis. For each MJ of beef tallow biodiesel produced, 4.6 g of CO2 is released to the atmosphere. Conclusions: Methane emissions, mainly due to cattle enteric fermentation, and thermal energy processes at the industrial units were the main sources of environmental GWP, AP, and EP impacts. Otherwise, water footprint indicators were associated with the high proportion of total energy derived from hydropower in Brazil. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between biofuel consumption, forest biodiversity, and a set of national scale indicators of per capita income, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, trade openness, and population density with a panel data of 12 biofuels consuming countries for a period of 2000 to 2013. The study used Global Environmental Facility (GEF) biodiversity benefits index and forest biodiversity index in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework. The results confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship between GEF biodiversity index and per capita income, while there is flat/no relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth, and between forest biodiversity and economic growth models. FDI inflows and trade openness both reduce carbon emissions while population density and biofuel consumption increase carbon emissions and decrease GEF biodiversity index. Trade openness supports to increases GEF biodiversity index while it decreases forest biodiversity index and biofuel consumption in a region. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The green macroalgal biomass corresponds to an emerging and promising biofuel feedstock. Their biological pretreatment and energetic conversion to biomethane were investigated and the enhancement of biogas production using the solid-state fermentation (SSF) as an eco-friendly innovative pretreatment of Ulva sp. was precisely assessed. Compared to conventional acid and alkali pretreatments, the highest methane potential of 153 ± 3 mL CH4 g− 1VS with an anaerobic biodegradability of 57% was obtained using SSF pretreatment with a locally isolated Aspergillus fumigatus SL1 strain. It was 132 ± 2 mL CH4 g− 1VS for raw Ulva sp. with biodegradability of 49%. Acid pretreatment with 4% HCl at 150 °C had a negative effect on Ulva sp.'s methane potential while alkali pretreatment with 4% NaOH at 20 °C showed a significant effect. The proposed SSF-based pretreatment enhanced therefore biogas production of 21% and permitted an eco-friendly valorization of large amounts of abundant macroalgae. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The export of wood pellets from the southeastern United States (USA) has grown significantly in recent years, following rising demand from Europe. Increased wood pellet demand could lead to spatially variable changes in timberland management and area in the USA. This study presents an assessment of the impacts of increasing wood pellet demand (an additional 11.6 Mt by 2030) on land-use dynamics, taking into account developments in other wood product markets as well as expected changes in other land uses. An economic model for the forest sector of the southeastern USA (SRTS) was linked to a land-use change model (PLUC) to identify potential locations of land-use change following scenarios of demand for pellets and other wood products. Projections show that in the absence of additional demand for wood pellets, natural timberland area is projected to decline by 450–15 000 km2 by 2030, mainly through urbanization and pine plantation establishment. Under the high wood pellet demand scenario, more (2000–7500 km2) natural timberland area is retained and more (8000–20 000 km2) pine plantation is established. Shifts from natural timberland to pine plantation occur predominantly in the Atlantic coastal region. Future work will assess the impact of projected transitions in natural timberland and pine plantations on biodiversity and carbon storage. This modeling framework can be applied for multiple scenarios and land-use projections to identify locations of timberland area changes for the whole southeastern USA, thereby informing the debate about potential impacts of wood pellet demand on land-use dynamics and environmental services. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Use of biofuel ashes for the afforestation of cutaway peatlands helps to balance the content of nutrients in peat substrate, which improves the survival of planted seedlings and increases significantly bio-production. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fertilization with alkaline ashes on the above- and belowground biomass formation of four-year-old Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and five-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on a cutaway peatland. Five treatments were established: three mixtures with different proportions of wood ash (10–15 t ha−1) and oil shale ash (10–15 t ha−1), pure oil shale ash (10 t ha−1) and control (unfertilized plot). Three years after fertilization with ashes the content of phosphorus was up to 150 times and that of potassium 23 times higher in the peat substrate treated with ashes than on the control plot. The growth and biomass formation varied among treatments and depends strongly on the content of P and K in the growth substrate. The best results were observed on plots of Silver birch treated with mixed ashes; there the seedlings annual height increment was 2–3 times (first year), 5–7 times (second year) and 8–9 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of mixed ashes on the annual height increment of Scots pine was weaker: the annual height increment was 1.4 times (first year), 3 times (second year) and 5 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of pure oil shale ash on the growth and biomass formation of trees was the smallest. The greatest root collar diameter increment of birch and pine was observed on the third vegetation period. Roots formed the largest part of the total Silver birch biomass, followed by stem, branches and leaves. At the end of the third year after treatment the largest part of the biomass of Scots pine was allocated to the needles, followed by roots, stem and branches. The biomass and biomass production were the greatest on the plots treated with mixed ashes, especially on the WA15+OSA10 and WA15+OSA10 treatments. The total bio-productivity of birch was until 4 times intense than in the case of pine. The average current annual biomass production of Silver birch and Scots pine stands were respectively 0.17–0.21 t ha−1 and 0.3–0.56 t ha−1 (mixed ashes), 0.04 t ha−1 and 0.16 t ha−1 (OSA10) and 0.02 t ha−1 (control). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Samples were collected every 90 days for 15 months at eight farms, four pig, and four dairy farms, four of them having a biogas plant. Moreover, to evaluate storage effects on samples, 20 l of manure and slurry taken at each farm (digested manure only in farms with a biogas plant) were stored in a controlled climatic chamber at 18 °C, for 6 months. The bacterial load and the chemical-physical characteristics of excreta were evaluated at each sampling time, stored slurry, and manure were sampled and analyzed every 2 months. A high variability of the concentration of bacteria in the different excreta types was observed during the experiment, mainly depending on the type and time of treatment. No sample revealed either the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 or of Salmonella, usually linked to the temporary rearing of infected animals in facilities. Anaerobic digestion and storage affected in a significant way the reduction of indicator bacteria like lactobacilli, coliforms, and streptococci. Anaerobic digestion lowered coliforms in pig slurry (− 2.80 log, P < 0.05), streptococci in dairy manure (− 2.44 log, P < 0.001) and in pig slurry (− 1.43 log, P < 0.05), and lactobacilli in pig slurry (− 3.03 log, P < 0.05). Storage lowered coliforms and the other indicators counts, in particular in fresh wastes, while clostridia did not show a reduction in concentration. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - While the process of producing ethanol from corn has been well established for over a decade, the process profitability still eludes the industry investors. In particular, uncertainties exist in both the feedstock and the product spot prices. To manage the sophisticated price uncertainty, current practice in industry is to negotiate long-term fixed rate prices with both the suppliers of the feedstock and the purchasers of the product. Although this practice completely eliminates the price uncertainty and simplifies production decisions, it entails the potential loss of profit. Stochastic programming methods provide a framework which takes into account the uncertainties and determines the decisions that are optimal under this uncertain future. Therefore, in this study, a stochastic optimization model is presented to determine the weekly production level and swap hedging portfolios over a year's planning horizon with the objective of maximizing the process profit. The approach is also used in a back-testing perspective to compare the profit obtained from applying the optimal decisions with the negotiated profit derived from using the current practice. This comparison in turn validates the effectiveness of the proposed model framework, in particular during times of high price uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In many countries, the biofuels sector was encouraged to expand its activities supported by public policies incentives, especially to achieve improvements in energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The Brazilian government followed these initiatives and undertook some responsibilities against the international scenario related to climate change. One of the theses commitments concerning actions to reduce the GEE emissions by some 37% by 2020. The Sugarcane Agroecology Zoning provides technical subside to policy makers to direct sugarcane expansion to permitted areas and a sustainable production in Brazil and is considered a guideline to sustainable sugarcane production in Brazil. However, although aiming at a sustainable production, the zoning only considered natural aspects of the country, as soils and climate and an approach that consider all the dimensions of the sustainability is still missing. Hence, this paper aims to propose a framework to evaluate biofuel sustainability to support public policies, especially concerning improvements in Brazilian decision-supporting tools. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., WOSR) is the major oil crop cultivated in Europe. Rapeseed oil is predominantly used for production of biodiesel. The framework of the European Renewable Energy Directive requires that use of biofuels achieves GHG savings of at least 50% compared to use of fossil fuel starting in 2018. However, N2O field emissions are estimated using emission factors that are not specific for the crop and associated with strong uncertainty. N2O field emissions are controlled by N fertilization and dominate the GHG balance of WOSR cropping due to the high global warming potential of N2O. Thus, field experiments were conducted to increase the data basis and subsequently derive a new WOSR-specific emission factor. N2O emissions and crop yields were monitored for three years over a range of N fertilization intensities at five study sites representative of German WOSR production. N2O fluxes exhibited the typical high spatial and temporal variability in dependence on soil texture, weather and nitrogen availability. The annual N2O emissions ranged between 0.24 kg and 5.48 kg N2O-N ha−1 a−1. N fertilization increased N2O emissions, particularly with the highest N treatment (240 kg N ha−1). Oil yield increased up to a fertilizer amount of 120 kg N ha−1, higher N-doses increased grain yield but decreased oil concentrations in the seeds. Consequently oil yield remained constant at higher N fertilization. Since, yield-related emission also increased exponentially with N surpluses, there is potential for reduction of the N fertilizer rate, which offers perspectives for the mitigation of GHG emissions. Our measurements double the published data basis of annual N2O flux measurements in WOSR. Based on this extended dataset we modeled the relationship between N2O emissions and fertilizer N input using an exponential model. The corresponding new N2O emission factor was 0.6% of applied fertilizer N for a common N fertilizer amount under best management practice in WOSR production (200 kg N ha−1 a−1). This factor is substantially lower than the linear IPCC Tier 1 factor (EF1) of 1.0% and other models that have been proposed. © 2017

AB  - To manage upland oak forests across the central and southern Appalachian mountain and plateau regions, prescribed fire is applied more frequently and across larger areas than in the recent past. The often stated objective is to reduce fuels, but there is a paucity of information on the impacts of repeated burning on fuels, including woody materials and the soil organic layer. These are complex components of forest ecosystems with significant impacts on nutrient and carbon cycling, forest successional dynamics, and soil protection from loss via erosion. Thus, understanding fuel bed response to prescribed fire is essential for predicting future forest function. Using study sites distributed across a range of landscape positions in the Daniel Boone National Forest on the Cumberland Plateau of eastern Kentucky, we examined changes to the fuel bed over six years in response to a single fire (burned once in six years), repeated fire (burned four times in six years), and fire-excluded treatments to determine prescribed fire impacts on fuel loads and mineral soil exposure. Prior to burning, fuel loads were generally similar among landscape positions, although the duff layer was lowest on sub-mesic and greatest on sub-xeric positions. A single fire reduced duff depth by 50%, whereas repeated burning led to depth reductions of >60%. Repeated burning also significantly increased mineral soil exposure (25%) compared to single burn and fire-excluded (2–4%) treatments, with the greatest effects on sub-mesic and intermediate landscape positions. Repeated burning significantly reduced fine woody (1-h) fuels, but only after three burns, whereas fine fuel mass on sites burned once was similar to those where fire was excluded. There were no statistically significant effects of burning on large woody fuels (100- and 1000-h fuels). Overall, the primary impact of prescribed fire on the fuel bed was to consume the organic horizon and expose mineral soil, which has the potential to reduce fuel continuity for subsequent burns. Fire behavior in this region is driven primarily by fine fuels (litter and duff) and fuel continuity, both of which recover in relatively short periods of one to several years. Reduction of woody fuels is more intractable under a prescribed fire regime. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use change driven alteration of microbial communities can have implications on belowground C cycling and storage, although our understanding of the interactions between plant C inputs and soil microbes is limited. Using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA's) we profiled the microbial communities under two contrasting UK perennial bioenergy crops, Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow and Miscanthus Giganteus (miscanthus), and used 13C – pulse labelling to investigate how recent carbon (C) assimilates were transferred through plant tissues to soil microbes. Total PLFA's and fungal to bacterial (F:B) ratios were higher under SRC willow (Total PLFA = 47.70 ± 1.66 SE μg PLFA g−1 dry weight soil, F:B = 0.27 ± 0.01 SE) relative to miscanthus (Total PLFA = 30.89 ± 0.73 SE μg PLFA g−1 dry weight soil, F:B = 0.17 ± 0.00 SE). Functional differences in microbial communities were highlighted by contrasting processing of labelled C. SRC willow allocated 44% of total 13C detected into fungal PLFA relative to 9% under miscanthus and 380% more 13C was returned to the atmosphere in soil respiration from SRC willow soil compared to miscanthus. Our findings elucidate the roles that bacteria and fungi play in the turnover of recent plant derived C under these two perennial bioenergy crops, and provide important evidence on the impacts of land use change to bioenergy on microbial community composition. © 2017

AB  - As lifecycle emissions accounting becomes more widely used in policy, it is important to understand how it has been applied. This paper analyses policy-making for two U.S. fuel regulations—the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)—that were pioneering not only in using life cycle assessment (LCA) in performance-based environmental regulations, but especially for including emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC). The case studies in this paper focus, in particular, on the decision to include ILUC in lifecycle emissions accounting. Tracing the development of these policies shows the key role of environmental policy entrepreneurs in advocating for ILUC emissions accounting during policy formulation. Moreover, it highlights a paradox in the use of science: although ILUC policy proponents were motivated by best available research, they were also politically enabled by scientific uncertainty and lack of understanding. Understanding this political dimension of decision-making is valuable for scholars as well as practitioners facing similar decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two energy crops (maize and soybean) were used in the remediation of cadmium-contaminated soils. These crops were used because they are fast growing, have a large biomass and are good sources for bioenergy production. The total accumulation of cadmium in maize and soybean plants was 393.01 and 263.24 μg pot−1, respectively. The rhizosphere bacterial community composition was studied by MiSeq sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequences. The rhizosphere bacteria were divided into 33 major phylogenetic groups according to phyla. The dominant phylogenetic groups included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes. Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and unweighted pair group with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis, we found that the bacterial community was influenced by cadmium addition and bioenergy cropping. Three molecular ecological networks were constructed for the unplanted, soybean- and maize-planted bacterial communities grown in 50 mg kg−1 cadmium-contaminated soils. The results indicated that bioenergy cropping increased the complexity of the bacterial community network as evidenced by a higher total number of nodes, the average geodesic distance (GD), the modularity and a shorter geodesic distance. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the keystone bacteria connecting different co-expressed operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The results showed that bioenergy cropping altered the topological roles of individual OTUs and keystone populations. This is the first study to reveal the effects of bioenergy cropping on microbial interactions in the phytoremediation of cadmium-contaminated soils by network reconstruction. This method can greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of plant-microbe-metal interactions in metal-polluted ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Processing biomass into multifunctional products can contribute to food, feed, and energy security while also mitigating climate change. However, biorefinery products nevertheless impact the environment, and this influence needs to be properly assessed to minimize the burden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is often used to calculate environmental footprints of products, but distributing the burdens among the different biorefinery products is a challenge. A particular complexity arises when the outputs are a combination of energy carrying no mass, and mass carrying no energy, where neither an allocation based on mass nor on energy would be appropriate. A novel hybrid mass–energy (HMEN) allocation scheme for dealing with multifunctionality problems in biorefineries was developed and applied to five biorefinery concepts. The results were compared to results of other allocation methods in LCA. The reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using the biorefinery's biofuels were also quantified. HMEN fairly distributed impacts among biorefinery products and did not change the order of the products in terms of the level of the pollution caused. The allocation factors for HMEN fell between mass and economic allocation factors and were comparable to energy allocation factors. Where the mass or the energy allocation failed to attribute burdens, HMEN addressed this shortcoming by assigning impacts to nonmass or to nonenergy products. Under the partitioning methods and regardless of the feedstock used, bioethanol reduced GHG by 72–98% relative to gasoline. The GHG savings were 196% under the substitution method, but no GHG savings occurred for sugar beet bioethanol under the surplus method. Bioethanol from cellulosic crops had lower energy use and GHG emissions than from sugar beet, regardless of the allocation method used. HMEN solves multifunctional problems in biorefineries and can be applied to other complex refinery systems. LCA practitioners are encouraged to further test this method in other case studies. © 2017 The Authors. Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to assess climate change mitigation potentials when using biomass-based fuels to replace fossil energy under consequential and attributional modelling approaches. The objectives are also to determine policy implications and to recommend the specific contexts suitable for each modelling choice by using specific illustrative cases on biofuels. Methods: Consequential and attributional modelling approaches are chosen for life cycle greenhouse gas emission assessment of several bioenergy options. The assessed functional unit is 1 MJ of energy from molasses-based ethanol, palm-based biodiesel and electricity production from rice straw. The fossil fuel comparators are gasoline (for molasses-based ethanol), diesel (for palm-based biodiesel) and coal and gas (for rice straw). The substituted and substituting product systems are modelled under the global and national markets depending on the market delimitation of each product. Results and discussion: The climate change mitigation potentials when using different approaches are dissimilar, because the affected product systems being included in the analysis are not the same. The palm biodiesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The molasses-based ethanol and rice straw-based electricity may or may not mitigate the climate change, since it depends on the methodological choices as well as the baseline situations of the product systems being investigated. The main characteristics of consequential modelling as additionality and the inclusion of only actually affected processes under market-based mechanisms while those of attributional modelling as specification and attribution/allocation have limitations. The limitations lead to potential risks on unintended and undesirable consequences (for the attributional model), unfairness and sub-optimisation (for the consequential model) in policy recommendations. Conclusions: This research clearly illustrates how certain modelling choices affect the climate change mitigation potentials of biomass-based fuels in comparison with fossil energy. Specific questions and conditions which could be more suitable for each modelling choice are addressed. The attributional modelling is more suitable for national environmental taxation and emission labelling/accounting for import-export, while the consequential modelling is more appropriate for new production development and eco-design. Due to the potential environmental risks arising from the modelling limitations, the consideration of both the widely applied approaches could support decisions more comprehensively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The Ecuadorian Government has, since the end of 2011, promoted an initiative for using pure jatropha oil, derived from the seeds of Jatropha curcas L., to generate electricity to supply Floreana Island (one of the Galapagos Islands). In the present study, nine elite accessions of J. curcas from tropical dry forests in Ecuador were cultivated for the purpose of evaluating seed production in relation to the propagation method used (seed, cutting). A split-plot design with three replicates was applied. Seed production, measured over a period of 7 years (2009–2015) showed a large year-to-year variation. However, seed production varied significantly among accessions and depended on the propagation method (seeds or cuttings). Propagation by stem cuttings stabilized the variability in the vegetative and seed production components measured, increasing the strength of their relationships with seed yield. The three highest yielding accessions produced 0.28–0.30 kg of seeds tree−1 year−1. As seed yield was not correlated with annual precipitation, the year-to-year variation in production of accessions indicates the effect of other factors not considered here, such as agronomic practices. The study findings suggest that agroforestry practices could be developed that would enable J. curcas to play a predominant role in a strategy for tropical dry forests aimed at reducing poverty (also known as pro-poor growth strategy). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Concerns over energy demands and climate change have led the United States to set ambitious targets for bioenergy production in the coming decades. The southeastern United States has had a recent increase in biomass woody pellet production and is projected to produce a large portion of the nation's cellulosic biofuels. We conducted a large-scale, systematic comparison of potential impacts of two types of bioenergy feedstocks – corn (Zea mays) and pine (Pinus spp.) – on bird communities across the southeastern United States. In addition, we evaluated three biomass alternatives for woody biomass from pine plantations: thinning, residue harvest, and short-rotation energy plantations (SREPs). We conducted transect counts for birds in eight different land uses across the region (85 sites), including corn fields, reference forest, and plantation forests, 2013–2015. We then used hierarchical occupancy models to test the effect of these biomass alternatives on 31 species. Across all species, birds had lower rates of occupancy in corn fields compared to pine stands. Thinning had positive effects on the average occupancy across species, while residue harvest and the potential conversion of conventional plantations to SREPs had negative effects. Cavity nesters and species with bark-gleaning foraging strategies tended to show the strongest responses. These results highlight the potential negative effects of corn as an energy crop relative to the use of pine biomass. In addition, harvesting biomass via thinning was a bird-friendly harvest method in comparison with other alternatives. While SREPs may negatively impact some bird species, previously reported yields emphasize that they may provide an order of magnitude greater yield per unit area than other alternatives considered, such that this land-use practice may be an important alternative to minimize the bioenergy impacts across the landscape. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Bioenergy crop production is rapidly expanding in Europe, and the potential emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) might change the chemical composition of the atmosphere, influencing in turn air quality and regional climate. The environmental impacts of bioenergy crops on air chemistry are difficult to assess due to a lack of accurate field observations. Therefore, we studied BVOC fluxes from a bioenergy maize field in North-Eastern Germany throughout the entire reproductive growth stage of the plants. Combining automated large chambers and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), we successfully measured fluxes of the highly reactive hydrocarbons monoterpenes (MTs) and sesquiterpenes (SQTs), together with several other BVOCs, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, benzenoids, and fatty acid derivatives. Emissions of MTs and SQTs were relatively high (17.0% and 3.6% of total mean molar BVOC emission, respectively) compared to methanol emissions (17.6%). Seasonal MT and SQT fluxes were clearly associated with the flowering phase, originating mainly from the flowering tissues as shown in additional laboratory experiments. From the observations of CO2 net ecosystem exchange and evapotranspiration rates, we could exclude heat and drought stress-induced BVOC emissions. Standard emission factors calculated for all compounds, chemical groups, and growth stages, showed that the temperature dependency of volatile terpenoid fluxes decreased distinctively with proceeding development stage. The results indicate that emissions from large-scale bioenergy maize fields should be better differentiated and considered in regional estimates of aerosol formation. For the implementation of such relation into biogeochemical modelling, it should be considered that not only seasonal weather development but also phenological growth stages are determining the BVOC patterns and emission potentials. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - In agricultural studies, estimating and testing differences between treatment regimes in a designed experiment usually determines the subsequent success or failure of inputs or management practices. Fine-scale soil variability of the experimental site can reduce statistical power and should be determined in order to optimize the experiment design. Although randomization is often performed, there is a probability that such randomization does not cover for fine scale soil variability. To determine the effect of this fine scale soil variability, a well characterized test system comprising of biochar's effects on soil microbial communities were studied, in conjunction with Electrical Resisitivity Tomography (ERT) to identify its role on biochar's differential interaction with soil microbial communities. Two main soil profiles were identified by the ERT survey and soil characteristics and soil microbial communities were differently affected by the biochar application with regards to soil profile. Fungal communities (mycorrhization intensity and fungal richness in particular) seemed to be more strongly affected than bacterial communities, however, these effects didn't show a similar trend in between the two studied soil profiles. Consequently, most of the effects of biochar application were masked by the soil variability of the experimental site when analysed in a nested design with randomization. Our results support the relevance of taking fine scale soil variability into account prior to the establishment of a field trial to optimize experimental design. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The influence of floating vessel motions on the hydrodynamic behavior of multiphase flows in porous media was studied using a hexapod ship motion emulator with an embarked packed column. The response of gas-liquid distribution, pressure drop, liquid saturation, and flow regime transition to column inclinations and roll motions was compared to those of the corresponding static vertical and inclined configurations. Two-phase flow patterns in terms of local liquid saturation distribution were visualized online by means of a capacitance wire-mesh sensor positioned firmly on the floating packed bed. The hydrodynamic performance of packed beds under roll motion deviates strongly from that of the static beds, indicating that the known characteristics of the conventional land-based trickle-bed reactors cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis for design and scale-up of the floating reactor configurations. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - A 2-year study was conducted to elucidate land use change (LUC) impact on the distribution of aggregate size fractions and associated carbon (C) concentration involving natural forest (NF), degraded forest (DF), cropland (CL), and biofuel plantation (JP, Jatropha plantation) in the dry tropical region of India across the soil profile (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm). Across the seasons and the land uses, the proportion of macro- and microaggregates was maximum at upper and minimum at lower layer whereas mesoaggregates increase with depth. The trend of macro- and microaggregate fractions through the soil profile was NF > JP > DF > CL whereas that of mesoaggregates was CL > DF < JP > NF. Dry mean weight diameter was highest at upper layer and decreased down the depth in all the land uses and followed the trend NF > JP > DF > CL. Aggregate associated organic carbon (OC) concentration in all the fractions decreased from NF to DF, CL, or JP indicates that macroaggregate associated OC concentration was more susceptible to loss than that of meso- and microaggregate associated OC concentration. LUC induced decline in macroaggregate associated OC stock and increase in meso- and microaggregate associated OC stock; indicated redistribution of OC stock among aggregate fractions. It may be concluded that JP in dry tropics can be an efficient strategy for rehabilitation of degraded land as it improves aggregate structure and stability in the whole profile and aggregate associated OC stock in upper layer of soil. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to assess the current freshwater use in the cassava supply chain for food, feed fuel in the Mun basin, and the water scarcity impact and possible options to increase cassava production to meet the future demand following the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) target. Methods: This research analyzes freshwater use based on ISO 14046 water footprint assessment. The analysis was implemented based on a life cycle perspective that determines the impact on freshwater use from cassava products along their supply chain. Both direct water use and indirect water use that associated are analyzed. Midpoint impact of water use was assessed using water stress index (WSI) to calculate water scarcity footprint. Results and discussion: The results show that in the current situation, total freshwater use of all cassava-related product in Mun basin in the base case is 1140 million m3/year. When WSI was applied, water scarcity footprint of all cassava-related products in the Mun basin in the base case was only 147 million m3/year. In the scenario 1, increasing irrigation to increase yield in the existing cassava cultivation area in the Mun basin has the largest water use compare to other scenarios. Scenarios 2 and 3, expanding cassava cultivation area in Mun basin and in other regions, have lower water and water scarcity impact than scenario 1. The benefit from transforming paddy rice (in unsuitable areas) to cassava cultivation was also good. However, more resources are required including land, energy, or fertilizer, and other environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emission or eutrophication could be increased from the increasing resource use. Therefore, the decision-making process needs to consider the trade-off between those factors, and a more complete life cycle assessment (LCA) on the envisioned alternatives should be applied for further analysis. Conclusions: The increasing demand of biofuels derived from cassava can increase stress on water in the Mun River basin. Increasing irrigation water use in the area as per requirement could possibly increase yield to meet the future feedstock demand but has large water scarcity impact. However, this could be alleviated by using groundwater from additional wells in the farm. Expanding cassava cultivation area could be another option having low water scarcity impact, but it requires more resources and could increase other environmental impacts that need to be further analyzed by a complete LCA. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This study presents a Life Cycle Assessment of second-generation ethanol production in Brazil considering current and future technologies to represent its technology evolution, compared to the first-generation process. With the start of the learning curve of the cellulosic ethanol production, improvements are expected on both biomass industrial conversion and agricultural production phases. Increased sugarcane yields and gradual introduction of more productive varieties, such as energy cane, are expected, affecting both first- and second-generation ethanol production processes. In environmental impact categories very relevant in the biofuel production debate, such as climate change, fossil depletion and agricultural land occupation, scenarios with second-generation process present lower impacts than first-generation process for the same time horizon. There is a trend of reduction of environmental impacts over time, reflecting the environmental advantages due to advances on the learning curve of second-generation ethanol technology and on biomass production system. The contribution of second-generation ethanol production will be extremely relevant to help Brazil to meet its targets in the international environmental agreements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Little is known about how citizens perceive the transition towards a bio-based economy (BBE), despite the fact that they are one of the most important actors in this transition. Citizens’ perceptions of bio-based innovations can support policy-makers to improve the quality of decision-making and the bio-based industry to develop innovations. This study explores Dutch citizens’ arguments for and against three selected bio-based innovations: bioplastics, bio-jetfuels and small-scale bio-refineries. Randomly selected Dutch citizens were consulted in seven focus groups discussions (n = 57). Results show that participants generally favor the contribution of bio-based technologies to economic growth and sustainability, but also mentioned several negative effects, such as high costs, food shortages or deforestation. In forming their opinion, citizens carefully weigh pros and cons of bio-based technologies from the perspective of their own interests and context, and this varies per bio-based technology. Their acceptance and support towards bio-based technologies increases when they feel more engaged with these technologies, and becomes even stronger when they identify opportunities for direct personal benefits, as in the case of the small-scale bio-refinery. This acceptance and support reduces if another important value is threatened (e.g. accessible mobility in the case of bio-jetfuels). Reliable information on both the advantages and disadvantages of bio-based technologies, coming from a neutral and independent body, is necessary in order for citizens to make their own judgments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We build a tractable partial equilibrium model to study the interactions between the EU biofuel policies (mandate and double-counting of second-generation biofuels) and first- and second-generation biodiesel production. We find that increasing the biodiesel mandate results in a higher share of first-generation biodiesel in total diesel fuel, but leads to a lower share of second-generation biodiesel. The double-counting policy supports the production of second-generation biodiesel at the expense of a lower share of first-generation biodiesel, and increases the consumption of fossil diesel as compared to treating first- and second-generation biodiesel equally. Finally, improved collection of used cooking oil reduces the price of oilseeds and oils thereof, the prices of both biofuel types, and negligibly also the consumer fuel price. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The use and production of biofuels have been strongly promoted in Thailand. In order to achieve a 25 % renewable energy target in 2021, feedstock expansion is needed to satisfy the increased demand for biofuel production putting more pressure on freshwater resources. This is an important implication of biofuel production which has not yet been taken into consideration. Thus, this study intends to address the impact from freshwater use due to the biodiesel target based on life cycle assessment approach as well as to evaluate suitable areas for expansion of oil palm. Methods: The amount of water for growing oil palm throughout its lifespan is estimated based on theoretical crop water requirement, while water demand for producing biodiesel is referred to from literature. Then, the potential impact on freshwater resources is assessed in terms of water deprivation using the water stress index of Thailand. The Alternative Energy Development Plan for 2012–2021 and areas recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives are referred in this study. Additionally, two scenarios for increasing new plantation in suitable areas are proposed as expansion in a single region or spread over the three regions. Results and discussion: The highest water requirement for oil palm-based biodiesel production is found in the central region followed by the eastern and southern (4–9, 5–16, and 4–19 m3 L−1 biodiesel, respectively). This is because oil palm plantations in the central region are not yet fully mature. As a result, the ratio of crop water requirement associated to crop productivity will be reduced while the water productivity will be increased yearly in yield. Also, more than 99 % of the total water is required during the cultivation period. To achieve the 2021 biodiesel target with a concern towards the impact from freshwater use by means of low water deprivation, cultivating oil palm is recommended entirely in the eastern and the southern parts without expansion to the central region. Conclusions: The impact on freshwater resources is an important implication of biofuel production as most of the water requirement of palm oil biodiesel was for oil palm cultivation. Accounting the water deprivation as one of the criteria on impact from freshwater use will provide useful support for selecting areas having less potential for inducing water stress in a watershed leads to people in these areas being less vulnerable to water stress. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Increasing global demand for biofuel has accelerated land-use change (LUC) in Brazil, primarily through the planting of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) to replace degraded pastures. The intensive mechanization associated with this LUC has increased concerns regarding structural quality of Brazilian tropical soils. Through decades of research focusing on identifying sensitive indicators of soil degradation due to land use and management, the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method has emerged as a simple, fast, reliable and accurate semi-quantitative approach for assessing soil structure changes. VESS integrates soil properties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, and root characteristics into a single score (Sq – structural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor structural quality). Although the VESS method was developed for temperate soils, it has been used successfully as an indicator of soil and crop management practice effects on structural quality of tropical and subtropical soils. Our objectives were to evaluate soil structural quality changes associated with a LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at three sites under Oxisols, Alfisols and Ultisols across central-southern Brazil using the VESS; and to correlate VESS scores with quantitative measurements of soil physical properties. Average VESS scores were 2.0, 2.7, and 3.1 for native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane, respectively. Overall the VESS method was able to detect soil structural quality changes under LUC for sugarcane cultivation, indicating a decrease in soil quality from native vegetation through pasture to sugarcane. The VESS scores were significantly correlated with quantitative soil physical property measurements, suggesting VESS is a reliable indicator of soil structural quality in tropical soils. A VESS score Sq = 3.0 seems to be suitable as a guide for management decisions. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient method to identify impacts of sugarcane expansion on soil structural quality, and recommend that VESS assessment be incorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating not only sugarcane expansion areas, but also overall soil quality/health in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study assesses the impact of wood energy use under underutilized conditions of wood resources: the impact on promotion of forest maintenance practices (FMPs), user costs, and local economies, using the case of a local initiative in Nishiwaga, Iwate, Japan. We conducted two main analyses: resource and economic assessment. For resource assessment, we investigate whether wood supply from FMP residue is sufficient to sustainably satisfy new demand created by a local initiative in Nishiwaga, and in how much forest area can FMPs be performed to satisfy the demand. These questions are analyzed by linear programming. Regarding economic assessment, we investigate whether replacement of fossil fuel by wood energy brings economic benefit to a user and local economy using input-output analysis. Our overall findings demonstrated that the use of wood energy under underutilized situations can lead to an increase of implementations of FMPs and of domestic wood resource supplies from a short-term perspective that comes from residues of the FMPs. We also found that wood energy consumption introduces co-benefits in terms of reduced heating costs for users and a larger economic impact on the local economy than fossil fuel. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The "Jatropha for Galápagos" (JFG) project in Ecuador aims to progressively replace diesel with jatropha oil in the generation of electricity in The Galápagos Islands. Thus, understanding and motivating the participation of jatropha suppliers is a priority for the sustainability of JFG. For this reason, the factors influencing their decision-making to participate in the project have been identified and analyzed using a binomial logit model. The results show that factors found to positively influence the likelihood of participation include, amongst others, the supplier's experience within the project, their participation in local organizations, and the degree of satisfaction with the price of jatropha oil. In addition, children from producer families' collaboration in the harvest of jatropha increases the overall likelihood of participation within the project. Similarly, the distance to the collection center positively influences the chances of participation. Conversely, those suppliers with higher wages and those who declared that jatropha harvest starts in April have a reduced likelihood of participating in the project. The findings obtained from this project can help decision-makers develop new measures to improve the sustainability of the project through initiatives to motivate the participation of jatropha suppliers in the program. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This study quantifies the synergies between agriculture and bioenergy considering biodiesel production as part of a set of systemic initiatives. We present a case study in Ecuador taking into account the recent government measures aimed at developing the bioenergy sector. Four scenarios have been evaluated through a newly designed systemic scheme of circular-economy initiatives. These scenarios encompass three production pathways covering three energy crops: palm oil (PO), microalgae in open ponds (M1) and microalgae in laminar photobioreactors (M2). We have applied Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) methodology considering the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) as the main evaluation criteria. In terms of private investment, biodiesel production from PO is more attractive than from M2. However, regarding efficiency and effectiveness of public funds, M2 is superior to PO because the public BCR and NPV are higher, and the pressure on agricultural land is lower. Moreover, M2 as part of a systemic approach presents a better carbon balance. These findings show that, under a systemic approach based on circular economy, strategies like the one analyzed in this study are economically feasible and may have a promising future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biorefineries have the potential to meet a significant part of the growing demand for energy, fuels, chemicals and materials worldwide. Indeed, the bio-based industry is expected to play a major role in energy security and climate change mitigation during the 21th century. Despite this, there are challenges related to resource consumption, processing optimization and waste minimization that still need to be overcome. In this context, microalgae appear as a promising non-edible feedstock with advantages over traditional land crops, such as high productivity, continuous harvesting throughout the year and minimal problems regarding land use. Importantly, both cultivation and microalgae processing can take place at the same site, which increases the possibilities for process integration and a reduction in logistic costs at biorefinery facilities. This review describes the actual scenario for microalgae biorefineries integration to the biofuels and petrochemical industries in Brazil, while highlighting the major challenges and recent advances in microalgae large-scale production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arundo donax L. is a perennial grass species of Mediterranean origin. Its high biomass yield potential in its native climate has contributed to A. donax being an important biofuel feedstock crop. This study investigates the potential of A. donax as a purpose-grown biomass feedstock for advanced biofuel production in Nova Scotia. The effects of nine different growth-promoters (bacterial and fungal species, a seaweed extract, and a lipo-chitooligosaccharide) and two inoculation methods on A. donax biomass productivity were investigated through three experimental trials: one greenhouse and one field trial inoculated by a post-planting application of the supplements around the plant stem (soil drenching) and one greenhouse trial with inoculation by root soaking just prior to planting (2016). The survival of A. donax over the winter was also evaluated over two winter seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016). Penicillium bilaiae Chalab. illustrated the most consistent positive effects on biomass productivity across experimental trials and the plants’ higher phosphorus concentrations suggest that P. bilaiae was helping the plant access soil phosphorus. The root soaking inoculation method resulted in more positive effects in measured growth parameters compared with the soil drench method. Despite a very mild winter in one of the 2 yr tested, A. donax did not successfully overwinter in the field in either year. The presence of growth-promoters did not enhance biomass productivity substantially in the field. Moreover, due to its low overwintering survivability, this study suggests that A. donax is not well suited as a biomass feedstock crop in Nova Scotia. © 2018, Agricultural Institute of Canada.

AB  - With the petroleum storage reduction and global warming, there is an increasing need to revolutionize the energy supply chain, especially in the transportation industry. Researches on the production of fuels derived from biological renewable feedstocks have been greatly intensified over the past decade. Sustained researches have been performed with biofuels, such as bioethanol which is the most commonly used in SI engines due to its renewable nature and high octane number. Apart from SI engines, bioethanol is also used in diesel engines. Our country population resources are numerous, it is impossible to popularize the bioethanol in large scale due to the limitation of the area of cultivated land. With the development of fuel production technology, more and more alternative fuel for diesel have been found, such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In the past, DMF did not draw extensive attention due to the limitation of production technology. Recently, some significant breakthroughs have been made in production methods for DMF, which makes it is possible to be widely applied as a major alternative fuel for diesel in compression ignition engine. Although DMF is a promising biofuel, little is known on its combustion and emission characteristics. The experiments were carried out on a modified four-cylinder, 4-stroke, water-cooled, DICI engine coupled with a common rail fuel injection system using blends of diesel and DMF. Conventional diesel fuel was used as the base fuel. Mixtures of 10% and 30% by mass fraction of DMF with the base diesel fuel were tested in the research, referred to as D10 and D30, respectively. Traditional pure diesel referred to as D0. The experimental conditions were constant engine speed of 1800 r min-1 and loads from 10% to 90% at an interval of 20%, corresponding to 0.13, 0.38, 0.63, 0.88 and 1.13 MPa BMEP, respectively. Unregulated emissions would severely harm the health of humans and other living beings. Some of the unregulated emissions, even in minor quantities into the air, can induce major health problems in large sections of the affected population. There is much research on the regulated emissions of DMF, but rarely on the unregulated emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or benzene. Airborne particulate matter (PM) is also associated with several severe health hazards. Thus, we studied the combustion and unregulated emission characteristics as well as PM emission from diesel engine on different DMF and diesel blends compared with baseline diesel. The results show that at 0.13 MPa BMEP, with the increase of DMF mass fraction in the mixtures, the peak cylinder pressure decreases significantly and the peak heat release rate (HRR) significantly increases. However, at 0.88 MPa BMEP, peak cylinder pressure and HRR are increased with the increase of DMF mass fraction. 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde and benzene emissions are decreased with the increase of engine load. The NOx emissions increases with the increase of engine load. In addition, DMF blending with diesel increased acetaldehyde emissions, whilst reduced 1,3-butadiene and benzene emissions. At 0.13 MPa BMEP, D30 has the lowest NOx emissions. For each tested fuels, the nucleation mode greatly dominates the particle size distribution. At 0.38 MPa BMEP, compared with diesel, the particle number concentration of blend fuels are lower in each test mode. However, at high load of 1.13 MPa BMEP, the particle number concentration of diesel is consistently the lowest within the entire range of diameters. At 0.88 MPa BMEP, D30 has 60.5% smaller nucleation-mode number and 232.2% smaller accumulation-mode mass than diesel. D30 has much smaller mean accumulation-mode diameter than diesel (50.9 vs. 60.1 nm). © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Cultivation of microalgae in anaerobically digested effluent is beneficial for removal of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and heavy metals at reduced cost and generation of biomass to produce biofuels. In the present study, four strains of oleaginous microalgae, separated from fresh water in South China, were evaluated for their ability to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. The results showed that Scenedesmus sp. (GN 171) was capable of removing nitrogen and phosphorous in BG-11 medium at the rates of 97% and 99%. Two types of anaerobically digested effluents, i.e., grass anaerobically digested effluent and molasses wastewater anaerobically digested effluent, were chosen as the nutrient sources. These anaerobically digested effluents diluted in BG-11 medium or with tap water were used as the substitute medium to cultivate GN 171; other pretreatment methods, such as sterilization and dilution ratio, were also taken into consideration. A ratio of 1/3 for unsterilized grass anaerobically digested effluent/tap water mixture (designated as G4) was the optimal proportion for growth of GN 171 and removal of nitrogen and phosphorus at a large scale. The dry weight of GN 171 reached 3.2 g L−1, and the total lipid, carbohydrate and protein contents were 34%, 30% and 16% in G4. The efficacies for removal of total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus and selected heavy metals were generally satisfactory. It seems possible to use ADE, rather than any artificial medium, as the sole nutrient source for microalgae production. © 2017

AB  - The agroforestry system that integrate non-food, perennial trees bearing oilseeds (TBO) with agricultural crops on low quality land, has potential to sustainably produce biofuels with considerable GHG savings and has livelihood benefits for the farmers. We evaluated many TBOs with a life cycle assessment methodology. We quantified Net Energy Balance (NEB), Net Energy Ratio (NER) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions saving potential in comparison to fossil fuels. The study focused on agroforestry-based biofuel production from seven tree species i.e. Pongamia pinnata, Madhuca indica, Azadirachta indica, Simarouba glauca, Amoora rohituka, Calophyllum inophyllum and Jatropha curcas. In a comparative assessment with first generation biofuels from corn and soybean, agroforestry based biofuels had NER values from 1.42 to 2.03 while soybean and corn had NER values of 0.43 and 0.54, respectively, when only biofuel energy was considered. When co-products energy was also considered, the NER values of agroforestry based biofuels increased manifold and ranged between 4.2 and 6.44, while for soybean and corn it was 1.35 and 0.88 respectively. The GHG emissions saving of agroforestry based biofuels ranged from 24.3 CO2-Eq/MJ to 41.7 CO2-Eq/MJ, while soybean and corn had negative GHG emissions saving of −137 CO2-Eq/MJ and −99 CO2-Eq/MJ respectively. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green public procurement is believed to have the potential to contribute to environmental improvement and diffusion of green technologies. The aim of this paper is to compare and analyse how two Swedish regions use public procurement to promote the introduction of renewable fuels in their public bus transport systems. The method is a qualitative comparative case study, based on interviews and document studies. The paper addresses the questions of what the strategic motivations are for using public procurement to stimulate renewable fuels, and what the practical challenges have been in relation to five important factors identified from previous research: strategies, requirements, costs, size and knowledge. In one region, procurement is used in a strategic way to create a local market for biofuels, which poses higher demands on political backing, information and knowledge, the way requirements are set, and an acceptance of increased costs. In the other region, procurement is used instrumentally to increase the share of biofuels in a cost-effective way that gives room for more flexibility and reduces the demands on the procurers. This paper highlights the importance of context when assessing green public procurement schemes and analyses the case-specific influence of factors on the outcome of green public procurement. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass continues to show promise in experimental and pilot scale tests for carbon partitioning toward desirable multi-phase organic products. Results from a techno-economic investigation are presented for a commercial scale stand-alone plant with primary production of renewable liquid fuels compatible with current transportation infrastructure. The plant feedstock was forest residues and the non-catalytic hydrothermal conditions were set to 330 °C and 210 bar. A sequential flowsheet was developed and simulated on Aspen Plus® that includes pre-treatment, hydrothermal liquefaction, fuel upgrading and residue recovery functional blocks. Different scenarios for the valorization of the liquefaction residue streams are examined to maximize organic recovery and eliminate process waste streams. The highest plant thermal efficiency on lower heating value basis was recorded for the polygeneration of renewable liquid fuels, Bio-char and hydrogen gas at 85.2%. The plant recorded a minimum selling price of 66 € per MWh of co-products. The break-even prices of the co-products under existing market conditions was found to be 1.03 € per kg of gasoline or 2.46 € per kg of hydrogen gas or 51.4 € per MWh of Bio-char. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Though more costly than petroleum-based fuels and a minor component of overall military fuel sources, biofuels are nonetheless strategically valuable to the military because of intentional reliance on multiple, reliable, secure fuel sources. Significant reduction in oilseed biofuel cost occurs when grown on marginally productive saline-sodic soils plentiful in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV). The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of oilseed production on marginal soils in the SJV to support a 115 ML yr-1 biofuel conversion facility. The feasibility evaluation involves: (1) development of an Ida Gold mustard oilseed yield model for marginal soils; (2) identification of marginally productive soils; (3) development of a spatial database of edaphic factors influencing oilseed yield and (4) performance of Monte Carlo simulations showing potential biofuel production on marginally productive SJV soils. The model indicates oilseed yield is related to boron, salinity, leaching fraction, and water content at field capacity. Monte Carlo simulations for the entire SJV fit a shifted gamma probability density function: Q = 68.986 + gamma (6.134,5.285), where Q is biofuel production in ML yr-1. The shifted gamma cumulative density function indicates a 0.15–0.17 probability of meeting the target biofuel-production level of 115 ML yr-1, making adequate biofuel production unlikely. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This study suggests that Iceland may be able to produce sufficient liquid hydrocarbon fuels from biological sources in the future to substitute the Icelandic 2016 consumption of fossil fuels, by using forest products. The authors evaluate a strategy to put forest on up to 35,000 km2 in Iceland to 2050. The preliminary study shows that Iceland could reach climate neutrality around 2050 and be a significant net carbon sequester for the next 250 years. Approximate estimates suggest that the total forest biomass production could reach about 10 million m3yr−1, comprising 3.1 million m3yr−1 of roundwood, 3.1 million m3yr−1 for generic biomass, and about 4.2 million m3yr−1 woody material for biofuel use. This could result in a net annual carbon dioxide sequestration of 2–2.5 mill ton CO2 yr−1 by 2100. The calculations suggest that such an afforestation and land restoration undertaking would be long term profitable in economic terms and that the payback time would be about 2050. The method applied in this study is that of a static mass balance calculations at different time points into the future. Parallel to this work, a full integrated regional forest production model is being developed and will be applied to this issue. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Anthropogenic inputs are increasing the CO2 content of the atmosphere, and the CO2 and total inorganic C in the surface ocean and, to a lesser degree, the deep ocean. The greenhouse effect of the increased CO2 (and, to a lesser extent, other greenhouse gases) is very probably the major cause of present global warming. The warming increases temperature of the atmosphere and the surface ocean to a greater extent than the deep ocean, with shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing nutrient flux to the surface ocean where there is greater mean photosynthetic photon flux density. These global changes influence algae in nature. However, it is clear that algae are important, via the biological pump, in decreasing the steady state atmospheric and ocean surface CO2, and thus decreasing radiative forcing, a reduction enhanced by algal increases in albedo. As well as these natural processes there are possibilities that algae can, with human intervention, partly offset the increase in atmospheric CO2. One possibility is to grow algae as sources of fuel for transport, in principle providing an energy source that is close to CO2-neutral. The other possibility is to increase the role of algae in sequestering CO2 as organic C over periods of hundreds or more years in the deep ocean and marine sediments and/or increasing albedo and decreasing radiative forcing of temperature. There are problems, currently unresolved, in the economically viable production of algal biofuels without carbon trading subsidies. Enhanced algal CO2 sequestration also has costs, both in resource input (phosphorus (P) from high P content rocks, a limited resource with a competing use as an agricultural fertilizer) and adverse environmental effects. For example, ocean anoxic zones producing N2O and increased algal production of short-lived halocarbons by algae that both, through breakdown, destroy O3 and increase UV flux to the Earth’s surface. © 2017 British Phycological Society.

AB  - Macroalgae have played an important role in coastal communities for centuries. In the past, they have been harvested and gathered from shorelines around the world for traditional uses such as food, animal feed and a crude fertilizer (marine manure). Today, seaweeds are used in a multitude of applications with expanding global industries based on hydrocolloids, cosmetics and food supplements, and also as a potential biofuel source. However, of the approximately 10 000 algal species reported to exist, only a small number are commercially utilized. While representing only a small fraction of total global seaweed production, harvesting and gathering ‘wild’ seaweeds has had, and continues to have, an integral role in many coastal societies, often being intrinsically linked to the cultural identity of those coastal communities. Today, 32 countries actively harvest seaweeds from wild stocks, with over 800 000 t harvested annually from natural beds. It is vitally important that seaweeds are utilized sustainably and that natural resources are effectively managed by coastal communities with vested interests around the world. As the popularity of seaweeds increases and the use of less traditional species with novel applications comes to the fore, it is critically important to make certain that the sustainability of the resource is ensured given the increased pressures of harvesting. Issues exist regarding ownership of the resource and its over-exploitation, and the implementation of environmentally damaging harvesting techniques must be avoided. Resource scientists, managers, conservationists, governments, and other stakeholders need to be proactive in the sustainable management of these vulnerable, yet valuable, resources. © 2017 British Phycological Society.

AB  - Horse manure, the improper disposal of which, imposes considerable environmental costs, constitutes an apt feedstock for conversion to renewable fuels and chemicals when tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) is employed. TGRP is a modification of fast pyrolysis that recycles its noncondensable gases and produces a bio-oil low in oxygen concentration and rich in naphthalene. Herein, we evaluate the coproduction of phenol as a value-added renewable chemical, alongside jet-range fuels within distributed TGRP systems using techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. We investigate the metrics global warming potential (GWP), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and cost for the conversion of 200 dry metric tons per day of horse manure to bio-oil and its subsequent upgrade to hydrocarbon fuel and phenolic chemicals. Assigning credits for the offset of the coproducts, the net GWP and CExD of TGRP jet fuel are 10 g of CO2 eq and 0.4 MJ per passenger kilometer distance traveled, respectively. These values are considerably lower than the GWP and CExD of petroleum-based aviation fuel. The minimum fuel selling price of the TGRP jet fuel ($1.35-$1.80 L-1) is estimated to be much greater than that of petroleum-based aviation fuel ($0.42 L-1), except under optimized fuel conversion and coproduct market conditions ($0.53-$0.79 L-1) when including a market price for carbon. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The quality requirements of wood biofuels are regulated by a series of harmonized international standards. These standards define the technical parameter limits that influence the quality of solid biomass as a fuel. In 2014 the European reference standard for solid biofuel was replaced by the International ISO standard. In the case of wood chips, the main difference between the European and International standards is the definition of particle size distribution classes. In this context, this study analyses the quality of wood chips and its variation over the years according to the "former" (EN 14691-4) and "in force" (ISO 17225-4) standards. A Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) model was built to predict the best quality of wood chips and to clarify the relationship between quality and standard parameters, time and changes in the standard regulations. The results show that, compared to the EN standards, classification with the ISO standards increases the samples belonging to the best quality classes and decreases the not classified samples. Furthermore, all the SIMCA models have a high sensitivity (>90%), reflect the differences introduced to the quality standards and are therefore suitable for monitoring the quality of wood chips and their changes. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Crude glycerol from biodiesel production is a biobased material capable of co-producing biofuels and chemicals. This study aimed to develop a line of Ni catalysts supported on cerium-magnesium (Ce-Mg) to improve the process efficiency of glycerol hydrogenolysis for ethanol and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). Results showed that catalytic activity was greatly improved by changing the preparation method from impregnation to deposition precipitation (DP), and by adjusting calcination temperatures. Prepared via DP, the catalysts of 25 wt % Ni supported on Ce-Mg (9:1 mol/mol) greatly improved the effectiveness in glycerol conversion while maintaining the selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO. Calcination at 350 °C provided the catalysts better selectivities of 15.61% to ethanol and 67.93% to 1,2-PDO. Increases in reaction temperature and time improved the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity to ethanol, but reduced the selectivity to 1,2-PDO. A lower initial water content led to a higher conversion of glycerol, but lower selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO. Higher hydrogen application affected the glycerol conversion rate positively, but the selectivities to ethanol and 1,2-PDO negatively. A comparison to the commercial Raney® Ni catalyst showed that the Ni/Ce-Mg catalyst developed in this study showed a better potential for the selective co-production of ethanol and 1,2-PDO from glycerol hydrogenolysis. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (JA) can grow well in marginal lands with high biomass yield, and thus is a potential energy crop for biorefinery. The major biomass of JA is from tubers, which contain inulin that can be easily hydrolyzed into a mixture of fructose and glucose, but fructose utilization for producing butanol as an advanced biofuel is poor compared to glucose-based ABE fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum. In this article, the impact of extracellular redox potential (ORP) on the process is studied using a mixture of fructose and glucose to simulate the hydrolysate of JA tubers. When the extracellular ORP is controlled above −460 mV, 13.2 g L−1 butanol is produced from 51.0 g L−1 total sugars (40.1 g L−1 fructose and 10.9 g L−1 glucose), leading to dramatically increased butanol yield and butanol/ABE ratio of 0.26 g g−1 and 0.67, respectively. Intracellular metabolite and q-PCR analysis further indicate that intracellular ATP and NADH availabilities are significantly improved together with the fructose-specific PTS expression at the lag phase, which consequently facilitate fructose transport, metabolic shift toward solventogenesis and carbon flux redistribution for butanol biosynthesis. Therefore, the extracellular ORP control can be an effective strategy to improve butanol production from fructose-based feedstock. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - There is a growing interest worldwide for the production of renewable oil without mobilizing agriculture lands; fast and reliable methods are needed to identify highly oleaginous microorganisms of potential industrial interest. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the relevance of attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy to achieve this goal. To do so, the total lipid content of lyophilized samples of five Streptomyces strains with varying lipid content was assessed with two classical quantitative but time-consuming methods, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ATR Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectroscopy in transmission mode with KBr pellets and the fast ATR method, often questioned for its lack of reliability. A linear correlation between these three methods was demonstrated allowing the establishment of equations to convert ATR values expressed as CO/amide I ratio, into micrograms of lipid per milligram of biomass. The ATR method proved to be as reliable and quantitative as the classical GC-MS and FT-IR in transmission mode methods but faster and more reproducible than the latter since it involves far less manipulation for sample preparation than the two others. Attenuated total reflection could be regarded as an efficient fast screening method to identify natural or genetically modified oleaginous microorganisms by the scientific community working in the field of bio-lipids. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Thraustochytrids are unicellular protists belonging to the Labyrinthulomycetes class, which are characterized by the presence of a high lipid content that could replace conventional fatty acids. They show a wide geographic distribution, however their diversity in the Antarctic Region is rather scarce. The analysis based on the complete sequence of 18S rRNA gene showed that strain 34-2 belongs to the species Thraustochytrium kinnei, with 99% identity. The total lipid profile shows a wide range of saturated fatty acids with abundance of palmitic acid (16:0), showing a range of 16.1–19.7%. On the other hand, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are present in a range of 24–48% and 6.1–9.3%, respectively. All factors analyzed in cells (biomass, carbon consumption and lipid content) changed with variations of culture temperature (10 °C and 25 °C). The growth in glucose at a temperature of 10 °C presented the most favorable conditions to produce omega-3fatty acid. This research provides the identification and characterization of a Thraustochytrids strain, with a total lipid content that presents potential applications in the production of nutritional supplements and as well biofuels. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia

AB  - Agricultural residues are important sources of feedstock for a cellulosic biofuels industry that is being developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy independence. While the US Midwest has been recognized as key to providing maize stover for meeting near-term cellulosic biofuel production goals, there is uncertainty that such feedstocks can produce biofuels that meet federal cellulosic standards. Here, we conducted extensive site-level calibration of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) terrestrial ecosystems model and applied the model at high spatial resolution across the US Midwest to improve estimates of the maximum production potential and greenhouse gas emissions expected from continuous maize residue-derived biofuels. A comparison of methodologies for calculating the soil carbon impacts of residue harvesting demonstrates the large impact of study duration, depth of soil considered, and inclusion of litter carbon in soil carbon change calculations on the estimated greenhouse gas intensity of maize stover-derived biofuels. Using the most representative methodology for assessing long-term residue harvesting impacts, we estimate that only 5.3 billion liters per year (bly) of ethanol, or 8.7% of the near-term US cellulosic biofuel demand, could be met under common no-till farming practices. However, appreciably more feedstock becomes available at modestly higher emissions levels, with potential for 89.0 bly of ethanol production meeting US advanced biofuel standards. Adjustments to management practices, such as adding cover crops to no-till management, will be required to produce sufficient quantities of residue meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction standard for cellulosic biofuels. Considering the rapid increase in residue availability with modest relaxations in GHG reduction level, it is expected that management practices with modest benefits to soil carbon would allow considerable expansion of potential cellulosic biofuel production. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The performance of biogas generation and sludge degradation was studied under different zero-valent iron/activated carbon (ZVI/AC) ratios in detail in mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sludge. A good enhancement of methane production was obtained at the 10:1 ZVI/AC ratio, and the cumulative methane production was 132.1 mL/g VS, 37.6% higher than the blank. The methane content at the 10:1 ZVI/AC ratio reached 68.8%, which was higher than the blank (55.2%) and the sludge-added AC alone (59.6%). For sludge degradation, the removal efficiencies of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), proteins, and polysaccharides were all the highest at the 10:1 ZVI/AC ratio. The concentration of available phosphorus (AP) decreased after anaerobic digestion process. On the other hand, the concentrations of available nitrogen (AN) and available potassium (AK) increased after the anaerobic digestion process and showed a gradually decreasing trend with increasing ZVI/AC ratio. The concentrations of AN and AK were 2303.1–4200.3 and 274.7–388.3 mg/kg, showing a potential for land utilization. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The increase in greenhouse gas emission due to the burning of fossil fuels since the last century has led to global warming. This has triggered numerous researches in green hydrocarbon alternatives from renewable oil. Microalgae is one of the potential sources of green hydrocarbon, which will reduce the dependency on fossil fuel. This is because microalgae have a high oil or lipid content, rapid growth rate, and high ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Besides that, their cultivation does not require arable land and will, therefore not compete with global food production. The current biofuel production is based on the transesterification of triglyceride to biodiesel which suffered from several drawbacks such as high acidity, high viscosity, and low heating value, etc. A more efficient reaction route needs to be developed to produce biofuel which possesses similar properties as the fossil-derived fuel. Therefore, this review aims to encompass the conversion of microalgae oil towards green hydrocarbons via various catalytic reactions. The fundamental chemistry and mechanisms involved in the conversion of microalgae oil to useful chemical products are also discussed in detail. © 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In East Africa, charcoal and firewood will remain the main sources of energy for cooking for the next two to three decades. Corresponding energy policies are needed that set proper priorities and improve the sustainability of the biomass energy sector. In this paper, we assess the supply potentials of wood-based and non-woody biomass fuels in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, and formulate recommendations to support sustainable biomass energy strategies in East Africa. We differentiate between tree types of potentials: the supply potential, the access potential, and the production potential. In order to calculate these potentials, we use a spatial Bayesian network that specifically enables accounting for uncertainties in the data and model. The main results show: (1) that agroforestry and small-scale mixed farming are the land use types with the highest potentials, (2) that firewood, charcoal, and biogas have substantial potential, whereas crop residue briquettes and Jatropha oil have only minor potentials, and (3) that such estimates can be subject to substantial uncertainties. Based on these results, we recommend that biomass energy strategies in East Africa consider the specific assets and limiting factors of the various fuel types and land use types in order to improve the supply of sustainable biomass cooking fuels. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - CO2 emission is a current global concern and has progressively increased due fossil fuel use, leading to climatic changes. As a workaround to this problem low carbon fuel use has been the key to mitigate it in several countries. Brazil is a leader in ethanol sugarcane production and has a high demand expected for this biofuel, which means that large areas will be cultivated to supply this demand. Although biofuels help to reduce carbon emissions, agriculture is highlighted in the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere as from the soil. Considering that the amount of soil carbon lost to the atmosphere is tightly coupled to the vegetation type, soil properties and climate conditions, the main objective of this study was to estimate and compare the CO2 emission in the agricultural phase of ethanol production, as from its main feedstocks. A model based on carbon flux of the soil-plant-atmosphere system, was used. From the five crops assessed (sugarcane, sugar-beet, corn, rice and cassava), sugarcane and corn crops presented, the less CO2 emission at nowadays and over the next 30 years, in opposite of the sugar-beet crop, which was the less sustainable feedstock for ethanol production in terms of CO2 emission. The outcomes of this study contribute to develop scenarios to better understand the impact of ethanol production in the GEEs emission, both in nowadays and in the future, considering the increasing demand for biofuel. Also is presented in this study a detailed discussion regarding important environmental issues of sugarcane and corn ethanol production, which are essential to be considered in the ethanol-policy decision. To our knowledge this is the first study that compares the CO2 emitted from the main ethanol feedstocks based on field tests, under the same conditions of soil and climate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Assessing the impacts of biofuel-induced land use change on hydrology, water quality and crop yield under the current and future climate scenarios enables selection of appropriate land uses and associated best management practices under the changing climate. In this study, the impacts of land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to perennial grasses in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas High Plains were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). While switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was assumed to replace cotton in irrigated areas, dryland cotton was replaced by Miscanthus × giganteus under the hypothetical land use change scenarios. Climate change impacts were assessed based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during two 30-year periods of middle (2040–2069) and end (2070–2099) of the 21st century. Median irrigation water use of cotton was simulated to decrease by 41%–61% in the future when compared to historic (1994–2009) period based on projections by 19 GCMs. Under the future climate change scenarios, when compared to cotton, median annual irrigation water use by switchgrass reduced by 62%–89%. Simulated future median total nitrogen load decreased by 30%–40% under perennial grasses when compared to future cotton land use. The median irrigated switchgrass yield decreased by 16%–28%, but the median dryland Miscanthus yield increased by 32%–38% under the future climate change scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spent coffee grounds (SCG) waste has been drawing attentions in the biodiesel industry due to the promising of oil content. However, SCG sources is very disperse and requires a transportation system. Moreover, a complexity of oil extraction steps using hazardous n-hexane can hinder the SCG biodiesel promotion. Therefore, an alternative approach using in-situ transesterification (in-situ TE), an n-hexane free process, was introduced for producing biodiesel at an on-site SCG source. Life cycle assessment was performed to compare the energy usage and environmental impacts between a conventional process, which requires transportation and n-hexane, and an on-site in-situ TE process. Producing SCG biodiesel using conventional process required 43% less energy and produced fewer environmental impacts than those of the on-site in-situ TE. Much of the difference was attributable to 73% of the energy in the in-situ TE being consumed in methanol recovery. Nevertheless, the in-situ TE process gained better scores in terms of respiratory organs and land occupation. A sensitivity analysis of energy usage on transportation distances and fuel consumption rates suggested that an on-site in-situ TE process could be viewed as more favorable once the transportation distance is greater than 180 km with 7 km/L of fuel consumption rate. © 2017 International Energy Initiative

AB  - The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) provided a grant to establish a wood-based cellulosic biofuels industry in the US Pacific Northwest. Whether the industry will be sustainable depends largely on social acceptability in general and market acceptability of the biofuels among the public in particular. We conducted contingent valuation surveys of general public in the US states of Oregon and Washington to determine people's willingness to pay (WTP) for wood-based cellulosic biofuels and the factors that influence their WTP decisions. Oregon has an existing cellulosic biorefinery, while Washington's biorefineries are only being planned, allowing us to conduct an ex-ante (Washington) versus ex-post (Oregon) WTP comparison. We sent out mail surveys to 2828 valid mailing addresses between May and July of 2015 and received 757 completed surveys. We used the distribution-free Turnbull estimator to estimate the expected WTP and logistic regression to determine the relative strength of predictors on WTP. About one fifth (18.8%) of the respondents were willing to pay some premium for wood-based cellulosic biofuels. The mean WTP amount was $0.19 ± $0.03/gal. (95% confidence interval: $0.17 to $0.21), which equates to a 6.4% price premium on top of the market price for gasoline. Logistic regression results showed that the offered bid price, knowledge on biofuels, age and religious affiliation of respondents were statistically significant predictors of WTP decisions. No significant differences in ex-ante versus ex-post WTP were observed. We also discussed the policy implications of these results for sustainable management of the wood-based cellulosic biofuels industry. © 2017

AB  - Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) refers to a heterogeneous mixture composed of plastics, paper, metal, food and other miscellaneous items. Local authorities commonly dispose of this waste by either landfill or incineration which are both unsustainable practices. Disposing of organic wastes via these routes is also becoming increasingly expensive due to rising landfill taxes and transport costs. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR®) process, is a proposed valorisation route to transform organic wastes and residues, such as MSW, into sustainable energy vectors including (H2 rich synthesis gas, liquid bio-oil and solid char). The aim herein, was to investigate the conversion of the organic fraction of MSW into fuels and chemicals utilising the TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that MSW was successfully processed with the TCR after carrying out a feedstock pre-treatment step. Approximately, 25 wt.% of the feedstock was converted into phase separated liquids, composed of 19 wt.% aqueous phase and 6 wt.% organic phase bio-oil. The analysis of the bio-oil fraction revealed physical and chemical fuel properties, higher heating value (HHV) of 38 MJ/kg, oxygen content &lt;7 wt.% and water content &lt;4 wt.%. Due to the bio-oil's chemical and physical properties, the bio-oil was found to be directly miscible with fossil diesel when blended at a volume ratio of 50:50. The mass balance closure was 44 wt.% synthesis gas, with a H2 content of 36 vol% and HHV of 17.23 MJ/Nm3, and 31 wt.% char with a HHV of 17 MJ/kg. The production of high quantities of H2 gas and highly de-oxygenated organic liquids makes downstream hydrogen separation and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation of the produced bio-oil a promising upgrading step to achieve drop-in transportation fuels from MSW. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Annual row crop agriculture contributes to carbon (C) losses from Midwest soils, while the establishment of perennial crops for food and fuel has the potential to increase soil C stocks. Perennial grasses eliminate the need for tillage and increase belowground biomass, both critical to the accumulation and conservation of soil organic matter and to soil C sequestration. The effect of C4 perennial grasses on particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), consisting primarily of partially decomposed plant material, was evaluated in Illinois, where native switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and a sterile hybrid of the Asian grass Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) were planted as bioenergy feedstocks at the University of Illinois Energy Farm in 2008. Six years after establishment of perennial crops, POM-C was compared with a maize-maize-soybean (Zea mays L., Glycine max L.) rotation typical of the area and a 28-species restored prairie. POM-C concentrations increased for all crops between 31 and 71% over 6 years, with the greatest increases in prairie and M. x giganteus soils. POM-C concentrations were highest at the 0–10 cm depth. Isotopic analyses showed 23–44% of POM-C was new C4 material under perennial bioenergy crops after 6 years. As soil organic matter is primarily plant-derived, increases in POM-C reflect increased organic matter inputs or decreases in the rate of decomposition from the cessation of tillage. Increases in POM-C under annual row crops may result from the incorporation of aboveground organic matter by tillage, while POM-C increases in untilled perennial crops mirror increases in belowground biomass. As soil aggregation protects POM-C from microbial degradation, untilled soils under long-term perennial crop production increase the residence time for soil C. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While liquid biofuels play a prominent role in sustainable energy goals, the relationship between their ability to advance sustainability agendas and their governance has been poorly addressed. The recognition of a number of private sector initiated certification schemes as mechanisms to verify compliance with the requirements of the EU-Renewable Energy Directive has provided a strong stimulus for biofuels certification. The question asked in this article is: “To what extent does the application of these standards effectively contribute to the sustainable production of bioenergy?” The question is answered on the basis of a conceptual framework and literature review. Three elements of the effectiveness of market-based certification standards are reviewed: the substantive scope of emergent standards, the effectiveness of implementation, and levels and trends in market conversion. The proliferation of certificates for low quality standards, deficiencies in the certification process and low market conversion suggest that certification is an inadequate substitute for public regulation. For certification to hold any meaningful potential to strengthen sustainability governance in the biofuel sector, it must be embedded within a public governance system committed to redressing these deficiencies and structuring accountability not just towards global environmental values, but to local people and place. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study evaluated the environmental performances of an integrated material recovery facility (MRF) able to treat 32 kt/y of unsorted mixed waste, made of residuals from household source separation and separate collection. The facility includes a mechanical sorting platform for the production of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) utilized in an external waste-to-energy plant, bio-cells for tunnel composting of organic fraction, and a sanitary landfill for the safe disposal of ultimate waste. All the MRF sub-units have been analysed in depth in order to acquire reliable data for a life cycle assessment study, focused on the environmental performances of different configurations of the facility. The study investigated a “past” configuration, including just mechanical sorting, landfilling and biogas combustion in a gas engine, and the “present” one, which includes also a composting unit. Two possible “future” configurations, having a gasifier inside the MRF battery limits, have been also analysed, assessing the performances of two fluidized bed reactors of different size, able to gasify only the residues generated by the sorting platform or the whole amount of produced SRF, respectively. The analysis evaluated the contributions of each unit in the different configurations and allowed a reliable assessment of the technological evolution of the facility. The results quantified the positive effect of the inclusion of an aerobic treatment of the waste organic fraction. The SRF gasification in situ appears to improve the MRF environmental performances in all the impact categories, with the exclusion of that of global warming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agribusiness participation in Brazil generates investments in rural infrastructure and employment, with direct effects on local quality of life. In this sense, government policies to support the production of ethanol from sugarcane and to promote bioelectricity from bagasse production have made Brazil a country of world leadership in this field. This paper reports an assessment of socioeconomic impacts due to sugarcane production in three regions in Brazil (Piracicaba, Presidente Prudente and Southwest Goiás). Local quality of life is defined as five dimensions: income and inequality, education, infrastructure, health and general development, analysed using panel data modelling, with variables that could explain differences in development due to local characteristics, including sugarcane activity. Presidente Prudente has the highest levels of progress in education, poverty, infrastructure and general development indicators. The models indicate that participation of sugarcane has positive impacts on the indicators of the microregion. In case of Piracicaba microregion, in two models (“L-Theil” and “Illiteracy rate”) indicators related with sugarcane sector are significant explanatory variables, contributing for better indicators. Finally, Southwest Goias—where sugarcane activity develops later—is the single microregion in which the adjusted models have no significant explanatory variables related to sugarcane sector. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Lignocellulose, composed mostly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin generated through secondary growth of woody plant, is considered as promising resources for biofuel. In order to use lignocellulose as a biofuel, biodegradation besides high-cost chemical treatments were applied, but knowledge on the decomposition of lignocellulose occurring in a natural environment is insufficient. We analyzed the 16S rRNA gene and metagenome to understand how the lignocellulose is decomposed naturally in decayed Torreya nucifera (L) of Bija forest (Bijarim) in Gotjawal, an ecologically distinct environment. A total of 464,360 reads were obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, representing diverse phyla; Proteobacteria (51%), Bacteroidetes (11%) and Actinobacteria (10%). The metagenome analysis using single molecules real-time sequencing revealed that the assembled contigs determined originated from Proteobacteria (58%) and Actinobacteria (10.3%). Carbohydrate Active enZYmes (CAZy)-and Protein families (Pfam)-based analysis showed that Proteobacteria was involved in degrading whole lignocellulose, and Actinobacteria played a role only in a part of hemicellulose degradation. Combining these results, it suggested that Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria had selective biodegradation potential for different lignocellulose substrates. Thus, it is considered that understanding of the systemic microbial degradation pathways may be a useful strategy for recycle of lignocellulosic biomass, and the microbial enzymes in Bija forest can be useful natural resources in industrial processes. © 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Poplars are fast-growing, high-yielding forest tree species, whose cultivation as second-generation biofuel crops is of increasing interest and can efficiently meet emission reduction goals. Yet, breeding elite poplar trees for drought resistance remains a major challenge. Worldwide breeding programs are largely focused on intra/interspecific hybridization, whereby Populus nigra L. is a fundamental parental pool. While high-throughput genotyping has resulted in unprecedented capabilities to rapidly decode complex genetic architecture of plant stress resistance, linking genomics to phenomics is hindered by technically challenging phenotyping. Relying on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing and imaging techniques, high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) aims at enabling highly precise and efficient, non-destructive screening of genotype performance in large populations. To efficiently support foresttree breeding programs, ground-truthing observations should be complemented with standardized HTFP. In this study, we develop a high-resolution (leaf level) HTFP approach to investigate the response to drought of a full-sib F2 partially inbred population (termed here ‘POP6’), whose F1 was obtained from an intraspecific P. nigra controlled cross between genotypes with highly divergent phenotypes. We assessed the effects of two water treatments (well-watered and moderate drought) on a population of 4603 trees (503 genotypes) hosted in two adjacent experimental plots (1.67 ha) by conducting low-elevation (25 m) flights with an aerial drone and capturing 7836 thermal infrared (TIR) images. TIR images were undistorted, georeferenced, and orthorectified to obtain radiometric mosaics. Canopy temperature (Tc) was extracted using two independent semi-automated segmentation techniques, eCognition- and Matlab-based, to avoid the mixed-pixel problem. Overall, results showed that the UAV platform-based thermal imaging enables to effectively assess genotype variability under drought stress conditions. Tc derived from aerial thermal imagery presented a good correlation with ground-truth stomatal conductance (gs) in both segmentation techniques. Interestingly, the HTFP approach was instrumental to detect droughttolerant response in 25% of the population. This study shows the potential of UAV-based thermal imaging for field phenomics of poplar and other tree species. This is anticipated to have tremendous implications for accelerating forest tree genetic improvement against abiotic stress. © 2017 Ludovisi, Tauro, Salvati, Khoury, Scarascia Mugnozza and Harfouche.

AB  - Raw thick juice is a concentrated beet extract that enables fermentable sugar storage and could help extend campaigns and reduce capital investments for industrial-beet processing into biobased chemicals including ethanol fuel. The aim of this work was to determine the carbon footprints of fermentable sugars stored as raw thick juice and of ethanol produced from raw thick juice. This enabled comparisons with carbon footprints of fermentable sugars obtained through conventional processing of sugar beets and corn grain, and of combusted gasoline. The carbon footprint of fermentable sugars in raw thick juice was assessed from cradle to gate since raw thick juice can be used as a feedstock for various industrial fermentations, including that for ethanol production. The carbon footprint of ethanol produced from raw thick juice was assessed from cradle to grave and it included juice fermentation and ethanol purification. Ethanol production was modeled assuming either that all fermentable sugars are stored as raw thick juice before fermentation, or that only half of the sugars are stored as raw thick juice before fermentation and the other half directly fermented after extraction. Analyses were also conducted to understand the importance of beet sugar content and of frozen beet pile storage on the carbon footprints. Fermentable sugars stored as raw thick juice have a carbon footprint that is 29% and 52% lower than those of fermentable sugars from conventional processing of sugar beets and corn grain, respectively. Raw juice concentration is the processing step with the largest effect on the overall carbon footprint, representing 26% of the total. Beet ethanol produced under the assumed scenarios could enable a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions of up to 57% compared to gasoline, qualifying as an advanced biofuel in the U.S. under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels can contribute significantly to reducing environmental damage. Lignocellulosic bioethanol can be an alternative to fossil fuels and is of great strategic importance to Brazil. In this context, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioethanol production from cattle manure (CM) was studied. CM is a biomass rich in cellulose that can be converted to glucose and other fermentable sugars. In the LCA, 1000 kg of CM were used as a functional unit of processing. The ReCiPe method and the EcoInvent libraries were used in SimaPro software version 7.3.2. We considered the following categories of impact: climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, ionizing radiation, agricultural land occupation, urban land occupation, natural land transformation, water depletion, mineral resource depletion and fossil resource depletion. The categories damaged were human health, ecosystems and natural resources. The results obtained in the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and the proposed changes in the process contributed to the reduction of environmental impacts. The inputs/outputs that made the greatest contribution to environmental impacts were energy consumption, drying emissions, sulfuric acid in the pretreatment, buffer in the enzymatic hydrolysis and sodium phosphate in the fermentation. Bioethanol production from CM has a low impact on most of the categories and is a process that can be improved to reduce its impact mainly by changing the energy type. In the LCIA, it was observed that the CM bioethanol production eliminates the need for disposal treatment of the manure and uses residual raw material in a biofuel production, thus counterbalancing the environmental impacts of the bioethanol process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Plant lignocellulosic biomass can be a source of fermentable sugars for the production of second generation biofuels and biochemicals. The recalcitrance of this plant material is one of the major obstacles in its conversion into sugars. Biomass is primarily composed of secondary cell walls, which is made of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Xylan, a hemicellulose, binds to the cellulose microfibril and is hypothesised to form an interface between lignin and cellulose. Both softwood and hardwood xylan carry glucuronic acid side branches. As xylan branching may be important for biomass recalcitrance and softwood is an abundant, non-food competing, source of biomass it is important to investigate how conifer xylan is synthesised. Results: Here, we show using Arabidopsis gux mutant biomass that removal of glucuronosyl substitutions of xylan can allow 30% more glucose and over 700% more xylose to be released during saccharification. Ethanol yields obtained through enzymatic saccharification and fermentation of gux biomass were double those obtained for non-mutant material. Our analysis of additional xylan branching mutants demonstrates that absence of GlcA is unique in conferring the reduced recalcitrance phenotype. As in hardwoods, conifer xylan is branched with GlcA. We use transcriptomic analysis to identify conifer enzymes that might be responsible for addition of GlcA branches onto xylan in industrially important softwood. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo activity assays, we demonstrate that a white spruce (Picea glauca) gene, PgGUX, encodes an active glucuronosyl transferase. Glucuronic acid introduced by PgGUX reduces the sugar release of Arabidopsis gux mutant biomass to wild-type levels indicating that it can fulfil the same biological function as native glucuronosylation. Conclusion: Removal of glucuronic acid from xylan results in the largest increase in release of fermentable sugars from Arabidopsis plants that grow to the wild-type size. Additionally, plant material used in this work did not undergo any chemical pretreatment, and thus increased monosaccharide release from gux biomass can be achieved without the use of environmentally hazardous chemical pretreatment procedures. Therefore, the identification of a gymnosperm enzyme, likely to be responsible for softwood xylan glucuronosylation, provides a mutagenesis target for genetically improved forestry trees. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Bioethanol production processes involve enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. Due to the relatively high cost of enzyme production, the development of potent and cost-effective cellulolytic cocktails is critical for increasing the cost-effectiveness of bioethanol production. In this context, the multi-protein cellulolytic complex of Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum, the cellulosome, was studied here. C. thermocellum is known to assemble cellulosomes of various subunit (enzyme) compositions, in response to the available carbon source. In the current study, different carbon sources were used, and their influence on both cellulosomal composition and the resultant activity was investigated. Results: Glucose, cellobiose, microcrystalline cellulose, alkaline-pretreated switchgrass, alkaline-pretreated corn stover, and dilute acid-pretreated corn stover were used as sole carbon sources in the growth media of C. thermocellum strain DSM 1313. The purified cellulosomes were compared for their activity on selected cellulosic substrates. Interestingly, cellulosomes derived from cells grown on lignocellulosic biomass showed no advantage in hydrolyzing the original carbon source used for their production. Instead, microcrystalline cellulose- and glucose-derived cellulosomes were equal or superior in their capacity to deconstruct lignocellulosic biomass. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed differential composition of catalytic and structural subunits (scaffoldins) in the different cellulosome samples. The most abundant catalytic subunits in all cellulosome types include Cel48S, Cel9K, Cel9Q, Cel9R, and Cel5G. Microcrystalline cellulose- and glucose-derived cellulosome samples showed higher endoglucanase-to-exoglucanase ratios and higher catalytic subunit-per-scaffoldin ratios compared to lignocellulose-derived cellulosome types. Conclusion: The results reported here highlight the finding that cellulosomes derived from cells grown on glucose and microcrystalline cellulose are more efficient in their action on cellulosic substrates than other cellulosome preparations. These results should be considered in the future development of C. thermocellum-based cellulolytic cocktails, designer cellulosomes, or engineering of improved strains for deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Concern about the inevitable depletion of global energy resources is rising and many countries are shifting their focus to renewable energy. Biodiesel is one promising energy source that has garnered much public attention in recent years. Many believe that this alternative source of energy will be able to sustain the need for increased energy security while at the same time being friendly to the environment. Public opinion, as well as proactive measures by key players in industry, may play a decisive role in steering the direction of biodiesel development throughout the world. Past studies have suggested that public acceptance of biofuels could be shaped by critical consideration of the risk-benefit perceptions of the product, in addition to the impact on the economy and environment. Results: The purpose of this study was to identify the relevant factors influencing stakeholders' attitudes towards biodiesel derived from crops such as palm oil for vehicle use, as well as to analyse the interrelationships of these factors in an attitude model. A survey of 509 respondents, consisting of various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia, was undertaken. The results of the study have substantiated the premise that the most important direct predictor of attitude to biodiesel is the perceived benefits (β = 0.80, p < 0.001). Attitude towards biodiesel also involves the interplay between other factors, such as engagement to biotechnology, trust of key players, attitude to technology, and perceived risk. Conclusion: Although perceived benefit has emerged as the main predictor of public support of biodiesel, the existence of other significant interactions among variables leads to the conclusion that public attitude towards biodiesel should be seen as a multi-faceted process and should be strongly considered prior to its commercialisation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Use of bio-based diesel is increasing in Europe. It is currently produced from oilseed crops, but can also be generated from lignocellulosic biomass such as straw. However, removing straw affects soil organic carbon (SOC), with potential consequences for the climate impact of the biofuel. This study assessed the climate impacts and energy balance of biodiesel production from straw using oleaginous yeast, with subsequent biogas production from the residues, with particular emphasis on SOC changes over time. It also explored the impact of four different scenarios for returning the lignin fraction of the biomass to soil to mitigate SOC changes. Climate impact was assessed using two methods, global warming potential (GWP) and a time-dependent temperature model (ΔT s ) that describes changes in mean global surface temperature as a function of time or absolute temperature change potential (AGTP). Results: Straw-derived biodiesel reduced GWP by 33-80% compared with fossil fuels and primary fossil energy use for biodiesel production was 0.33-0.80 MJprim/MJ, depending on the scenario studied. Simulations using the time-dependent temperature model showed that a scenario where all straw fractions were converted to energy carriers and no lignin was returned to soil resulted in the highest avoided climate impact. The SOC changes due to straw removal had a large impact on the results, both when using GWP and the time-dependent temperature model. Conclusions: In a climate perspective, it is preferable to combust straw lignin to produce electricity rather than returning it to the soil if the excess electricity replaces natural gas electricity, according to results from both GWP and time-dependent temperature modelling. Using different methods to assess climate impact did not change the ranking between the scenarios, but the time-dependent temperature model provided information about system behaviour over time that can be important for evaluation of biofuel systems, particularly in relation to climate target deadlines. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha), a shrub species of the family Euphorbiaceae, has been recognized as a promising biofuel plant for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent attempts at commercial cultivation in Africa and Asia have failed because of low productivity. It is important to elucidate genetic diversity and relationship in worldwide Jatropha genetic resources for breeding of better commercial cultivars. Here, genetic diversity was analyzed by using 246 accessions from Mesoamerica, Africa and Asia, based on 59 simple sequence repeat markers and eight retrotransposonbased insertion polymorphism markers. We found that central Chiapas of Mexico possesses the most diverse genetic resources, and the Chiapas Central Depression could be the center of origin. We identified three genetic groups in Mesoamerica, whose distribution revealed a distinct geographic cline. One of them consists mainly of accessions from central Chiapas. This suggests that it represents the original genetic group. We found two Veracruz accessions in another group, whose ancestors might be shipped from Port of Veracruz to the Old World, to be the source of all African and Asian Jatropha. Our results suggest the human selection that caused low productivity in Africa and Asia, and also breeding strategies to improve African and Asian Jatropha. Cultivars improved in the productivity will contribute to expand mass commercial cultivation of Jatropha in Africa and Asia to increase biofuel production, and finally will support in the battle against the climate change. © 2017 Li, Tsuchimoto, Harada, Yamasaki, Sakai, Wada, Alipour, Sasai, Tsunekawa, Tsujimoto, Ando, Tomemori, Sato, Hirakawa, Quintero, Zamarripa, Santos, Hegazy, Ali and Fukui.

AB  - Background: (Pseudo) Bacteroides cellulosolvens is an anaerobic, mesophilic, cellulolytic, cellulosome-producing clostridial bacterium capable of utilizing cellulose and cellobiose as carbon sources. Recently, we sequenced the B. cellulosolvens genome, and subsequent comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, herein reported, revealed an unprecedented number of cellulosome-related components, including 78 cohesin modules scattered among 31 scaffoldins and more than 200 dockerin-bearing ORFs. In terms of numbers, the B. cellulosolvens cellulosome system represents the most intricate, compositionally diverse cellulosome system yet known in nature. Results: The organization of the B. cellulosolvens cellulosome is unique compared to previously described cellulosome systems. In contrast to all other known cellulosomes, the cohesin types are reversed for all scaffoldins i.e., the type II cohesins are located on the enzyme-integrating primary scaffoldin, whereas the type I cohesins are located on the anchoring scaffoldins. Many of the type II dockerin-bearing ORFs include X60 modules, which are known to stabilize type II cohesin-dockerin interactions. In the present work, we focused on revealing the architectural arrangement of cellulosome structure in this bacterium by examining numerous interactions between the various cohesin and dockerin modules. In total, we cloned and expressed 43 representative cohesins and 27 dockerins. The results revealed various possible architectures of cell-anchored and cell-free cellulosomes, which serve to assemble distinctive cellulosome types via three distinct cohesin-dockerin specificities: type I, type II, and a novel-type designated R (distinct from type III interactions, predominant in ruminococcal cellulosomes). Conclusions: The results of this study provide novel insight into the architecture and function of the most intricate and extensive cellulosomal system known today, thereby extending significantly our overall knowledge base of cellulosome systems and their components. The robust cellulosome system of B. cellulosolvens, with its unique binding specificities and reversal of cohesin-dockerin types, has served to amend our view of the cellulosome paradigm. Revealing new cellulosomal interactions and arrangements is critical for designing high-efficiency artificial cellulosomes for conversion of plant-derived cellulosic biomass towards improved production of biofuels. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The main goals for sustainable water resource recovery include maximizing energy generation, minimizing adverse environmental impacts, and recovering beneficial resources. Wastewater biosolids pyrolysis is a promising technology that could help facilities reach these goals because it produces biochar that is a valuable soil amendment as well as bio-oil and pyrolysis gas (py-gas) that can be used for energy. The raw bio-oil, however, is corrosive; therefore, employing it as fuel is challenging using standard equipment. A novel pyrolysis process using wastewater biosolids-derived biochar (WB-biochar) as a catalyst was investigated to decrease bio-oil and increase py-gas yield for easier energy recovery. WB-biochar catalyst increased the py-gas yield nearly 2-fold, while decreasing bio-oil production. The catalyzed bio-oil also contained fewer constituents based on GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. The energy shifted from bio-oil to py-gas, indicating the potential for easier on-site energy recovery using the relatively clean py-gas. The metals contained in wastewater biosolids played an important role in upgrading pyrolysis products. The Ca and Fe in WB-biochar reduced bio-oil yield and increased py-gas yield. The py-gas energy increase may be especially useful at water resource recovery facilities that already combust anaerobic digester biogas for energy since it may be possible to blend biogas and py-gas for combined use. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a viable option for the production of renewable energy and agricultural resources from diverted organic waste streams. This high temperature thermochemical process yields material with beneficial reuses, including bio-oil and biochar. Gaseous forms of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are also emitted during pyrolysis. The effluent mass emission rates from pyrolysis are not well characterized, thus limiting proper evaluation of the environmental benefits or costs of pyrolysis products. We present the first comprehensive suite of C and N mass emission rate measurements of a biomass pyrolysis process that uses chicken manure as the feedstock to produce biochar and bio-oil. Two chicken manure fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted at controlled temperature ranges of 450-485 °C and 550-585 °C. Mass emission rates of nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) were measured using trace gas analyzers. Based on the system mass balance, 23-25% of the total mass of the manure feedstock was emitted as gas, while 52-55% and 23% were converted to bio-oil and biochar, respectively. CO2 and NH3 were the dominant gaseous species by mass, accounting for 58-65% of total C mass emitted and 99% of total reactive N mass emitted, respectively. Temperature variations within the two set of temperature ranges had a perfunctory effect on bio-oil production and gaseous emissions, but the higher temperature range process produced more bio-oil and slightly less emissions. However, a larger effect on the relative amounts of CO and CO2 produced were observed between the different temperature regimes. These results have important implications for greenhouse gas and reactive N life cycle assessments of biochar and bio-oil. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abandoned cropland (ACL) is often cited as a land resource on which to produce energy crops while reducing the negative impacts of broad-scale energy crop production; for example, carbon emissions from land-cover change and competition with food production. In contrast to marginal land, which refers to a set of biophysical and economic criteria usually imposed by experts or policymakers, the designation of ACL refers to a land-use decision by a land owner. As such, ACL is argued to be a more appropriate indication of land availability for dedicated energy crop production. Prevailing estimates of ACL in the United States vary widely due to inconsistent treatment of land-use conversions away from cropland and overreliance on remote sensing methods that measure land cover, even though ACL is a category of land use. This article develops and applies a replicable and flexible methodology to estimate available abandoned cropland (AACL) at the county level in the United States, which accounts for conversion of ACL to forest cover, urban development, or permanent pasture. Estimates of AACL are derived for two scenarios: (1) land abandoned between 1978 and 2012, which excludes lands with meaningful forest regrowth, and (2) land abandoned between 2007 and 2012, which corresponds to land-use constraints imposed by the Renewable Fuel Standard. Results show that 15.0 and 4.9 Mha of AACL exist in the United States in the two scenarios, respectively, amounting to between only 3 and 8 percent of total light-duty gasoline consumption in the United States. The policy implications of these findings and the need for future research are discussed. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - British Columbia's (BC) Greenhouse Gas Reduction (GHGR) Targets Act (GHGRTA) contains ambitious goals of reducing province-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% in 2050 (relative to 2007). With ∼38% of BC's GHG emissions stemming from transportation (in 2012), it is clear that BC's climate goals can only be realized with an effective climate policy for transport fuel activities. Enacted in December 2009, the GHGR Renewable and Low Carbon Fuel Requirement (RLCFR) Act and Regulation have achieved significant life cycle GHG emissions reductions accredited to its enforcement: 904,900 t CO2eq (2012). At face value, this is a great success. However, several accounting issues suggest that these GHG emissions reductions are inaccurate. In this study, the GHG emissions reductions achieved with the RLCFR are first analyzed by fuel source and transport mode. Next, the methodology for determining the life-cycle carbon intensity (CI) factors of each fuel are analyzed, with a particular focus on how indirect land use change (iLUC) is dealt with. The findings of this study suggest that the RLCFR legislation has not been nearly as effective as proclaimed by the BC government. Nevertheless, this transport fuel regulation is essential if BC wants to achieve its future GHG emissions reduction targets. Several recommendations are provided. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Waste from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for Helianthus annuus L. production may be a viable solution to obtain biodiesel. This study achieved two objectives: assess the agronomical viability of waste (wastewater and sludge) from the Alcázar de San Juan WWTP in central Spain for H. annuus L. production; use H. annuus L. seeds grown in this way to obtain biodiesel. Five study plots, each measuring 6 m × 6 m (36 m2), were set up on the agricultural land near the Alcázar de San Juan WWTP. Five fertilizer treatment types were considered: drinking water, as the control; treated wastewater; 10 t ha−1 of air-dried sewage sludge; 20 t ha−1 of air-dried sewage sludge; 0.6 t ha−1 of commercial inorganic fertilizer. Soil, irrigation water, sewage sludge, crop development and fatty acid composition in achenes oil were monitored. The 20 t ha–1 dose of sewage sludge proved effective to grow H. annuus L. with similar results to those grown with a commercial fertilizer. However, precautions should be taken when irrigating with wastewater because of high salinity and nutrient deficiency. Sunflower oil was composed mostly of linoleic and oleic acid. The remaining fatty acids were linolenic, estearic, nervonic, palmitoleic, and palmitic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective. To assess the economic and financial feasibility of traditional silvopastoral systems for the biofuels production as a contribution to the sustainability of “Piñón for Galapagos” project. Materials and methods. A survey was conducted to 450 small livestock producer in 10 cantons of the Manabí province in order to collect basic agronomic knowledge, management, establishment and costs involved in production of the Piñón ((Jatropha curcas L.)/Savoy (Megathyrsus maximus) silvopastoral systems. For Piñón CP041 production recording plantation in live fence were stablished and for the tradition Piñón, the production of 10 sites were recorded, both systems since 2009. With those data were calculated the following economic indicators: ratio benefit/cost, net present value (NPV), internal rate ratio (IRR) and land expectation value (LEV). Results. The study exhibited a production decrease of Piñón with the passage of time. The CP041 INIAP improved silvopastoral system Piñón showed a B/C 1.07, NPV of USD$ 404.11, LEV US$ 970.23 and IRR of 18%. Followed by silvopastoral system with a local Piñón with a B/C 1.06, NPV of USD$ 363.66, LEV USD$ 873.10 and IRR of 17% and finally silvopastoral system without harvesting Piñón with a B/C 1.05, NPV of USD$ 285.72, LEV USD$ 685.99 and IRR of 15%. Conclusions. The alternative biofuels production was the silvopastoral systems (INIAP CP041)/Savoya in Manabí and is economically feasible. This system does not compete for arable land for food production and would not affect food security. © 2017. All rights reserved

AB  - Marginal farm land is land characterised by low food, feed and fodder crop productivity due to soil and environmental limitations. Such land may however be utilised for bio-energy crop production. We investigate the economic viability of small scale combined heat and power anaerobic digestion (CHP AD) projects based on feedstock from farm waste and bio-energy crops grown on a representative temperate latitude marginal farm land in the UK. Using a realistic set of five project feedstock-mix scenarios, and considering standard technology and current market and policy regimes, we deploy a stochastic framework to assess prices of electricity required for these projects to break-even and conduct sensitivity analyses of key project parameters. Accounting for the current market prices and policy tariffs for heat, we find that critical electricity sale prices of about 17.46 p/kWh to 27.12 p/kWh are needed for the projects to break even. These prices are well above the current combined feed-in-tariff support and market prices for electricity over the past years in the UK.We conclude that the use of marginal land to generate power for export using small-scale CHP AD in the UK and the wider temperate latitude countries is unviable, if energy and farming policy regimes do not provide substantial support. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel from higher plants has a number of limitations like burden on limited agricultural land and fresh water resources, especially in poor developing nations. On the other hand wastelands can be effectively used for the cultivation of microalgae and potential yields from many green algae have been reported to be many folds to that obtained from the oil crops. Productivity in natural habitats is generally limited by low nitrogen and phosphorus content. Present study deals with the application of main nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus stress conditions commonly found in natural water bodies on stimulating the biofuel components oils in Chlorella vulgaris, a unicellular freshwater green alga and a potential feedstock for biodiesel. Oils from the algal biomass were extracted in chloroform-methanol (2:1) and identified by GC-MS. Significantly reduced concentrations of the nutrients Ca(NO3)2 and K2HPO4 from the control values of Chu-10 medium positively affected the oil content without much affecting the growth. There was also a significant effect on the relative ratios of various types of oils produced by the algal strain in response to the nutrient stress conditions. Mostly C14 to C26 fatty acids were identified, with palmitic, oleic and stearic acids being the major ones. The relative proportion of the desirable biofuel component, palmitic acid, was increased significantly under NO3- and PO43-stress conditions. These findings suggest that monitoring the concentrations of a few nutrients may lead to significant enhancement in quantity as well as the desirable biofuel components with substantial growth for commercial cultivation of C. vulgaris for bioenergy production. © 2017, SciTechnol, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The U.S. cellulosic biofuel mandate has not been enforced in recent years. Uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the mandate in addition to high production and harvest cost have contributed to a delay in the widespread planting of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. Previous literature has shown that under uncertainty and sunk cost, an investment threshold is further increased due to the value associated from holding the investment option. In this paper, we extend the previous literature by applying a real option switching model to bioenergy crop production. First, we calculate the county-level break-even price which triggers a switching away from traditional field crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat) to bioenergy crops under various scenarios differing by commodity prices, production cost and biomass price expectations. We show that the resulting break-even prices at the county-level can be substantially higher than previously estimated due to the inclusion of the option value. In a second step, we identify counties that are most likely to grow switchgrass or miscanthus by simulating a stochastic biomass price over time. Our results highlight two issues: First, switchgrass or miscanthus are not grown in the Midwest under any scenario. Under low agricultural residue removal rates, biomass crops are mostly grown in the Southeast. Second, under the assumption of a high removal rates, bioenergy crops are not grown anywhere in the U.S. since the cellulosic biofuel mandate can be covered by agricultural residues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Heat transport is an important factor that can influence the soil environment. The objective of this study was to determine if perennial biofuel and cover crops could alter soil thermal properties. Experimental treatments included two levels of cover crops (cover crops [CC] vs. no cover crops) [NC], collectively called row crops (RC), and two biofuel crop treatments. Cover crops used included cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa subsp. villosa), and Austrian winter pea [Pisum sativum subsp. arvense (L.) Asch. & Graebn]. The two biofuel treatments included perennial biofuel crops (PB): Giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus J.M. Greef & Deuter ex Hodkinson & Renvoize) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Soil samples were collected at 10-cm depth increments from the soil surface to a depth of 30 cm. Soil thermal properties (thermal conductivity [l], volumetric heat capacity [CV], thermal diffusivity [D]), and volumetric water content (q) were determined at 0, -33, -100 and -300 kPa soil water matric potentials. Additionally, bulk density and soil organic C (SOC) were determined. Results showed that PB had 11% higher CV at saturation, probably because they had significantly higher q and SOC than RC management. Cover crops had 13% higher CV at saturation probably because they had significantly higher q and SOC than no cover crop management. Row crops had significantly higher λ and D than PB. The results from the current study imply that CC and PB can change soil thermal properties by reducing l and D and increasing CV under laboratory conditions. © 2017 Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Biofuels can potentially reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from energy use and help address the climate change problem. However, the siting and operation of a biofuel production facility can impact the members of the host community both positively (e.g. local jobs and income) and negatively (e.g. pollution and noise). Such ambivalent and heterogeneous external impacts result in either local support or opposition to the facility, which in turn becomes a key factor affecting biorefinery location decisions, and subsequent success of biorefineries. While a number of prior studies have analyzed economic and environmental impacts of biofuels, systematic analysis of local acceptability of biofuel production facilities is lacking. Our study explores factors that influence community attitudes towards biofuel facilities. We assess the strength of acceptability or opposition by estimating the local community's willingness to pay (WTP) either to support or to oppose a proposed biorefinery. We posit that such WTP estimates provide a more comprehensive measure of local acceptability. Results also suggest that county level socio-economic characteristics significantly influence these attitudes and WTP. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The paper aims to analyse the relationship between energy prices (biodiesel, crude oil) and food commodities - vegetable oils used also as feedstock for biodiesel production. The econometric technique of price transmission, such as unit root test, cointegration test and vector error correction model, is applied to assess the interdependencies between energy prices and vegetable oil prices in Germany. Results suggest close price linkages between prices of vegetable oils and biodiesel and confirm that the vegetable oil prices drive the price dynamics of biodiesel. However, the simultaneous relationship is only revealed between biodiesel and soybean oil prices. The increase in crude oil prices is found to lead to an upward trend in the vegetable oils used for biodiesel production, thus influencing biodiesel prices as well.

AB  - Knowledge about environmental impacts associated with the application of anaerobic digestion residue to agricultural land is of interest owing to the rapid proliferation of biogas plants worldwide. However, virtually no information exists concerning how soil-emitted N2O is affected by the feedstock hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the biogas digester. Here, the O2 planar optode technique was used to visualize soil O2 dynamics following the surface application of digestates of the codigestion of pig slurry and agro-industrial waste. We also used N2O isotopomer analysis of soil-emitted N2O to determine the N2O production pathways, i.e., nitrification or denitrification. Two-dimensional images of soil O2 indicated that anoxic and hypoxic conditions developed at 2.0- and 1.5-cm soil depth for soil amended with the digestate produced with 15-d (PO15) and 30-d (PO30) retention time, respectively. Total N2O emissions were significantly lower for PO15 than PO30 due to the greater expansion of the anoxic zone, which enhanced N2O reduction via complete denitrification. However, cumulative CO2 emissions were not significantly different between PO15 and PO30 for the entire incubation period. During incubation, N2O emissions came from both nitrification and denitrification in amended soils. Increasing the HRT of the biogas digester appears to induce significant N2O emissions, but it is unlikely to affect the N2O production pathways after application to soil. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Cool-season (C3) perennial grasses have a long history of cultivation and use as animal forage. This study evaluated 15 cultivars of C3 grasses, when harvested in late June for increased biomass yield, as biofuel feedstocks using near- infrared spectroscopy (NIR) based partial least square (PLS) analysis. These grasses were grown near Iliff, CO, for three growing seasons (2009–2011). The carbohydrate composition and released carbohydrates (total glucose and xylose released from dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis [EH]) were predicted for samples from the study using NIR/PLS. The results were analyzed from a biofuels perspective, where composition combined with harvest yield provided information on the carbohydrate yield available for biomass conversion processes, and released carbohydrate yield provided information on the accessibility of those carbohydrates to conversion methods. The range in harvest yields varied more among cultivars (2900 kg ha–1) than did the range in carbohydrate composition (56.0 g kg–1) or released carbohydrates (60.0 g kg–1). When comparing carbohydrate yield to released carbohydrate yield between cultivars, an efficiency as high as 87% release of available carbohydrates was obtained for pubescent wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth &amp; D.R. Dewey ‘Mansaka’], with a low of 71% for hybrid wheatgrass [Elytrigia repens (L.) nevski ´ pseudo-roegneria spicata (PURSH) A. Love ‘Newhy’]. Though hybrid wheatgrass had the lowest release efficiency, its high harvest yield resulted in release of more total carbohydrates than half the other cultivars analyzed. This suggested that harvest yield, carbohydrate release, and carbohydrate composition, together-play significant roles in biofuel feedstock evaluation. © 2017 American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a potential bioenergy crop recommended by the U.S. Department of Energy. To produce biofuel from switchgrass, high cellulose and low lignin concentrations are ideal for biochemical conversion while high lignin and energy content are desirable for thermochemical conversion. These values change during plant growth. The objective of this study was to identify the optimum harvest window using a one-cut system. Thirteen and eight harvests were collected in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and analyzed for cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, total C, and energy content. Generally, cellulose and hemicellulose concentrations increased through July, remained relatively constant for the remainder of the study period (through early November), and were unaffected by drought. Carbon concentrations increased significantly with plant growth then decreased significantly in July/August, presumably due to reproductive growth, followed by a significant increase in September or October of 2011 and 2012 due to senescence. Drought in early 2012 may have caused small changes in C concentration as compared to 2011. Energy content increased significantly early in the season, and remained similar between August and November while lignin concentrations increased. Both parameters, however, were relatively unaffected by the 2012 drought. It was concluded that switchgrass could be harvested as early as late August (earlier than the current recommended period of after 1 November or killing frost) depending on the requirements of the conversion method. More research is needed to determine whether early or delayed harvests have a greater economic impact on overall fuel yields in drought or normal years. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - C4 plants are major grain (maize [Zea mays] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor]), sugar (sugarcane [Saccharum officinarum]), and biofuel (Miscanthus spp.) producers and contribute ~20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO2 (assimilation [A]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (gS). The ability to mechanistically predict gS and A in response to atmospheric CO2, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for gS are lacking, especially for C4 photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C4 photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C4 grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of gS to light, atmospheric CO2 and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C4 plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C4 grasses may have supported the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - This paper develops a lifecycle economic analysis (LCEA) model that integrates endogenous input substitution into the standard lifecycle analysis (LCA) of biofuel that typically assumes fixed-proportions production. We use the LCEA model to examine impacts of a pure carbon tax and a revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic ethanol using forest residues as feedstock in Washington State. In a model allowing for input substitution in the cellulosic ethanol feedstock, conversion, and transportation process, we consider energy source substitution (woody biomass for coal in the cellulosic ethanol conversion plant and biodiesel for diesel in feedstock production and feedstock and ethanol transportation) as well as substitution of capital and labor for energy in all stages of the lifecycle. We find that ignoring endogenous input substitution by using standard LCA leads to substantial underestimation of the impact of carbon tax policies on carbon emissions. Both tax policies can substantially reduce carbon emissions by inducing substitution among inputs. The revenue-neutral tax-subsidy policy reduces emissions more effectively than the carbon tax policy for carbon tax rates currently in place throughout most of the world. It stimulates substitution of woody biomass for coal and biodiesel for diesel at much lower tax rates when accompanied by corresponding subsidies for reduced emissions from renewable sources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reports the conclusions of the three panel discussions held during the WasteEng2016 Conference in Albi, France (http://www.wasteeng2016.org/). It explores the research and development trends aiming at the production of energy and added value materials from waste and/or biomass. Three approaches are investigated: thermochemical conversion (Panel chairs: M. Castaldi, J.M. Lavoie, C. Vandecasteele), biochemical conversion (Panel chairs: J. Legrand, P.T. Vasudevan, W. Verstraete) and, sustainable construction and energy storage (Panel chairs: J. van Deventer, Y. Pontikes, X. Py). The thermochemical conversion session addressed feedstock, technologies for energy recovery and material recycling, gas cleaning and the marketplace. It is shown that combustion (WtE) is the leading technology and that also much research is devoted to gasification and pyrolysis. The biochemical conversion session noted the ability to yield products applied to different sectors such as food and feed, chemical, biofuels, biomaterials and many others. Innovation oriented towards better exploitation of the existing biocatalytic activity of known enzymes and microbes is also discussed. Recycling of solid and liquid waste received substantial focus in construction. Materials for thermal energy storage from waste are considered a promising use of recycled materials. The paper also shows how entrepreneurs introducing new technology have to work with both technical and commercial uncertainty, which renders investment into new technology a high risk. Finally, this paper identifies, in the three sections developed below, the trends for ongoing research and highlights the direction where the research is trending from this point forward. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We present a game-theoretic model to analyze the role of two major biofuel policies in the U.S., namely mandates and subsidies, and their implications to biofuel industry development. By characterizing the farmers' land use decision (land allocation among food, energy, and reservation) and biofuel firm's mandate compliance strategy (whether to comply with the mandate or not), we identify the complementarity roles of mandate and subsidy. We further illustrate the impact of coordination in the two policy instruments; lack of coordination may result in excessive biofuel mandate in the early stage of industry development, while it may lead to insufficient mandate during the matured stage. With a case study based on the U.S. Midwest, we address recent trends in the U.S. biofuel industry and further discuss related policy insights. © 2017

AB  - In their recent publication “Carbon balance effects of U.S. biofuel production and use,” DeCicco et al. present an empirical assessment of net CO2 emission effects over the period 2005–2013 after the US renewable fuel standard (RFS) came into existence and conclude that biofuels have resulted in a net increase in CO2 emissions over the period. The analysis presented by DeCicco et al. relies on three key assertions. First, that if biofuel carbon combustion emissions are not completely offset by additional net ecosystem production (NEP), then the biofuel should not receive full biogenic carbon credit. Second, that changes in agricultural NEP related to biofuel production can be accurately estimated from national-level agricultural production statistics. Third, that agricultural NEP is a pertinent measure of biofuel global warming impacts. We show that following the conventional definition of NEP the combustion of biofuel by definition leads to an exactly equal increase in NEP; therefore, the first assertion is not meaningful. Regarding the second assertion, we show that estimation of biofuel-related NEP changes from agricultural production statistics is not a robust methodology. Finally, we argue that agricultural NEP is an important parameter for estimating land-use change effects, but in isolation is an irrelevant GHG metric for current biofuels. We find that the conclusions above from DeCicco et al. are unfounded and do not invalidate the application of biogenic carbon offsets in life cycle assessments of biofuels currently used in national and international regulations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The impact of substituting biofuels for fossil fuels on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has been debated for many years. A reason for the lack of resolution is that the method widely used to address the question, lifecycle analysis (LCA), is subjective. Its results irreducibly depend on untestable assumptions, notably those pertaining to system boundaries but also those for representing market effects. The best one can do is empirically constrain estimates of net CO2 impact using data that characterize important aspects of the overall system. Our 2016 paper, “Carbon balance effects of U.S. biofuel production and use,” took such an approach, using field data to estimate the direct CO2 exchanges for a circumscribed vehicle-fuel system over the 2005–2013 period of expanding US biofuel use. De Kleine and colleagues criticize our work because it does not follow LCA conventions, arguing in particular for the primacy of the assumption that biofuels are inherently carbon neutral. This response refutes their critique; it reminds readers why the lifecycle paradigm fails for a dynamic system involving the terrestrial carbon cycle, stresses the need to bound an analysis of key carbon exchanges, and explains why the circular logic of LCA can be so beguiling. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Catering waste and orange peel were co-digested using an anaerobic digestion process. Orange peel is difficult to degrade anaerobically due to the presence of antimicrobial agents such as limonene. The present study aimed to examine the feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of catering waste with orange peel to provide the optimum nutrient balance with reduced inhibitory effects of orange peel. Batch experiments were conducted using catering waste as a potential substrate mixed in varying ratios (20–50%) with orange peel. Similar ratios were followed using green vegetable waste as co-substrate. The results showed that the highest organic matter degradation (49%) was achieved with co-digestion of catering waste and orange peel at a 50% mixing ratio (CF4). Similarly, the soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) was increased by 51% and reached its maximum value (9040 mg l-1) due to conversion of organic matter from insoluble to soluble form. Biogas production was increased by 1.5 times in CF4 where accumulative biogas was 89.61 m3 t-1 substrate compared with 57.35 m3 t-1 substrate in the control after 80 days. The main reason behind the improved biogas production and degradation is the dilution of inhibitory factors (limonene), with subsequent provision of balanced nutrients in the co-digestion system. The tCOD of the final digestate was decreased by 79.9% in CF4, which was quite high as compared with 68.3% for the control. Overall, this study revealed that orange peel waste is a highly feasible co-substrate for anaerobic digestion with catering waste for enhanced biogas production. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Environmental building recommendations aimed towards new environmental policies and management-changing decisions which as example demonstrated in consideration of the problems of Canadian oil sands operators. For the implementation of the circular economic strategy, we use an in-depth analysis of reported environmental after-consequence on all stages of the production process. The study addressed the promotion of innovative solutions for greenhouse gas emission, waste mitigation, and risk of falling in oil prices for operators of oil sands with creating market opportunities. They include the addition of microalgae biomass in tailings ponds for improvement of the microbial balance for the water speedily cleaning, recycling, and reusing with mitigation of GHG emissions. The use of food scraps for the nutrition of microalgae will reduce greenhouse gas emission minimally, on 0.33 MtCO2eq for Alberta and 2.63 MtCO2eq/year for Canada. Microalgae-derived biofuel can reduce this emission for Alberta on 11.9–17.9 MtCO2eq and for Canada on 71–106 MtCO2eq/year, and the manufacturing of other products will adsorb up to 135.6 MtCO2 and produce 99.2 MtO2. The development of the Live Conserve Industry and principal step from non-efficient protection of the environment to its cultivation in a large scale with mitigation of GHG emission and waste as well as generating of O2 and value-added products by the use of microalgae opens an important shift towards a new design and building of a biological system. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Thermobifidas are thermophilic, aerobic, lignocellulose decomposing actinomycetes. The Thermobifida genus includes four species: T. fusca, T. alba, T. cellulosilytica, and T. halotolerans. T. fusca YX is the far best characterized strain of this taxon and several cellulases and hemicellulases have been cloned from it for industrial purposes targeting paper industry, biofuel, and feed applications. Unfortunately, sequence data of such enzymes are almost exclusively restricted to this single species; however, we demonstrated earlier by zymography that other T. alba and T. cellulosilytica strains encode the same enzyme sets. Recently, the advances in whole genome sequencing by the use of next generation genomics platforms accelerated the selection process of valuable hydrolases from uncharacterized bacterial species for cloning purposes. For this purpose T. cellulosilytica TB100T type strain was chosen for de novo genome sequencing. We have assembled the genome of T. cellulosilytica strain TB100T into 168 contigs and 19 scaffolds, with reference length of 4 327 869 bps, 3 589 putative coding sequences, 53 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. The analysis of the annotated genome revealed the existence of 27 putative hydrolases belonging to 14 different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. The investigation of identified, cloned, and heterologously multiple cellulases, mannanases, xylanases, and amylases may result in industrial applications beside gaining useful basic research related information. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The land use change (LUC) and application of N fertilizers have potential to affect soil C and N dynamics and long–term C and N stocks. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the LUC from native vegetation (seasonal semideciduous forest) to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) cultivation under successive annual N fertilizer applications on chemical and microbiological attributes of sugarcane–cropped soils. Two field trials were performed during three (Site 1) or four years (Site 2) in southeastern Brazil. Soil sampling was carried out in the following N treatments applied to the crop: control (N–unfertilized plots), organomineral fertilizer (100 kg ha−1 yr−1 N), and synthetic fertilizer (100 and 200 kg ha−1 yr−1 N). Soil samples from native vegetation located near each site were also taken, to serve as reference for studying LUC. For Site 1, successive application of N fertilizers on sugarcane managed under green cane trash blanketing system maintained the C and N dynamics and stocks in soil to conditions similar to those found before LUC. At Site 2, however, modifications in soil attributes caused by LUC were more impacting than the N fertilization management. Compared to synthetic N fertilizers, successive application of organomineral fertilizer did not improve the soil microbiological attributes as well as organic C and total N stocks. Lastly, successive high N input (200 kg ha−1 yr−1, via synthetic fertilizer) promoted accumulation of mineral N deep in the soil profile, thus increasing potential losses through NO3 − leaching. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biopropane made by hydrogenating vegetable or animal oil/fat is being commercialized as a biofuel alternative to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Its carbon footprint has been calculated from field to tank, using public data for each process in the supply chain, for six main feedstocks: palm oil, palm oil fatty acid distillate, tallow, used cooking oil, rape oil, and soy oil. Scenarios have been applied to the calculations using four main variables: allocation method, i.e., economic or energy; methane capture at the oil mill (or not); application of indirect land-use change (or not); and classification of the feedstock as a residue (or not). HVO biopropane's carbon footprint varies, depending on the feedstock and the four variables, from as low as 5 g CO2e/MJ to as high as 102 g. In most cases, this qualifies for government support, i.e., financial credits and biofuel mandates enacted by EU member states under the Renewable Energy Directive. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Considering its size and expanding population, Africa needs to play a more active role in preventing global warming. The economy of most West African countries is driven by agriculture and the export of processed wood resulting in the generation of tons of wood and agricultural waste. The waste is usually disposed of by burning, which releases harmful greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the environment. Wood and agricultural wastes are valuable biomass feedstocks for second-generation biofuels and chemicals. The availability of diverse feedstocks makes the West African sub-region suitable for setting up biorefineries. However, the limiting factors for establishing biorefineries such as appropriate technology, infrastructure and forward-looking policies have to be addressed. The currently high cost of biofuel production and competitive crude oil prices also make it seem unfeasible for West African countries and other developing economies to invest in this industry. Therefore, we present an idea for developing a multipurpose modular biorefinery model to meet the energy needs of the region with an added advantage of creating new markets and jobs. We also discuss what new energy policies should be focused on in order to fast-track the development of the bioenergy sector. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Integrated landscape management has emerged in recent years as a methodology to integrate the environmental impacts of various agricultural practices along with yield and profitability in a variety of cropping systems. In this study, the Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF), a decision support toolset for use in integrated landscape management and developed at Idaho National Laboratory, was used to evaluate the profitability of grain-producing subfields, to determine the efficacy of sustainably harvesting residual biomass after grain harvest, and to determine the efficacy of integrating bioenergy crops into grain-producing landscapes to enhance farmer profitability. Three bioenergy crops, sorghum, switchgrass, and miscanthus, were integrated into non-profitable subfields in four US counties. The manuscript describes in detail the material and methods used to define crop rotations, land management units and practices, subfield units and productivity, grain profitability, sustainability criteria, energy crop integration, and feedstock cost estimation. With the integration of bioenergy crops, the overall annual biomass production rates in the four counties could be increased by factors ranging from 0.8 to 21, depending on the energy crop and county, over the annual residue biomass production rates. By modeling the harvesting of residual biomass and energy crops using geo-referenced, precision harvesting equipment and optimal harvesting paths on individual subfields, the average logistics costs including harvesting of both residual biomass and energy crops were observed to fall well below US DOE’s 2017 goals for biomass feedstock price of US$84/ton or US$92.6/dry Mg. Miscanthus, grown in counties in Ohio and Kansas, provided the maximum potential, among the three energy crops considered, for increment in biomass production and also posed maximum threat to the grain production. Considerable variability was observed in the harvesting and total costs because of the size, shape, and productivity of individual subfields. It was shown that variability in the harvesting costs could be used to down-select non-profitable farms with low harvesting costs and high residue and bioenergy crop yields and to reduce the negative impacts of bioenergy crop integration into croplands on grain production. The results of the assessment suggest that (1) the potential to produce biomass is considerably enhanced when non-profitable grain-producing subfields are replaced by bioenergy crops and (2) the subfield-scale integrated landscape assessment provides a defensible methodology to directly address individual farmer’s profitability, sustainability, and environmental stewardship. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) has potential as a bioenergy crop in poorly drained cropland in much of temperate North America. Our objectives were (1) describe morphological differences between two prairie cordgrass populations and switchgrass for biomass production and pattern of biomass accumulation in leaf and stem tissue, (2) estimate genetic variation for biomass production and other agronomic traits in a population of prairie cordgrass from South Dakota, and (3) increase knowledge of the impact of insects on biomass production of prairie cordgrass. On poorly drained cropland in South Dakota, a natural population of prairie cordgrass (SD CG) from South Dakota produced 75% more biomass than a natural population from North Dakota, and a selected population of prairie cordgrass produced &gt;2 times the biomass of switchgrass. However, when prairie cordgrass was fed on by larvae of the four-lined borer [(Resapamea stipata (Morr.)], yield of the two species was similar. Prairie cordgrass had a lower frequency of reproductive tillers (RTRs) and larger leaves than switchgrass. SD CG had high genetic variation for disease resistance, moderate genetic variation for biomass yield, and low genetic variation for inflorescences m−2. Seven out of 57 half-sib families from SD CG produced more biomass than “summer” switchgrass during a year with normal precipitation, whereas only one family did so during a drought year. RTR declined rapidly with stand age. The four-lined borer was identified as a serious threat to biomass production of prairie cordgrass in eastern South Dakota. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Field and laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of biochar amendment on methane oxidation rates and microbial communities in landfill cover soils. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from soil and biochar-amended soil following incubation in laboratory soil columns and from samples collected from four test plots installed within the intermediate cover of an active landfill in northeastern Illinois. Next-generation sequencing of 16SrRNA gene amplicons following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to assess the community composition and relative abundance of methane-oxidizing bacteria among the samples. In field soil samples from both soil and biochar-amended soil covers, Type-I methanotrophs (primarily Methylomonas and Crenothrix species) were observed and prevailed over Type-II methanotrophs in terms of relative abundance, comprising 83 to >99% of the total methanotrophic community. Non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (e.g., Methylibium, Methyloversatilis, Hyphomicrobium, Bradyrhizobium) and facultative methanotrophs (e.g., Methylocella) were also detected along with obligate methanotrophs, reflecting a diverse bacterial community. Methane oxidation rates in batch assays were positively correlated with relative abundance of methanotrophs as well as methane concentration at depth in the soil at the time of sampling. These trends indicate a significant relationship between methane exposure history and methanotrophic community abundance and composition. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A comprehensive study of Miscanthus x giganteus culture on brownfield has been carried out. Plants are an alternative being considered for the production of biofuel, but development of energy crops increased competition in the use of land resources. Brownfields cover approximately 239 Mha of the world’s unexploited soils. Miscanthus x giganteus is able to produce biofuel and is able to grow on polluted sites. The present study is focused on Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn and K contents in roots, rhizomes, stems and leaves to optimize bioenergy production on brownfields. Regarding metal partitioning, Cr and Ni are not accumulated in the whole plant. Bioconcentration factors and translocation factor calculations show that Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are mostly stocked in rhizomes and roots. Low concentrations of metals in aboveground biomass should facilitate its use in combustion units. K content is similar in control samples and brownfield samples during the growing season but K remobilization is blocked at the end of autumn if plants are cultivated on brownfields. K increase in aboveground biomass could be a limiting parameter of biofuel production in brownfield cultures because of critical problems of fouling and slagging in combustion units. K regulation associated to exclusion of metal by Miscanthus x giganteus should be investigated to standardize engineering practices and more particularly in case of brownfield culture. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bioenergy as well as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are key options to embark on cost-efficient trajectories that realize climate targets. Most studies have not yet assessed the influence on these trajectories of emerging bioeconomy sectors such as biochemicals and renewable jet fuels (RJFs). To support a systems transition, there is also need to demonstrate the impact on the energy system of technology development, biomass and fossil fuel prices. We aim to close this gap by assessing least-cost pathways to 2030 for a number of scenarios applied to the energy system of the Netherlands, using a cost-minimization model. The type and magnitude of biomass deployment are highly influenced by technology development, fossil fuel prices and ambitions to mitigate climate change. Across all scenarios, biomass consumption ranges between 180 and 760 PJ and national emissions between 82 and 178 Mt CO2. High technology development leads to additional 100–270 PJ of biomass consumption and 8–20 Mt CO2 emission reduction compared to low technology development counterparts. In high technology development scenarios, additional emission reduction is primarily achieved by bioenergy and carbon capture and storage. Traditional sectors, namely industrial biomass heat and biofuels, supply 61–87% of bioenergy, while wind turbines are the main supplier of renewable electricity. Low technology pathways show lower biochemical output by 50–75%, do not supply RJFs and do not utilize additional biomass compared to high technology development. In most scenarios the emission reduction targets for the Netherlands are not met, as additional reduction of 10–45 Mt CO2 is needed. Stronger climate policy is required, especially in view of fluctuating fossil fuel prices, which are shown to be a key determinant of bioeconomy development. Nonetheless, high technology development is a no-regrets option to realize deep emission reduction as it also ensures stable growth for the bioeconomy even under unfavourable conditions. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding the environmental impact of bioenergy crops is needed to inform bioenergy policy development. We determined the effects of five biomass cropping systems—continuous maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max)-triticale (Triticosecale ×)/soybean-maize, maize-switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), triticale/sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and triticale-aspen (Populus alba × P. grandidentata)—on soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity (KS) across a toposequence in central Iowa, USA. We compared data from the time of cropping system establishment in 2009 to 4 years post-establishment. Both our 2009 and 2013 data confirmed that cropping system impacts on KS vary by landscape position. We found that differences in cropping system impacts were more likely to occur at lower landscape positions, specifically, within footslope and floodplain positions. Previous research on cropping system impacts suggested that grass and woody systems were associated with a general increase in KS over time, with greater changes likely occurring at landscape positions with a higher erosive potential or lower SOC content. Our results confirmed that the triticale-aspen woody system was associated with a significant increase in KS across all landscape positions. In contrast, we did not observe an increase in KS under maize-switchgrass, which we attributed to the high density of switchgrass roots by the fourth year of study, but expect an increase in KS under switchgrass under longer measurement periods. We also found a significant increase in KS in the annual systems, likely due to the conversion to no-till soil management with cropping system establishment. We expect such differences to become more apparent over longer time scales as cropping systems continue to impact soil hydraulic properties. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Biofuel-cropping systems, projected for large land areas, can potentially change their soil microbiome and the ecosystem services they catalyze. We determined the bacterial community composition and relevant soil properties for samples collected after 6 crop years at 0–10 cm, 10–25 cm, 25–50 cm, and 50–100 cm under corn, switchgrass, Miscanthus, and restored prairie, as well as 0–10 cm under six additional candidate biofuel crops in replicate side-by side plots. Deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA-V4 region established that soil bacterial communities were significantly differentiated by depth as determined by proportional OTU abundance and composition, UniFrac distance, and taxonomic and indicator analyses. The cropping system significantly impacted bacterial community composition within the top three layers, with corn and switchgrass communities the most different within the 0–25 cm and 25–50 cm depths, respectively. The effects of crop type and depth co-mingled, likely attributed to differences in rooting depth and biomass among crops. Individual phyla demonstrated varying patterns with depth, with significant proportional decreases of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes but proportional increases of Firmicutes from shallow to deep soils. The Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi peaked in abundance in the middle layers, whereas Thaumarchaeota decreased in abundance. Importantly, some classes within the Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes followed contrasting patterns with depth suggesting that they have different ecological specializations. Poplar, followed by soils with perennial crops contained the most C in the surface soils, with data indicating that these differences will become more pronounced with time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Concentration of biofuel feedstock crop production in specific regions of the USA is dependent on the relative comparative advantage of production in a specific region based on several agronomic and economic factors. For the southeastern region of the USA, energy cane and sweet sorghum have been identified as two feedstock crops with the greatest potential for further development of production. This study utilized field trial data from yield studies in Louisiana to develop estimates of feedstock crop production costs and biofuel feedstock input costs for these two crops. Results indicated that feedstock production costs on a harvest yield basis, as well as the related dry matter basis, were heavily dependent on yield level. Economic research from this study indicated that energy cane had a slight cost advantage compared with sweet sorghum, although production of sorghum in certain periods during the growing season was very cost competitive with energy cane. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Feedstock supply risk is one of the key concerns limiting cellulosic biofuel expansion. We use an economic model of corn stover-based ethanol production to investigate strategies to manage stover supply uncertainty, including three contract arrangements that vary according to risk-sharing between the processor and farmers. Applying this model to corn stover-based ethanol in the USA, we find that a greater quantity of biofuel is supplied at lower cost under right-of-access contracts than a delivered quantity contract. The processor can manage some of the risk borne under the right-of-access contracts by contracting excess acreage and, if available, by purchasing deficit stover from a spot market. Contracting excess acreage increases the expected biofuel cost but results in lower uncertainty surrounding cellulosic biofuel supply. A biomass spot market provides a source of biomass during low yielding years, but can also create competition for the processor as an alternative outlet for farmers to supply stover under favorable spot market prices. In general, farmers’ contract preferences are responsive to the basic structure of incentives, which could provide flexibility to processors as the industry develops and market uncertainties change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A major concern about biofuels is that increasing biofuel feedstock demand reduces availability of crops for food and feed leading to higher food prices. This paper investigates relations between biofuel policies and prices of rapeseed, the major feedstock used for biodiesel production in Europe, and the impact of rapeseed prices on crop acreages in Germany and France. Biodiesel is an important biofuel in Europe, and Germany and France are the largest biodiesel producers in Europe. First, the various biofuel policies in Germany and France are discussed, followed by an analysis of their effects on rapeseed prices. Although theory indicates that such effects exist, we could not find empirical evidence for them. Second, using regional land use panel data from Germany and France we investigate empirically whether crop shares have been affected by rapeseed prices in the period 2000–2015 and whether these price effects changed because of biofuel policy changes. Results show that wheat shares in Germany and France did respond to rapeseed prices, but barley shares did not. Moreover, mandatory blending introduced in Germany in 2007 and production quotas introduced in France in 2005 led to a stronger effect of rapeseed prices on wheat shares, but again did not affect barley shares. © 2017 The Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - While excitement around biofuels initially focused on finding a clean and secure alternative to fossil fuels, many other expectations have subsequently been attached to the “biofuel boom.” Biofuels are not only expected to mitigate climate change or foster domestic energy security, but also to generate employment, provide opportunities to smallholders and support decentralized energy systems. This paper interrogates the expectations attached to biofuels. We begin by examining how policies in consumer and producer countries articulate a series of expectations for biofuels that are “bundled” with the promise of cleaner energy, using the rationales behind these expectations to derive criteria for success. We then review evidence from the published literature on biofuel outcomes against these criteria to assess whether the most prevalent assumptions have been met. We find that policy expectations for biofuels are often expressed in narrow terms, failing to capture important potential impacts – for example focusing on new jobs in the formal sector rather than job quality or whether employment offsets livelihood costs associated with biofuel investments. Some expectations have proven elusive irrespective of the metrics employed, for example using biofuels to improve energy access in remote rural areas. The paper concludes by discussing implications for policy and practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy policies in the electricity and transportation sectors in the United States are expected to create demand for biomass and food crops (corn) that could divert land from food crop production. We develop a dynamic, open-economy, price-endogenous multi-market model of the US agricultural, electricity and transportation sectors to endogenously determine the quantity and mix of bioenergy likely to be required to meet the state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) and the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) if implemented independently or jointly (RFS & RPS) over the 2007–2030 period and their implications for the extent and spatial pattern of diversion of land from other uses for biomass feedstock production. We find that the demand for biomass ranges from 100 million metric tons (MMT) under the RPS alone to 310 MMT under the RFS & RPS; 70% of the biomass in the latter case can be met by crop and forest residues, while the rest can be met by devoting 3% of cropland to energy crop production with 80% of this being marginal land. Our findings show significant potential to meet current renewable energy goals by expanding high-yielding energy crop production on marginal land and using residues without conflicting with food crop production. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Concerns over energy shortages and global climate change have stimulated developments toward renewable energy. Biofuels have been developed to replace fossil fuels to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. However, food security and water scarcity are other growing concerns, and the increased production of biofuels may increase these problems. This study focuses on whether biofuel development would stress China's water resources. Cassava-based fuel ethanol and sweet sorghum-based fuel ethanol are the focus of this study because they are the most typical nongrain biofuels in China. The spatial distribution of the total water requirement of fuel ethanol over its life cycle process was simulated using a biophysical biogeochemical model and marginal land as one of the types of input data for the model to avoid impacts on food security. The total water requirement of fuel ethanol was then compared with the spatial distribution of water resources, and the influence of the development of fuel ethanol on water resources at the pixel and river basin region scales was analyzed. The result showed that the total water requirement of fuel ethanol ranges from 37.81 to 862.29 mm. However, considering water resource restrictions, not all of the marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol. Approximately 0.664 million km2 of marginal land is suitable for the development of fuel ethanol, most of which is located in the south of China, where water resources are plentiful. For these areas, the value of fuel ethanol's water footprint ranges from 0.05 to 11.90 m3 MJ−1. From the water point of view, Liaoning province, Guizhou province, Anhui province and Hunan province can be given priority for the development of fuel ethanol. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The United States military is treating climate change as a crucial factor in its preparation for future conflicts. This concern manifests not only in strategic planning and forward-looking documents, but also in building infrastructural capacity and material provision. Yet, the impetus to ‘green’ the military goes beyond the deployment of existing technologies. We examine several facets of the military's role as an environmental actor, particularly through its promotion of the US Navy's ‘Great Green Fleet’ (GGF), which actively supports the development of advanced biofuels by subsidizing their development and facilitating wider marketization. The GGF promises to reduce military reliance on conventional fossil fuels and reconfigure its energy sourcing, thus reducing dependence on imported hydrocarbons; this is with an eye towards ultimately severing the logistical relationship between existing energy infrastructures and the spaces of military intervention. Taking an integrated lens of political ecology and geopolitics - ‘geopolitical ecology’ - we seek to provide an understanding of the production of weaponized nature. We demonstrate that the US military's discursive use of climate change to justify the provision of new military hardware and advanced biofuels promotes a vision of resource conflicts to support the development of technologies to overcome the constraints to delivery of fuel to emergent front lines. We argue that while this may appear to be militarized greenwashing, it signals a shift in the logics and practices of fuel sourcing driven by a dystopian vision of climate change, which the US military played a significant role in creating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food and fuel markets are seen as competing for common land and biomass resources. However, in a well-designed biorefinery, the production of food and fuel might be synergistic. Canadian oilseed crops could be processed in Canada to increase opportunities for rural development and improved environmental stewardship. Biorefinery processing of grain crops will yield fractions with little or no utility as food. The objective of this study was to simultaneously optimize the yield of high quality food, animal feed, and energy co-products. Oilseed crops grown in western Canada are typically processed into two fractions: oil and meal. The quality of oilseed meal, as a nutritional ingredient, is greatly affected by extraction processes. It is proposed that processes are developed to separate anti-nutrients and compounds that have nutritional value to achieve a maximum yield of total nutrients. Practical applications: Organic materials that have little nutritional value might then be processed for utilization as biomass for energy or chemicals. We have devised processes for fractionation of various Cruciferous crops that simultaneously produce food, feed, industrial chemicals, and raw materials for energy production. In this report, we describe the performance of several crops that potentially produce high quality protein for food as well as oil, carbohydrate, and glucosinolates that could be used for industrial purposes. It is proposed that processes are developed to separate anti-nutrients and compounds that have nutritional value to achieve an optimum utilization. The composition of the input material before processing is determined by both plant genotype and environment. Principal component analysis shows trends in composition that reflect the impact of genotype and environment. Protein was highest (greatest CP1) in seeds grown in Canora and lowest in Truro while protein was highest in Sinapis alba and lowest in Brassica rapa. Oil was highest in seed grown in Saskatoon and for Brassica juncea (greatest CP2). © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Removal of corn (Zea mays L.) residues at high rates for biofuel and other off-farm uses may negatively impact soil and the environment in the long term. Biomass removal from perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs) grown in marginally productive lands could be an alternative to corn residue removal as biofuel feedstocks while controlling water and wind erosion, sequestering carbon (C), cycling water and nutrients, and enhancing other soil ecosystem services. We compared wind and water erosion potential, soil compaction, soil hydraulic properties, soil organic C (SOC), and soil fertility between biomass removal from WSGs and corn residue removal from rainfed no-till continuous corn on a marginally productive site on a silty clay loam in eastern Nebraska after 2 and 3 years of management. The field-scale treatments were as follows: (i) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), (ii) big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman), and (iii) low-diversity grass mixture [big bluestem, indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash), and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.)], and (iv) 50% corn residue removal with three replications. Across years, corn residue removal increased wind-erodible fraction from 41% to 86% and reduced wet aggregate stability from 1.70 to 1.15 mm compared with WSGs in the upper 7.5 cm soil depth. Corn residue removal also reduced water retention by 15% between −33 and −300 kPa potentials and plant-available water by 25% in the upper 7.5 cm soil depth. However, corn residue removal did not affect final water infiltration, SOC concentration, soil fertility, and other properties. Overall, corn residue removal increases erosion potential and reduces water retention shortly after removal, suggesting that biomass removal from perennial WSGs is a desirable alternative to corn residue removal for biofuel production and maintenance of soil ecosystem services. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas, where cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is grown in vast acreage, and the Texas Rolling Plains (TRP), which is dominated by an invasive brush, honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) have the potential for biofuel production for meeting the U.S. bioenergy target of 2022. However, a shift in land use from cotton to perennial grasses and a change in land management such as the harvesting of mesquite for biofuel production can significantly affect regional hydrology and water quality. In this study, APEX and SWAT models were integrated to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus in the upstream subwatershed and harvesting mesquite in the downstream subwatershed on water and nitrogen balances in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the SHP and TRP regions. Simulated average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the baseline cotton areas decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 88%, and percolation increased by 28% under the perennial grasses scenario compared to the baseline cotton scenario. The soil water content enhanced significantly under the irrigated switchgrass scenario compared to the baseline irrigated cotton scenario from January to April and August to October. However, the soil water content was depleted significantly under the dryland Miscanthus scenario from April to July relative to the baseline dryland cotton scenario. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and organic-N loads in surface runoff and NO3-N leaching to groundwater reduced significantly by 86%, 98%, and 100%, respectively, under the perennial grasses scenario. Similarly, surface runoff, and NO3-N and organic-N loads through surface runoff reduced significantly by 98.9%, 99.9%, and 99.5%, respectively, under the post-mesquite-harvest scenario. Perennial grasses exhibited superior ethanol production potential compared to mesquite. However, mesquite is an appropriate supplementary bioenergy source in the TRP region because of its standing biomass and rapid regrowth characteristics. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper we investigate how irreversible social harms should be evaluated from an ethical perspective. First, we define a general notion of irreversibility, drawing on discussions in ecology and economics. This notion is relational in the sense that “irreversibility” is always “irreversibility for a certain party”. We also note that a change may be more or less difficult to reverse, with full reversibility and irreversibility as two extremes. Second, we examine what can make an irreversible change a harm, and why these kinds of harms have particular ethical significance. Here we draw on discussions from ethics, particularly regarding the capability approach. We also show how our notion of irreversibility connects to, and can add to, discussions in the fields of development studies and disaster management, particularly on the concept of resilience. Third, we suggest how potentially irreversible harms can be recognised and dealt with in policy-making. Finally, we show how our framework can be applied by evaluating the land acquisition process of two biofuel producers in Tanzania. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, the increase in Brazilian ethanol production has been based on expansion of sugarcane-cropped area, mainly by the land use change (LUC) pasture–sugarcane. However, second-generation (2G) cellulosic-derived ethanol supplies are likely to increase dramatically in the next years in Brazil. Both these management changes potentially affect soil C (SOC) changes and may have a significant impact on the greenhouse gases balance of Brazilian ethanol. To evaluate these impacts, we used the DayCent model to predict the influence of the LUC native vegetation (NV)–pasture (PA)–sugarcane (SG), as well as to evaluate the effect of different management practices (straw removal, no-tillage, and application of organic amendments) on long-term SOC changes in sugarcane areas in Brazil. The DayCent model estimated that the conversion of NV-PA caused SOC losses of 0.34 ± 0.03 Mg ha−1 yr−1, while the conversion PA-SG resulted in SOC gains of 0.16 ± 0.04 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Moreover, simulations showed SOC losses of 0.19 ± 0.04 Mg ha−1yr−1 in SG areas in Brazil with straw removal. However, our analysis suggested that adoption of some best management practices can mitigate these losses, highlighting the application of organic amendments (+0.14 ± 0.03 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Based on the commitments made by Brazilian government in the UNFCCC, we estimated the ethanol production needed to meet the domestic demand by 2030. If the increase in ethanol production was based on the expansion of sugarcane area on degraded pasture land, the model predicted a SOC accretion of 144 Tg from 2020 to 2050, while increased ethanol production based on straw removal as a cellulosic feedstock was predicted to decrease SOC by 50 Tg over the same 30-year period. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Several EU countries import wood pellets from the south-eastern United States. The imported wood pellets are (co-)fired in power plants with the aim of reducing overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity and meeting EU renewable energy targets. To assess whether GHG emissions are reduced and on what timescale, we construct the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity. This GHG balance consists of supply chain and combustion GHG emissions, carbon sequestration during biomass growth and avoided GHG emissions through replacing fossil electricity. We investigate wood pellets from four softwood feedstock types: small roundwood, commercial thinnings, harvest residues and mill residues. Per feedstock, the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity is compared against those of alternative scenarios. Alternative scenarios are combinations of alternative fates of the feedstock materials, such as in-forest decomposition, or the production of paper or wood panels like oriented strand board (OSB). Alternative scenario composition depends on feedstock type and local demand for this feedstock. Results indicate that the GHG balance of wood-pellet electricity equals that of alternative scenarios within 0–21 years (the GHG parity time), after which wood-pellet electricity has sustained climate benefits. Parity times increase by a maximum of 12 years when varying key variables (emissions associated with paper and panels, soil carbon increase via feedstock decomposition, wood-pellet electricity supply chain emissions) within maximum plausible ranges. Using commercial thinnings, harvest residues or mill residues as feedstock leads to the shortest GHG parity times (0–6 years) and fastest GHG benefits from wood-pellet electricity. We find shorter GHG parity times than previous studies, for we use a novel approach that differentiates feedstocks and considers alternative scenarios based on (combinations of) alternative feedstock fates, rather than on alternative land uses. This novel approach is relevant for bioenergy derived from low-value feedstocks. © 2017 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the historical drivers and barriers of three mitigation actions in Brazil: the expansion of no-till agriculture, reduction of deforestation, and increased displacement of gasoline with ethanol. The characteristics of these three economic changes align with evolutionary economic theories rather than neoclassical or environmental economics. Despite its cost-effectiveness, diffusion of no-till agriculture was contingent on social learning and flows of information within the agricultural regime. Brazil's success in reducing deforestation rates was driven not by policies that changed the microeconomic calculation of farmers, but by command-and-control policies on deforestation enabled through landscape shifts. Brazil's ethanol biofuels industry emerged due to both niche level innovation of ethanol production systems and pure-ethanol vehicles, and shifts at the landscape level that enabled mandated fuel blends, public procurement programmes, and public investment in R&D. These three economic changes correspond with the categories of reproduction, transformation and transition, respectively. © 2016

AB  - Background: Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is one of the most important economic crops because of its high sugar production and biofuel potential. Due to the high polyploid level and complex genome of sugarcane, it has been a huge challenge to investigate genomic sequence variations, which are critical for identifying alleles contributing to important agronomic traits. In order to mine the genetic variations in sugarcane, genotyping by sequencing (GBS), was used to genotype 14 representative Saccharum complex accessions. GBS is a method to generate a large number of markers, enabled by next generation sequencing (NGS) and the genome complexity reduction using restriction enzymes. Results: To use GBS for high throughput genotyping highly polyploid sugarcane, the GBS analysis pipelines in 14 Saccharum complex accessions were established by evaluating different alignment methods, sequence variants callers, and sequence depth for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) filtering. By using the established pipeline, a total of 76,251 non-redundant SNPs, 5642 InDels, 6380 presence/absence variants (PAVs), and 826 copy number variations (CNVs) were detected among the 14 accessions. In addition, non-reference based universal network enabled analysis kit and Stacks de novo called 34,353 and 109,043 SNPs, respectively. In the 14 accessions, the percentages of single dose SNPs ranged from 38.3% to 62.3% with an average of 49.6%, much more than the portions of multiple dosage SNPs. Concordantly called SNPs were used to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship among the 14 accessions. The results showed that the divergence time between the Erianthus genus and the Saccharum genus was more than 10 million years ago (MYA). The Saccharum species separated from their common ancestors ranging from 0.19 to 1.65 MYA. Conclusions: The GBS pipelines including the reference sequences, alignment methods, sequence variant callers, and sequence depth were recommended and discussed for the Saccharum complex and other related species. A large number of sequence variations were discovered in the Saccharum complex, including SNPs, InDels, PAVs, and CNVs. Genome-wide SNPs were further used to illustrate sequence features of polyploid species and demonstrated the divergence of different species in the Saccharum complex. The results of this study showed that GBS was an effective NGS-based method to discover genomic sequence variations in highly polyploid and heterozygous species. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - A major challenge to the economic viability of outdoor cultivation of microalgae is the high cost of CO2 supply, even when microalgae farms are co-located with point sources of CO2 emissions. In addition, the global capacity for algae biofuel generation is severely restricted when microalgae farm locations are constrained by proximity to CO2 sources along with the additional limitations of low slope lands and favorable climate. One potential solution to the impediments of CO2 supply cost and availability is through cultivation of microalgae in highly alkaline pH solutions (pH &gt;10) that are effective at scavenging CO2 from the atmosphere at high rates. The extremely alkaline pH media would also mitigate culture crashes due to microbial contamination and predators. In this study, we report the indoor and outdoor phototrophic cultivation of a microalgae isolate (Chlorella sorokiniana str. SLA-04) adapted to grow in unusually high-pH environments. The isolate was cultivated in a growth medium at pH &gt;10 without any inputs of concentrated CO2. Both indoor and outdoor studies showed biomass and lipid productivities that were comparable to those reported for other microalgae cultures cultivated in near-neutral pH media (pH 7-8.5) under similar conditions. SLA-04 cultures also showed high lipid productivity and high glucose-to-lipid conversion efficiency when cultivated mixotrophically in the presence of glucose as an organic carbon source. From the energy content (calorific value) of the lipids produced and glucose consumed, a relatively high amount of lipid calories (0.62) were produced per glucose calorie consumed. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the feasibility of microalgae cultivation in extremely high-pH media (pH &gt;10) as a novel strategy for biofuel production without dependence on concentrated CO2 inputs. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to investigate the influence mechanism of magnesium lignosulfonates as assisted additives on enzymatic of cellulose hydrolysis, two kinds of magnesium lignosulfonates from different materials were selected to study the fabric differences and influences on enzymatic hydrolysis of different lignocellulose materials. It could be found that commercial magnesium lignosulfonate had higher sulfonation degree than homemade magnesium lignosulfonate, but ML had higher total hydroxy related content. Both commercial magnesium lignosulfonate and homemade magnesium lignosulfonate could enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of Avicel. For enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose material, two kinds of lignosulfonates showed inhibit influences on wheat straw pretreated by liquid hot water pretreatment. Only low concentration homemade magnesium lignosulfonate indicated the positive influence on wheat straw pretreated by magnesium bisulfite pretreatment. This study provided the theoretical references for explanation on influence mechanism of magnesium lignosulfonates on enzymatic hydrolysis. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - Biofuel is perceived as a means to ease global energy concerns, promote rural development and mitigate climate change. Therefore, its development has been and will continue to be a priority for most countries. Presently biofuel production is not economically viable, and the drive for its production is driven by the policies of some countries that perceive it as the only possible alternative to fossil fuels and a way out from the declining world crude reserves. Since biofuel offers the opportunities for developing countries to grow new livelihood and reduce the over dependence on imported fossil fuel, as well as obvious benefit to the environment, Nigeria is not left out. Therefore, for Nigeria to step into the biofuels industry in a big way, with every sector being placed in the use of cleaner renewable energy, government need to plan towards producing biofuel from her abundant biomass resources. This idea is expected to boost Nigerian economy through cultivation of arable landmass for provision of feedstock. Therefore, the quest for biofuels no doubt, represents a legitimate ambition. It is in the light of this that the paper reveals the prospects and challenges of biofuel development with the objective of reviewing the current situation in Nigeria. It further identifies inadequate process technology, poor policy implementation and lack of public acceptance as factors hampering its success. © 2017 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU - All rights reserved.

AB  - Scenedesmus sp. MB 23 was cultivated in fish silage to study the effects of different concentrations on the growth and biochemical characteristics, particularly the protein, carbohydrate and lipid properties. Fish silage with 12% concentration was most effective for the growth and biomass production of Scenedesmus sp. The microalga reached maximum cell density (2433.89 × 104 cells/mL), chlorophyll-a concentration (2.766 μg/mL), specific growth rate (0.48/d) and biomass (2.73 g/L) on this medium. In mass culture, enhanced production of protein (123.87 mg/g dry weight of alga), carbohydrate (44.904 mg/g dry weight of alga) and lipid (84.21 mg/g dry weight of alga) was found using 9% fish silage. The effective reduction (up to 90%) in the concentrations of nitrate, phosphorus and ammonia in the final fish silage medium proved the removal efficiency of Scenedesmus sp. The enhanced production of Scenedesmus sp. MB 23 indicated that effective bioremediation of fish waste can be conducted using algal mass production in fish silage. The study also proved that microalgae grown in fish silage have great industrial potential and can be used as a source of feed and biofuel. © 2017 Kasetsart University

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen footprints are increasingly common metrics used to consider the environmental impacts of activities and consumption by institutions; an institutional water footprint complements these assessments by providing a third metric: water use. This study calculated the water footprint of the University of Virginia (UVA) as a summation of direct water use and virtual water use. The latter was estimated using purchasing records for utilities, food, transportation, paper, research animals, and hospital purchases for calendar year 2014. The direct water use portion of the footprint was 1.7 million m3 water. The virtual water footprint was 15.2 million m3. The utilities sector is responsible for 46 percent of UVA's total water footprint, and food production 23 percent. The UVA Health System contributed 17 percent, and paper, transportation, and research animals each constituted less than 3 percent of the total footprint. The most water-intensive inputs were biofuels, hydroelectricity, and animal products. This water footprint assessment supports carbon and nitrogen footprint-reduction strategies, such as replacing coal with natural gas and reducing beef consumption. Water footprints also require explicitly considering the impacts of renewable energy sources, such as biofuels or hydropower. The water footprint of the University of Virginia provides an additional measure to address the environmental implications of the institution's resource demands and this approach is broadly applicable to other institutions. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

AB  - Identifying and addressing critical improvements in biomass, bioproduct and biofuel productivity is a priority for the nascent algae-based bioeconomy. Economic and sustainability principles should guide these developing improvements and help to unravel the contentious water-food-energy-environment nexus that algae inhabit. Understanding the biochemistry of the storage carbon metabolism of algae to produce biofuels and bioproducts can bring to light the key barriers that currently limit the overall carbon efficiency and the photosynthetic efficiency, and ultimately guide productivity and commercial viability in the context of limiting resources. In the analysis reported here, we present different potential pathways for a conceptual algae biorefinery framework, with each pathway addressing one of the main identified barriers to future deployment. We highlight the molecular identification, in the form of an extensive literature review, of potential bioproducts that may be derived directly from both biomass and fractions produced through a conversion pathway, for three important commercially-relevant genera of algae, Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Nannochloropsis. We establish a relationship between each of the potential bioproducts, describe relevant conversion and extraction processes, and discuss market opportunities with values and sizes as they relate to commercial development of the products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has attracted attention as a promising second generation biofuel feedstock. Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

AB  - The effects of torrefaction under an oxidizing atmosphere on the physicochemical properties of patula pine wood chips were studied. Raw and torrefied pine were characterized to evaluate the effect of temperature and residence time on biofuel properties, such as bulk density, equivalent Hardgrove grindability index (HGIeq), ultimate and proximate analyses, heating value, and fuel value index (FVI). In contrast, the torrefaction process was characterized by mass and energy yields, and by the energy-mass co-benefit index (EMCI). Torrefaction was performed in a rotary kiln at temperatures between 180 °C and 240 °C during residence times between 30 min and 120 min. The torrefaction process under an oxidizing atmosphere tended to increase the fixed carbon/volatile matter ratio (from 0.19 to 2.5), while the H/C and O/C atomic ratios decreased 73% and 55%, respectively. The best properties of wood reached in the experimental plan were obtained at 210 °C during 75 min. For this torrefaction condition, energy yield, FVI, and EMCI were 85.91%, 1.91 MJ/cm3, and 4.41%, respectively. Additionally, the lower heating value for torrefied pine (18.65 MJ/kg) was higher than for the raw material (17.76 MJ/kg), and the HGIeq was 17% greater, which resulted in a better grindability behavior.

AB  - We propose and demonstrate a novel system for simultaneous ammonia recovery, carbon capture, biogas upgrading, and fertilizer production in biogas production. Biogas slurry pretreatment (adjusting the solution pH, turbidity, and chemical oxygen demand) plays an important role in the system as it significantly affects the performance of ammonia recovery. Vacuum membrane distillation is used to recover ammonia from biogas slurry at various conditions. The ammonia removal efficiency in vacuum membrane distillation is around 75% regardless of the ammonia concentration of the biogas slurry. The recovered ammonia is used for CO2 absorption to realize simultaneous biogas upgrading and fertilizer generation. CO2 absorption performance of the recovered ammonia (absorption capacity and rate) is compared with a conventional model absorbent. Theoretical results on biogas upgrading are also provided. After ammonia recovery, the treated biogas slurry has significantly reduced phytotoxicity, improving the applicability for agricultural irrigation. The novel concept demonstrated in this study shows great potential in closing the CO2 loop in biogas production by recycling ammonia as an absorbent for CO2 absorption associated with producing fertilizers.

AB  - Background: Acetic acid is a predominant by-product of lignocellulosic biofuel process, which inhibits microbial biocatalysts. Development of bacterial strains that are tolerant to acetic acid is challenging due to poor understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results: In this study, we generated and characterized two acetic acid-tolerant strains of Zymomonas mobilis using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG)-acetate adaptive breeding. Two mutants, ZMA-142 and ZMA-167, were obtained, showing a significant growth rate at a concentration of 244mM sodium acetate, while the growth of Z. mobilis ATCC 31823 were completely inhibited in presence of 195mM sodium acetate. Our data showed that acetate-tolerance of ZMA-167 was attributed to a co-transcription of nhaA from ZMO0117, whereas the co-transcription was absent in ATCC 31823 and ZMA-142. Moreover, ZMA-142 and ZMA-167 exhibited a converstion rate (practical ethanol yield to theorical ethanol yield) of 90.16% and 86% at 195mM acetate-pH5 stress condition, respectively. We showed that acid adaptation of ZMA-142 and ZMA-167 to 146mM acetate increased ZMA-142 and ZMA-167 resulted in an increase in ethanol yield by 32.21% and 21.16% under 195mM acetate-pH5 stress condition, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicate the acetate-adaptive seed culture of acetate-tolerant strains, ZMA-142 and ZMA-167, could enhance the ethanol production during fermentation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Tourism generates substantial carbon footprint with its air transport sector holding the largest share. Biofuel technology has been repeatedly trialled in aviation to minimise this carbon footprint. While biofuels can become mainstream aviation fuels in the near future, little is known about public knowledge on and perception of its use within the air transport sector. This signifies considerable knowledge gap as the level of public awareness of a new technology determines the speed of its societal acceptance and may affect its market success. This study explores the attitudes of UK tourists to the use of biofuels in aviation. It finds that while the public are generally aware of biofuel technology, public knowledge of its specific application in aviation alongside the carbon benefits this brings is limited. Future policy-making and managerial measures should aim at enhancing public understanding of biofuel technology use in aviation in the UK. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a C3 perennial, warm-season, rhizomatous grass of emerging interest for bioenergy and biomass derivatives production, and for phytoremediation. It only propagates vegetatively and very little genetic variation is found among ecotypes, basically precluding breeding efforts. With the objective to increase the genetic variation in this species, we developed and applied a mutagenesis protocol based on γ-irradiation of in vitro cell cultures from which regenerants were obtained. Based on a radiosensitivity test, the irradiation dose reducing to 50% the number of regenerants per callus (RD50) was estimated at 35 Gy. A large mutagenic experiment was carried out by irradiating a total of 3120 calli with approx. 1×, 1.5× and 2× RD50. A total of 1004 regenerants from irradiated calli were hardened in pots and transplanted to the field. Initial phenotypic characterization of the collection showed correlated responses of biomass-related quantitative traits to irradiation doses. Approx. 10% of field-grown clones showed remarkable morphological aberrations including dwarfism, altered tillering, abnormal inflorescence, leaf variegation and others, which were tested for stability over generations. Clone lethality reached 0.4%. Our results show for the first time that physical mutagenesis can efficiently induce new genetic and phenotypic variation of agronomic and prospective industrial value in giant reed. The methodology and the plant materials described here may contribute to the domestication and the genetic improvement of this important biomass species. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Switchgrass and giant reed can provide a dual contribution in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions through displacing fossil fuels and derivatives and increasing soil organic carbon. However, if it is generally true that displacing fossil fuels with biomass brings favorable effects, there is not as much evidence that perennial grasses increase soil organic carbon, as it mainly depends on the land-use change. The present study investigated, for the first time, the effects on soil organic carbon of the land-use change from poplar to switchgrass and giant reed. We addressed the soil organic carbon variation over 10 years of switchgrass and giant reed succeeding a 30-year poplar. Soil samplings were performed after 3 and 10 years from establishment down to 0.6 m depth. The results show that although the ability of poplar to store large quantities of soil C is widely demonstrated, the two perennial crops allowed to further increase soil organic carbon stocks; particularly, giant reed increased soil organic carbon at a double rate than switchgrass (0.19 and 0.09 g kg−1 year−1). The variation in soil organic carbon highly affected total greenhouse gas savings as estimated by a life-cycle assessment: 11–35 and 20–42% of total savings from switchgrass and giant reed, respectively, derived from increasing soil C stocks. These results highlight the importance of understanding long-term environmental- and crop-specific land-use-change effects in life-cycle assessments instead of applying coefficients to generic crop categories (e.g., perennial tree/crop) and crop sequences, as it normally happens. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.

AB  - Perennial grasses are promising candidates for bioenergy crops, but species that can escape cultivation and establish self-sustaining naturalized populations (feral) may have the potential to become invasive. Fertile Miscanthus × giganteus, known as “PowerCane,” is a new potential biofuel crop. Its parent species are ornamental, non-native Miscanthus species that establish feral populations and are sometimes invasive in the USA. As a first step toward assessing the potential for “PowerCane” to become invasive, we documented its growth and fecundity relative to one of its parent species (Miscanthus sinensis) in competition with native and invasive grasses in common garden experiments located in Columbus, Ohio and Ames, Iowa, within the targeted range of biofuel cultivation. We conducted a 2-year experiment to compare growth and reproduction among three Miscanthus biotypes—”PowerCane,” ornamental M. sinensis, and feral M. sinensis—at two locations. Single Miscanthus plants were subjected to competition with a native grass (Panicum virgatum), a weedy grass (Bromus inermis), or no competition. Response variables were aboveground biomass, number of shoots, basal area, and seed set. In Iowa, all Miscanthus plants died after the first winter, which was unusually cold, so no further results are reported from the Iowa site. In Ohio, we found significant differences among biotypes in growth and fecundity, as well as significant effects of competition. Interactions between these treatments were not significant. “PowerCane” performed as well or better than ornamental or feral M. sinensis in vegetative traits, but had much lower seed production, perhaps due to pollen limitation. In general, ornamental M. sinensis performed somewhat better than feral M. sinensis. Our findings suggest that feral populations of “PowerCane” could become established adjacent to biofuel production areas. Fertile Miscanthus × giganteus should be studied further to assess its potential to spread via seed production in large, sexually compatible populations. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Brazil meets about 16% of its energy needs with bioethanol and other sugarcane products and leads the world in biofuel energy production. However, there are concerns over the environmental credentials of the sugarcane given the high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) − a potent greenhouse gas − associated with its production. We quantify N2O fluxes from a sugarcane experiment in the Brazilian Cerrado over an entire year, comparing the magnitude of response to different fertilizer treatments: mineral nitrogen (N), a liquid residue from bioethanol distillation known as vinasse (V) and a combination of both (NV), on irrigated and nonirrigated plots. We find that soil N2O fluxes in plots subjected to the NV treatment are, on average, at least three times higher than those in the other treatments, resulting in four times the emissions intensity per yield than when mineral N or vinasse were applied alone. We also find that irrigation has a positive effect on N2O emissions in the first two weeks after treatment addition and on annual sugarcane yield. Emission factors, defined as net N emissions as N2O as a percentage of the total mineral N added, vary from 0.05 to 4.6% according to treatment. Sugarcane production in the Cerrado is a significant source of N2O, due to the synergistic effect of mineral N fertilizer and vinasse. Using vinasse as the main fertilizer, or applying N and vinasse at widely spaced intervals are effective strategies for climate change mitigation, plant nutrition, waste management and cost-efficient production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a cellulosic feedstock for alternative energy production that can be grown between rows of planted pines (Pinus spp.) within intensively managed forests. Southeastern planted pine occupies 15.8 million ha and thus, switchgrass intercropping could have far-ranging effects on plant communities and biomass production within these forests if broadly implemented. Such intercropping could lead to alterations to plant communities that may cause bottom-up ecological changes affecting ecologically, economically, and socially important wildlife, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer). Therefore, we tested whether intercropping switchgrass in loblolly pine (P. taeda) plantations would cause switchgrass to dominate vegetative biomass thereby decreasing biomass of forages and reducing white-tailed deer nutritional carrying capacity (NCC), or whether disturbance associated with establishment and harvest of switchgrass would facilitate ruderal forbs, and thereby increase biomass of preferred deer forages and increase NCC. In a randomized complete block design, we assigned 2 treatments (intercropped switchgrass and a standard pine management control) to 4 replicates of 10-ha experimental units in Kemper County, Mississippi during summers of 2011−2015. We detected 323 plant species. Intercropping switchgrass had little effect on plant biomass production, and did not affect white-tailed deer NCC at a maintenance diet of 6% crude protein. Intercropping provided additional disturbance allowing high-protein content ruderal plants to colonize, and temporarily increased (3 yr) deer NCC at the 14% crude protein diet considered necessary to support lactation. However, concomitant with a sharp increase in switchgrass biomass in the third year of the study, NCC dropped to levels similar to traditionally managed pine stands. Switchgrass intercropping is not a reliable means of increasing deer NCC as a management strategy but does not appear to reduce carrying capacity in the short-term relative to standard intensive pine management. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017

AB  - The seeds of many nondomesticated plant species synthesize oils containing high amounts of a single unusual fatty acid, many of which have potential usage in industry. Despite the identification of enzymes for unusual oxidized fatty acid synthesis, the production of these fatty acids in engineered seeds remains low and is often hampered by their inefficient exclusion from phospholipids. Recent studies have established the feasibility of increasing triacylglycerol content in plant leaves, which provides a novel approach for increasing energy density of biomass crops. Here, we determined whether the fatty acid composition of leaf oil could be engineered to accumulate unusual fatty acids. Eleostearic acid (ESA) is a conjugated fatty acid produced in seeds of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii) and has both industrial and nutritional end-uses. Arabidopsis thaliana lines with elevated leaf oil were first generated by transforming wild-type, cgi-58 or pxa1 mutants (the latter two of which contain mutations disrupting fatty acid breakdown) with the diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 or DGAT2) and/or oleosin genes from tung. High-leaf-oil plant lines were then transformed with tung FADX, which encodes the fatty acid desaturase/conjugase responsible for ESA synthesis. Analysis of lipids in leaves revealed that ESA was efficiently excluded from phospholipids, and co-expression of tung FADX and DGAT2 promoted a synergistic increase in leaf oil content and ESA accumulation. Taken together, these results provide a new approach for increasing leaf oil content that is coupled with accumulation of unusual fatty acids. Implications for production of biofuels, bioproducts, and plant–pest interactions are discussed. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Liquid fraction produced in anaerobic digestion (AD) of biodegradable waste can be treated on-site with microalgae, which can be recycled back as substrate to the biogas plant. For this research, a pilot high rate algal pond (HRAP) was set with connections to a full scale biogas plant that enabled the use of waste heat and CO2 from a combined heat and power gen-set (CHP). The microalgal mix produced in the thermophilic anaerobic digestate supernatant was tested as a substrate for biogas production in the thermophilic AD (i.e. untreated, bioaugmented with anaerobic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum, and thermally pretreated, respectively). The methane potential of the untreated microalgal mix was low (157.5 ± 18.7 mL CH4/g VS). However, after the thermal pretreatment of the microalgae, methane production increased by 62%, while in the bioaugmentation with C. thermocellum under thermophilic conditions (T = 55 °C) it was elevated by 12%. The outcome of our pilot trial suggests that microalgae produced in the thermophilic biogas digestate represent a prospective alternative AD feedstock. At the same time, microalgae reduce the digestate nitrogen and COD to the level sufficient for the outflow to meet the quality required by the sewage system (ammonia-nitrogen max 200 mg/L, nitrite max 10 mg/L). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bacterial endophytes constitute a very diverse community and they confer important benefits which help to improve agricultural yield. Some of these benefits remain underexplored or little understood, mainly due to the bottlenecks associated with the plant feature, a low number of endophytic bacterial cells in relation to the plant, and difficulties in accessing these bacteria using cultivation-independent methods. Enriching endophytic bacterial cells from plant tissues, based on a non-biased, cultivation-independent physical enrichment method, may help to circumvent those problems, especially in the case of sugarcane stems, which have a high degree of interfering factors, such as polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, nucleases, and fibers. In the present study, an enrichment approach for endophytic bacterial cells from sugarcane lower stems is described. The results demonstrate that the enriched bacterial cells are suitable for endophytic community characterization. A community analysis revealed the presence of previously well-described but also novel endophytic bacteria in sugarcane tissues which may exert functions such as plant growth promotion and biological control, with a predominance of the Proteobacterial phylum, but also Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, among others. In addition, by comparing the present and literature data, it was possible to list the most frequently detected bacterial endophyte genera in sugarcane tissues. The presented enrichment approach paves the way for improved future research toward the assessment of endophytic bacterial community in sugarcane and other biofuel crops. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - GHG mitigation by bioenergy crops depends on crop type, management practices, and the input of residue carbon (C) to the soil. Perennial grasses may increase soil C compared to annual crops because of more extensive root systems, but it is less clear how much soil C is derived from above- vs. belowground inputs. The objective of this study was to synthesize the existing knowledge regarding soil C inputs from above- and belowground crop residues in regions cultivated with sugarcane, corn, and miscanthus, and to predict the impact of residue removal and tillage on soil C stocks. The literature review showed that aboveground inputs to soil C (to 1-m depth) ranged from 70% to 81% for sugarcane and corn vs. 40% for miscanthus. Modeled aboveground C inputs (to 30 cm depth) ranged from 54% to 82% for sugarcane, but were 67% for miscanthus. Because 50% of observed miscanthus belowground biomass is below 30 cm depth, it may be necessary to increase the depth of modeled soil C dynamics to reconcile modeled belowground C inputs with measured. Modeled removal of aboveground corn residue (25–100%) resulted in C stock reduction in areas of corn–corn–soybean rotation under conventional tillage, while no-till management lessoned this impact. In sugarcane, soil C stocks were reduced when total aboveground residue was removed at one site, while partial removal of sugarcane residue did not reduce soil C stocks in either area. This study suggests that aboveground crop residues were the main C-residue source to the soil in the current bioethanol sector (corn and sugarcane) and the indiscriminate removal of crop residues to produce cellulosic biofuels can reduce soil C stocks and reduce the environmental benefits of bioenergy. Moreover, a switch to feedstocks such as miscanthus with more allocation to belowground C could increase soil C stocks at a much faster rate. © 2017 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) productivity on marginal and fertile lands has not been thoroughly evaluated in a systematic manner that includes soil–crop–weather–management interactions and to quantify the risk of failure or success in growing the crop. We used the Systems Approach to Land Use Sustainability (SALUS) model to identify areas with low risk of failing to having more than 8000 kg ha−1 yr−1 switchgrass aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) under rainfed and unfertilized conditions. In addition, we diagnosed constraining factors for switchgrass growth, and tested the effect of nitrogen fertilizer application on plant productivity across Michigan for 30 years under three climate scenarios (baseline climate in 1981–2010, future climate with emissions using RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0). We determined that &lt;16% of land in Michigan may have at least 8 Mg ha−1 yr−1 ANPP under rainfed and unfertilized management with a low risk of failure. Of the productive low-risk land, about 25% was marginal land, with more than 80% of which was affected by limited water availability due to low soil water-holding capacity and shallow depth. About 80% of the marginal land was N limited under baseline conditions, but that percentage decreased to 58.5% and 42.1% under RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0 climate scenarios, respectively, partly due to shorter growing season, smaller plants and less N demand. We also found that the majority of Michigan's land could have high switchgrass ANPP and low risk of failure with no more than 60 kgN ha−1 fertilizer input. We believe that the methodology used in this study works at different spatial scales, as well as for other biofuel crops. © The Authors.

AB  - The growing biodiesel production requires the use of new technologies and alternative feedstocks to maintain the growing demand of this biofuel. The macaw (Acrocomia aculeata) is a palm native to Argentina whose fruits present high oil content. Due to its tolerance to prolonged drought, it is a promising crop for biodiesel and biokerosene production. The aim of this work was to design an agroclimatic zoning model to define the potential growing areas from macaw in Argentina. To define the agroclimatic suitability to produce oil, it was necessary to identify the requirements, limits, and biometeorological tolerance for this palm. In order to define the agroclimatic fitness of this crop in Argentina, the meteorological data corresponding to the period 1981–2010 were employed. The agroclimatic indices were integrated in a Geographic Information System. The maps were superimposed and the overlapping regions delineated the agroclimatic zoning. The agroclimatic zonation classified zones with homogeneous characteristics responding to bioclimatic requirements of this species, resulting in optimal, very suitable, suitable, and nonsuitable areas for macaw cultivation. The authors designed an agroclimatic zoning model based on bibliography. This model can be used in any part of the world, employing the same agroclimatic indices presented in this work. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Crop models with well-tested parameters may help improve sugarcane productivity for food and biofuel generation, especially in rainfed areas where studies are scarce. This study aimed to calibrate crop parameters for the sugarcane cultivar CP 72-2086, an early-maturing cultivar widely grown in Mexico and other countries, and evaluate their adequacy in simulating sugarcane in a diverse range of rainfed conditions. For the calibration and evaluation of parameters, the ALMANAC model was used with climate, soil, management, and yield for two growing seasons from 30 farms in three regions (Northeastern Mexico, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Mexico). Statistical analyses were made using regression analysis and mean squared deviation and its three components, i.e., the squared bias, the lack of correlation weighted by the standard deviations, and the squared difference between standard deviations. Model simulations with a light extinction coefficient (k) of 0.69, maximum leaf area index of 7.5, leaf area index decline rate of 0.3, optimal and minimum temperature for plant growth of 32 °C and 11 °C, respectively, potential heat units of 6000 to 7400 degree days (base 11 °C), harvest index of 0.9; maximum crop height of 4.0 m, and root depth of 2.0mshowed highest accuracy and captured best the magnitude of yield fluctuations with a root mean squared deviation of 7.8 Mg ha-1. The parameters were found to be reasonable to use in simulating sugarcane in diverse regions under rainfed conditions. Using a dynamic value of k (varying during the growing season) deserves further study as it may help improve crop model precision. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The GTAP model has been used to estimate biofuel policy induced land use changes and consequent GHG emissions for more than a decade. This paper reviews the history of the model and database modifications and improvements that have occurred over that period. In particular, the paper covers in greater detail the move from the 2004 to the 2011 database, and the inclusion of cropland intensification in the modeling structure. Results: The results show that all the changes in the global economy and agricultural sectors cause biofuels induced land use changes and associated emissions can be quite different using the 2011 database versus 2004. The results also demonstrate the importance of including land intensification in the analysis. The previous versions of GTAP and other similar models assumed that changes in harvested area equal changes in cropland area. However, FAO data demonstrate that it is not correct for several important world regions. The model now includes land intensification, and the resulting land use changes and emission values are lower as would be expected. Conclusions: Dedicated energy crops are not similar to the first generation feedstocks in the sense that they do not generate the level of market-mediated responses which we have seen in the first-generation feedstocks. The major market-mediated responses are reduced consumption, crop switching, changes in trade, changes in intensification, and forest or pasture conversion. These largely do not apply to dedicated energy corps. The land use emissions for cellulosic feedstocks depend on what we assume in the emissions factor model regarding soil carbon gained or lost in converting land to these feedstocks. We examined this important point for producing bio-gasoline from miscanthus. Much of the literature suggests miscanthus actually sequesters carbon, if grown on the existing active cropland or degraded land. We provide some illustrative estimates for possible assumptions. Finally, it is important to note the importance of the new results for the regulatory process. The current California Air Resources Board carbon scores for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel are 19.8 and 29.1, respectively (done with a model version that includes irrigation). The new model and database carbon scores are 12 and 18, respectively, for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. Thus, the current estimates values are substantially less than the values currently being used for regulatory purposes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Within the United States and Puerto Rico, publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) process 130.5 Gl/d (34.5 Bgal/d) of wastewater, producing sludge as a waste product. Emerging technologies offer novel waste-to-energy pathways through whole sludge conversion into biofuels. Assessing the feasibility, scalability and tradeoffs of various energy conversion pathways is difficult in the absence of highly spatially resolved estimates of sludge production. In this study, average wastewater solids concentrations and removal rates, and site specific daily average influent flow are used to estimate site specific annual sludge production on a dry weight basis for >15,000 POTWs. Current beneficial uses, regional production hotspots and feedstock aggregation potential are also assessed. Analyses indicate 1) POTWs capture 12.56 Tg/y (13.84 MT/y) of dry solids; 2) 50% are not beneficially utilized, and 3) POTWs can support seven regions that aggregate >910 Mg/d (1000 T/d) of sludge within a travel distance of 100 km. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The establishment of energy crops could be an option for the management of degraded and contaminated lands, where they would not compete with food production for land use. Here, we aimed to explore the potential of certain native Mediterranean species for the revegetation of contaminated lands for energy production purposes. A field survey was conducted in a trace-element (TE) contaminated area from SW Spain, where the patterns of biomass production, TE accumulation and the calorific value of some thistle species were analyzed along a soil contamination gradient. In a greenhouse experiment the response of two thistle species (Cynara cardunculus and Silybum marianum) and the shrub Dittrichia viscosa to soil contamination was assessed, as well as the effects of these species on some soil microbial parameters involved in nutrient cycling (enzyme activities and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in roots). Silybum marianum was able to colonize highly contaminated soils. Its aboveground biomass accumulated Cd and had a relatively high calorific value; this value was similar in biomass obtained from both heavily and moderately contaminated soils. Greenhouse experiment confirmed that S. marianum biomass production and calorific value is scarcely affected by soil contamination. In addition, some soil enzyme activities were clearly enhanced in the S. marianum rhizosphere. Dittrichia viscosa is another promising species, given its capacity to produce a high biomass with appreciable calorific value in acid contaminated soils. Germination of both species was hampered in the acid contaminated soil, and therefore soil pH correction would have to be accomplished before establishing these species on extremely acid soils. Further assessment of the risk of transfer of Cd and other TE to the food chain would be needed to confirm the suitability of these species for the revegetation of contaminated lands with energy production purposes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fecal waste is an environmental burden that requires proper disposal, which ultimately becomes also an economic burden. Because fecal waste is nutrient-rich and contains a diverse methanogenic community, it has been utilized to produce biomethane via anaerobic digestion. Carbohydrates and lipids in fecal waste could reach up to 50% of the dry weight, which also suggests a potential as a feedstock for bioethanol and biodiesel production. We measured biomethane production from fecal waste of cows, chickens, goats and humans and compared the microbial community composition before and after anaerobic digestion. We also compared the fecal waste for cellulase production, saccharification and fermentation to produce bioethanol and for lipid content and fatty acid profiles to produce biodiesel. All fecal waste produced biomethane, with the highest yield of 433.4 ± 77.1 ml CH4/g VS from cow fecal waste. Production of bioethanol was achieved from all samples, with chicken fecal waste yielding as high as 1.6 ± 0.25 g/l. Sludge samples exhibited the highest extractable portion of lipids (20.9 ± 0.08 wt%) and conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (11.94 wt%). Utilization of fecal waste for the production of biofuels is environmentally and economically beneficial. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The continued increase in urbanization and vehicle ownership poses an increasing challenge in curbing the rising energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Malaysia. For more than a decade, road vehicles have been the leading contributor in the country, due mainly to their heavy reliance on petroleum products, particularly gasoline and diesel. The efficient utilization of petroleum products becomes paramount in reducing Malaysia's overall CO2 emissions in the land transportation sector. The timely abolition of petroleum product subsidies in 2014 may provide a financial source to support the improvement of petroleum product efficiency. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the impact on economic growth and sectoral performance with fuel subsidy savings being reallocated to the biofuel industry for research and development purposes. The study then investigates whether an environmental tax on petroleum products could induce more energy saving and emission control. This research applies the computable general equilibrium modeling for the simulation, as it takes into account the interaction between petroleum products and the economy as a whole. The Malaysia Input-Output Tables 2010 is the main database used in the simulation. The simulation results found that fuel efficiency improvement could produce a double dividend effect with simultaneous benefits on the economy and environmental quality. A simultaneous implementation with fuel tax policy appears to be one suitable complementary measure for a further emission cut. However, sufficient compensation schemes might be necessary to stimulate economic activities over time. Based on the simulation results, policymakers should emphasize fuel efficiency improvement as a crucial strategy to control the rising energy consumption and emissions in Malaysia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: With increasing concerns over global warming and depletion of fossil-fuel reserves, it is attractive to develop innovative strategies to assimilate CO2, a greenhouse gas, into usable organic carbon. Cell-free systems can be designed to operate as catalytic platforms with enzymes that offer exceptional selectivity and efficiency, without the need to support ancillary reactions of metabolic pathways operating in intact cells. Such systems are yet to be exploited for applications involving CO2 utilization and subsequent conversion to valuable products, including biofuels. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) play a pivotal role in global CO2 fixation. Results: We hereby demonstrate the co-assembly of two RubisCO-associated multienzyme cascades with self-assembled synthetic amphiphilic peptide nanostructures. The immobilized enzyme cascades sequentially convert either ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) or glucose, a simpler substrate, to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the acceptor for incoming CO2 in the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by RubisCO. Protection from proteolytic degradation was observed in nanostructures associated with the small dimeric form of RubisCO and ancillary enzymes. Furthermore, nanostructures associated with a larger variant of RubisCO resulted in a significant enhancement of the enzyme's selectivity towards CO2, without adversely affecting the catalytic activity. Conclusions: The ability to assemble a cascade of enzymes for CO2 capture using self-assembling nanostructure scaffolds with functional enhancements show promise for potentially engineering entire pathways (with RubisCO or other CO2-fixing enzymes) to redirect carbon from industrial effluents into useful bioproducts. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Nature's silicon marvel, the diatoms have lately astounded the scientific community with its intricate designs and lasting durability. Diatoms are a major group of phytoplanktons involved in the biogeochemical cycling of silica and are virtually inherent in every environment ranging from water to ice to soil. The usage of diatoms has proved prudently cost effective and its handling neither requires costly materials nor sophisticated instruments. Diatoms can easily be acquired from the environment, their culture requires ambient condition and does not involve any costly media or expensive instruments, besides, they can be transported in small quantities and proliferated to a desirable confluence from that scratch, thus are excellent cost effective industrial raw material. Naturally occurring diatom frustules are a source of nanomaterials. Their silica bio-shells have raised curiosity among nanotechnologists who hope that diatoms will facilitate tailoring minuscule structures which are beyond the capabilities of material scientists. Additionally, there is a colossal diversity in the dimensions of diatoms as the frustule shape differs from species to species; this provides a scope for the choice of a particular species of diatom to be tailored to an exacting requisite, thus paving the way to create desired three dimensional nanocomposites. The present article explores the use of diatoms in various arenas of science, may it be in nanotechnology, biotechnology, environmental science, biophysics or biochemistry and summarizes facets of diatom biology under one umbrella. Special emphasis has been given to biosilicification, biomineralization and use of diatoms as nanomaterials', drug delivery vehicles, optical and immune-biosensors, filters, immunodiagnostics, aquaculture feeds, lab-on-a-chip, metabolites, and biofuels. © 2017 Mishra, Arukha, Bashir, Yadav and Prasad.

AB  - Background: Saccharum species such as sugarcane and energy cane are key players in the expanding bioeconomy for sugars, bioenergy, and production of high-value proteins. Genomic tools such as culm-regulated promoters would be of great value in terms of improving biomass characteristics through enhanced carbon metabolism for sugar accumulation and/or fiber content for biofuel feedstock. Unlike the situation in dicots, monocot promoters currently used are limited and mostly derived from highly expressed constitutive plant genes and viruses. In this study, a novel promoter region of Sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV; genus Badnavirus, family Caulimoviridae), SCBV21 was cloned and mapped by deletion analysis and functionally characterized transiently in monocot and dicot species and stably in sugarcane. Results: In silico analysis of SCBV21 [1816 base pair (bp)] identified two putative promoter regions (PPR1 and PPR2) with transcription start sites (TSS1 and TSS2) and two TATA-boxes (TATAAAT and ATATAA), and several vascular-specific and regulatory elements. Deletion analysis revealed that the 710 bp region spanning PPR2 (with TSS2 and ATATAA) at the 3′ end of SCBV21 retained the full promoter activity in both dicots and monocots, as shown by transient expression of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene. In sugarcane young leaf segments, SCBV21 directed a 1.8- and 2.4-fold higher transient EYFP expression than the common maize ubiquitin 1 (Ubi1) and Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoters, respectively. In transgenic sugarcane, SCBV21 conferred a preferential expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in leaves and culms and specifically in the culm storage parenchyma surrounding the vascular bundle and in vascular phloem cells. Among the transgenic events and tissues characterized in this study, the SCBV21 promoter frequently produced higher GUS activity than the Ubi1 or 35S promoters in a manner that was not obviously correlated with the transgene copy number. Conclusions: The newly developed plant viral SCBV21 promoter is distinct from the few existing SCBV promoters in its sequence and expression pattern. The potential of SCBV21 as a tissue-regulated promoter with a strong activity in the culm vascular bundle and its storage parenchyma makes it useful in sugarcane engineering for improved carbon metabolism, increased bioenergy production, and enhanced stress tolerance. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change occurs at a local level within contiguous ownership and management units (parcels), yet LULC models primarily use pixel-based spatial frameworks. The few parcel-based models being used overwhelmingly focus on small geographic areas, limiting the ability to assess LULC change impacts at regional to national scales. We developed a modified version of the Forecasting Scenarios of land use change model to project parcel-based agricultural change across a large region in the United States Great Plains. A scenario representing an agricultural biofuel scenario was modeled from 2012 to 2030, using real parcel boundaries based on contiguous ownership and land management units. The resulting LULC projection provides a vastly improved representation of landscape pattern over existing pixel-based models, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented combination of thematic detail and broad geographic extent. The conceptual approach is practical and scalable, with potential use for national-scale projections. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The biofuels sustainability in transport depends on the energetic products demand and the limited resources. According to European legislation, the energy consumption in transport from renewable energy in the European Union should increase by 10% till 2020. Considering the environmental requests related to greenhouse gases reduction and a lower dependency on oil fuels stimulated more the biofuels production, this research empirically assessed the impact of energy consumption in transport based on biodiesel and bioethanol on sustainable development in terms of economic growth and greenhouse emissions. Using dynamic panel and panel vector-auto-regression models for European Union countries during 2010–2015, we proved that only the energy consumption in transport based on biodiesel had a positive impact on economic growth. The greenhouse emissions did not have any impact on economic growth while the energy consumption in transport based on bioethanol negatively affected the economic growth. The Granger causality tests on panel data indicated a bilateral relationship between economic growth and energy consumption in transport based on biodiesel and between economic growth and energy consumption in transport based on bioethanol. Given these empirical results, the energy policies should focus on the higher utilisation of biodiesel in transport in the EU. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - Life cycle optimization (LCO) enables static life cycle analysis (LCA) and techno-economic analysis to be performed dynamically for automatic generation and optimization of process alternatives. Existing LCO models are developed following an attributional LCA approach, which overlooks the environmental consequences in response to the changes in the market. In this study, we develop a consequential LCO framework that simultaneously optimizes consequential environmental impacts and economic performance. We propose a general system boundary that encloses processes linked by markets. On the basis of the general system boundary, we develop a multiobjective optimization model, which integrates process models and market models with the tenets of consequential LCA and techno-economic analysis methodologies. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, a global optimization algorithm is proposed to integrate the inexact parametric algorithm and the branch-and-refine algorithm. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study of producing renewable diesel from microalgae. We conduct detailed market analysis to identify the consequences associated with the renewable diesel production process. The environmental impacts of the optimal process designs based on the proposed consequential LCO framework are significantly lower than those based on the existing attributional LCO framework. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent research has highlighted the conflict potential of both land deals and climate change mitigation projects, but generally the two phenomena are studied separately and the focus is limited to discrete cases of displacement or contested claims. We argue that research with a broader “landscape” perspective is needed to better understand the complex social, ecological and institutional interactions taking place in sites of land-based climate change projects (such as biofuel production or forest conservation) and large-scale investments (plantations or mines). Research that co-produces knowledge and capacity with local actors, and informs advocacy at multiple policy scales, will contribute better to preventing, resolving or transforming conflicts. © 2016 Canadian Association for the Study of International Development (CASID).

AB  - In the European Union's Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the energy efficiency goal for buildings is set in terms of primary energy use. In the proposal from the National Board of Housing, Building, and Planning, for nearly zero energy buildings in Sweden, the use of primary energy is expressed as a primary energy number calculated with given primary energy factors. In this article, a multi-dwelling building is simulated and the difference in the primary energy number is investigated when the building uses heat from district heating systems or from heat pumps, alone or combined with solar thermal or solar photovoltaic systems. It is also investigated how the global CO2 emissions are influenced by the different energy system combinations and with different fuels used. It is concluded that the calculated primary energy number is lower for heat pump systems, but the global CO2 emissions are lowest when district heating uses mostly biofuels and is combined with solar PV systems. The difference is up to 140 tonnes/year. If the aim with the Swedish building code is to decrease the global CO2 emissions then the ratio between the primary energy factors for electricity and heat should be larger than three and considerably higher than today. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The microbial conversion of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production represents a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the discovery of new microbial enzymes with high activity is critical for improving biomass conversion processes. While attempts to identify superior lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have focused predominantly on the animal gut, biomass-degrading communities in landfill sites represent an unexplored resource of hydrolytic enzymes for biomass conversion. Here, to address the paucity of information on biomass-degrading microbial diversity beyond the gastrointestinal tract, cellulose (cotton) "baits" were incubated in landfill leachate microcosms to enrich the landfill cellulolytic microbial community for taxonomic and functional characterization. Metagenome and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated the dominance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Fibrobacteres in the landfill cellulolytic community. Functional metagenome analysis revealed 8,371 carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) belonging to 244 CAZyme families. In addition to observing biomass-degrading enzymes of anaerobic bacterial "cellulosome" systems of members of the Firmicutes, we report the first detection of the Fibrobacter cellulase system and the Bacteroidetes polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) in landfill sites. These data provide evidence for the presence of multiple mechanisms of biomass degradation in the landfill microbiome and highlight the extraordinary functional diversity of landfill microorganisms as a rich source of biomass-degrading enzymes of potential biotechnological significance. © 2017 Ransom-Jones et al.

AB  - Furfural is a base chemical with a wide range of applications and with a great opportunity for market growth in the near term. Derived from biomass, its production may be incorporated to the Brazilian chemical industry using sugarcane bagasse as feedstock. In this context, the integration of a furfural plant to a first generation bioethanol facility, within the biorefinery concept, was simulated considering different scenarios compared to an autonomous bioethanol distillery. The economic analysis of the different scenarios showed that the revenues from furfural commercialization increase the internal rate of return of the project for maximum furfural production (22.0%) in comparison to a conventional ethanol distillery (13.5%), despite the decrease in electricity output. Moreover, the economic analysis of the results pointed out the possibility of lowering furfural prices to levels that could lead to its use as a precursor for biofuels.

AB  - Biofuels derived from renewable biomass has been the focus of bio-based economy. Especially the development of new processes and facilities from lignocellulosic waste for advanced biofuel production represents an important field for academic research and industrial innovation within bioenergy development. The technical pathways for advanced biofuel production include the processes of cellulosic ethanol through lignocellulose hydrolysis-sugar fermentation, two-step hydrogenation (hydrodeoxygenation and hydroisomerization) of oils and fats (HVO), biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis, biomass pyrolysis-upgrading of bio-oil and hydrotreating of algae oil via thermochemical, biochemical and hybrid conversions. Bio-oil, syngas, and sugars are used as platform chemicals. The progress of advanced biofuel development and the project activities in foreign countries were reviewed, which used lignocellulosic biomass, energy crops, municipal solid waste and organic waste as feedstock. The policies and regulations of advanced biofuels in America, Brazil, European Union and Canada, were described and compared. The current status of commercial and demonstration-scale facilities for advanced biofuel production was also discussed, mainly following the conversion processes of lignocellulosic ethanol, hydrotreated oils/fats (HVO) and biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Although advanced biofuels have advantages for sustainable development, energy security and low carbon emission, the overall production and develop pathways cannot have cost parity with fossil-based fuels. The key barriers associated with its high cost include the unreliable feedstock availability, high production cost and uncertainty of policies. Biomass feedstock, especially lignocellulosic biomass, has huge annual amount worldwide, yet the significant hurdles for collecting, transportation and storage of biomass are needed to overcome in the scale-up of advanced biofuel production. And the limited lignocellulosic feedstock supply is also the result of uncertainties associated with its demand in the current market. Technical risk associated with scaling-up facilities is another restraining factor for investors due to the complexity of lignocellulosic feedstock and its conversion technologies, compared with starch-based corn ethanol. Financial support for pilot and demonstration plants can provide a valuable opportunity to validate technology from lab scale to commercial scale. Thus it would significantly reduce the technical and financial risks for new technology deployment. Cheap crude oil price in recent years is another reason, which resulted in the lack of policy irritation intention from government. As a consequence, the inconsistent developments of advanced biofuels cause its slowdown, and then form a vicious circle for limited feedstock supplements. The assessment of advanced biofuel in China was also discussed and its future development prospect was proposed. Due to the concern of food security in China, the only solution of biofuel production is using waste biomass via advanced technologies. HVO process is relatively easy and mature due to the utilization of bolt-on technologies by introduction of the advanced biofuel refineries into the existing petroleum refinery. Expanding the sources of oil feedstock by screening oil-fixing microorganisms, planting oil plant on marginal land will guarantee its long-term development in China. Cellulosic ethanol, bio-gasoline and biodiesel from lignocellulosic feedstock are essential guarantee for its perspective production. It is necessary to financially support cellulosic ethanol facilities of 100000 t/a and gasification-Fischer Tropsch facilities of 10000 t/a to demonstrate advanced biofuel production. And consistent policy measures are needed to provide investors with certainty about the future growth of advanced biofuel production in China, such as national mandatory addition of biofuel in transportation fuel, and adequate investment on demonstration project. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A modeling process was developed to examine the economic and environmental benefits of utilizing energy crops for bioenergy products in the northeastern United States. Three energy crops (hybrid willow, switchgrass, and Miscanthus) that can potentially grow on marginal agricultural land or abandoned mine land in the region were considered in the analytical process for the production of biofuels, biopower, and pellet fuel. The supply chain components for the economic analysis and life cycle modeling processes included feedstock establishment, harvest, transportation, storage, preprocessing, conversion, distribution, and final usage of the bioenergy products. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of energy crop yield, transportation distance, conversion rate, facility capacity, and internal rate of return (IRR) on the production of bioenergy products. The required selling price (RSP) ranged from $7.7/GJ to $47.9/GJ for different bioenergy products. The production of biopower had the highest RSP and pellet fuel had the lowest RSP. The results also indicated that bioenergy production using hybrid willow demonstrated lower RSP than the other two perennial grasses. Pellet production had presented the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (less than 10 kg CO2 eq per 1000 MJ) and fossil energy consumption (less than 150 MJ per 1000 MJ). The production of biofuel resulted in the highest GHG emissions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that IRR was the most sensitive factor to RSP, followed by conversion rate for biofuel and biopower production. Fuel conversion efficiency and feedstock transport distance had a significant effect on the life cycle environmental impact of the bioenergy products studied. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In the past years, a series of initiatives on biotechnology research have been launched, which were focused on investigating methods to improve productivity and metabolic processes related to biomass production, as well as for bio-refining biomass to produce biofuels or other valuable products from the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Advanced techniques of the biological systems electromagnetic stimulation with radiation from various frequency domains are increasingly being studied and applied in practice. This paper analyses the physiological response of the algal species of Chlorella sorokiniana exposed to the DC and AC electric fields generated at low frequencies in the range of 10 Hz -10 kHz and for the different electric field intensities. Through a series of algal suspension exposures in the electric field of well-defined parameters, the cell growth rate for the exposed samples was analysed, as compared to the samples unexposed in the electric field. The experimental results were interpreted in terms of cellular mechanisms identified on theoretical studies and can be applied in the perspective of the development of more efficient biotechnological processes. © 2017, ICPE Electra Publishing House.

AB  - Fuel consumption and the emission of pollutant gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), derived from fuel combustion formulated from pure petrol and mixed at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% v/v of dehydrated ethanol are evaluated. A monocylindric, four stroke, 196 cc, small non-road engine (SNRE), locked to a generator with maximum power of 2,400 W, at 0, 600, 1.200, 1.800 and 2.000 W, was employed. An automatic analyzer similar to that normally employed in the inspection of engines was used to determine gas emission. Results showed that decreases in CO, HC and NOx concentrations reached 75, 67 and 7% for the lowest charge (0 W ) and 189, 3 and 43% for the highest one (2000 W ), respectively, due to the gradual addition of ethanol to petrol. However, a mean 10% increase in fuel consumption was reported.

AB  - World demand in clean energy is on the increase, especially electricity and biofuels such as ethanol. Although biofuel emit low CO2 rates, there is at present a discussion on what actually characterizes clean energy due to social, economic and environmental impacts of production. Current paper identifies the assets and negative impacts caused by the production of sugarcane-based energy in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, and evaluates economic, social and environmental sustainability. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for economic, social and environmental treatments was employed for data on the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, ranking fourth in Brazilian production. Results suggest that the social aspect is the most relevant to determine the establishment of an sugar-based factory in the state coupled to the fact that sugar-based energy chains have more positive than negative impacts.

AB  - The Exergy Replacement Cost (ERC) is an indicator that is used to ascertain the sustainability of non-renewable resource depletion. Specifically, it measures the amount of exergy society would have to expend if it were forced to re-capture and re-concentrate dispersed minerals back into a manmade usable deposit. Due to an assumption regarding the non-substitutability of fossil fuels, the original method failed to properly account for them. In fact, it sub-estimated their exergy replacement cost forty-seven-fold, on average, when considering solar radiation to fuel, and by approximately fivefold when going from crop to fuel. This new method, via the cumulative exergy consumption (CExC), calculates the exergy replacement cost of photosynthesis and bio-energy production, as together they form the best available technology when it comes to closing the carbon cycle. This approach ties together the "cradle to grave" to the "grave to cradle", standardises the ERC calculations and enables comparisons between fuel and non-fuel mineral consumption. It also opens a discussion as to the role of the ERC in sustainability debates and whether resource depletion should be a matter of geological patrimony or material/energy services. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Legislation passed in 2007 by the U.S. Congress increased by about 1.3 billion bushels the net amount of corn required to be processed annually into ethanol for motor-fuel use. We estimate that corn prices were about 30% higher from 2006 to 2014 than they would have been without this demand increase. We develop a partially identified structural vector autoregression model. Our identification strategy is unique in the literature because it enables us to estimate the effects of transitory shocks, such as weather, separately from the effects of persistent shocks, such as the increased ethanol mandate. Moreover, by only partially identifying our model, we show how to generate robust conclusions without strong identifying assumptions. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Limited information is available about soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, N2O emission factors (EFs), and yield-scaled N2O emissions for biogas residues used to fertilize crops in semiarid regions. To address this knowledge gap, a 4-yr field experiment was conducted in a semiarid climate to determine growing season N2O fluxes from soil receiving (i) anaerobically digested solid beef cattle manure (digestate), (ii) separated solids from the digestate (separated solids), and (iii) undigested solid beef cattle manure (cattle manure) applied to target one and two times the recommended rates (200 and 400 kg total N ha-1) for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) forage, assuming 50% of N was annually plant available. Nitrous oxide fluxes were determined using vented static chambers. Over the four growing seasons, 95, 80, and 81% of the N2O flux occurred within 36 d of applying digestate, separated solids, and cattle manure, respectively. The cumulative N2O emissions with digestate were 4.7 and 4.1 times the values of the separated solids and cattle manure, respectively. The digestate N2O EF was 13.6 and 10.6 times the values of the separated solids and cattle manure, respectively, but the N2O EF based on applied mineral N was similar for all amendments. The yield-scaled N2O emissions with digestate were 4.3 and 3.6 times the values of the separated solids and cattle manure, respectively. In the semiarid region of southern Alberta, liquid biogas residues have a higher risk for N2O emissions than both the separated solid fraction of the biogas residues and undigested cattle manure. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Agricultural landscape design has gained recognition by the international environmental and development community as a strategy to address multiple goals in land, water, and ecosystem service management; however, field research is needed to quantify impacts on specific local environments. The production of bioenergy crops in specific landscape positions within a graincrop field can serve the dual purpose of producing cellulosic biomass (nutrient recovery) while also providing regulating ecosystem services to improve water quality (nutrient reduction). The effectiveness of such a landscape design was evaluated by the strategic placement of a 0.8-ha short-rotation shrub willow (Salix miyabeana Seemen) bioenergy buffer along marginal soils in a 6.5- ha corn (Zea mays L.) field in a 6-yr field study in central Illinois. The impact of willow integration on water quality (soil water, shallow groundwater leaching, and crop nutrient uptake) and quantity (soil moisture and transpiration) was monitored in comparison with corn in the willow's first cycle of growth. Willows significantly reduced nitrate leachate in shallow subsurface water by 88% while maintaining adequate nutrient and water usage. Results suggest that willows offer an efficient nutrient-reduction strategy and may provide additional ecosystem services and benefits, including enhanced soil health. However, low values for calculated willow biomass will need to be readdressed in the future as harvest data become available to understand contributing factors that affected productivity beyond nutrient availability. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Intensive studies are being conducted to improve alternative energy resources due to a significant increase in the risks arising from the use of oil based energy in recent years. Biomass, ethanol and biodiesel are the most important alternative energy resources are renewable, recyclable and non-polluting. Biodiesel has caused an increase in food prices and has made it difficult to obtain food in some less developed countries, due to the allocation of agricultural land for the cultivation of oil crops rather than food production, to gain more profit. Therefore, microalgae, which can grow easily in fields not used for agriculture and for which per hectare yield is very high when compared with other biodiesel resources; appear to be a new biodiesel resource. In this study, the Chlorella protothecoides species belonging to the class Chlorophyceae were examined, suitability for biofuel production, large amount of oil, different temperature requirements. The effect of some growing parameters of this species, on different light intensity (172 lux, 186 lux and 265 lux) and different light cycles (12/12, 18/6, 6/18 and 24/0) on cell numbers, pH and conductivity values, has been investigated. According to the results of this study, it was determined that the effect of both light cycles and light intensity are important for cell numbers, pH, conductivity and salinity values. © by PSP.

AB  - Biomass of Flourensia oolepis, a native shrub of the semi-arid central region of Argentina, was treated by vacuum pyrolysis to investigate the potential of this species to be used as a source of energy and chemicals. In this study we determined the influence of temperature on the product yields in different plant organs (leaves and stems), characterized the bio-oil, and assessed the bioactivity of biochar aqueous extracts through germination and growth bioassays with Lactuca sativa. The pyrolysis oils showed a predominance of long chain, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the leaves pyrolysate. The sesquiterpene spathulenol was the major compound in these reactions. Pyrolysis of stems produced mainly phenolic compounds. The effect of phosphoric acid pretreatment on leaves and stems was also evaluated in order to improve bio-oil yield and selectivity to any interesting compound. The results showed that acid treatment enhanced the liquid formation in pyrolysis of leaves giving a high amount of long chain hydrocarbons compared with the untreated organ. The biochar water extracts from leaves exhibited a hormetic type of response, with a promoting growth effect on roots and shoots up to 225%, and only a transient inhibition of germination at higher doses (≥7.5% w/v). Biochar water extracts from stems did not affect seed germination and showed a remarkable promoting effect, stimulating growth at all concentrations tested up to 330%. Although additional testing is required, overall results show F. oolepis as a promissory species for the production of bio-oil and biochar with a wide range of applications, including the potential use as growth regulator. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The bioethanol is playing an increasingly important role in renewable energy in China. Based on the theory of circular economy, integration of different resources by polygeneration is one of the solutions to improve energy efficiency and to reduce environmental impact. In this study, three modes of bioethanol production were selected to evaluate the life cycle energy efficiency and environmental impact of sweet potato-based bioethanol. The results showed that, the net energy ratio was greater than 1 and the value of net energy gain was positive in the three production modes, in which the maximum value appeared in the circular economy mode (CEM). The environment emission mainly occurred to bioethanol conversion unit in the conventional production mode (CPM) and the cogeneration mode (CGM), and eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) were the most significant environmental impact category. While compared with CPM and CGM, the environmental impact of CEM significantly declined due to increasing recycling, and plant cultivation unit mainly contributed to EP and GWP. And the comprehensive evaluation score of environmental impact decreased by 73.46% and 23.36%. This study showed that CEM was effective in improving energy efficiency, especially in reducing the environmental impact, and it provides a new method for bioethanol production. © 2017 Zhang et al.

AB  - About 40 percent of US corn is now used to produce biofuels, which are used as substitutes for gasoline in transportation. In this paper, we use a Ricardian model with differential land quality to show that world food prices could rise by about 32 percent by 2022. About half of this increase is from the biofuel mandate and the rest is a result of demand-side effects in the form of population growth and income-induced changes in dietary preferences, from cereals to meat and dairy products. However, aggregate world carbon emissions would increase, because of significant land conversion to farming and leakage from lower oil prices. © The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2016.

AB  - Growing concerns of energy security and climate change mitigation have led to new policy initiatives by many countries in the area of renewable energy. In the same direction, India's National Policy on Biofuels has now allowed producers to directly sell biofuel to consumers. This is to ensure the minimum supply of biofuels in the domestic market and meet an “indicative target” of 20% blending for biofuels. This policy change will raise concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from land-use changes (LUC) that would be incurred by accelerated production of the biofuel feedstock. Efficacy of biofuel should be assessed by accounting for its potential LUC emissions. The conversion of land from its original state to an altered state for production of biofuels feedstocks, has been shown to emit direct greenhouse gases. Perennial tree species sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) and certain oil seed bearing perennial tree species can be grown on degraded wasteland and degraded cropland and can also be used to produce biofuels. Carbon dioxide emissions/saving potential from plantations of perennial tree species on degraded wasteland and degraded cropland were studied and results showed that these tree species had huge net CO2 sequestration potential. © 2017

AB  - Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein that plays an important role in lipid droplet (LD) formation in animal cells. However, no obvious homologue of FIT2 is found in plants. Here, we tested the function of FIT2 in plant cells by ectopically expressing mouse (Mus musculus) FIT2 in Nicotiana tabacum suspension-cultured cells, Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Confocal microscopy indicated that the expression of FIT2 dramatically increased the number and size of LDs in leaves of N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis, and lipidomics analysis and mass spectrometry imaging confirmed the accumulation of neutral lipids in leaves. FIT2 also increased seed oil content by ~13% in some stable, overexpressing lines of Arabidopsis. When expressed transiently in leaves of N. benthamiana or suspension cells of N. tabacum, FIT2 localized specifically to the ER and was often concentrated at certain regions of the ER that resembled ER-LD junction sites. FIT2 also colocalized at the ER with other proteins known to be involved in triacylglycerol biosynthesis or LD formation in plants, but not with ER resident proteins involved in electron transfer or ER-vesicle exit sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mouse FIT2 promotes LD accumulation in plants, a surprising functional conservation in the context of a plant cell given the apparent lack of FIT2 homologues in higher plants. These results suggest also that FIT2 expression represents an effective synthetic biology strategy for elaborating neutral lipid compartments in plant tissues for potential biofuel or bioproduct purposes. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Short rotation coppice willow (SRCW) is a high-yielding energy crop that can be used to produce solid, liquid or gaseous biofuels. The crop is harvested during the winter, when the leaves have dropped. For economic reasons, however, most fuel processing plants require continuous year-round delivery of raw material. Thus, SRCW should be harvested as stems or in larger pieces in order to be storable, and not chipped directly at harvest for immediate use in large-scale heating plants, which is common practice at present. The aim of the project within which this study was conducted is to find cost-effective whole-stem harvesting and handling systems for year-round deliveries of natural-dried SRCW. A discrete event simulation model for such systems was developed in this study, taking weather, soil trafficability, geographical conditions, natural drying of the material and storage losses into account. The model was applied to a fictitious processing plant in Uppsala, Sweden. Machine performance and costs for a system with one stem harvester and up to three in-field shuttles, together with one chipper truck for chipping and transport, were investigated. The simulations showed that field trafficability had a crucial impact on total quantity harvested. The total cost was € 40 t−1 dry matter. Yield of SRCW and harvest productivity were important factors regarding costs. The model can be used to design cost-effective harvesting and handling systems for year-round deliveries of SRCW. © 2017 IAgrE

AB  - Xylose isomerase (XylC) from Clostridium cellulovorans can simultaneously perform isomerization and fermentation of d-xylose, the main component of lignocellulosic biomass, and is an attractive candidate enzyme. In this study, we optimized a specified metal cation in a previously established Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain displaying XylC. We investigated the effect of each metal cation on the catalytic function of the XylC-displaying S. cerevisiae. Results showed that the divalent cobalt cations (Co2+) especially enhanced the activity by 46-fold. Co2+ also contributed to d-xylose fermentation, which resulted in improving ethanol yields and xylose consumption rates by 6.0- and 2.7-fold, respectively. Utility of the extracellular xylose isomerization system was exhibited in the presence of mixed sugar. XylC-displaying yeast showed the faster d-xylose uptake than the yeast producing XI intracellularly. Furthermore, direct xylan saccharification and fermentation was performed by unique yeast co-culture system. A xylan-degrading yeast strain was established by displaying two kinds of xylanases; endo-1,4-β-xylanase (Xyn11B) from Saccharophagus degradans, and β-xylosidase (XlnD) from Aspergillus niger. The yeast co-culture system enabled fine-tuning of the initial ratios of the displayed enzymes (Xyn11B:XlnD:XylC) by adjusting the inoculation ratios of Xylanases (Xyn11B and XlnD)-displaying yeast and XylC-displaying yeast. When the enzymes were inoculated at the ratio of 1:1:2 (1.39 × 1013: 1.39 × 1013: 2.78 × 1013 molecules), 6.0 g/L ethanol was produced from xylan. Thus, the cofactor optimization and the yeast co-culture system developed in this study could expand the prospect of biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - This study aimed to determine theoretically, the electrical optimum power of LFG using the maximum net benefit (MNB) methodology, and taking into consideration the economic, demographic, and regional aspects of the Inter municipal Consortium of the Micro-region of the High Sapucaí for Sanitary Landfill (CIMASAS, as acronym in Portuguese), that is located in the southern part of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. To this end, the prognosis for a 20-year period of household solid waste generation in this region was estimated and quantified based on population data, in order to estimate the LFG production and the energy that can be generated. From this point, the optimum power for thermal power plant (TPP) by LFG was determined. The results indicated that the landfill in this region could produce more 66,293,282 m3CH4 (with maximum power of 997 kW in 2036) in twenty years and that there would be no economic viability to generate energy from LFG, because the Net Present Value (NPV) would not be positive. The smallest population to that can achieve a minimum attractiveness rate (MAR) of 15% should be 3,700,000 inhabitants under the conditions studied. Considering the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) Resolutions, it would be 339,000 inhabitants with an installed power of 440 kW. In addition, the outcome of the CIMASAS case-study demonstrated the applicability of MNB methodology for the determination of TPP optimum power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There are great challenges to replace fossil fuels by biofuels, including the development of efficient technologies and adequate strategic planning. For the manufacture of biofuels at the industrial scale, there is a need to optimize the overall associated supply chain. Among biofuels, the global market for the aviation biofuel has increased drastically, mainly due to the forecasted growth of the aviation sector. Nevertheless, the supply chain for the aviation biofuel has specific characteristics, which are different from the case of bioethanol and biodiesel. Therefore, this paper presents a general optimization approach for optimizing the supply chain of aviation biofuels. A case study is presented accounting for the projection of the Mexican government for implementing the use of aviation biofuel in the airport network. The application of the proposed approach generates very interesting solutions, which are grouped in a Pareto front; from these results, it can be highlighted that the demand for aviation biofuel in the Mexican market can be satisfied with a gross economic benefit of M US$ 1681 per year, and savings of 93% of carbon dioxide emissions. The generated information can contribute to the establishment of the sustainable supply chain for aviation biofuels in Mexico. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Crop residues are potential biofuel feedstocks, but residue removal may reduce soil carbon (C). The inclusion of a cover crop in a corn bioenergy system could provide additional biomass, mitigating the negative effects of residue removal by adding to stable soil C pools. In a no-till continuous corn bioenergy system in the northern US Corn Belt, we used 13CO2 pulse labeling to trace plant C from a winter rye (Secale cereale) cover crop into different soil C pools for 2 years following rye cover crop termination. Corn stover left as residue (30% of total stover) contributed 66, corn roots 57, rye shoots 61, rye roots 50, and rye rhizodeposits 25 g C m−2 to soil. Five months following cover crop termination, belowground cover crop inputs were three times more likely to remain in soil C pools than were aboveground inputs, and much of the root-derived C was in mineral-associated soil fractions. After 2 years, both above- and belowground inputs had declined substantially, indicating that the majority of both root and shoot inputs are eventually mineralized. Our results underscore the importance of cover crop roots vs. shoots and the importance of cover crop rhizodeposition (33% of total belowground cover crop C inputs) as a source of soil C. However, the eventual loss of most cover crop C from these soils indicates that cover crops will likely need to be included every year in rotations to accumulate soil C. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Given the growing need for biofuel production but the lack of suitable land for producing biomass feedstock, development of stress-tolerant energy crops will be increasingly important. We used comparative transcriptomics to reveal differential responses to long-term salt stress among five populations of Miscanthus lutarioriparius grown in the natural habitats and salinity experimental site. A total of 59 genes were found to be potentially responsive to the high-salinity conditions shared by the five populations, including those involved in detoxification, plant defense, photosynthesis, and signal transduction. Of these genes, about 70% were related to abiotic stress response. Among five populations, the most contrasting performance between relatively high survival rates and the relatively weak growing traits was in accordance with the down-regulation of genes involved in growth and up-regulation of genes related to plant stress tolerance in one of the populations. These results might reveal a potential tolerance-productivity trade-off, where resources were allocated from growth to stress resistance. The comparative transcriptomics of different populations among different environments will provide a basis for breeding and domestication of energy crops. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Prospective evaluation of the lifecycle impacts of aviation biofuel production in Abu Dhabi, UAE based on a production system that integrates aquaculture, saltwater agriculture, and mangrove silviculture, termed an Integrated Seawater Energy Agriculture System (ISEAS) in order to investigate its energetic and environmental potential compared to conventional fuels. Methods: We compare the hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) produced from ISEAS against fossil jet fuel using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Based on a detailed description of the production process, we use data from a wide-ranging literature review and experimental results from the specific location to make informed assumptions for the range of the process inputs and yields. We then analyze several process configuration scenarios with different ranges. Results and discussion: ISEAS can produce aviation biofuels, electricity, and food while afforesting coastal desert land, acting as a long-term sink for carbon, minimizing freshwater consumption, and having beneficial land use impacts when compared to fossil jet fuel production. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we show that ISEAS HRJ emits 38 to 68% less greenhouse gases than fossil jet fuel and yields an overall positive net energy balance under all scenarios except one with an extensive use of desalinated water. Conclusions: ISEAS offers a promising pathway for integrating aquaculture and seawater agriculture in arid regions. It is essentially a process to sustainably augment aquaculture-based products by using its waste as a biofuel resource. Achieving positive emissions results depend critically on minimizing freshwater use, maximizing biomass yield and to a lesser extent the performance of biomass gasification. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Efforts to reduce the indirect land use change (ILUC) -related carbon emissions caused by biofuels has led to inclusion of an ILUC factor as a part of the carbon intensity of biofuels in a Low Carbon Fuel Standard. While previous research has provided varying estimates of this ILUC factor, there has been no research examining the economic effects and additional carbon savings from including this factor in implementing a Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Here we show that inclusion of an ILUC factor in a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard led to additional abatement of cumulative emissions over 2007-2027 by 1.3 to 2.6% (0.6-1.1 billion mega-grams carbon-dioxide-equivalent (Mg CO 2 e-1) compared to those without an ILUC factor, depending on the ILUC factors utilized. The welfare cost to the US of this additional abatement ranged from $61 to $187 MgCO2e-1 and was substantially greater than the social cost of carbon of $50 MgCO2e-1. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Rice straw is a major crop residue which is burnt in many countries, creating significant air pollution. Thus, alternative routes for disposal of rice straw are needed. Biotechnological treatment of rice straw hydrolysate has potential to convert this agriculture waste into valuable biofuel(s) and platform chemicals. Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a thermophile with properties specially suited for use as a biocatalyst in lignocellulosic bioprocesses, such as high optimal temperature and tolerance to high levels of ethanol. However, the capabilities of G. thermoglucosidasius to utilise sugars in rice straw hydrolysate for making bioethanol and other platform chemicals have not been fully explored. In this work, we have created a genome scale metabolic model (denoted iGT736) of the organism containing 736 gene products, 1159 reactions and 1163 metabolites. The model was validated both by purely theoretical approaches and by comparing the behaviour of the model to previously published experimental results. The model was then used to determine the yields of a variety of platform chemicals from glucose and xylose — two primary sugars in rice straw hydrolysate. A comparison with results from a model of Escherichia coli shows that G. thermoglucosidasius is capable of producing a wider range of products, and that for the products also produced by E. coli, the yields are comparable. We also discuss strategies to utilise arabinose, a minor component of rice straw hydrolysate, and propose additional reactions to lead to the synthesis of xylitol, not currently produced by G. thermoglucosidasius. Our results provide additional motivation for the current exploration of the industrial potential of G. thermoglucosidasius and we make our model publicly available to aid the development of metabolic engineering strategies for this organism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We developed an energy-efficient, flat-plate, dual-chambered microbial peroxide producing cell (MPPC) as an anaerobic energy-conversion technology for converting primary sludge (PS) at the anode and producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the cathode. We operated the MPPC with a 9 day hydraulic retention time in the anode. A maximum H2O2 concentration of ∼230 mg/L was achieved in 6 h of batch cathode operation. This is the first demonstration of H2O2 production using PS in an MPPC, and the energy requirement for H2O2 production was low (∼0.87 kWh/kg H2O2) compared to previous studies using real wastewaters. The H2O2 gradually decayed with time due to the diffusion of H2O2-scavenging carbonate ions from the anode. We compared the anodic performance with a H2-producing microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Both cells (MEC and MPPC) achieved ∼30% Coulombic recovery. While similar microbial communities were present in the anode suspension and anode biofilm for the two operating modes, aerobic bacteria were significant only on the side of the anode facing the membrane in the MPPC. Coupled with a lack of methane production in the MPPC, the presence of aerobic bacteria suggests that H2O2 diffusion to the anode side caused inhibition of methanogens, which led to the decrease in chemical oxygen demand removal. Thus, the Coulombic efficiency was ∼16% higher in the MPPC than in the MEC (64% versus 48%, respectively). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The expansion of sugarcane cultivation in Brazil for sugar and bioethanol production has led to increased N-fertilizer use. Today, sugarcane is harvested mechanically and resulting crop residues are retained as a mulch on the soil surface. We hypothesized that the combination of these activities (topdressing N-fertilization applied on the mulching) promotes soil conditions that modify the microbiota involved in the soil N cycle, and consequently raise N2O emissions. We investigated a commercial sugarcane crop to determine whether a topdressing of N-fertilizer (100 kg N ha−1 as ammonium nitrate) combined with sugarcane straw mulch (14 Mg ha−1 dry mass) change soil attributes (pH, total C and N, microbial biomass C and N, inorganic-N and WFPS%), and the copy numbers of genes (nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ) involved in soil N-transformation with consequent increases in N2O emissions. The 3 × 2 factorial treatments were: three soil surface treatments: i) bare soil (no-straw); ii) sugarcane straw and, iii) synthetic straw (polypropylene strips) and with or without an application of N-fertilizer. The mulch treatments (sugarcane or synthetic) produced the highest emissions, which occurred at two ‘N2O hot moments’ within 10 days after fertilization. Regarding fertilizer treatments, cumulative N2O emissions did not differ between the straw treatments (∼99 mg m−2) but were higher than those of the no-straw treatments (51 mg m−2). Similar behavior was found in the no-fertilizer treatments where the highest emissions were found in the straw treatments (∼30 mg m−2) and lowest in the no-straw treatments (6 mg m−2). The copy numbers of the nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ genes were equal in the straw treatments, but were significantly lower in the no-straw. While high copy numbers of the norB gene were associated with the ‘N2O hot moments,’ the same was not observed for the other genes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that N2O emissions were higher in relation to microbial biomass and WFPS% than they were in relation to the norB gene and inorganic-N. Our findings show that N-fertilization combined with sugarcane-straw mulching raised N2O emissions by promoting a chain of interactions between soil attributes and microorganisms involved in N-transformation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Implementation of greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement strategies often ends up as the responsibility of municipal action rather than national policies. Impacts of local GHG reduction measures were investigated in the EU FP7 funded project Urban Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China and Europe (URGENCHE). Kuopio in Finland was one of the case study cities. The assessed reduction measures were (1) increased use of biomass in local heat and power cogeneration plant, (2) energy efficiency improvements of residences, (3) increased biofuel use in traffic, and (4) increased small scale combustion of wood for residential heating. Impact assessment compared the 2010 baseline with a 2020 BAU (business as usual) scenario and a 2020 CO2 interventions scenario. Changes in emissions were assessed for CO2, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NOx, and SO2, and respective impacts were assessed for PM2.5 ambient concentrations and health effects. The assessed measures would reduce the local CO2 emissions in the Kuopio urban area by over 50% and local emissions of PM2.5 would clearly decrease. However, the annual average ambient PM2.5 concentration would decrease by just 4%. Thus, only marginal population level health benefits would be achieved with these assumed local CO2 abatement actions. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of bioenergy, the sustainability issue of bioenergy has aroused more and more attention globally. China is also highly concerned about the sustainable development of bioenergy. But, there are only sustainable principles emphasized by government with no specific criteria and indicators, e.g., avoiding bioenergy competition for food crops and land. Therefore, it is necessary to establish systematic criteria and indicators to provide clear and executable guidelines for the sustainable development of bioenergy in China. Several regions in the world have promulgated regulation framework or certification standard to assure the sustainable production and utilization of bioenergy. Also some international institutions, such as Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have published voluntary sustainable standard for decision makers. Therefore, to learn the global experience is a good option to promote the establishment of sustainable requirements in China. The typical sustainable bioenergy initiatives in the world are introduced in the paper, including regulation frameworks, certification standards and voluntary standards without threshold. The key criteria and indicators are reviewed. It is found that although the principles of sustainable development are the same for diverse initiatives, their focuses on environmental, social or economic aspects are different due to their different starting points and goals. The importance of involving greenhouse gas (GHG) emission as a key indicator is analyzed, and the challenges on how to quantify GHG emission are also discussed, such as, the allocation of byproduct's emission and the impact of direct land use change & indirect land use change. The requirements on GHG emission reduction of bioenergy compared to fossil fuel are also reviewed. The supporting role of bioenergy sustainability initiatives for the bioenergy industrial policies is elaborated based on the practices of the EU (European Union) and the United States. And finally, related policy suggestions in China are proposed. The suggestions include: 1) Sustainability requirement (criteria or indicators) of bioenergy should be proposed in Renewable Energy Law and Bioenergy Development Planning in China to guide the direction of industrial development; 2) the criteria and indicators of sustainable bioenergy should be both scientific and implementable with clear goals and focus, and should be selected based on domestic situation; 3) GHG emissions counting methodology of different kinds of bioenergy should be provided by government to facilitate industries to meet the sustainability requirement, and the threshold of life cycle GHG emission reduction of bioenergy needs to be fully discussed with stakeholders and strengthened gradually; 4) priority should be given to aviation biofuels, bioenergy derived from residues and wastes, and systematic sustainability criteria and indictors should be established for other biofuels for transportation use in the near term; and, 5) the industrial policies and research and development funding of bioenergy should be linked with the sustainability requirements, and the policy support should be inclined to the sustainable production and utilization of bioenergy which can meet the requirements. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel for energy production is one of the major problems being faced worldwide. As an alternative to fossil fuels, first and second generation biofuel was developed from corn, grains and lignocellulosic agricultural residues. These generations are inefficient in achieving the desired rate of biofuel production, climate change mitigation and economic growth. Therefore, third generation biofuel specifically derived from microalgae have proved to be a promising unconventional energy source. Microalgae are microscopic organisms that grow in salt or fresh water and have been used for producing metabolites, cosmetics and for energy production. The conventional approaches used for biofuel production include pyrolysis, gasification, direct combustion and thermomechanical liquefaction. The search for biological and eco-friendly approaches led to the emergence of Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which provide a new solution to energy crisis. Integration of photosynthetic organisms such as microalgae into MFC resulted in a new approach i.e. Microbial Solar Cell, which can convert solar energy into electrical energy via photosynthesis. Microbial solar cells have broad range application in wastewater treatment, biodiesel processing and intermediate metabolite production.

AB  - Recently, several global phenomena have sparked a rise in interest for biofuels. One of them is the rise of oil prices. Due to several reasons-large increases in demand from China and India, political instability in several oil producers and various other factors, oil prices have risen almost continuously from early 2002 to 2008. Biomass as a fuel for energy requirements is a better choice as it is renewable and is also low on GHG emissions. Biofuels primarily include bio-ethanol and biodiesel. With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass such as trees is also used as fuel stock for ethanol production. The UN International Biofuel Forum formed by Brazil, China, India, South Africa, United States and European Union, which derive biofuel mainly from agricultural feedstock e. g. corn, wheat etc. but there are various current issues with biofuels production from agricultural feedstock which are presently being discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include the food v/s fuel debate, carbon emission levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, and impact on water resources, human right issues, biofuel prices, energy balance and efficiency. On the other hand, biofuels from forest biomass (cellulosic ethanol) have the advantage of reducing GHG emissions by 85% over reformulated gasoline. Among the various forest species desirable for biofuels production, a lot of research has been done on the Salix spp. and Populus spp. belonging to the Salicaceae family. These trees can be grown in climatically challenging conditions where the options for growing food crops are limited, therefore, minimising conflicts of food versus fuel. Thus, more work, coupled with the detailed understanding of their genetics in future will allow scientists to provide novel means for improved uses of biomass for biofuel production rather than just limit the use of their wood for timber purpose only.

AB  - Among forest diseases, fungi are the most important agents that cause irreparable losses to the wood of standing trees and logs. In this study, pyrolysis of undecayed and decayed beech (Fagus orientalis) wood were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor at pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The influence of Trametes versicolor fungal decay on the yield and chemical composition of products was investigated. The bio-oil yield was 62.5 wt% at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C for decayed wood, while the bio-oil yield was found to be about 58 wt% at the same temperature for undecayed wood. Bio-oils were characterized using some chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). It was found that Tetracosamethyl-cyclododecasiloxane (5.50 %), tetradecamethyl-hexasiloxane (4.85 %), 2,6-dime-thoxy-phenol (4.21 %), and benzene acetic acid (3.16 %) were the main oil components present in decayed beech wood, while syringol (14.86%), methoxyeugenol (6.59 %), naphthalene (4.41 %), o-guaiacol (3.60 %), isoeugenol (3.17 %), and 2-methoxy-4-methyl-phenol (3.08 %) were present in undecayed beech wood. These results show that decayed wood can be used for the production of bio-oil. © 2017, Journal Drvna Industrija. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global interest in biofuels has resulted in the development of novel land-use practices for the production of cellulosic biomass. One novel land-use practice that has recently been developed is intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) between rows of planted loblolly pines (Pinus taeda). However, our understanding of how intercropping switchgrass influences loblolly pine flora and fauna is limited. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of switchgrass cultivation within loblolly pine stands on invertebrate communities. We detected 2,913 individuals (n = 1,172 and 1,741 in 2014 and 2015, respectively), encompassing 13 orders. To examine invertebrate community composition among treatments, we conducted metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) in R. Multivariate analysis determined that treatment had a significant (Pr(&gt;r) = 0.01) influence on invertebrate communities. Furthermore, stable isotope analysis suggests that Orthopterans are not assimilating cultivated switchgrass (C4 species), but are instead assimilating C3 plant species, such as Rubus argutus (sawtooth blackberry). Results indicate that switchgrass intercropping may be a viable land-use practice for the co-production of cellulosic biomass and forest products and the maintenance of invertebrate communities associated with loblolly pine plantations.

AB  - Biofuels are environment friendly and economical. First-generation biofuels are made from sugar, starch and vegetable oils, and have an impact on food security, while second generation biofuels are generated from plant or algal material and are greener and sustainable. The present work focused on lab-scale application of hydrothermal carbonization to convert aquatic weed Ceratophyllum demersum into a second-generation biofuel—hydrochar. Hydrothermal carbonization has been carried out with and without catalysts in a high-pressure reactor under subcritical temperatures 240–320 °C, residence times 10–40 min and biomass to water dilution ratios varying from 1:4 to 1:12. Under noncatalytic conditions higher heating value and energy density were highest, 24.11 MJ/kg and 1.64 respectively at temperature of 300 °C and residence time of 30 min. The calorific value of noncatalytic hydrochar was enhanced further, respectively, to 29.0, 27.5 and 26.48 MJ/kg by catalysts KOH, Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Catalytic hydrochar had H/C and O/C atomic ratios of same order as that of high-rank bituminous coal. Van Krevelen diagram indicated KOH to be better catalyst followed by Na2CO3 and acetic acid. Hydrochar yield of 38% obtained in noncatalytic hydrothermal carbonization decreased with catalysts in following order; acetic acid &gt; Na2CO3 &gt; KOH, however, energy density was enhanced in order KOH &gt; Na2CO3 &gt; acetic acid. The research can prove a way forward in the direction of meeting part of global energy demand. At the same time, the problem of secondary pollution caused by piling up and decay of aquatic weeds will also be addressed to. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the response of Jatropha curcas L., an important bio-diesel plant species, to arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculations. AM species, isolated from its rhizosphere could colonize its roots/rhizospheres, indicating that J. curcas does not retard the activities of AM fungi. However, the seedlings did not respond positively to the inoculations and mycorrhizal dependency (MD) for some inoculants was in the negative range. This could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of big sized J. curcas seeds. Further results showed that the removal of cotyledons (metabolic reserves) immediately after seed germination did not increase MD of J. curcas. Workers from different countries have reported variable results on this aspect and it is generally admitted that different populations, varieties, cultivars or strains of any specific cultivated crop may react differently to different situations such as inoculation with AM fungi. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to test the different populations of J. curcas from various locations under a given set of conditions. © 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - In this paper we seek to understand the impact of expanded use of soybean oil biodiesel to address biofuel mandates on global vegetable oil markets, and in particular on the demand for palm oil. An open-economy equilibrium model is derived to investigate the market effects of biodiesel expansion on related energy and vegetable oil markets. The model is calibrated to represent the recent benchmark data in calendar year 2014. The simulation estimates suggest that the expanded use of soy oil for biodiesel in the US will have considerable impacts on world vegetable oil markets. The majority of the vegetable oil replacement is likely to occur through substitution of palm oil under a wide range of plausible elasticity values on the demand for vegetable oil and the demand substitution between soy oils and palm oils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European Union plays a globally influential role in environmental legislation, with policies and regulation rooted in particular norms. Through a narrative on regulatory capitalism, ecological modernization, and diffusion, we trace how the promotion of renewable energy in transport through subsidies, mandatory targets, and prescriptive criteria for liquid biofuels mobilize social forces for its market development. The study identifies prevailing norms, mechanisms of decision making, and the network of actors involved in this regulatory regime and also identifies where and through whom its expansion influenced decisions in Tanzania. The findings show how this regime emphasizes systematic eco-innovation of energy technologies, has a substitutable approach to natural capital, and subordinates social concerns to economic efficiency. The analysis shows how this regime mobilized a broader network of actors with similar interests, who mediated the political space of liquid biofuels in Tanzania in ways which conflicted with a domestic critique concerning land use. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - We evaluate how alternative future oil prices will influence the penetration of biofuels, energy production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use and other outcomes. Our analysis employs a global economy wide model and simulates alternative oil prices out to 2050 with and without a price on GHG emissions. In one case considered, based on estimates of available resources, technological progress and energy demand, the reference oil price rises to $124 by 2050. Other cases separately consider constant reference oil prices of $50, $75 and $100, which are targeted by adjusting the quantity of oil resources. In our simulations, higher oil prices lead to more biofuel production, more land being used for bioenergy crops, and fewer GHG emissions. Reducing oil resources to simulate higher oil prices has a strong income effect, so decreased food demand under higher oil prices results in an increase in land allocated to natural forests. We also find that introducing a carbon price reduces the differences in oil use and GHG emissions across oil price cases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Automatic land cover classification from satellite image time series is of paramount relevance to assess vegetation and crop status, with important implications in agriculture, biofuels, and food. However, due to the high cost and human resources needed to characterize and classify land cover through field campaigns, a recurrent limiting factor is the lack of available labeled data. On top of this, the biophysical-geophysical variables exhibit particular temporal structures that need to be exploited. Land cover classification based on image time series is very complex because of the data manifold distortions through time. We propose the use of the kernel manifold alignment (KEMA) method for domain adaptation of remote sensing time series before classification. KEMA is nonlinear and semisupervised and reduces to solve a simple generalized eigenproblem. We give empirical evidence of performance through classification of biophysical (leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fractional vegetation cover, and normalized difference vegetation index) time series on a global scale. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Algae is considered a promising future feedstock for biofuels. Although several studies have been conducted to assess the environmental impact of algae-based fuels, land use change is one area that is commonly overlooked in previous life cycle assessment studies. However, land use change can impact the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of algal biofuels when large tracts of land are converted to algal raceway cultivation systems. This study assesses the impacts of land use change through a variety of means. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 methodology was utilized to assess potential emissions resulting from the conversion of potential algae facility sites in the U.S. Gulf Coast, consisting of grassland, cropland, and forestland in several management conditions. These emission values over a 20-year time horizon were combined with guidance on promising sites for algae raceway development to provide an estimate of industry-wide GHG emissions impacts due to direct land use change (LUC). Direct LUC impacts appear to be important, with average GHG emissions of between 4 and 8 g CO2eq/MJ for grassland and cropland conversion, which is roughly 6.3% and 12.5% of the total GHG emission over the entire algae renewable diesel life cycle without considering the LUC. Emissions due to direct LUC could be even larger if previously forested lands are cleared, averaging 24.7 g CO2eq/MJ across a range of potential algae sites. This article details the methods, assumptions and initial LCA results for these land use change scenarios when considering the algae biofuels life cycle. Results from this LCA can help decision-makers recognize the importance of facility siting in overall environmental performance, and select locations of algae cultivation facilities to minimize direct LUC emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels have been seen as potential sources to meet future energy demand as a renewable and sustainable energy source. Despite the fact that the production technology of first-generation biofuels is consolidated, these biofuels are produced from foods crops such as grains, sugar cane, and vegetable oils competing with food for crop use and agricultural land. In recent years, it was found that microalgae have the potential to provide a viable alternative to fossil fuels as source of biofuels without compromising food supplies or arable land. On this scenario, this paper aims to demonstrate the energetic potential to produce bio-oil and chemicals from microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis. The potential of these biomasses was evaluated in terms of physical-chemical characterization, thermogravimetric analysis, and analytical pyrolysis interfaced with gas chromatograph (Py-GC/MS). The results show that C. vulgaris and A. platensis are biomasses with a high heating value (24.60 and 22.43 MJ/kg) and low ash content, showing a high percentage of volatile matter (72.49 and 79.42%). These characteristics confirm their energetic potential for conversion process through pyrolysis, whereby some important aromatic compounds such as toluene, styrene, and phenol were identified as pyrolysis products, which could turn these microalgae a potential for biofuels and bioproduct production through the pyrolysis. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Robust evapotranspiration (ET) models are required to predict water usage in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems under different geographical and agrometeorological conditions. As a result, several remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models have been developed to estimate ET over large regions. However, comparison of the performance of several SEB models at the same site is limited. In addition, none of the SEB models have been evaluated for their ability to predict ET in rain-fed high biomass sorghum grown for biofuel production. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five widely used single-source SEB models, namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping ET with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), and operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for estimating ET over a high biomass sorghum field during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. The predicted ET values were compared against eddy covariance (EC) measured ET (ETEC) for 19 cloud-free Landsat image. In general, S-SEBI, SEBAL, and SEBS performed reasonably well for the study period, while METRIC and SSEBop performed poorly. All SEB models substantially overestimated ET under extremely dry conditions as they underestimated sensible heat (H) and overestimated latent heat (LE) fluxes under dry conditions during the partitioning of available energy. METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS overestimated LE regardless of wet or dry periods. Consequently, predicted seasonal cumulative ET by METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS were higher than seasonal cumulative ETEC in both seasons. In contrast, S-SEBI and SSEBop substantially underestimated ET under too wet conditions, and predicted seasonal cumulative ET by S-SEBI and SSEBop were lower than seasonal cumulative ETEC in the relatively wetter 2013 growing season. Our results indicate the necessity of inclusion of soil moisture or plant water stress component in SEB models for the improvement of their performance, especially under too dry or wet environments. © 2017

AB  - The palm biodiesel industry has been promoted for climate change mitigation, energy security and sustainability strategies worldwide. International debates on land use change and unintended consequences from market-driven impacts of biofuel (i.e. biodiesel and bioethanol) production have highlighted the need for an assessment which considers multi-modelling approaches as well as up-to-date improvement technologies. This study assessed potential environmental life cycle consequences of palm-based biodiesel production in comparison with conventional diesel production. Impacts from modelling choices (consequential and attributional life cycle assessment), co-product utilisation during the palm oil milling and biodiesel conversion stages, recent improvement technologies for treating palm oil mill effluent and oil palm breeding, and direct and indirect land use change were assessed using fifteen scenarios. It was found that the different modelling choices as well as the inclusion of direct and indirect land use change highly affected environmental gains and losses compared with the conventional diesel system. The most important contributor to the environmental benefits was utilisation of co-products. When excluding the use phase (because its value did not vary across the different scenarios; except for climate change), the most important contributor in environmental impacts for terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication, was emissions from indirect land use change. Increased oil palm yields and improved palm oil mill effluent treatment technologies resulted in overall impact reduction; and should be promoted. Various co-product utilisation pathways have shown different impact reduction potentials. Co-products from palm oil mills should be fully utilised for electricity production, animal feed and oil substitution. Glycerol from biodiesel conversion was suggested to be used for animal nutrition. In conclusion, both modelling choices should be used for supporting policies in different contexts. Policy makers need to be aware of the differences in outcomes and risks of both modelling choices and later on select the specific approach which fits their specific decision context. Co-product utilisation should be optimised in order to increase the total impact reduction. Recommended co-product utilisation pathways, oil palm variety and wastewater treatment technologies can be used for further enhancing the sustainability of palm oil industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured over a 2-year period from several land use systems on adjacent sites under the same soil and climatic conditions to assess the influence of the transition from arable agricultural (barley) and fallow to perennial bioenergy crops short rotation coppice (SRC) willow (Salix spp.) and short rotation forest (SRF) Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). There were no significant differences between CH4 and N2O fluxes measured from the SRC, SRF and fallow, but the arable agricultural site showed an order of magnitude higher N2O emissions compared with the others. Fertiliser application to the arable crop was the major factor influencing N2O emissions, and both air and soil temperature showed no significant effects on fluxes between the different land use systems. Soil moisture was significantly different from the arable crop, showing a greater range than from SRF and SRC. Hence, these bioenergy crops might be viable options for water-stressed areas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The interrelationship between renewable energy support policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law is an important recent manifestation of the challenge to reconcile environmental and economic values in contemporary societies. This article strives to contribute to the discussion by using the intersection between policies to support renewable energy, in particular sustainable biofuels in the EU, and the WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures as a case study. The article discusses how efforts to promote renewable energy seem to have become contingent upon the core legal notion of ‘relevant markets’. The article further claims that this contingency is problematic: renewable energy markets are highly complex in practice, and combined with the WTO’s convoluted interpretations of ‘relevant markets’, the legal outcomes struggle to find the proper balance between appropriate support for sustainability and the prevention of protectionist market fragmentation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In the last decade, jatropha-based bioenergy projects have gotten significant attention as a solution to various social, economic, and environmental problems. Jatropha’s popularity stemmed out from different discourses, some real and some perceived, in scientific and non-scientific literature. These discourses positioned jatropha as a crop helpful in producing biodiesel and protecting sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels and increasing local, rural development by creating jobs. Consequently, many countries established national policies that incentivized the establishment of jatropha as a bioenergy feedstock crop. In this paper, we explore the case of jatropha bioenergy development in Yucatan, Mexico and argue that the popular discourse around jatropha as a sustainability and rural development tool is flawed. Analyzing our results from 70 semi-structured interviews with community members belonging to a region where plantation-scale jatropha projects were introduced, we found that these projects did not have many significant social sustainability benefits. We conclude from our case that by just adding bioenergy projects cannot help achieve social sustainability in rural areas alone. In ensuring social sustainability of bioenergy projects, future policymaking processes should have a more comprehensive understanding of the rural socioeconomic problems where such projects are promoted and use bioenergy projects as one of the many solutions to local problems rather than creating such policies based just on popular discourses. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - For the past decade, Thailand pursued a strategy of promoting biofuel crop production, including sugarcane, to meet the ever increasing energy demand and to increase the income of farmers. This study analyzed the influence of policy instruments implemented to promote the sugarcane cultivation, farm household socioeconomic levels, biophysical, and institutional factors driving the conversion of rice fields into sugarcane farms. Primary information was collected from 230 farm households through a structured questionnaire. Relevant policy documents published by the responsible government agencies were the main sources of secondary information collected for policy analysis. The analyses revealed that farmers in the study area converted 25–75% of their rice fields into sugarcane farms as a result of implementation of policy instruments that made sugarcane financially far more attractive than rice. The results of the regression analysis showed that eight variables were found significant and positively influenced the conversion of rice fields into sugarcane farms. These were access to extension services, information, sugarcane loading stations, and ground water for irrigation, and duration of experience in sugarcane farming as well as household head’s age and education. Irrespective of landholding size, the majority of farmers were not concerned about food security. In view of the finding, if feasible, in the form of additional price supports and commercial cane sugar index-based pricing strategies to promote sugarcane production should benefit all concerned farmers. Likewise, attention should be paid to deliver essential extension and marketing services in an effective way, particularly to those farmers who are not receiving such services. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Remnant habitat patches immersed within biofuel cropland matrices can retain considerable species diversity, although the effects of land use change on species persistence in historically modified landscapes remain unclear. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most fragmented South American biodiversity hotspots and retains about 12% of its original vegetation cover. Most of these remnants are distributed in small isolated fragments immersed mainly within pastures and sugarcane monocultures. Here we examine how species richness and composition of medium and large-sized mammals are explained by forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount at the landscape scale. We sampled 22 fragmented landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations along a wide gradient of forest cover (3% to 96%) in southeastern Brazil. We recorded 88% of terrestrial mammal species expected for this region, but many likely local extirpations were detected at the landscape scale, with losses between 50% to 80% of species. Most of the landscapes were highly depleted of forest-specialist species, with replacements by exotics and/or species typical of non-forest habitats. We found that total mammalian species richness, which includes forest-specialists, generalists, exotics and non-forest dwelling species, was not affected by landscape metrics, such as forest cover, structural area and forest edge amount. Nevertheless, forest cover was important predictor of the presence of three ungulates, a medium-sized rodent, and an armadillo. Local mammalian communities exhibited a high degree of species turnover between landscapes, representing 95% of the total β-diversity. In this region, where there was no regional extinction, landholder compliance with the Brazilian Forest Bill and restoration measures will enhance habitat connectivity and mammal persistence across the wider unprotected countryside. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - SWAT watershed model simulated biomass yield and pollutant loadings were integrated with associated economic costs of farm production and transport to study two dedicated energy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, and corn stover, as feedstocks for a cellulosic biorefinery. A multi-level spatial optimization (MLSOPT) framework was employed to get spatially explicit cropping plans for a watershed under the assumption that the watershed supplies biomass to a hypothetical biorefinery considering both the biochemical and the thermochemical conversion pathways. Consistent with previous studies, the perennial grasses had higher biomass yield than corn stover, with considerably lower sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loadings, but their costs were higher. New insights were related to the tradeoffs between cost, feedstock production, and the level and form of environmental quality society faces as it implements the Renewable Fuel Standard. Economically, this involved calculating the farthest distance a biorefinery would be willing to drive to source corn residue before procuring a single unit of perennial grasses from productive agricultural soils. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - High volumes of flowback and produced water are generated everyday as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing operations and shale gas developments across the United States. Since most shale gas developments are located in semi-arid to arid U.S. regions close to agricultural production, there are many opportunities for reusing these waters as potential alternatives or supplements to fresh water resources for irrigation activities. However, the impacts of high salinity and total organic content of these types of water on crop physiological parameters and plant growth needs to be investigated to determine their utility and feasibility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of switchgrass and rapeseed to treated produced water as an irrigation water source. In this greenhouse study, the influence of produced water at four total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations [1.22, 38.3, 232.2 and 1352.4 mg/l] and three total dissolved solids (TDS) levels [400,3,500, and 21,000 mg/l] on rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), two relatively salt-tolerant, non-food, biofuel crops, was studied. Seedling emergence, biomass yield, plant height, leaf electrolyte leakage, and plant uptake were evaluated. Irrigation water with the highest salinity and TOC concentration resulted in significantly lower growth health and physiological characteristics of both crop species. The organic content of the produced water had a negative impact on biomass yield and physiological parameters of both species. The results of this study could be valuable for regulators and stakeholders in development of treatment standards in which organic matter should be removed to less than 50 mg/l to keep leaf EL (cell damage) to less than 50% and a TOC concentration of less than 5 mg/l required to keep a sustainable biomass production rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scale-up of microalgal biotechnology to provide large quantities of biofuel, lipids, and coproducts is not fully developed because of the large needs for nutrients, water, land, solar insolation, and CO2/carbon supplies. Wastewaters, including oil and gas produced water (PW), may supply a portion of these needs in regions with insufficient fresh water resources. PW is a challenging water resource for this use because of variable salinity, geochemical complexity, and the presence of biologically toxic components. In this paper we review PW volumes, quality, and use in media for microalgae production in the southwestern US, Australia, and Oman. We also include data from the southwestern US, referencing previously unpublished results from the National Alliance for Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) consortium research project. We include a Supplementary Information section that explores cultivation of multiple microalgae species in PW and examines the carbon utilization process, all work performed in support of the NAABB field program. Strains of algae tested in the reviewed papers include Nannochloropsis, Dunalliella, Scenedesmus, and several mixed or unknown cultures. We conclude that the use of PW in algae cultivation is feasible, if the additional complexity of the water resource is accounted for in developing media formulations and in understanding metals uptake by the algae. We recommend additional work to standardize growth testing in PW, better and more thorough chemical analysis, and geochemical modeling of the PW used in media. Expanded strain testing in PW media will identify improved strains tolerant of PW in algae cultivation. © 2017

AB  - The plant cell wall is a source of fermentable sugars in second-generation bioethanol production. However, cellulosic biomass hydrolysis remains an obstacle to bioethanol production in an efficient and low-cost process. Clostridium thermocellum has been studied as a model organism able to produce enzymatic blends that efficiently degrade lignocellulosic biomass, and also as a fermentative microorganism in a consolidated process for the conversion of lignocellulose to bioethanol. In this study, a C. thermocellum strain (designated B8) isolated from goat rumen was characterized for its ability to grow on sugarcane straw and cotton waste, and to produce cellulosomes. We also evaluated C. thermocellum gene expression control in the presence of complex lignocellulosic biomasses. This isolate is capable of growing in the presence of microcrystalline cellulose, sugarcane straw and cotton waste as carbon sources, producing free enzymes and residual substrate-bound proteins (RSBP). The highest growth rate and cellulase/xylanase production were detected at pH 7.0 and 60 °C, after 48 h. Moreover, this strain showed different expression levels of transcripts encoding cellulosomal proteins and proteins with a role in fermentation and catabolic repression. © 2017, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The environmental sustainability of bioenergy cropping systems depends upon multiple factors such as crop selection, agricultural practices, and the management of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water resources. Perennial grasses, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), show potential as a sustainable bioenergy source due to high yields on marginal lands with low fertilizer inputs and an extensive root system that may increase sequestration of C and N in subsurface soil horizons. We quantified the C and N stocks in roots, free particulate, and mineral-associated soil organic matter pools in a 4-year-old switchgrass system following conversion from row crop agriculture at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in southwest Michigan. Crops were fertilized with nitrogen at either 0, 84, or 196 kg N ha−1 and harvested either once or twice annually. Twice-annual harvesting caused a reduction of C and N stocks in the relatively labile roots and free-particulate organic matter pools. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced total soil organic C and N stocks, particularly in the stable, mineral-associated C and N pools at depths greater than 15 cm. The largest total belowground C stocks in biomass and soil occurred in unfertilized plots with annual harvesting. These findings suggest that fertilization in switchgrass agriculture moderates the sequestration potential of the soil C pool. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Cell wall recalcitrance poses a major challenge on cellulosic biofuel production from feedstocks such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). As lignin is a known contributor of recalcitrance, transgenic switchgrass plants with altered lignin have been produced by downregulation of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT). Field trials of COMT-downregulated plants previously demonstrated improved ethanol conversion with no adverse agronomic effects. However, the rhizosphere impacts of altering lignin in plants are unknown. We hypothesized that changing plant lignin composition may affect residue degradation in soils, ultimately altering soil processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of two independent lines of COMT-downregulated switchgrass plants on soils in terms of chemistry, microbiology, and carbon cycling when grown in the field. Over the first two years of establishment, we observed no significant differences between transgenic and control plants in terms of soil pH or the total concentrations of 19 elements. An analysis of soil bacterial communities via high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed no effects of transgenic plants on bacterial diversity, richness, or community composition. We also did not observe a change in the capacity for soil carbon storage: There was no significant effect on soil respiration or soil organic matter. After five years of establishment, δ13C of plant roots, leaves, and soils was measured and an isotopic mixing model used to estimate that 11.2 to 14.5% of soil carbon originated from switchgrass. Switchgrass-contributed carbon was not significantly different between transgenic and control plants. Overall, our results indicate that over the short term (two and five years), lignin modification in switchgrass through manipulation of COMT expression does not have an adverse effect on soils in terms of total elemental composition, bacterial community structure and diversity, and capacity for carbon storage. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We assess the impact of a potential TTIP bilateral free trade agreement on the EU and US bio-economies (feedstock, biofuels, by-products, and related competing crops) and major trade partners in these markets. The analysis develops a multi-market model that incorporates bilateral trade flows (US to EU, EU to US, and similarly with third countries) and is calibrated to the OECD-FAO baseline for 2013–2022 to account for recent policy decisions. The major policy reforms from a TTIP involve tariff and TRQ liberalisation and their direct contractionary impact on US sugar supply, EU biofuel production, and indirect negative effect on US high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) production. EU sugar and isoglucose production expand along with US ethanol and biodiesel and oilseed crushing. EU sugar would flow to the US, US biofuels and vegetable oil to the EU. We further quantify non-tariff measures (NTM) affecting these trade flows between the EU and the US. EU oilseed production contracts, and EU crushing expands with improving crushing margins following reduced NTM frictions. Our analysis reveals limited net welfare gains with most net benefits reaped by Brazil and not the two trading partners of the TTIP. © 2016 The Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - Methyl Chloride (CH3Cl) is a chlorine-containing trace gas in the atmosphere contributing significantly to stratospheric ozone depletion (Carpenter et al. 2014). In the global CH3Cl budget, the atmospheric CH3Cl emissions is predominantly maintained by natural sources, of which magnitudes have been relatively well-constrained. However, significant uncertainties still remain in the CH3Cl emission strengths from anthropogenic sources. High-frequency and high-precision in situ measurements of atmospheric CH3Cl concentrations obtained since 2008 at Gosan station (a remote background site in the East Asia) reveal significant pollution events superimposed on the seasonally varying regional background levels. Back trajectory statistics showed that air masses corresponding to the observed CH3Cl enhancement largely originated from regions of intensive industrial activities in China. Based on an inter-species correlation method, estimates of CH3Cl emissions from manufacturing industries including coal combustion, use of feedstocks, or process agents in chemical production for China (2008–2012) are 297 ± 71 Gg yr.−1 in 2008 to 480 ± 99 Gg yr.−1 in 2009, followed by a gradual decrease of about 25% between 2009 and 2012 (398 ± 92 Gg yr.−1 for 2010; 286 ± 68 Gg yr.−1 for 2011; 358 ± 92 Gg yr.−1 for 2012). The annual average of industrial CH3Cl emissions for 2008–2012 (363 ± 85 Gg yr.−1) in China is comparable to the known total global anthropogenic CH3Cl emissions accounting only for coal combustion and indoor biofuel use. This may suggest that unless emissions from the chemical industry are accounted for, global anthropogenic emissions of CH3Cl have been substantially underestimated. In particular, since industrial production and use of CH3Cl have not been regulated under the Montreal Protocol (MP) or its successor amendments, continuous monitoring of Chinese CH3Cl outflow is important to properly evaluate its anthropogenic emissions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In this study, an alga-based simultaneous process of treating swine wastewater (SWW) and producing biodiesel was explored. Chlorella vulgaris (UTEX-265) was employed as a model species, and a SWW-based medium was prepared by dilution with tap water. Chlorella vulgaris grew well in the SWW-based medium, and at optimum dilution ratios, it exceeded the conventional culture medium in terms of biomass concentration and productivity. In eightfold diluted SWW, which supported the maximum growth, biomass productivity was 0.247 g L−1 day−1, while the productivity was merely 0.165 g L−1 day−1 in standard tris-acetate-phosphorous (TAP) algal medium. In addition, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) productivity was greater in the SWW-based medium (0.067 versus 0.058 g L−1 day−1). This enhanced productivity resulted in more than 95 % removal of both nitrogen and phosphorous. All these show that C. vulgaris cultivation is indeed possible in a nutrient-rich wastewater with appropriate dilution, and in so doing, the wastewater can effectively be treated. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Land use change models based on historical behavior have proven useful in predicting and understanding determinants of change. Such approaches are not possible where land use change data are absent. In this paper, we develop a normative spatial model that considers option values associated with land conversion between agriculture and forestry and their differing time scales. The model is applied in a case study regarding the potential for a cellulosic biofuel industry in Alberta. Results indicate the importance of future patterns of prices in influencing decisions to switch from agriculture to bioenergy production, and suggest that cellulosic plantations are not likely to prevail over agricultural land uses. Les modèles de changement d'affectation des terres basés sur les comportements historiques se sont avérés utiles pour la prédiction et la compréhension des facteurs de changements. Ces approches sont impossibles là où les données concernant les changements d'affectation des terres sont absentes. Cet article présente un modèle normatif spatial qui tient compte des valeurs d'option associées à la conversion des terres agricoles en terres forestières et à leurs différentes échelles de temps. L'application du modèle se fait dans une étude de cas au sujet du potentiel pour une industrie du biocarburant cellulosique en Alberta. Les résultats montrent l'importance de l'influence des futures structures de prix sur le choix de passer de l'agriculture à la production de bioénergie, et suggèrent que les plantations cellulosiques ne l'emporteront pas sur les affectations agricoles des terres. © 2016 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - Energy sorghum tolerates adverse climatic and edaphic conditions and has great potential as biofuel feedstock in marginal land. This study investigates the potential energy sorghum biomass production and uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on a sandy loam marginal land in a semi-arid region, in order to define optimum N fertilizer rate to produce the highest biomass yield with minimal nutrient elimination. Five N rate treatments (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg ha−1) and two sorghum varieties (sweet type Guotian-8 (GT-8) and biomass type Guoneng-11 (GN-11)) were used. Yield increment was observed as N level increased, but the standout treatment appeared to be N rate of 60 kg ha−1 which significantly increased biomass yield vs. controls by 68.8% in 2014 and 64.1% in 2015. Biomass yield exhibited non-significant differences between N rate treatments from 60 to 240 kg ha−1, although the highest biomass yield (9.2–11.9 t ha−1) was observed in the 120 kg N ha−1 treatment. Nutrient analysis showed that N, P, and K accumulation in aboveground plants increased with N rate increase, ranging between 32.2 and 119.1, 7.9 and 19.2, and 22.1 and 94.0 kg ha−1, respectively, for the highest N rate of 240 kg ha−1. Substantial amounts of N were extracted from the soil in control and 60 kg N ha−1 treatments, despite the low fertility and organic matter content of the soil. Moreover, nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) was maximized at lower N rates. A decline in physiological N use efficiency (PNUE) resulted in decreased agronomic N use efficiency (ANUE) at higher N rates. Hence, it is concluded that N fertilizer rate between 60 and 120 kg ha−1 would be the optimal N requirement to facilitate sustainable production of energy sorghum on a sandy wasteland. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The leaves of Agave tequilana Weber variety Blue represent a viable, inexpensive, and renewable source of lignocellulosic biomass and fructans for the production of second generation biofuels. The objective was to study the effect of drying temperature on the release of reducing sugars for the agave leaves. It was found that with pretreatment-drying at 100°C for 30.5 ± 1.0 min had a maximum of the release of reducing sugars with a 66% increment compared to 60°C. An aqueous extract obtained from the powder of the leaves after drying did not show the presence of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural compounds. Phenolic compounds were detected in order of 120.8 ± 1.0 mg L−1 below 1 g L−1 reported to cause inhibition of the alcoholic fermentation. In addition the drying of the leaves also can be used as preservation of agave leaf for biomass storing. The results show that pretreatment-drying allow increase the release of reducing sugars, avoids thermal degradation and does not produce significant concentrations of fermentation inhibitors. Practical Applications: The research in industrial waste materials has received special attention worldwide because it is potential for production of biofuels. This study propose a simple method of drying that acts as a thermal pretreatment of Agave tequilana Weber variety Blue leaves that increases the release of reducing sugars, avoids thermal degradation, not produce significant concentrations of fermentation inhibitors for ethanol production and can be used as a preservation method for storing biomass of the agave leaves. The results would be useful not only in the energy field but also in the alimentary and pharmaceutical industry. Fructans and phenolic compounds found in the agave are used as functional ingredients in the food industry and also bioactive compounds that by themselves promotes future research for the Agave tequilana. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This work presented a Spatially-Explicit-High-Resolution Life Cycle Assessment (SEHR-LCA) model for wastewater-based algal biofuel production, by integrating life cycle assessment, GIS analysis, and site-specific Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) data analysis. Wastewater resources, land availability, and meteorological variation were analyzed for algae cultivation. Three pathways, Microwave Pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, and lipid extraction were modeled for bio-oil conversion. This model enables the assessment of seasonal and site-specific variations in productivity and environmental impacts of wastewater-based algal bio-oil across the whole U.S. Model results indicate that wastewater-based algal bio-oil can provide an opportunity to increase national biofuel output. The potential production of algal bio-oil can reach to 0.98 billion gallon/yr, nearly 20% of advanced biofuel projection as outlined in the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007. LCA results shows significant variations among different locations, WWTPs, and operational seasons. Although not competitive to conventional fossil fuel in energy efficiency, wastewater-based algal biofuel could offer significant benefit in controlling GHG emissions. However, spatial analysis shows that only 61% of the total wastewater could be used, based on current land use efficiency for algae cultivation and land availability around each WWTP in a radius where algal biofuel production is energy positive (energy output > energy input). These results indicate that land availability could be a significant challenge for wastewater-based algal biofuels that have not been considered in previous studies. They also suggest that improvement should be made in technological development and system design to increase energy and land use efficiency for full potential of wastewater as a promising resource for algal biofuel production. Although focusing on the U.S. as the case study, the developed methodology could be used for spatially explicit analysis of algal biofuel integrated with wastewater on macro-scale in other regions as well. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Aims: To (1) identify the trade-offs among flammability attributes within grass and litter fuel types; (2) determine how flammability attributes of grass and litter fuels vary across macro-ecological gradients; and (3) test our hypothesis that inherent flammability attributes of grass and litter fuels scale to satellite-derived proxies for fire frequency and intensity. Location: Continent of Australia. Methods: Samples of litter and grass fuels collected from 133 sites across Australia were oven dried, then burnt under controlled conditions. Measurements of ignitability, combustibility and sustainability were made. Estimates of fire frequency and fire radiative power (a proxy for intensity) were derived from satellite imagery. Multivariate analyses were used to identify inter-relationships among variables and trends across macro-ecological gradients. Results: Flammability was best described by two axes: high rate of combustion versus long duration of burning, and fast rate of spread versus high maximum temperature. As expected, our study confirmed that grass and litter fuel types have inherently differently flammability attributes whereby grass samples burn more quickly, with a higher rate of spread, than litter samples. However, there were also smaller differences in flammability attributes within fuel types, which scaled to rainfall, temperature and soil phosphorus concentrations. In keeping with our hypothesis, we found correlations between inherent fuel flammability attributes and landscape fire activity across the Australian continent. Fire frequency and rate of combustion of grass fuels were both highest in the tropics, and fire intensity and maximum temperature during combustion of litter fuels were highest in temperate areas. Main conclusions: At a continental scale, we found landscape fire activity was correlated with inherent flammability of grass and litter fuels. This inherent flammability contributes to observed pyrogeographical patterns that are shaped by climate through its known effects on plant productivity, the abundance of cured grass biomass and fire weather. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Biofuels have transitioned from a technology expected to deliver numerous benefits to a highly contested socio-technical solution. Initial hopes about their potential to mitigate climate change and to deliver energy security benefits and rural development, particularly in the Global South, have unravelled in the face of numerous controversies. In recognition of the negative externalities associated with biofuels, the European Union developed sustainability criteria which are enforced by certification schemes. This paper draws on the literature on stewardship to analyse the outcomes of these schemes in two countries: the UK and Guatemala. It explores two key issues: first, how has European Union biofuels policy shaped biofuel industries in the UK and Guatemala? And second, what are the implications for sustainable land stewardship? By drawing attention to the outcomes of European demand for biofuels, we raise questions about the ability of European policy to drive sustainable land practices in these two cases. The paper concludes that, rather than promoting stewardship, the current governance framework effectively rubberstamps existing agricultural systems and serves to further embed existing inequalities. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The effect of regional factors on life cycle assessment (LCA) of camelina seed production and camelina methyl ester production was assessed in this study. While general conclusions from LCA studies point to lower environmental impacts of biofuels, it has been shown in many studies that the environmental impacts are dependent on location, production practices, and even local weather variations. Methods: A cradle-to-farm gate and well-to-pump approaches were used to conduct the LCA. To demonstrate the impact of agro-climatic and management factors (weather condition, soil characteristics, and management practices) on the overall emissions for four different regions including Corvallis, OR, Pendleton, OR, Pullman, WA, and Sheridan, WY, field emissions were simulated using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. openLCA v.1.4.2 software was used to quantify the environmental impacts of camelina seed and camelina methyl ester production. Results and discussion: The results showed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during camelina production in different regions vary between 49.39 and 472.51 kg CO2-eq./ha due to differences in agro-climatic and weather variations. The GHG emissions for 1 kg of camelina produced in Corvallis, Pendleton, Pullman, and Sheridan were 0.76 ± 11, 0.55 ± 10, 0.47 ± 18, and 1.26 ± 6 % kg CO2-eq., respectively. The GHG emissions for 1000 MJ of camelina biodiesel using camelina produced in Corvallis, Pendleton, Pullman, and Sheridan were 53.60 ± 5, 48.87 ± 5, 44.33 ± 7, and 78.88 ± 4 % kg CO2-eq., respectively. Other impact categories such as acidification and ecotoxicity for 1000 MJ of camelina biodiesel varied across the regions by 43 and 103 %, respectively. Conclusions: It can be concluded that process-based crop models such as DNDC in conjunction with Monte Carlo analysis are helpful tools to quantitatively estimate the influence of regional factors on field emissions which consequently can provide information about the expected variability in LCA results. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Utility of perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., switchgrass and miscanthus) offers unique opportunities to transition toward a more sustainable energy pathway due to their reduced carbon footprint, averted competition with food crops, and ability to grow on abandoned and degraded farmlands. Studies that have examined biogeophysical impacts of these crops noted a positive feedback between near-surface cooling and enhanced evapotranspiration (ET), but also potential unintended consequences of soil moisture and groundwater depletion. To better understand hydrometeorological effects of perennial bioenergy crop expansion, this study conducted high-resolution (2-km grid spacing) simulations with a state-of-the-art atmospheric model (Weather Research and Forecasting system) dynamically coupled to a land surface model. We applied the modeling system over the Southern Plains of the United States during a normal precipitation year (2007) and a drought year (2011). By focusing the deployment of bioenergy cropping systems on marginal and abandoned farmland areas (to reduce the potential conflict with food systems), the research presented here is the first realistic examination of hydrometeorological impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion. Our results illustrate that the deployment of perennial bioenergy crops leads to widespread cooling (1–2 °C) that is largely driven by an enhanced reflection of shortwave radiation and, secondarily, due to an enhanced ET. Bioenergy crop deployment was shown to reduce the impacts of drought through simultaneous moistening and cooling of the near-surface environment. However, simulated impacts on near-surface cooling and ET were reduced during the drought relative to a normal precipitation year, revealing differential effects based on background environmental conditions. This study serves as a key step toward the assessment of hydroclimatic sustainability associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion under diverse hydrometeorological conditions by highlighting the driving mechanisms and processes associated with this energy pathway. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Climate-change impacts can be mitigated through greater use of bioenergy, but the extent to which specific options actually reduce overall impacts needs to be assessed. Most bioenergy assessments have used proxy measures for assessing its merits. Here, a new approach is presented, whereby the contribution of bioenergy use is assessed through quantifying marginal changes in climate-change impacts that result from the implementation of a bioenergy option. Methods: Marginal climate-change impacts were calculated for one specific example of a bioenergy option, conversion of an unutilised mature forest into a production forest harvested repeatedly for bioenergy over successive 25-year rotations. The overall benefit of the option was assessed by including stand-level carbon dynamics, global carbon-cycle feedback, progressively changing radiative efficiency and marginal impact sensitivity of warming. It also includes a differentiated assessment of three kinds of climatic impacts: direct-warming, rate-of-warming and cumulative-warming impacts. Marginal impacts were calculated and summed over 100 years to assess the overall marginal impact of this bioenergy option. Results and discussion: Bioenergy use in this specific example led to a large initial loss of biomass carbon followed by an ongoing and accumulating benefit through fossil-fuel substitution. This caused adverse climatic impacts over the first two rotations as the effects of the on-site carbon loss dominated the overall impact, but the option became increasingly beneficial over longer time frames as the benefit of fossil-fuel substitution accrued and eventually dominated. Summed over 100 years, the bioenergy option reduced direct-temperature and rate-of-warming impacts whilst increasing cumulative-warming impacts. The average of the three kinds of impacts showed a slight mitigation benefit by reducing overall impacts. In the particular example, bioenergy use was assessed to have a more beneficial effect if the analysis was carried out under the assumption of higher-emission concentrations pathways, or if it assumed a steeper relationship between climate perturbations and impacts. Conclusions: The usefulness of any climate-change mitigation option ultimately relates to the marginal climate-change impacts it can avert. It is shown here that marginal impacts can be calculated in routine operation and that they can provide an objective and methodologically consistent assessment of the mitigation potential of bioenergy use. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we model the supply and demand for agricultural goods and assess and compare how welfare, land use, and biodiversity are affected under intensive and extensive farming systems at market equilibrium instead of at exogenous production levels. As long as demand is responsive to price, and intensive farming has lower production costs, there exists a rebound effect (larger market size) of intensive farming. Intensive farming is then less beneficial to biodiversity than extensive farming is, except when there is a high degree of convexity between biodiversity and yield. On the other hand, extensive farming leads to higher prices and smaller quantities for consumers. Depending on parameter values, it may increase or decrease agricultural producer profits. Implementing “active” land sparing by zoning some land for agriculture and other land for conservation could overcome the rebound effect of intensive farming, but we show that farmers have then incentives to encroach on land zoned for conservation, with higher incentives under intensive farming. We also show that the primary effect of the higher prices associated with extensive farming is a reduction of animal feed production, which has a higher price elasticity of demand, whereas less of an effect is observed on plant-based food production and almost no effect is observed on biofuel production if there are mandatory blending policies. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Despite promises that they can contribute toward more environmentally beneficial transportation there are many sustainability concerns about liquid transport biofuels. In response to pressure from civil society, the European Union (EU) has introduced sustainability criteria for biofuels. A hybrid regulatory system involving state and non-state actors stipulates that retailers and producers must comply to be eligible for fiscal support such as tax exemptions. Flexibility in the system allows choice between different means of compliance, including a range of voluntary schemes. We present an analysis of views within the Swedish liquid transport biofuel sector in 2012 – a year after the introduction of EU sustainability criteria. Using document analysis, official statistics, and a survey, we use four key structures of global value chains — input–output structure, territorial configuration, institutional framework, and firm-level chain governance structure — to structure an analysis of biofuel value chain coordination. This yields three main findings regarding how the Swedish liquid transport biofuel system operates within, and views, the new regulatory framework. Firstly that it uses a broad portfolio of feedstock mainly from within Europe, seemingly avoiding countries where any supply conditions may be in doubt; second, larger retailers and producers achieve compliance without the need to provide additional social sustainability information; third, that actors exhibit predominantly Eurocentric perspectives on sustainability, express confidence that their supply chains have strong 'sustainability performance’ and desire long-term policy stability. We conclude that despite a deep critique of the sustainability of biofuels amongst civil society and academia, EU regulation allows for production systems that reflect a European- and climate change mitigation-centred view on biofuel 'sustainability’. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - Background: Arundo donax has attracted renewed interest as a potential candidate energy crop for use in biomass-to-liquid fuel conversion processes and biorefineries. This is due to its high productivity, adaptability to marginal land conditions, and suitability for biofuel and biomaterial production. Despite its importance, the genomic resources currently available for supporting the improvement of this species are still limited. Results: We used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to de novo assemble and characterize the A. donax leaf transcriptome. The sequencing generated 1249 million clean reads that were assembled using single-k-mer and multi-k-mer approaches into 62,596 unique sequences (unitranscripts) with an N50 of 1134 bp. TransDecoder and Trinotate software suites were used to obtain putative coding sequences and annotate them by mapping to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniRef90 databases, searching for known transcripts, proteins, protein domains, and signal peptides. Furthermore, the unitranscripts were annotated by mapping them to the NCBI non-redundant, GO and KEGG pathway databases using Blast2GO. The transcriptome was also characterized by BLAST searches to investigate homologous transcripts of key genes involved in important metabolic pathways, such as lignin, cellulose, purine, and thiamine biosynthesis and carbon fixation. Moreover, a set of homologous transcripts of key genes involved in stomatal development and of genes coding for stress-associated proteins (SAPs) were identified. Additionally, 8364 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were identified and surveyed. SSRs appeared more abundant in non-coding regions (63.18%) than in coding regions (36.82%). This SSR dataset represents the first marker catalogue of A. donax. 53 SSRs (PolySSRs) were then predicted to be polymorphic between ecotype-specific assemblies, suggesting genetic variability in the studied ecotypes. Conclusions: This study provides the first publicly available leaf transcriptome for the A. donax bioenergy crop. The functional annotation and characterization of the transcriptome will be highly useful for providing insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying its extreme adaptability. The identification of homologous transcripts involved in key metabolic pathways offers a platform for directing future efforts in genetic improvement of this species. Finally, the identified SSRs will facilitate the harnessing of untapped genetic diversity. This transcriptome should be of value to ongoing functional genomics and genetic studies in this crop of paramount economic importance. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Acetogens are promising cell factories for producing fuels and chemicals from waste feedstocks via gas fermentation, but quantitative characterization of carbon, energy, and redox metabolism is required to guide their rational metabolic engineering. Here, we explore acetogen gas fermentation using physiological, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data for Clostridium autoethanogenum steady-state chemostat cultures grown on syngas at various gas-liquid mass transfer rates. We observe that C. autoethanogenum shifts from acetate to ethanol production to maintain ATP homeostasis at higher biomass concentrations but reaches a limit at a molar acetate/ethanol ratio of ∼1. This regulatory mechanism eventually leads to depletion of the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and collapse of metabolism. We accurately predict growth phenotypes using a genome-scale metabolic model. Modeling revealed that the methylene-THF reductase reaction was ferredoxin reducing. This work provides a reference dataset to advance the understanding and engineering of arguably the first carbon fixation pathway on Earth. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The cointegration and causal relation among CO2 emissions, economic growth, militarization, and biofuel consumption were tested from 1984 to 2015 period for Unite States (US). The Autoregressive Distributed lag and three supplementary long-run estimators: the Dynamic OLS, Canonical Cointegration Regression and Fully Modified OLS were employed to reveal the long run impacts of economic growth, militarization and biofuel consumption on CO2 emissions. Toda and Yamamoto's MWALD and Rao F tests were applied to find out the direction of causality. The evidence of bi-directional causality between biofuel consumption and economic growth, between economic growth, between militarization and biofuel consumption, and CO2 emissions and between biofuel consumption and CO2 emissions was determined. The results of forecast-error variance determined 50.1% of the forecast-error variance of CO2 emissions is explained by the forecast-error variance of militarization and 59.4% by energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of dried sewage sludge is regarded as an effective treatment method as well as a promising technology for energy/fuel production. In this work, thermochemical conversion of dried sewage sludge in a continuous reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures (400-800 °C) and solid residence times (6-46 min) was conducted. The pyrolysis products obtained using different pyrolysis conditions were extensively investigated. It is indicated that high pyrolysis temperature (&gt;700 °C) and long solid residence time (&gt;23 min) could enhance secondary reactions and decrease the yield of bio-oil. The maximum yield of bio-oil of 16.69% was achieved at reaction temperature of 700 °C and solid residence time of 23 min. The FTIR and GC-MS analyses of the bio-oil obtained at optimum condition indicated that it contained large amounts of phenols and esters. H2 and CO2 were the main components of pyrolysis gas, with a total amount that exceeded 52.18%. The characteristics of the char, including elemental composition, functional groups, and combustion property were investigated by XRF, FTIR, and TG. FTIR analysis of the char showed that the main functional groups are M-X, C-O, and C-H. The volatile content in the char decreased with an increase of pyrolysis temperature, while it increased with an increase of solid residence time. Heavy metals distribution in pyrolysis products of dried sewage sludge were investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The results showed that most of the heavy metals remained in char. In addition, the potential ecological risk assessment of heavy metals was assessed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Hitherto, the main goal of metaproteomic analyses has been to characterize the functional role of particular microorganisms in the microbial ecology of various microbial communities. Recently, it has been suggested that metaproteomics could be used for bioprospecting microbial communities to query for the most active enzymes to improve the selection process of industrially relevant enzymes. In the present study, to reduce the complexity of metaproteomic samples for targeted bioprospecting of novel enzymes, a microbial community capable of producing cellulases was maintained on a chemically defined medium in an enzyme suppressed metabolic steady state. From this state, it was possible to specifically and distinctively induce the desired cellulolytic activity. The extracellular fraction of the protein complement of the induced sample could thereby be purified and compared to a non-induced sample of the same community by differential gel electrophoresis to discriminate between constitutively expressed proteins and proteins upregulated in response to the inducing substance. Results: Using the applied approach, downstream analysis by mass spectrometry could be limited to only proteins recognized as upregulated in the cellulase-induced sample. Of 39 selected proteins, the majority were found to be linked to the need to degrade, take up, and metabolize cellulose. In addition, 28 (72%) of the proteins were non-cytosolic and 17 (44%) were annotated as carbohydrate-active enzymes. The results demonstrated both the applicability of the proposed approach for identifying extracellular proteins and guiding the selection of proteins toward those specifically upregulated and targeted by the enzyme inducing substance. Further, because identification of interesting proteins was based on the regulation of enzyme expression in response to a need to hydrolyze and utilize a specific substance, other unexpected enzyme activities were able to be identified. Conclusions: The described approach created the conditions necessary to be able to select relevant extracellular enzymes that were extracted from the enzyme-induced microbial community. However, for the purpose of bioprospecting for enzymes to clone, produce, and characterize for practical applications, it was concluded that identification against public databases was not sufficient to identify the correct gene or protein sequence for cloning of the identified novel enzymes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic wastes is a promising alternative to landfilling for reducing Greenhouse Gas Emission (GHG) and it is encouraged by current regulation in Europe. Biogas-AD produced, represents a useful source of green energy, while its by-product (digestate) is a waste, that needs to be safely disposal. The sustainability of anaerobic digestion plants partly depends on the management of their digestion residues. This study has been focused on the environmental and economic benefits of co-digest recalcitrant agricultural wastes such olive wastes and citrus pulp, in combination with livestock wastes, straw and cheese whey for biogas production. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of two different bioenergy by-products on soil carbon stock, enzymes involved in nutrient cycling and microbial content. The two digestates were obtained from two plants differently fed: the first plant (Uliva) was powered with 60% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes, and 40% of livestock manure milk serum and maize silage. The second one (Fattoria) was fed with 40% of recalcitrant agricultural wastes and 60% of livestock manure, milk serum and maize silage. Each digestate, separated in liquid and solid fractions, was added to the soil at different concentrations. Our results evidenced that mixing and type of input feedstock affected the composition of digestates. Three months after treatments, our results showed that changes in soil chemical and biochemical characteristics depended on the source of digestate, the type of fraction and the concentration used. The mainly affected soil parameters were: Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Microbial Biomass Carbon (MBC), Fluorescein Diacetate Hydrolysis (FDA), Water Soluble Phenol (WSP) and Catalase (CAT) that can be used to assess the digestate agronomical feasibility. These results show that the agronomic quality of a digestate is strictly dependent on percentage and type of feedstocks that will be used to power the digester. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Microalgae have shown clear advantages for the production of biofuels compared with energy crops. Apart from their high growth rates and substantial lipid/triacylglycerol yields, microalgae can grow in wastewaters (animal, municipal and mining wastewaters) efficiently removing their primary nutrients (C, N, and P), heavy metals and micropollutants, and they do not compete with crops for arable lands. However, fundamental barriers to the industrial application of microalgae for biofuel production still include high costs of removing the algae from the water and the water from the algae which can account for up to 30-40% of the total cost of biodiesel production. Algal biofilms are becoming increasingly popular as a strategy for the concentration of microalgae, making harvesting/dewatering easier and cheaper. Results: We have isolated and characterized a number of natural microalgal biofilms from freshwater, saline lakes and marine habitats. Structurally, these biofilms represent complex consortia of unicellular and multicellular, photosynthetic and heterotrophic inhabitants, such as cyanobacteria, microalgae, diatoms, bacteria, and fungi. Biofilm #52 was used as feedstock for bioenergy production. Dark fermentation of its biomass by Enterobacter cloacae DT-1 led to the production of 2.4 mol of H2/mol of reduced sugar. The levels and compositions of saturated, monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in Biofilm #52 were target-wise modified through the promotion of the growth of selected individual photosynthetic inhabitants. Photosynthetic components isolated from different biofilms were used for tailoring of novel biofilms designed for (i) treatment of specific types of wastewaters, such as reverse osmosis concentrate, (ii) compositions of total fatty acids with a new degree of unsaturation and (iii) bio-flocculation and concentration of commercial microalgal cells. Treatment of different types of wastewaters with biofilms showed a reduction in the concentrations of key nutrients, such as phosphates, ammonia, nitrates, selenium and heavy metals. Conclusions: This multidisciplinary study showed the new potential of natural biofilms, their individual photosynthetic inhabitants and assembled new algal/cyanobacterial biofilms as the next generation of bioenergy feedstocks which can grow using wastewaters as a cheap source of key nutrients. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as ‘end consumers’ of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studiesRotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Markets for biomass are emerging across Canada, however, considerable concern has been expressed regarding the ability of Canada’s arable land base to sustainably meet this emerging demand. Using Ontario as a case study, economic and environmental factors that must be considered when designing biomass production systems based on either crop residues from maize (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or on dedicated biomass crops such as Miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) or switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) are reviewed. The Ontario agricultural land base is characterized by a growing prevalence of maize and soybean rotations, a high percentage of total arable land under the Canada Land Inventory categorized as Class 1 and 2, and geographically dispersed Class 3-5 land. Economic and environmental risks and opportunities of biomass production are demonstrated to be a function of the source of biomass, land availability, land classification, and existing land use patterns. © 2017, Agricultural Institute of Canada.

AB  - The ecological restoration of heavy metal polluted sites is a hot topic in the fields of environmental science and ecology. King grass, which is an important energy crop for cellulosic biofuels and electric power plants, could also potentially be used as a remediation tool for heavy metal polluted soils. In this paper, the metal tolerance mechanisms, metal accumulation tendencies, and phytoremediation efficiencies of king grass were studied in detail. The shoot lengths and dry biomass values of plants grown in treatments of Ni, As, Zn, and Pb were significantly higher than or the same as those of plants grown in control treatments, while plants grown in Cr treatments had shoot lengths and dry biomass values that were significantly lower than those of control plants. King grass could produce from 25.55 to 28.51 t·hm-2 of fresh biomass and 8.23 to 9.12 t·hm-2 of dry biomass when grown in soils containing Ni, As, Zn, and Pb and low levels of Cr pollution. The content of MDA and the activities of POD in plant leaves increased with increasing concentrations of Cr(VI), Ni, As, and Pb in the soil, while the activities of CAT and SOD showed the opposite trend. The biomarker activities in plant leaves decreased with increasing Zn concentrations in soil. The concentrations of Cr, As, and Pb were the highest in the plant roots followed by the leaves and stems. The concentrations of Ni and Zn were the highest in plant roots followed by the stems and leaves. The analysis results for metal chemical forms showed that high proportions of the hydrochloric acid extraction fractions of Cr, Ni, Zn, and Pb could be found in plant leaves. The contents of Cr, As, and Pb in the leaf cells were the largest in vacuoles followed by cell walls and cell organs, whereas the contents of Ni and Zn in leaf cells were the largest in cell organs followed by vacuoles and cell walls. The bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor were both smaller than 1, and the metal extraction amounts were low; however, the metal tolerance of king grass was high and the biomass yields of plants grown in contaminated soils were also high. Therefore, king grass may be good candidate for phytostabilization of soil heavy metal pollution. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is an organic waste bioconversion process that produces biofuel and digestates. Digestates have potential to be applied as soil amendment to improve properties for crop production including phytonutrient content and pest load. Our objective was to assess the impact of solid anaerobic digestates on weed seed inactivation and soil quality upon soil biosolarization (a pest control technique that combines solar heating and amendment-induced microbial activity). Two solid digestates from thermophilic (TD) and mesophilic (MD) digesters were tested. The solarized TD-amended samples presented significantly higher mortality of Brassica nigra (71%, P = 0.032) than its equivalent incubated at room temperature. However, biosolarization with digestate amendment led to decreased weed seed mortality in certain treatments. The plant-available water, total C, and extractable P and K were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the incubated amended soils. The results confirm the potential of digestates as beneficial soil amendments. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impacts of digestate stability on biosolarization efficacy and soil properties. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Clostridium thermocellum is a Gram-positive anaerobe with the ability to hydrolyze and metabolize cellulose into biofuels such as ethanol, making it an attractive candidate for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). At present, metabolic engineering in C. thermocellum is hindered due to the incomplete description of its metabolic repertoire and regulation within a predictive metabolic model. Genome-scale metabolic (GSM) models augmented with kinetic models of metabolism have been shown to be effective at recapitulating perturbed metabolic phenotypes. Results: In this effort, we first update a second-generation genome-scale metabolic model (iCth446) for C. thermocellum by correcting cofactor dependencies, restoring elemental and charge balances, and updating GAM and NGAM values to improve phenotype predictions. The iCth446 model is next used as a scaffold to develop a core kinetic model (k-ctherm118) of the C. thermocellum central metabolism using the Ensemble Modeling (EM) paradigm. Model parameterization is carried out by simultaneously imposing fermentation yield data in lactate, malate, acetate, and hydrogen production pathways for 19 measured metabolites spanning a library of 19 distinct single and multiple gene knockout mutants along with 18 intracellular metabolite concentration data for a Δgldh mutant and ten experimentally measured Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters. Conclusions: The k-ctherm118 model captures significant metabolic changes caused by (1) nitrogen limitation leading to increased yields for lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids, and (2) ethanol stress causing an increase in intracellular sugar phosphate concentrations (∼1.5-fold) due to upregulation of cofactor pools. Robustness analysis of k-ctherm118 alludes to the presence of a secondary activity of ketol-acid reductoisomerase and possible regulation by valine and/or leucine pool levels. In addition, cross-validation and robustness analysis allude to missing elements in k-ctherm118 and suggest additional experiments to improve kinetic model prediction fidelity. Overall, the study quantitatively assesses the advantages of EM-based kinetic modeling towards improved prediction of C. thermocellum metabolism and develops a predictive kinetic model which can be used to design biofuel-overproducing strains. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Switchgrass is C4 perennial grass species that is being developed as a cellulosic bioenergy feedstock. It is wind-pollinated and considered to be an obligate outcrosser. Genetic engineering has been used to alter cell walls for more facile bioprocessing and biofuel yield. Gene flow from transgenic cultivars would likely be of regulatory concern. In this study we investigated pollen-mediated gene flow from transgenic to nontransgenic switchgrass in a 3-year field experiment performed in Oliver Springs, Tennessee, U.S.A. using a modified Nelder wheel design. The planted area (0.6 ha) contained sexually compatible pollen source and pollen receptor switchgrass plants. One hundred clonal switchgrass 'Alamo' plants transgenic for an orange-fluorescent protein (OFP) and hygromycin resistance were used as the pollen source; whole plants, including pollen, were orange-fluorescent. To assess pollen movement, pollen traps were placed at 10 m intervals from the pollen-source plot in the four cardinal directions extending to 20 m, 30 m, 30 m, and 100 m to the north, south, west, and east, respectively. To assess pollination rates, nontransgenic 'Alamo 2' switchgrass clones were planted in pairs adjacent to pollen traps. Results: In the eastward direction there was a 98% decrease in OFP pollen grains from 10 to 100 m from the pollen-source plot (Poisson regression, F1,8 = 288.38, P &lt; 0.0001). At the end of the second and third year, 1,820 F1 seeds were collected from pollen recipient-plots of which 962 (52.9%) germinated and analyzed for their transgenic status. Transgenic progeny production detected in each pollen-recipient plot decreased with increased distance from the edge of the transgenic plot (Poisson regression, F1,15 = 12.98, P &lt; 0.003). The frequency of transgenic progeny detected in the eastward plots (the direction of the prevailing wind) ranged from 79.2% at 10 m to 9.3% at 100 m. Conclusions: In these experiments we found transgenic pollen movement and hybridization rates to be inversely associated with distance. However, these data suggest pollen-mediated gene flow is likely to occur up to, at least, 100 m. This study gives baseline data useful to determine isolation distances and other management practices should transgenic switchgrass be grown commercially in relevant environments. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - To provide input to sewage sludge management strategies that address expected new regulations in terms of hygienisation and phosphorus recovery in Sweden, an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) was made. The LCA identified environmental hot spots for methods that may permit sludge or phosphorus from sludge to be applied on agricultural land. In particular, thermophilic digestion, pasteurisation, thermal hydrolysis, urea treatment and mono-incineration with phosphorus recovery were compared. In addition, a sludge management system involving drying of sludge before use in forestry was investigated. The results showed that some major impacts are related to large uncertainties, such as those related to emissions from sludge storage. It also showed that large gains can be achieved when products from the systems replace other products, in particular when biogas is used to replace natural gas in vehicles, but also when sludge is used in agriculture and forestry. In general, there are small differences between the sludge management methods. Retaining the sludge matrix to allow for its utilisation in agriculture may conflict with keeping emissions to air and water from the sludge matrix low. It is recommended that any sludge management option minimises emissions from sludge to air and water and that resources are recovered and used, in line with the principles of a circular economy. © IWA Publishing 2017.

AB  - In addition to playing a role in offering safe sanitation in decentralized settings, shelter for biodiversity, and cleansing of polluted sites, constructed wetlands also produce biomass that can be harvested and utilized for the production of fodder and fuel. Biomass for human consumption comes in food form for direct use, as fodder for livestock, and as semi-woody biomass for fueling purposes, for either heating and cooking or for the production of biogas and/or biofuel. Against the backdrop of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus, the United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources was mandated to pay critical attention to the interconnections of the underlying resources, namely, water, soil, and waste.

AB  - Biofuels are an important tool for the reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions. NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase has been previously shown to be capable of the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into formate, which can be ultimately converted to methanol. We established that a functional enzyme, tagged for immobilization, could be continuously secreted by Pichia pastoris. The protein can be easily separated from the growth media and its activity remains constant over an extended period of time. This is an important first step in creating a self-sustaining system capable of producing biofuels with minimal resources and space required. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - With climate change endangering environmental sustainability, and food–biofuel competition still looming large, the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) requires balancing this trade-off. By highlighting the role of current-vintage agro-fuel technology in combating twin crisis, we calibrate a 23 regions-24 sectors Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to enumerate the impacts of: [i] 10% biotechnological invention in maize grains, rice and wheat; [ii] productivity growth in new agro-chemical inputs; [iii] impact of next generation biofuel technology (5% productivity shock). The results confirm that investing in factors for adoption of third-generation biofuels could be significant policy response for mitigating the adverse impacts. © 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling

AB  - The water footprint for fossil fuels typically accounts for water utilized in mining and fuel processing, whereas the water footprint of biofuels assesses the agricultural water used by crops through their lifetime. Fossil fuels have an additional water footprint that is not easily accounted for: ancient water that was used by plants millions of years ago, before they were transformed into fossil fuel. How much water is mankind using from the past to sustain current energy needs? We evaluate the link between ancient water virtually embodied in fossil fuels to current global energy demands by determining the water demand required to replace fossil fuels with biomass produced with water from the present. Using equal energy units of wood, bioethanol, and biodiesel to replace coal, natural gas, and crude oil, respectively, the resulting water demand is 7.39 × 1013 m3 y−1, approximately the same as the total annual evaporation from all land masses and transpiration from all terrestrial vegetation. Thus, there are strong hydrologic constraints to a reliance on biofuel energy produced with water from the present because the conversion from fossil fuels to biofuels would have a disproportionate and unsustainable impact on the modern water. By using fossil fuels to meet today's energy needs, we are virtually using water from a geological past. The water cycle is insufficient to sustain the production of the fuel presently consumed by human societies. Thus, non-fuel-based renewable energy sources are needed to decrease mankind's reliance on fossil fuel energy without placing an overwhelming pressure on global freshwater resources. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Soybean biodiesel (B100) has been playing an important role in Brazilian energy matrix towards the national bio-based economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers. Former studies have been mainly focused on the GHG emissions from the soybean cultivation, excluding other stages of the biodiesel production. Here, we present a holistic view of the total GHG emissions in four life cycle stages for soybean biodiesel. The aim of this study was to assess the GHG emissions of Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system with an integrated life cycle approach of four stages: agriculture, extraction, production and distribution. Allocation of mass and energy was applied and special attention was paid to the integrated and non-integrated industrial production chain. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG emissions, among four life cycle stages, is the agricultural stage (42-51%) for B100 produced in integrated systems and the production stage (46-52%) for B100 produced in non-integrated systems. Integration of industrial units resulted in significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. Without the consideration of LUC and assuming biogenic CO2 emissions is carbon neutral in our study, the calculated life cycle GHG emissions for domestic soybean biodiesel varied from 23.1 to 25.8 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100 and those for soybean biodiesel exported to EU ranged from 26.5 to 29.2 gCO2eq. MJ-1 B100, which represent reductions by 65% up to 72% (depending on the delivery route) of GHG emissions compared with the EU benchmark for diesel fuel. Our findings from a life cycle perspective contributed to identify the major GHG sources in Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system and they can be used to guide mitigation priority for policy and decisionmaking. Projected scenarios in this study would be taken as references for accounting the environmental sustainability of soybean biodiesel within a domestic and global level. © 2017 Cerri et al.

AB  - With increasing removal of maize (Zea mays L.) stover for cellulosic biofuels, livestock bedding, and feedstuffs, there exists a need to address natural resources-related issues such as soil erosion, nitrate leaching, and loss of organic matter content. Perennial groundcover (PGC) offers a potential solution for alleviating these problems associated with maize stover removal from conventional cropping systems. We conducted a field study to ascertain the costs of PGC establishment on the primary crop of economic interest and groundcover success under a maize or soybean (Glycine max L.) crop. To test this concept, we established either Kentucky bluegrass (KB) (Poa pratensis L.) or creeping red fescue (CF) (Festuca rubra L.) as living mulch (LM) concurrently with either maize or soybean, documenting impacts on crop maturity, stand density, leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), grain yield, grain quality, yield components, and stover C and N. First-year maize and first- and second-year soybean in the no LM control yielded on average 13.00, 3.38, and 4.86 Mg ha–1, respectively, 30, 84, and 27% greater than LM systems. However, yield did not significantly differ in the second site-year between the no LM and LM maize. Moreover, PGC treatments did not affect expected ethanol yield in the second year, averaging 5459 L ha–1 in Year 2 over all treatments. These results indicate that further research is needed to achieve both groundcover establishment and subsequent natural resources benefits in row crop production while minimizing impact on yield. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is an attractive dual use forage and/or biomass crop option for eroded soils where corn (Zea mays L.) grain production is often not profitable. Topsoil thickness, especially on soils with a claypan, relates directly to crop productivity and nutrient removal, but knowledge is lacking on how it impacts switchgrass grown for summer forage and advanced biofuels. Therefore, a study was conducted near Columbia, MO, to determine how topsoil thickness, or depth to claypan (DTC) affects the production and profitability of integrated (forage and biomass) and biomass only switchgrass. Switchgrass was planted in 2009 on a range of DTC classified as exposed (&lt;8 cm), shallow (8–15 cm), moderate (16–30 cm), or deep (&gt;30 cm), and was annually harvested twice (pre-anthesis and postdormancy) in the integrated system or once (postdor-mancy) in the biomass only system during 2011 to 2015. Results indicated that DTC mainly affected the second harvest of the integrated system; biomass yield increased 74% and nutrient removal by 50 to 102% from exposed to deep soil across years. Across DTC and years, the integrated system had more severe weed cover (46 vs. 6%), less yield (9.8 vs. 13.5 Mg ha–1), more N, P, and K removal (79 to 206%), and less profit (US$–155 vs. $137 ha–1 or $80 vs. $220 ha–1 without nutrient replacement costs) than the biomass only system. Therefore, improvements are needed before integrated systems are profitable, and biomass only systems may offer greater longevity, productivity, and profitability. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - We explore four fundamental channels of mandate compliance available under current U.S. biofuel policy: increased ethanol blending through E10 or E85, increased biodiesel blending, and a reduction in the overall compliance base. Simulation results highlight the interplay and varying importance of these channels at increasing blend mandate levels. In addition, we establish how RIN prices are formed: The value of a RIN in equilibrium is shown to reflect the marginal cost of compensating the blender for employing one additional ethanol-equivalent unit of biofuel. This contrasts with existing research equating the price of RINs to the gap between ethanol supply and demand evaluated at the mandate level. We demonstrate the importance of this distinction in case of binding demand side infrastructure constraints such as the ethanol blend wall: as percentage blend mandates increase, the market for low-ethanol blends may contract in order to reduce the overall compliance base. This has important implications for implied ethanol demand in the economy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapeseed is considered to be a promising sources for hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid (HEFA) jet fuel production as a means to address energy security and climate change mitigation. However, concerns have been raised about its impact on water, as large-scale biofuel production may place pressure on fresh water supplies and water quality. Water footprint (WF) analysis, when combined with water-focused life cycle assessment (LCA), can be an effective system analysis tool for water sustainability. This study developed a life cycle water footprint analysis informed by inputs from multiple models for rapeseed HEFA jet fuel production in North Dakota and evaluated the environmental impacts on water utilization and water quality due to large scale HEFA jet production. The biogeochemical-based EPIC model was incorporated to simulate crop growth that influences the hydrological cycle. Systematic LCA models were built in SimaPro to conduct life cycle blue WF analysis. Results using energy allocation indicate that rapeseed derived HEFA jet fuel has a WF of 131-143 m3 per GJ fuel over a rapeseed price range of $470-600, including all green, blue, and gray WF components. Discussions also indicate the importance of incorporating allocation within a life cycle approach when conducting biofuel WF analysis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Airport properties often include agricultural land cover that can attract wildlife species hazardous to aircraft, despite recommendations against row crops near air operations areas. However, few studies have directly quantified bird use of corn, wheat, and soybean fields relative to bird-aircraft collision (strike) hazard levels to support land cover recommendations. Therefore, we compared bird use among corn, wheat and soybean fields and predicted that corn and wheat would attract bird species recognized as hazardous to aviation. We also anticipated that soybeans would pose minimal attraction to such birds. Here, hazard ranking (low to extremely high) reflects the percentage of strikes involving a species that resulted in damage to aircraft. We investigated bird use among 22 corn, wheat, and soybean fields near Oak Harbor, OH, using approximately weekly point transects from 2013 to 2014. We used generalized distance sampling models and analysis of variance using distance matrices to determine bird abundance and community responses to row crop land coverages and crop height. We observed 4331 birds of 40 species, with most birds observed in wheat fields (n = 2555 birds) and standing stubble (n = 2409 birds). Large flocks occurred more in corn and wheat fields than soybean fields, but soybean fields harbored greater cumulative hazard scores than corn, likely due to consistent detections of small, non-flocking birds in soybean fields. Crop type and height had greater influence on medium- and high-hazard level bird species than other hazard levels. Density of medium- and high-hazard level birds increased with increasing crop height in soybean and wheat fields with wheat fields having slightly greater densities than soybeans. Corn fields also had the greatest bird densities in the tallest crop height categories. Categories of very and extremely high-hazard level bird species were rarely detected, but their abundance peaked in crops 0–15 cm, similar to low-hazard level bird species. However, model selection results included null models for very and extremely high-hazard level bird species suggesting minimal effects. Overall, our results suggest that all three crop types can harbor birds hazardous to aircraft, and crop height can enhance bird use. Although not directly tested in our study, land management surrounding airports may benefit most from alternative land covers (e.g., biofuel crops), but additional research is necessary. © 2017

AB  - The multi-attribute biomass and food production (BFP) problem facing farmers and co-operatives is further complicated by uncertainties in crop yield and prices. In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that maximizes the economic and environmental benefits of food and biofuel production. The uncertain parameters of yield amount and price level are calculated using real data. Economic aspects include revenue obtained from biomass and food crop sales as well as costs related to seeding, production, harvesting, and transportation operations at the farm level. Environmental effects include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon sequestration, soil erosion, and nitrogen leakage to water. The first-stage variables define binary decisions for allocating various land types to food and energy crops, while the second-stage variables are operational decisions related to harvesting, budget allocation, and amounts of different yield types. We present a decomposition algorithm, which is enhanced with specialized Benders cuts for solving this stochastic MIP problem. The computational efficiency of the proposed model and approach is demonstrated by applying it to a real case study involving switchgrass and corn production in the state of Kansas. We measure the solution quality and speed of the decomposition method over stochastic and deterministic models. Results indicate the significant benefit of using the stochastic yield-level information in an optimization model. The proposed stochastic MIP model provides important strategies and insights into decision making for biofuel and food production under uncertainty. © 2017

AB  - Algae have come into prominence over the last decade as a commercial biofuel feedstock due to their high production efficiencies compared to first and second feedstocks. However, algal investment is not economically feasible currently due to the operational and capital cost. There is still need for innovations for both high productivity and green productions. In order to decrease the cost of the algal processes, usage of some wastes as cultivation medium for algal productions and novel biofuel production methods should be considered according to green chemistry principals. In this study, seawater and wastewater supplied from Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) were used and combined at different ratios to be utilized as a growth medium for Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis suecica microalgae strain under the same growth conditions, and its effect on cell proliferation and growth kinetics were investigated. It was found that, both N. oculata and T. suecica can tolerate and utilize the wastewater and, the specific growth rate of the cultures can up to 0.5430 d−1 (75% of wastewater) for N. oculata and 0.4778 d−1 (25% of wastewater) for T. suecica. Different concentrations show different results for the growth of two species due to the effect of higher concentrations of the fundamental sources on growth stage and change of ionic composition of the culture medium. To evaluate bioethanol production performance of these two strains, samples which included maximum carbohydrate content as well as control groups were chosen for further studies. The results showed that T. suecica is much suitable for ethanol production using municipal wastewater as a culture medium. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High solids loadings (>18 wt%) in enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are desired for lignocellulosic biofuel production at a high titer and low cost. However, sugar conversion and ethanol yield decrease with increasing solids loading. The factor(s) limiting sugar conversion at high solids loading is not clearly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of solids loading on simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of AFEX™ (ammonia fiber expansion) pretreated corn stover for ethanol production using a xylose fermenting strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424A(LNH-ST). Decreased sugar conversion and ethanol yield with increasing solids loading were also observed. End-product (ethanol) was proven to be the major cause of this issue and increased degradation products with increasing solids loading was also a cause. For the first time, we show that with in situ removal of end-product by performing SSCF aerobically, sugar conversion stopped decreasing with increasing solids loading and monomeric sugar conversion reached as high as 93% at a high solids loading of 24.9 wt%. Techno-economic analysis was employed to explore the economic possibilities of cellulosic ethanol production at high solids loadings. The results suggest that low-cost in situ removal of ethanol during SSCF would significantly improve the economics of high solids loading processes. Biotechnol.

AB  - Although the aviation sector is a relatively small contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fast-growing, fossil fuel-intensive transportation mode. Because aviation is a mode for which liquid fuels currently have no practical substitute, biofuels are gaining attention as a promising cleaner alternative. In this paper, we use the GCAM integrated assessment model to develop scenarios that explore the potential impact of biojet fuels for use in aviation in the context of broader climate change mitigation. We show that a carbon price would have a significant impact on the aviation sector. In the absence of alternatives to jet fuel from petroleum, mitigation potential is limited and would be at the expense of aviation service demand growth. However, mitigation efforts through the increased use of biojet fuels show potential to reduce the carbon intensity of aviation, without a significant impact on bioenergy use in the rest of the energy system for carbon mitigation. The potential of biofuel to decarbonize air transport is significantly enhanced when carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is used in the conversion process to produce jet fuels from biomass feedstock. © 2017

AB  - Wood chip, mainly used to produce paper and other products traditionally, has also been used to produce biofuel. The global demand for wood chip is increasing as policies promote the use of biomass for renewable energy. The USA has been a major exporter of wood chip worldwide, but US exports of wood chip could decline if this resource is increasingly used for domestic electricity generation and cellulosic biofuel production. Meanwhile, European Union (EU) demand for wood chip is expected to increase rapidly in response to its renewable energy policy. In this paper, we build the first global trade model for wood chip using available wood chip trade data and analyze the combined effects of local renewable energy policies in these jurisdictions on the global market of wood chip. We find that the tropical regions of Latin America and Southeast Asia as well as the Former Soviet Union would increase their export of wood chip significantly in response to the policy scenarios. If forest governance in some of these countries is weak, US and EU renewable energy policy could inadvertently exacerbate deforestation in these regions, with an associated negative impact on carbon storage and other environmental services. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Ongoing severe drought and increased demand for freshwater by municipal and industrial sectors have reduced the freshwater availability for agriculture in the far west Texas region. The region has enormous potential for developing alternative water sources for a bioenergy crop that requires less water and can grow on saline soils. In addition to improving farm income, this can help in producing 137 billion liters of bio-based transportation fuels goal set by the U.S. Congress by the year 2022. This study evaluated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) performance under treated urban wastewater irrigation on salt affected soils amended with gypsum and polymer using soil columns prepared from a salt affected land over six years under greenhouse conditions that mimicked the climatic conditions of the study region. Results indicated that switchgrass produced appreciable biomass even under highly saline and sodic conditions. Qualities of biomass under treated urban wastewater were comparable to that produced under freshwater irrigation. Expectedly, soil salinity increased with time at a greater rate under wastewater irrigation than freshwater. Soil SAR values were below threshold when adequate Ca was available to counter sodicity. In addition irrigation with treated wastewater improved nitrogen and potassium status in the root zone. This can reduce of cost of fertilization and increase farm profitability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used extensively to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of biofuels. Some argue that the common treatment of biogenic carbon emissions as being carbon neutral in LCA is flawed. From this divergent perspective, biofuels have potential benefits only if additional atmospheric CO2 is captured or feedstocks that would otherwise quickly decompose (e.g. agricultural residues) are utilized. An alternative method, Annual Basis Carbon (ABC) accounting, has recently been demonstrated for a single ethanol facility comparing the year-over-year GHG impacts of the cropland supplying the facility, the fuel production processes (gasoline prior to construction and ethanol after), and vehicle tailpipe emissions. Our review of the ABC method identifies inconsistencies in the treatment of the non-fuel products: corn, soybeans, and distiller's dried grain solubles (DDGS). While these products are also consumed annually, the GHG emissions were not considered in evaluating the system performance. Furthermore, GHG impacts, both in terms of burdens from inputs and crop CO2 uptake, were not allocated to the products leaving the system. Thus in the initial state, the petroleum-fueled system received a substantial benefit from crop CO2 uptake, but none of the subsequent emission burdens associated with the consumption of non-fuel (i.e., food/feed) ‘exports’. In the final state, conversely, most biomass was combusted as ethanol and captured within the considered system. A system expansion is needed to better account for impacts. While concerns about the degree of carbon additionality have some merit, consequential LCA methods provide for more consistent and comprehensive approaches for evaluating biofuel GHG performance. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The present work investigated the degradation of two Indian hardwoods (Pithecellobium dulce and Tamarindus indica) and the activities of lignocellulolytic enzymes by Pseudolagarobasidium acaciicola AGST3 and Tricholoma giganteum AGDR1. Laccase exhibited the highest ligninolytic activity, followed by manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase in both white rot fungi. Accessory enzymes such as aryl alcohol oxidase and cellobiose dehydrogenase showed higher activities till 21 days after incubation and then declined till 30 days. Xylanase and β-glucosidase were also found to be stable in both fungi during the degradation of hardwoods. The cultures, P. acaciicola AGST3 and T. giganteum AGDR1 accumulated high amounts of oxalic acid and produced weddellite (0.2–9 μm) and whewellite (5–21 μm) crystals, respectively. Comparative decay studies revealed that both the fungi were able to degrade lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses of two hardwoods efficiently. During the pyrolysis reaction, decrease in onset temperature and activation energy was observed with the fungal treated wood as compared to the untreated wood. The basidiomycete cultures used in the study are efficient lignin degraders and can be applied as a pretreatment for second generation biofuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Extensive use of nanomaterials in commercial consumer products and industrial applications eventually leads to their release to the waste streams and the environment. Nano-ZnO is one of the most widely-used nanomaterials (NMs) due to its unique properties. It is also known to impact biological processes adversely. In this study, the effect of nano-ZnO on biogas generation from sanitary landfills was investigated. Two conventional and two bioreactor landfills were operated using real MSW samples at mesophilic temperature (35 °C) for a period of about 1 year. 100 mg nano-ZnO/kg of dry waste was added to the simulated landfill reactors. Daily gas production, gas composition and leachate Zn concentrations were regularly monitored. A model describing the fate of the nano-ZnO was also developed. The results obtained indicated that as much as 99% of the nano-ZnO was retained within the waste matrix for both reactor operation modes. Waste stabilization was faster in simulated landfill bioreactors with and without the addition of nano-ZnO. Moreover, the presence of the nano-ZnO within the waste led to a decrease in biogas production of about 15%, suggesting that the nano-ZnO might have some inhibitory effects on waste stabilization. This reduction can have potentially significant implications on waste stabilization and the use of biogas from landfills as a renewable energy source. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus is a promising candidate for biofuel production due to the broad range of substrates it can utilize and its high ethanol yield compared to other thermophilic bacteria, such as Clostridium thermocellum. Three alcohol dehydrogenases, AdhA, AdhB and AdhE, play key roles in ethanol formation. To study their physiological roles during ethanol formation, we deleted them separately and in combination. Previously, it has been thought that both AdhB and AdhE were bifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases. Here we show that AdhE has primarily acetyl-CoA reduction activity (ALDH) and almost no acetaldehyde reduction (ADH) activity, whereas AdhB has no ALDH activity and but high ADH activity. We found that AdhA and AdhB have similar patterns of activity. Interestingly, although deletion of both adhA and adhB reduced ethanol production, a single deletion of either one actually increased ethanol yields by 60–70%. © 2017, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Biofuels often raise the specter of food insecurity, water resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing. These concerns underpin the “sustainability criteria” governing access to European biofuel markets. However, it is unclear if producing biofuels in low-income countries does exacerbate poverty and food insecurity, and moreover, whether the sustainability criteria should apply to all agricultural exports entering European markets. We develop an integrated modeling framework to simultaneously assess the economic and environmental impacts of producing biofuels in Malawi. We incorporate the effects of land use change on crop water use, and the opportunity costs of using scarce resources for biofuels instead of other crops. We find that biofuel production reduces poverty and food insecurity by raising household incomes. Irrigated outgrower schemes, rather than estate farms, lead to better economic outcomes, fewer emissions, and similar water requirements. Nevertheless, to gain access to European markets, Malawi would need to reduce emissions from ethanol plants. We find that biofuels’ economic and emissions outcomes are generally preferable to tobacco or soybeans. We conclude that the sustainability criteria encourage more sustainable biofuel production in countries like Malawi, but are perhaps overly biased against biofuels since other export crops raise similar concerns about food security and environmental impacts. © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Closing yield gaps through higher fertilizer use increases direct greenhouse gas emissions but shares the burden over a larger production volume. Net greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints per unit product under agricultural intensification vary depending on the context, scale and accounting method. Life cycle analysis of footprints includes attributable emissions due to (i) land conversion (‘fixed cost’); (ii) external inputs used (‘variable cost’); (iii) crop production (‘agronomic efficiency’); and (iv) postharvest transport and processing (‘proportional’ cost). The interplay between fixed and variable costs results in a nuanced opportunity for intermediate levels of intensification to minimize footprints. The fertilizer level that minimizes the footprint may differ from the economic optimum. The optimization problem can be solved algebraically for quadratic crop fertilizer response equations. We applied this theory to data of palm oil production and fertilizer use from 23 plantations across the Indonesian production range. The current EU threshold requiring at least 35% emission saving for biofuel use can never be achieved by palm oil if produced: (i) on peat soils, or (ii) on mineral soils where the C debt due to conversion is larger than 20 Mg C ha−1, if the footprint is calculated using an emission ratio of N2O–N/N fertilizer of 4%. At current fertilizer price levels in Indonesia, the economically optimized N fertilizer rate is 344–394 kg N ha−1, while the reported mean N fertilizer rate is 141 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and rates of 74–277 kg N ha−1 would minimize footprints, for a N2O–N/N fertilizer ratio of 4–1%, respectively. At a C debt of 30 Mg C ha−1, these values are 200–310 kg N ha−1. Sustainable weighting of ecology and economics would require a higher fertilizer/yield price ratio, depending on C debt. Increasing production by higher fertilizer use from current 67% to 80% of attainable yields would not decrease footprints in current production conditions. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - A possible application of glycerol, which is produced in large amounts as a by-product from the biodiesel industry, is its fermentation to serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol), a glycerol derivative. The downstream processing of this glycerol-based fermentation broth was investigated. The challenge of the isolation of serinol was the complex media and the solubility of the desired substance in aqueous media. In this study, the isolation of serinol was investigated by an appropriate reversible derivatization method. Serinol was isolated by protecting the amino group with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate directly in the aqueous phase, followed by extraction of the 2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)vinyl-serinol (BECV-serinol) with ethyl acetate resulting in an isolated yield of 63%. We demonstrate the possibility of isolation of a hydroscopic amino alcohol from the fermentation broth and the comparison of the products in water as well as the cleavage of the 2,2-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)vinyl group (BECV group). The procedure can also be used for other amino group containing molecules, such as serine, glucosamine, hexylamine and amino methyl laureate. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Production of woody biomass for bioenergy, whether wood pellets or liquid biofuels, has the potential to cause substantial landscape change and concomitant effects on forest ecosystems, but the landscape effects of alternative production scenarios have not been fully assessed. We simulated landscape change from 2010 to 2050 under five scenarios of woody biomass production for wood pellets and liquid biofuels in North Carolina, in the southeastern United States, a region that is a substantial producer of wood biomass for bioenergy and contains high biodiversity. Modeled scenarios varied biomass feedstocks, incorporating harvest of ‘conventional’ forests, which include naturally regenerating as well as planted forests that exist on the landscape even without bioenergy production, as well as purpose-grown woody crops grown on marginal lands. Results reveal trade-offs among scenarios in terms of overall forest area and the characteristics of the remaining forest in 2050. Meeting demand for biomass from conventional forests resulted in more total forest land compared with a baseline, business-as-usual scenario. However, the remaining forest was composed of more intensively managed forest and less of the bottomland hardwood and longleaf pine habitats that support biodiversity. Converting marginal forest to purpose-grown crops reduced forest area, but the remaining forest contained more of the critical habitats for biodiversity. Conversion of marginal agricultural lands to purpose-grown crops resulted in smaller differences from the baseline scenario in terms of forest area and the characteristics of remaining forest habitats. Each scenario affected the dominant type of land-use change in some regions, especially in the coastal plain that harbors high levels of biodiversity. Our results demonstrate the complex landscape effects of alternative bioenergy scenarios, highlight that the regions most likely to be affected by bioenergy production are also critical for biodiversity, and point to the challenges associated with evaluating bioenergy sustainability.

AB  - Winter barley has attracted strong interest as a potential feedstock for fuel ethanol production in regions with mild winter climate such as the mid-Atlantic and northeastern USA. Ten recently developed and improved winter barley cultivars and breeding lines including five hulled and five hull-less lines were experimentally evaluated for potential ethanol production. The five hulled barley lines included three released cultivars (Thoroughbred, Atlantic, and Secretariat) and two breeding lines (VA09B-34 and VA11B-4). The five hull-less lines also included three released cultivars (Eve, Dan, and Amaze 10) and two breeding lines (VA08H-65 and VA13H-34). On the average, the hull-less barley cultivars produced more ethanol per unit mass because of their higher starch and β-glucan contents. However, since the hulled barley cultivars had higher agronomic yield, the potential ethanol production per acre of land for the two types were approximately equal. Among the ten cultivars tested, the hull-less cultivar Amaze 10 was the best one for ethanol production. The ethanol yield values obtained for this cultivar were 2.61 gal per bushel and 292 gal per acre. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Biofuels of the second generation can contribute significantly to the replacement of the currently used fossil energy carriers for transportation fuel production. The lignocellulosic biomass residues used do not compete with food and feed production, but have to be collected from wide-spread areas for industrial large-scale use. The two-stage gasification concept bioliq offers a solution to this problem. It aims at the conversion of low-grade residual biomass from agriculture and forestry into synthetic fuels and chemicals. Central element of the bioliq process development is the 2–5 MW pilot plant along the complete process chain: fast pyrolysis for pretreatment of biomass to obtain an energy dense, liquid intermediate fuel, high-pressure entrained flow gasification providing low methane synthesis gas free of tar, hot synthesis gas cleaning to separate acid gases, and contaminants as well as methanol/dimethyl ether and subsequent following gasoline synthesis. After construction and commissioning of the individual process steps with partners from industry, first production of synthetic fuel was successfully achieved in 2014. In addition to pilot plant operation for technology demonstration, a research and development network has been established providing the scientific basis for optimization and further development of the bioliq process as well as to explore new applications of the technologies and products involved.

AB  - Purpose: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from biofuel production and use often occur over many different years. Nondynamic GHG accounting methods traditionally sum the global warming impacts (GWIs) occurring over a 100-year period for all emissions occurring in the life cycle regardless of emission timing. When examining biofuels from a policy perspective, time horizons are chosen to determine the benefits a policy or action has over a desired time period. It is critical to only account for impacts occurring within the given time period by having consistent temporal boundaries. When calculating the GWI as a function of time, additional assumptions and data are required. These assumptions have implications on the results and are explored herein to determine their influence on the overall conclusions when comparing biofuels made from different cellulosic feedstocks. Materials and methods: The time zero assumption of both biomass planting and harvesting was examined. Analytical time horizon choice was also tested by examining results on a 25-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year time horizon. GWIs using dynamic GHG accounting methods were compared to nondynamic GWI method results. Direct land use change (LUC) emissions were determined for the different feedstock conversion scenarios and used to calculate a payback period for switchgrass and sweet sorghum biofuel scenarios. Dynamic biofuel life cycle emissions were also modeled for biofuel scenarios where LUC emissions were negative in the case of converting cropland to forests. Results and discussion: Biofuel life cycle emissions and GHG reductions compared to gasoline were highly sensitive to GHG accounting methods and time horizons. The time zero assumption had greater influence on the results when shorter time horizons were chosen and decreased as time horizons approached 500 years. Using the dynamic GHG accounting method, LUC payback periods were determined to be greater compared to a 0 % emission discount method. Payback periods using a discount rate of 2 and 3 % were at times greater and less than dynamic GHG accounting method results. Conclusions: The data presented herein suggest that time zero and other temporal emission timing assumptions are important and influence the overall study results. Analytical time horizons were also shown to be important and significantly influence the overall results, as well as be important to achieving carbon mitigation goals. Dynamic GHG accounting was shown to be a more robust method than the traditional static GWI accounting method ensuring consistent temporal boundaries; however, dynamic inventories require additional emission timing details and assumptions that require more effort and resources to model. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of the paper and fines across seven landfill sites (LFS) and assess the relationship between waste physicochemical properties and biogas production. Physicochemical analysis of the waste samples demonstrated that there were no clear trends in the spatial distribution of total solids (TS), moisture content (MC) and waste organic strength (VS) across all LFS. There was however noticeable difference between samples from the same landfill site. The effect of landfill age on waste physicochemical properties showed no clear relationship, thus, providing evidence that waste remains dormant and non-degraded for long periods of time. Landfill age was however directly correlated with the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of waste; with the highest BMP obtained from the most recent LFS. BMP was also correlated with depth as the average methane production decreased linearly with increasing depth. There was also a high degree of correlation between the Enzymatic Hydrolysis Test (EHT) and BMP test results, which motivates its potential use as an alternative to the BMP test method. Further to this, there were also positive correlations between MC and VS, VS and biogas volume and biogas volume and CH4 content. Outcomes of this work can be used to inform waste degradation and methane enhancement strategies for improving recovery of methane from landfills. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: At commercial level, the biodiesel production process is well established for many types of feedstock. However, economic feasibility depends on regional fluctuating data, making each case unique. A calculation model to analyze the economic feasibility of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas was developed, along with an analysis of the energetic balance derived from this process. RESULTS: Yucatán state has the cultivation surface to replace 10% of its fossil diesel fuel consumption with biodiesel. Two scenarios were studied: the use of biodiesel–fossil diesel blends B5 and B10. The net energy ratio (NER) of biodiesel production is 2.88, indicating that the system provides more energy than it consumes. The economic analysis indicates that biodiesel cost remains constant with production capacities of 10 000 m3 year−1 and higher. Field labor, pesticides, and fertilizers are the major costs at J. curcas plantations, representing 64.3, 16.3 and 11.5% of total biodiesel cost, respectively. The net present value (NPV) was always negative, proving that the biodiesel–jatropha chain is not economically viable. CONCLUSIONS: Actual seed productivity (1 495 kg ha−1 year−1) must be increased 2.17 times to attain economic viability. Agricultural practices need to be enhanced in order to lower labor cost and the use of fertilizers. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - To find a balance between food and energy security, this research presents the design of an energy self-sufficient farm in electricity, heat and bioethanol, which is produced by energy crops and agricultural residues. The farm proposed is evaluated by two models: Land Optimization and Cost Optimization. Due to the food–fuel debate over land and the detriment of food security, this research proposes utilizing the current abandoned land and increasing the food self-sufficiency ratio (FSSR) of the crops analyzed (rice, wheat and maize). The farm is optimized for several food and fuel demands, with a maximum farm unit size of 100 ha. The result is a myriad of farms of different sizes, each optimized for a certain demand. Subsequently, the amount and variety of such farms are optimized maximizing the food and fuel produced for each city of the case study (Miyagi Prefecture, Japan). The results suggest that the establishment of energy self-sufficient farms in the abandoned land can stimulate the biofuel industry and increase food security simultaneously. The FSSR of maize and wheat can be improved in approximately 10–25 and 7–9 %, respectively. The estimated bioethanol potential is 3.2–3.8 ML. Additionally, a surplus of electricity and heat, approximately 61–65 GWh and 60–165 MJ, respectively, is obtained. As the Land Optimization model proposed is sensitive to crop yields, a simultaneous evaluation is recommended. The results also suggest that the farms must be larger than 8 ha to achieve self-sufficiency; therefore, the policies involved need further evaluation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Domestic and foreign renewable energy targets and financial incentives have increased demand for woody biomass and bioenergy in the southeastern United States. This demand is expected to be met through purpose-grown agricultural bioenergy crops, short-rotation tree plantations, thinning and harvest of planted and natural forests, and forest harvest residues. With results from a forest economics model, spatially explicit state-and-transition simulation models, and species–habitat models, we projected change in habitat amount for 16 wildlife species caused by meeting a renewable fuel target and expected demand for wood pellets in North Carolina, USA. We projected changes over 40 years under a baseline ‘business-as-usual’ scenario without bioenergy production and five scenarios with unique feedstock portfolios. Bioenergy demand had potential to influence trends in habitat availability for some species in our study area. We found variation in impacts among species, and no scenario was the ‘best’ or ‘worst’ across all species. Our models projected that shrub-associated species would gain habitat under some scenarios because of increases in the amount of regenerating forests on the landscape, while species restricted to mature forests would lose habitat. Some forest species could also lose habitat from the conversion of forests on marginal soils to purpose-grown feedstocks. The conversion of agricultural lands on marginal soils to purpose-grown feedstocks increased habitat losses for one species with strong associations with pasture, which is being lost to urbanization in our study region. Our results indicate that landscape-scale impacts on wildlife habitat will vary among species and depend upon the bioenergy feedstock portfolio. Therefore, decisions about bioenergy and wildlife will likely involve trade-offs among wildlife species, and the choice of focal species is likely to affect the results of landscape-scale assessments. We offer general principals to consider when crafting lists of focal species for bioenergy impact assessments at the landscape scale. Published 2016.

AB  - Purpose: The present opinion paper is focused on the phytoremediation of organic pollutants and is based on the lectures given by the author during the International Congress of Phytoremediation of Polluted Soils, held at Vigo, Spain, 29–30 July 2014. The aim of this position paper is (1) to highlight some progress made within the last few years (after the end of COST Action 859 in October 2009) in the phytoremediation of selected organic pollutants and (2) to suggest new research and approaches, which seem important and promising in the opinion of the author to make this environmentally friendly remediation technique more attractive and more successful. Results and discussion: Depending on the type of soil to be treated, as well as on the xenobiotic contaminants, their concentration and ageing, different approaches can be considered and are briefly presented with some recent and successful applications, but also highlighting their limitations and needs for future developments: phytoextraction of hydrophobic xenobiotic compounds like polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), phytodegradation of xenobiotics and its possible impacts on primary and secondary metabolism of the plant and phytostimulation of rhizospheric microorganisms by root exudates for the rhizodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Outlook: Finally, some promising approaches are suggested for overcoming the bottlenecks and making phytoremediation a reliable, mature and sustainable technology: how to deal with mixed pollution; the potential of endophytic bacteria; possible improvements by soil amendments and co-cropping; validation of laboratory results by field experimentation; evolution of regulations from the total concentration of a pollutant to its bioavailable fraction; and the use of biomass for added-value products, fine chemicals and biofuels in biorefineries or the production of ornamental plants. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Landfill gas (LFG) management is one of the most important tasks for landfill operation and closure because of its impact in potential global warming. The aim of this work is to present a case history evaluating an LFG capture and treatment system for the present landfill facility in Córdoba, Argentina. The results may be relevant for many developing countries around the world where landfill gas is not being properly managed. The LFG generation is evaluated by modeling gas production applying the zero-order model, Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]), Scholl Canyon model, and triangular model. Variability in waste properties, weather, and landfill management conditions are analyzed in order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing different treatment systems. The results show the advantages of capturing and treating LFG in order to reduce the emissions of gases responsible for global warming and to determine the revenue rate needed for the project’s financial requirements. This particular project reduces by half the emission of equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) compared with the situation where there is no gas treatment. In addition, the study highlights the need for a change in the electricity prices if it is to be economically feasible to implement the project in the current Argentinean electrical market. Implications: Methane has 21 times more greenhouse gas potential than carbon dioxide. Because of that, it is of great importance to adequately manage biogas emissions from landfills. In addition, it is environmentally convenient to use this product as an alternative energy source, since it prevents methane emissions while preventing fossil fuel consumption, minimizing carbon dioxide emissions. Performed analysis indicated that biogas capturing and energy generation implies 3 times less equivalent carbon dioxide emissions; however, a change in the Argentinean electrical market fees are required to guarantee the financial feasibility of the project. © 2017 A&WMA.

AB  - Background: Development of biofuels is considered as one of the important ways to replace conventional fossil energy and mitigate climate change. However, rapid increase of biofuel production could cause other environmental concerns in China such as water stress. This study is intended to evaluate the life-cycle water footprints (WF) of biofuels derived from several potential non-edible feedstocks including cassava, sweet sorghum, and Jatropha curcas in China. Different water footprint types including blue water, green water, and grey water are considered in this study. Based on the estimated WF, water deprivation impact and water stress degree on local water environment are further analyzed for different regions in China. Results: On the basis of the feedstock resource availability, sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas seeds are considered as the likely feedstocks for biofuel production in China. The water footprint results show that the feedstock growth is the most water footprint intensive process, while the biofuel conversion and transportation contribute little to total water footprints. Water footprints vary significantly by region with climate and soil variations. The life-cycle water footprints of cassava ethanol, sweet sorghum ethanol, and Jatropha curcas seeds biodiesel were estimated to be 73.9-222.2, 115.9-210.4, and 64.7-182.3 L of water per MJ of biofuel, respectively. Grey water footprint dominates the life-cycle water footprint for each type of the biofuels. Development of biofuels without careful water resource management will exert significant impacts on local water resources. The water resource impacts vary significantly among regions. For example, based on blue and grey water consumption, Gansu province in China will suffer much higher water stress than other regions do due to limited available water resources and large amount of fertilizer use in that province. In term of blue water, Shandong province is shown with the most severe water stress issue, followed by Gansu province, which is attributed to the limited water resources in both provinces. Conclusions: By considering feedstock resource distribution, biofuel production potentials, and estimated water footprints, this study provides insight into the impact of biofuel production on the local water environment in China. Biofuel development policies need to be carefully designed for the sustainable development of biofuels in China. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Microalgae grown under different nutrient deficient conditions present a good source of natural lipids with applications for several types of biofuels. The expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene can further provide an insight to the mechanisms leading to enhanced lipid production under such stresses. In this study, two nutrients viz. nitrogen and phosphorus were modulated to see its effect on lipid productivity in selected cyanobacteria and its correlation with Accase followed by molecular dynamics simulation. Results: Selected cyanobacteria viz. Oscillatoria sp. (SP8), Anabaena sp. (SP12), Anabaena sp. (SP13), Microcoleus sp. (SP18), and Nostoc sp. (SP20) varied in their ability to accumulate lipids which ranged from a lowest of 0.13% in Anabaena sp. (SP13) to the maximum of 7.24% in Microcoleus sp. (SP18). Microcoleus sp. (SP18) also recorded highest lipid accumulation at both N (6 mM NaNO3) and P (0.20 mM K2HPO4) limiting conditions. The overall expression of accD was found to be upregulated in both Oscillatoria sp. (SP8) and Microcoleus sp. (SP18) for all nitrogen concentrations but was differentially regulated with both positive and negative induction under phosphorus stress conditions. Maximum induction was observed in Microcoleus sp. (SP18) at 0.20 mM K2HPO4. The obtained 3D structure of SP8 protein (21.8 kDa) showed six alpha helices, while SP18 protein (16.7 kDa) exhibited four alpha helices and four beta sheets. The phi (φ)/psi(ψ) angles of the amino acid residues observed in Ramachandran plot analysis showed that both SP8 and SP18 proteins were highly stable with more than 90% amino acids in allowed regions. The molecular dynamics simulation results also indicated the stability of ligand-bound protein complexes. Conclusion: It has been demonstrated that cyanobacterial isolates are affected differently by nutrient limitation leading to variation in their lipid productivity. The same has been revealed by the behavior of accD gene expression which was regulated more by nutrients concentrations rather than the organism. However, the ligand-bound protein complexes were stable throughout MD simulations. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In Brazil, the cultivation of bioenergy crops is expanding at an accelerated rate. Most of this expansion has occurred over low-intensity pasture and is considered sustainable because it does not involve deforestation of natural vegetation. However, the impacts on the water quality of headwater streams are poorly understood, especially with regard to the influence of land use patterns in the watershed. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use conversion on the water quality of streams draining sugarcane fields and examined whether the preservation of forested areas at the top of the headwaters would help mitigate the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Water samples were collected in two paired catchments in southeastern Brazil, which is one of the largest sugarcane production regions in the world. Our results show significant differences in the water quality of streams predominantly draining the pasture or the sugarcane field. Several parameters commonly used to indicate water quality, such as the concentrations of nitrate and suspended solids, were significantly higher in the sugarcane than in the pasture stream. Differences in water quality between the streams draining predominantly pasture or sugarcane fields were accentuated during the wet season. The preservation of forests surrounding the headwater streams was associated with overall better water quality conditions, such as lower nitrate concentrations and temperature of the stream water. We concluded that forest conservation in the headwater agricultural catchments is an important factor preventing water quality degradation in tropical streams. Therefore, we strongly recommend the preservation of robust riparian forests in the headwaters of tropical watersheds with intensive agriculture. More studies on the effects of best agricultural practices in bioenergy crops can greatly improve our capacity to prevent the degradation of water quality in the tropical waterways as intensive agriculture continues to expand in this region of the world. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of biofuels using second-generation feedstocks has been recognized as an important alternative source of sustainable energy and its demand is expected to increase due to regulations such as the Renewable Fuel Standard. However, the pathway to biofuel industry maturity faces unique, unaddressed challenges. To address this challenges, this paper presents an optimization model which quantifies and controls the impact of biomass quality variability on supply chain related decisions and technology selection. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model and associated efficient solution procedures for solving large-scale problems to (1) better represent the random nature of the biomass quality (defined by moisture and ash contents) in supply chain modeling, and (2) assess the impact of these uncertainties on the supply chain design and planning. The proposed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Tennessee. Results show that high moisture and ash contents negatively impact the unit delivery cost since poor biomass quality requires the addition of quality control activities. Experimental results indicate that supply chain cost could increase as much as 27%–31% when biomass quality is poor. We assess the impact of the biomass quality on the topological supply chain. Our case study indicates that biomass quality impacts supply chain costs; thus, it is important to consider the impact of biomass quality in supply chain design and management decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km-2 year-1. Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers. © 2017 Duarte, Wu, Xiao, Bruhn and Krause-Jensen.

AB  - Biodiesel production using microalgae would play a pivotal role in satisfying future global energy demands. Understanding of lipid metabolism in microalgae is important to isolate oleaginous strain capable of overproducing lipids. It has been reported that reducing starch biosynthesis can enhance lipid accumulation. However, the metabolic mechanism controlling carbon partitioning from starch to lipids in microalgae remains unclear, thus complicating the genetic engineering of algal strains. We here used "dynamic" metabolic profiling and essential transcription analysis of the oleaginous green alga Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4 for the first time to demonstrate the switching mechanisms from starch to lipid synthesis using salinity as a regulator, and identified the metabolic rate-limiting step for enhancing lipid accumulation (e.g., pyruvate-To-Acetyl-CoA). These results, showing salinity-induced starch-To-lipid biosynthesis, will help increase our understanding of dynamic carbon partitioning in oleaginous microalgae. Moreover, we successfully determined the changes of several key lipid-synthesis-related genes (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthetase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and starch-degradation related genes (e.g., starch phosphorylases), which could provide a breakthrough in the marine microalgal production of biodiesel. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Vinasse, main residue of the sugarcane industry, has high pollutant content, being subjected to the use in biogas production due to the high content of organic matter non-toxic to microbial action. For a consolidated process, it is necessary to study parameters that influence the process, in which the amount of inoculum is one of the major factors in the biological process of biogas production. This study investigated the influence of the amount of manure as inoculum (0.5 to 5.5%) during the biodigestion process, evaluating variables such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, biogas production, methane concentration, total solids and total phosphorus and nitrogen contents, as well as microbiological analysis in the sludge remaining in the digester. Biodigestion occurred normally, with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days, with an acidogenic phase, subsequent stabilization of pH and biogas production. The vinasse had COD and total solids reduced during biodigestion by around 67 and 40%, respectively. Biogas production was increased after the fifth day. Among the three studied conditions, there was no significant increase in efficiency of inoculum use and it can be used the lowest amount, 0.5 % (m v-1). © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - This article1 assesses recent efforts by the Indian government to tackle energy poverty and sustainable development. It focuses on the new integrated energy policy and initiatives to disseminate improved cookstoves and develop energy alternatives for transport. The success of government initiatives in cleaner biomass cookstoves and village electrification has historically been limited, and institutional reforms in the 2000s promoted market-led and ‘user-centred’ approaches, and encouraged biofuels as a ‘pro-poor’ route to rural development and energy security. The article argues that such interventions have reopened tensions and conflicts around land-use, intra-community inequalities and the role of corporate agendas in sustainable energy. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus has been widely cultivated in Europe and North America and is considered a potential biofuel plant. However, a barrier is the lacking establishment of inexpensive and successful stands. As a progenitor of M. × giganteus, M. sinensis could be potentially propagated by seed, with comparable biomass yield in some areas. The germination of seed plays an important role in establishing M. sinensis in the field. However, dormancy may not be advantageous for a seed to germinate freely. It is widely recognized that temperature is a key factor for seed dormancy and germination. In this study, two different temperature methods were hypothesized for promoting the seed germination of M. sinensis. The results showed that both 4°C and 10°C moist pre-chill treatment for 21 days had a positive effect on breaking dormancy. Nevertheless, 10°C treatment showed the ability to promote germinated seed growth, especially in the radical, which provided a rapid growth for establishment. For dry pre-heat treatments, 30°C for 30 days was the suitable treatment for increasing overall germination, as well as growth vigor. Furthermore, for saving time and labor, 50°C for 10 days also could be a choice as pre-treatment before sowing. In addition, there is a possibility that the high temperature sometimes reinforced dormancy or even induced seed death, but could well increase the radical growth, indicating that high temperature could be an unfavorable environment signal to cause the seed self-protection mechanism to dormancy. Therefore, high temperature level and duration of treatment for pre-heat seeds is necessary for further field performance studies. © 2017 Japanese Society of Grassland Science

AB  - Triglycerides (TAGs), the major storage molecules of metabolic energy and source of fatty acids, are produced as single cell oil by some oleogenic microorganisms. However, these microorganisms require strict culture conditions, show low carbon source flexibilities, lack efficient genetic modification tools and in some cases pose safety concerns. TAGs have essential applications such as behaving as a source for added-value fatty acids or giving rise to the production of biodiesel. Hence, new alternative methods are urgently required for obtaining these oils. In this work we describe TAG accumulation in the industrially appropriate microorganism Escherichia coli expressing the heterologous enzyme tDGAT, a wax ester synthase/triacylglycerol:acylCoA acyltranferase (WS/DGAT). With this purpose, we introduce a codon-optimized gene from the thermophilic actinomycete Thermomonospora curvata coding for a WS/DGAT into different E. coli strains, describe the metabolic effects associated to the expression of this protein and evaluate neutral lipid accumulation. We observe a direct relation between the expression of this WS/DGAT and TAG production within a wide range of culture conditions. More than 30% TAGs were detected within the bacterial neutral lipids in 90 minutes after induction. TAGs were observed to be associated with the hydrophobic enzyme while forming round intracytoplasmic bodies, which could represent a bottleneck for lipid accumulation in E. coli. We detected an increase of almost 3- fold in the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) occurring in the recombinant strains. These MUFA were predominant in the accumulated TAGs achieving 46% of the TAG fatty acids. These results set the basis for further research on the achievement of a suitable method towards the sustainable production of these neutral lipids. © 2017 Lázaro et al.

AB  - This study evaluates the ability of biostimulation to enhance the bioremediation of soil contaminated with oily compounds as compared with natural attenuation. The soil was contaminated with 4% of diesel or biodiesel and biostimulated with phycocyanin (a proteic emulsifier extracted from the Spirulina platensis biomass), an inactive biomass of S. platensis, or ammonium sulfate. Experiments were conducted for 60 days, whereas the biodegradation was measured through the determination of carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution and oils and grease. Higher CO2 evolution was observed in the soil contaminated with the biodiesel and phycocyanin as biostimulant (2,997.35 mg C-CO2) and in the soil contaminated with diesel oil with the inactive biomass S. platensis as biostimulant (2,454.89 mg C-CO2). The highest biodegradation was achieved by using phycocyanin as a biostimulant for biodiesel contamination (88.75%) or inactive biomass of S. platensis (63.89%) for diesel as contaminant. Natural attenuation resulted in the lower CO2 evolution of 386.5 and 282.5 mg C-CO2 and biodegradation rates of 42.4 and 31.3% for biodiesel and diesel, respectively. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Irrigated agricultural lands in arid regions often suffer from soil salinization and lack of drainage, which affect environmental quality and productivity. Integrated Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) systems, where drainage water generated from higher-valued crops grown on high quality soils are used to irrigate salt-tolerant crops grown on marginal soils, is one possible strategy for managing salinity and drainage problems. If the IFDM crop were a biofuel crop, both environmental and private benefits may be generated; however, little is known about this possibility. As such, we develop a bioeconomic programming model of irrigated agricultural production to examine the role salt-tolerant biofuel crops might play within an IFDM system. Our results, generated by optimizing profits over land, water, and crop choice decisions subject to resource constraints, suggest that based on the private profits alone, biofuel crops can be a competitive alternative to the common practices of land retirement and nonbiofuel crop production under both low to high drainage water salinity. Yet IFDM biofuel crop production generates 30–35% fewer GHG emissions than the other strategies. The private market competitiveness coupled with the public good benefits may justify policy changes encouraging the growth of IFDM biofuel crops in arid agricultural areas globally. © 2017.

AB  - Brazilian ethanol is derived from sugarcane and is mostly used domestically as a transportation fuel either pure or mixed with gasoline. Brazilians will fill their cars with pure ethanol when its pump price in energy equivalent is lower than the price of gasohol, the mandatory mixture of ethanol and gasoline. Over the last decade, Brazilian ethanol companies have used debt financing to meet the expected increase in domestic and international ethanol demand, which did not fully realise. With the current economic crisis, the ethanol sector, the second largest worldwide, is restructuring and seeking additional earning opportunities; co-generation and valorisation of by-products are likely to develop. Political commitments towards the ethanol sector through mandatory blending obligations or the fuel taxation system are strong. Domestic ethanol demand should thus remain sustained in the medium term. In addition, sugarcane-based ethanol has the best GHG emission reduction profile of all biofuels available on a large scale. Advanced ethanol based on sugarcane derived biomass has the potential to perform even better; here Brazil has a major role to play in the future. However massive flows of investments are needed to develop competitive and innovative large-scale advanced ethanol production facilities in the country. © 2017 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE)

AB  - “Generation 1.5” biofuels are derived from biomass feedstocks that originated as food crops, but with selective breeding and modified production management, are more energy dense and have lower carbon footprints than their food crop progenitors. Energy beets, specialized genotypes of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), grown under the proper low-carbon footprint conditions, is an example of such a Generation 1.5 feedstock crop. In this study, Beta vulgaris variety-Beta 5833R was tested for its responses to 14 different strains of the growth-promoting bacterium, Gluconacetobacter spp. in greenhouse studies at low (1 or 2 mM) and high (10 mM) levels of NO3- supplied to the plants. Using a β-glucuronidase (GUS)-labeled strain of the bacterium, confirmed that G. diazotrophicus is able to colonize the plant with root tips, root hairs and lateral root junctions being the major infection sites. Using 15N-isotope dilution technique, the present work demonstrates for the first time that N2 fixation associated with Gluconacetobacter spp. increased N accumulation and lead to increases of up to 110% in sugar beet biomass. However, biomass increases in sugar beet were still evident even at higher levels of NO3- supply even though N2 fixation by the bacterium was quite low, suggesting that other mechanisms may also have been at work in the growth promotion of sugar beet by Gluconacetobacter spp. © 2017

AB  - As modern societies are moving to the bio-economy era the energy solutions of enterprises are becoming increasingly important. In this paper we study the energy futures of farms up to 2030. A two-rounded mixed Delphi study combining qualitative and quantitative data was carried out to gather the views of experts within agriculture, as well as climate and energy issues. In the first round the experts answered a questionnaire and were interviewed and on the second round a feed-back report from the first round and an online questionnaire was used. The experts were asked to estimate probable and evaluate preferred futures of eleven energy sources in farm-level energy usage. Images of the future were constructed by performing a cluster analysis of the quantitative data. The quantitative clusters were complemented with qualitative material providing, arguments, meanings and rationale of and paths to the images of the future. Six scenarios were formed this way: 1) Boiler and Pump, 2) Incremental Change, 3) Energy Boost Plus, 4) Energy Boost Minus, 5) Renewable Prosperity and 6) Energy Save. The six scenarios differ in how much they envision traditional energy forms (bulk electricity, oil, natural gas) will be used and what is the emphasis of combustion of biofuels (wood, liquid biofuels, biogas, other biomass) and the use of other renewables (wind, solar energy, heat pumps and hydropower). All scenarios need consistent policies in order to become realised in the future – it is time to decide. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of different pretreatments methodologies of hydrogen peroxide, alkaline hydrolysis (calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide), alkaline peroxide oxidation (hydrogen peroxide/calcium hydroxide or hydrogen peroxide/sodium hydroxide), and dilute acid hydrolysis (10%(w/w) sulphuric acid) on corn cob biomass waste potential for biofuel and biocommodities utilization. The structure and elemental compositions of treated solid biomass waste fraction were characterised by different analytical techniques such as gravimetry, steremicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Light microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, and oxygen analyser. The solid fractions were also estimated based on cellulose enhancement, hemicellulose solubilization and lignin removal. The liquid fractions were evaluated with atomic absorption spectrophotometry for heavy metals presence and high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) for the monosaccharides. In all the pretreatments, the performance of alkaline peroxide oxidation (hydrogen peroxide/sodium hydroxide) was superior to all other methods evaluated with the highest lignin removal (about 78%(w/w)), cellulose was also enhanced (up to 59%(w/w)) from an initial 16%(w/w), and hemicellulose solubilized up to 79%(w/w). More of the sugars were solubilized in the acid pretreated hydrolyzate. The pretreatment methods considered in this study established the economic viability of the corn cob for biocommodities and biofuel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Residue removal for biofuel production may have unintended consequences for N2O emissions from soils, and it is not clear how N2O emissions are influenced by crop residue removal from different tillage systems. Thus, we measured field-scale N2O flux over 5 years (2005–2007, 2010–2011) from an annual crop rotation to evaluate how N2O emissions are influenced by no-till (NT) compared to conventional tillage (CV), and how crop residue removal (R−) rather than crop residue return to soil (R+) affects emissions from these two tillage systems. Data from all 5 years indicated no differences in N2O flux between tillage practices at the onset of the growing season, but CT had 1.4–6.3 times higher N2O flux than NT overwinter. Nitrous oxide emissions were higher due to R− compared to R+, but the effect was more marked under CT than NT and overwinter than during spring. Our results thus challenge the assumption based on IPCC methodology that crop residue removal will result in reduced N2O emissions. The potential for higher N2O emission with residue removal implies that the benefit of utilizing biomass as biofuels to mitigate greenhouse gas emission may be overestimated. Interestingly, prior to an overwinter thaw event, dissolved organic C (DOC) was negatively correlated to peak N2O flux (r = −0.93). This suggests that lower N2O emissions with R+ vs. R− may reflect more complete stepwise denitrification to N2 during winter and possibly relate to the heterotrophic microbial capacity for processing crop residue into more soluble C compounds and a shift in the preferential C source utilized by the microbial community overwinter. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel production in the U.S. from vegetable oils has increased substantially during the past decade. However, its further increase is limited by the low amounts of oil produced per hectare from temperate oilseed crops. Recently novel transgenic sugarcane has been developed to accumulate both sugars and lipids in stems, making it a promising dual-purpose feedstock to produce both ethanol and biodiesel. In this study, two lines of the transgenic lipid producing sugarcane (lipid-cane) and the non-transformed sugarcane were characterized and processed. The total lipid concentrations were 0.7%, 0.9% and 1.3% for the non-transformed sugarcane and lipid-cane lines19B and 25 C, respectively. Lipid composition analysis showed that about 31–33% of the total lipids were triacylglycerols, main feedstock for biodiesel production, for the lipid-cane samples, while this value was only 5% for the non-transformed sugarcane. By processing the sugarcane stems with a juicer, about 90% of the sugars and 60% of the lipids were extracted with juice. The extracted sugars in juice were fermented to ethanol and the lipids were later recovered from the fermented juice using organic solvents. The recovered lipids from the fermented juice were 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 g/100 g dry stem for the non-transformed sugarcane and lipid-cane lines 19B and 25 C, respectively. This study proved the concept of the lipid and sugar coproduction from the novel lipid-cane, which have a potential to make a large-scale replacement of fossil derived fuel without unrealistic demands on land area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The residence of municipal solid waste within a landfill body results in a significant change of material properties. Experiences with the energetic utilisation of the burnable fractions from formerly landfilled waste are hardly documented, the influence of refuse derived fuels (RDF) from such materials on the performance of modern waste-to-energy plants is not sufficiently described in scientific literature. Therefore this study focuses on the energetic utilisation of refuse derived fuel from landfilled waste, processed in a mechanical waste treatment facility, and the impact of the material on the operation of the incineration plant. Additionally, the possibility of direct combustion of non-pre-treated excavated landfill material has been evaluated in the same facility. First, sampling and analysis of the fuel has been carried out. Based on this, a large-scale combustion experiment was planned and conducted in an industrial waste-to-energy plant. Steam mass flow rate, concentration of harmful substances in the raw gas, as well as total emissions of the facility have been monitored in detail. Furthermore, the influence of the landfilled material on the additive consumption has been determined. The combustion residues (bottom ash) were also sampled and analysed. Based on the evaluation of operating data and analysis of both fuel and residue, suitable thermal treatment approaches for the refuse-derived fuel and the non-pre-treated excavated material have been assessed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a consequence of the environmental concerns linked with the exploitation of fossil fuel reserves, biofuel production using microalgae has been widely considered because of their higher productive capacity compared with land plants. However, genetic modifications will likely be required to further improve the lipid productivity of native microalgae and to tailor it to the compositions required for different fuel types. In this study, genes encoding two NADPH-producing enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), were overexpressed in the oleaginous diatom Fistulifera solaris. The native expression levels of the PGD and G6PD selected in this study were not up-regulated but constant and down-regulated, respectively. By overexpression of the genes encoding these enzymes, NADPH enhancement was confirmed in the transformant cells as compared to wild type cells, as was the acceleration of lipid accumulation. The promotion effect of G6PD (oil content: 37.2 ± 5.6%) on neutral lipid accumulation was higher than that of PGD (26.1 ± 3.32%) at early stages (24 h after nutrient depletion, 20.5 ± 4.3% for wild type), although the final lipid content at 60 h was not significantly different between wild type and transformant cells (47.5 ± 2.9%, 48.6 ± 3.8%, 52.2 ± 2.9% for wild type, PGD, and G6PD, respectively). Overexpression of G6PD elevated lipid productivity by 1.5-fold. We therefore propose that NADPH-producing enzymes in PPP can contribute to lipid synthesis in F. solaris, indicating that their further manipulation may provide breakthroughs for an even more effective biodiesel fuel production with this diatom. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Camelina sativa is an old world crop newly introduced to the semi-arid regions of the Southwestern US. Recently, Camelina gained attention as a biofuel feedstock crop due to its relatively high oil content, polyunsaturated fatty acids, very short growing season with fairly good adaption to marginal lands, and low input agricultural systems. To expand Camelina growing zones into more arid regions, it is important to develop new drought resistant cultivars that can grow under water-limited conditions. Plants having cuticles with low permeability to water can possess elevated dehydration avoidance and improved drought tolerance. To extend our understating of cuticle chemical composition among Camelina species, leaf wax and cutin monomers in seventeen accessions representing four Camelina species were analyzed. Camelina exhibited a wide range of wax and cutin contents. The primary alcohols and alkanes were the predominant classes of leaf wax, followed in abundance by wax esters, fatty acids, aldehydes, alkylguaiacols, methylalkylresorcinols, α-amyrin and ß-sitosterol. Among primary alcohols, the dominant constituents were the C24, C26 and C28 homologues, while the C31 homologue was the most abundant alkane among all Camelina accessions. Cutin monomers included monohydroxy monobasic acids, phenolics, monobasic acids, monohydroxy epoxymonobasic acids, and dibasic acids. Among the cutin monomers examined, the C16:0 diOH acid showed extensive variation among Camelina species. © 2017

AB  - Due to the adverse effects of fossil fuel use, it is becoming increasingly important to produce next-generation biofuels from renewable, sustainable sources. Filamentous N2-fixing strains of cyanobacteria have emerged as promising industrial microorganisms capable of producing a range biofuels and chemicals using CO2, water, and sunlight. In this study, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was conducted on a hypothetical production facility that uses a genetically engineered strain of filamentous cyanobacteria to produce the cyclic hydrocarbon limonene. Two scenarios were evaluated in which the only difference between the scenarios was the limonene productivity of the engineered cyanobacteria strain. In Scenario 1, the cyanobacterium was assumed to produce limonene at a rate of 1.8 mg/L/h, resulting in an annual production of 32,727 L/yr of limonene. In Scenario 2, limonene productivity was 55.5 mg/L/h, resulting in annual production of 1,000,000 L/yr. Both scenarios were assumed to produce the same amount of cellular biomass, that was converted to biogas by anaerobic digestion and the biogas was converted by gas turbines into electricity to power the facility. Excess electricity was assumed to be sold to the grid. The major environmental burdens of the facility, which were measured in eco-points and calculated based on the Eco-indicator 99 method, were the cyanobacteria nutrient supply (especially sodium nitrate) and the photobioreactor (PBR) electrical requirements. The lower output of limonene in Scenario 1 meant that less energy was required for product recovery, leaving more electricity for sale to the grid. Even though a higher limonene productivity will worsen the environmental profile of the process, both scenarios described in this study have less of a negative environmental impact than biodiesel production. This study strongly suggests both scenarios of the theoretical limonene production facility described herein holds great potential as a future solution for producing next-generation biofuels directly from solar energy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is crucial for biofilm structure, microbial nutrition and proximal stability of habitat in a variety of environments. However, the production patterns of microbial EPS in soils as affected by heavy metal contamination remain uncertain. Here we investigate the extracellular response of the native microbial biomass in a grassland soil treated with refined glycerol or crude unrefined biodiesel co-product (BCP) with and without ZnCl2. We extracted microbial EPS and more readily soluble microbial products (SMP), and quantified total polysaccharide, uronic acid, and protein content in these respective extracts. Organic addition, especially BCP, significantly stimulated the production of EPS-polysaccharide and protein but had no impact on EPS-uronic acids, while in the SMP-fraction, polysaccharides and uronic acids were both significantly increased. In response to the inclusion of Zn2+, both EPS- and SMP-polysaccharides increased. This implies firstly that a tolerance mechanism of soil microorganisms against Zn2+ toxicity exists through the stimulation of SMP and EPS production, and secondly that co-products of biofuel industries may have value-added use in bioremediation efforts to support in-situ production of microbial biopolymers. Microbial films and mobile polymers are likely to impact a range of soil properties. The recent focus on EPS research in soils is anticipated to help contribute an improved understanding of biofilm dynamics in other complex systems - such as continuously operated bioreactors. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Agricultural land use change, especially corn expansion since 2000s, has been accelerating to meet the growing bioenergy demand of the United States. This study identifies the environmentally sensitive lands (ESLs) in the U.S. Midwest using the distance-weighted Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) associated with bioenergy land uses extracted from USDA Cropland Data Layers. The impacts of soil erosion to downstream wetlands and waterbodies in the river basin are counted in the RUSLE with an inverse distance weighting approach. In a GIS-ranking model, the ESLs in 2008 and 2011 (two representative years of corn expansion) are ranked based on their soil erosion severity in crop fields. Under scenarios of bioenergy land use change (corn to grass and grass to corn) on two land types (ESLs and non-ESLs) at three magnitudes (5%, 10% and 15% change), this study assesses the potential environmental impacts of bioenergy land use at a basin level. The ESL distributions and projected trends vary geographically responding to different agricultural conversions. Results support the idea of re-planting native prairie grasses in the identified High and Severe rank ESLs for sustainable bioenergy management in this important agricultural region. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Restaurant grease trap waste (GTW) is a potentially feasible energy source that can be used as an alternative to liquid fossil fuels and natural gas. However, GTW must be collected from many different resources for energy production because restaurants in Japan only produce an average of 486 kg GTW per year. This study investigated the variation in oil properties and methane generation potential of 44 GTW samples from 13 types of restaurants during different seasons. The GTW samples had high variation in oil content and oil properties. Biofuel oil was extracted from most GTW samples at a high efficiency (more than 80 wt%). In contrast, the methane yield varied little among de-oiled GTW samples. All types of GTWs are potential sources of biomethane generation. GTW samples are classified into five major oil property clusters according to solid chemical stability. Oil properties depend little on the season and heavily on the restaurant type. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is one of the highest biomass-producing plant and the best lignocellulosic feedstock for ethanol production. To achieve more efficient conversion of biomass to ethanol, a better understanding of the main factors affecting biomass recalcitrance is needed. Therefore, with this objective, here, we report a systematic study on lignin content, deposition, identification, and cloning of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and their differential expression in five sugarcane clones, EC11003, EC11010, IK 76-91, IK 76-99, and Co 86032. Lignin content among the clones varied from 26.87 to 23.19 % with the highest in the clone EC11010 and the lowest in high sugar Co86032. Lignin deposition studied through phloroglucinol staining of the cell walls implied that the sclerenchyma cells of the energy canes (EC11010 and EC11003) have more lignin deposition followed by the Erianthus (IK 76-91 and IK 76-99) clones whereas Co86032 has the minimum amount of lignin deposition. We cloned partial coding regions of important genes of lignification COMT (650 bp), CCR (332 bp), and PAL (650 bp) from Erianthus, wild relative of sugarcane followed by the expression analysis through real-time PCR. Differential expression analysis showed high level of expression for the three genes in the energy cane EC11010. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The implementation of measures to increase productivity and resource efficiency in food and bioenergy chains as well as to more sustainably manage land use can significantly increase the biofuel production potential while limiting the risk of causing indirect land use change (ILUC). However, the application of these measures may influence the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and other environmental impacts of agricultural and biofuel production. This study applies a novel, integrated approach to assess the environmental impacts of agricultural and biofuel production for three ILUC mitigation scenarios, representing a low, medium and high miscanthus-based ethanol production potential, and for three agricultural intensification pathways in terms of sustainability in Lublin province in 2020. Generally, the ILUC mitigation scenarios attain lower net annual emissions compared to a baseline scenario that excludes ILUC mitigation and bioethanol production. However, the reduction potential significantly depends on the intensification pathway considered. For example, in the moderate ILUC mitigation scenario, the net annual GHG emissions in the case study are 2.3 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (1.8 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) for conventional intensification and −0.8 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (−0.6 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) for sustainable intensification, compared to 3.0 MtCO2-eq yr−1 (2.3 tCO2-eq ha−1 yr−1) in the baseline scenario. In addition, the intensification pathway is found to be more influential for the GHG balance than the ILUC mitigation scenario, indicating the importance of how agricultural intensification is implemented in practice. Furthermore, when the net emissions are included in the assessment of GHG emissions from bioenergy, the ILUC mitigation scenarios often abate GHG emissions compared to gasoline. But sustainable intensification is required to attain GHG abatement potentials of 90% or higher. A qualitative assessment of the impacts on biodiversity, water quantity and quality, soil quality and air quality also emphasizes the importance of sustainable intensification. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Miscanthus has a high potential as a biomass feedstock for biofuel production. Drought tolerance is an important breeding goal in miscanthus as water deficit is a common abiotic stress and crop irrigation is in most cases uneconomical. Drought may not only severely reduce biomass yields, but also affect biomass quality for biofuel production as cell wall remodeling is a common plant response to abiotic stresses. The quality and plant weight of 50 diverse miscanthus genotypes were evaluated under control and drought conditions (28 days no water) in a glasshouse experiment. Overall, drought treatment decreased plant weight by 45%. Drought tolerance – as defined by maintenance of plant weight – varied extensively among the tested miscanthus genotypes and ranged from 30% to 110%. Biomass composition was drastically altered due to drought stress, with large reductions in cell wall and cellulose content and a substantial increase in hemicellulosic polysaccharides. Stress had only a small effect on lignin content. Cell wall structural rigidity was also affected by drought conditions; substantially higher cellulose conversion rates were observed upon enzymatic saccharification of drought-treated samples with respect to controls. Both cell wall composition and the extent of cell wall plasticity under drought varied extensively among all genotypes, but only weak correlations were found with the level of drought tolerance, suggesting their independent genetic control. High drought tolerance and biomass quality can thus potentially be advanced simultaneously. The extensive genotypic variation found for most traits in the evaluated miscanthus germplasm provides ample scope for breeding of drought-tolerant varieties that are able to produce substantial yields of high-quality biomass under water deficit conditions. The higher degradability of drought-treated samples makes miscanthus an interesting crop for the production of second-generation biofuels in marginal soils. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The cost of supplying wood biomass from forestry operations in remote areas has been an obstacle to expansion of forest-based bioenergy in much of the western United States. Economies of scale in the production of liquid fuels from lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks favor large centralized biorefineries. Increasing transportation efficiency through torrefaction and pelletization at distributed satellite facilities may serve as a means to expand the utilization of forestry residuals in biofuel production. To investigate this potential, a mixed-integer linear program was developed to optimize the feedstock supply chain design with and without distributed pretreatment. The model uses techno-economic assessment of scale-dependent biomass pretreatment processes from existing literature and multimodal biomass transportation cost evaluations derived from a spatially explicit network analysis as input. In addition, the sensitivity of the optimal system configuration was determined for variations of key input parameters including the production scale of pretreatment facilities, road and rail transportation costs, and feedstock procurement costs. Torrefaction and densification were found to reduce transportation costs by $0.84 per GJ and overall delivered costs by $0.24 per GJ, representing 14.5% and 5.2% cost reductions compared to feedstock collection without pretreatment. Significant uncertainties remain in terms of the costs associated with deploying torrefaction equipment at the scales modeled, but the level of potential cost savings suggests further analysis and development of these alternatives. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Perennial grasses can sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) in sustainably managed biofuel systems, directly mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentrations while simultaneously generating biomass for renewable energy. The objective of this study was to quantify SOC accumulation and identify the primary drivers of belowground C dynamics in a zero-tillage production system of tropical perennial C4 grasses grown for biofuel feedstock in Hawaii. Specifically, the quantity, quality, and fate of soil C inputs were determined for eight grass accessions – four varieties each of napier grass and guinea grass. Carbon fluxes (soil CO2 efflux, aboveground net primary productivity, litterfall, total belowground carbon flux, root decay constant), C pools (SOC pool and root biomass), and C quality (root chemistry, C and nitrogen concentrations, and ratios) were measured through three harvest cycles following conversion of a fallow field to cultivated perennial grasses. A wide range of SOC accumulation occurred, with both significant species and accession effects. Aboveground biomass yield was greater, and root lignin concentration was lower for napier grass than guinea grass. Structural equation modeling revealed that root lignin concentration was the most important driver of SOC pool: varieties with low root lignin concentration, which was significantly related to rapid root decomposition, accumulated the greatest amount of SOC. Roots with low lignin concentration decomposed rapidly, but the residue and associated microbial biomass/by-products accumulated as SOC. In general, napier grass was better suited for promoting soil C sequestration in this system. Further, high-yielding varieties with low root lignin concentration provided the greatest climate change mitigation potential in a ratoon system. Understanding the factors affecting SOC accumulation and the net greenhouse gas trade-offs within a biofuel production system will aid in crop selection to meet multiple goals toward environmental and economic sustainability. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Bioethanol is not currently produced in Chile. However, mixtures of bioethanol-gasoline at 2 and 5 % have been authorized. The production and use of the bioethanol-gasoline blend “E5” has been assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA) with the aim to compare the environmental profiles of bioethanol produced from Eucalyptus globulus with gasoline in Chile and to determine the potential of this biofuel-replacing gasoline in the transport sector. Methods: The standard framework of LCA described by ISO was selected to assess the ecological burdens derived from the biofuel production using the SimaPro v7.8 software. The system boundaries included eucalyptus cultivation, bioethanol production, E5 blend production, and final use of E5. The inventory data for Eucalyptus cultivation were previously collected through surveys with forest managers. Inventory data for bioethanol production were obtained by process simulation models using Aspen Plus v7.1, and for non-simulated or modeled information, secondary information (scientific articles and reports) was used. Conventional gasoline, produced and used in Chile, was used as base scenario for comparison with E5 scenario. Results and discussion: The environmental results showed reduction of the environmental impacts in most of the assessed categories when E5 blend is assessed and compared with gasoline. Reduction was evident for climate change, photochemical oxidation formation, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, depletion of water, and fossil resources. However, there was an increase in other impact categories, such as ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and marine eutrophication. The hotspots for E5 blend were the blending production and the combustion in the engine, whereas in the production process, the electricity production was the major contributor to most of the impact categories. When increasing the bioethanol content from E5 to E10 blend, the environmental impact increases in most of the evaluated categories except in the CC, WD, and FD categories. However, compared with other studies related to wood-based E10, the values for the environmental impacts obtained were lower than the reported. Conclusions: The use of E5 blend can help to reduce the environmental impact in 8 of the 12 categories analyzed. Environmental impacts obtained are lower compared with other studies reported for E10 blend production from wood resources. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Petroleum from unconventional reserves is making an increasingly important contribution to the transportation fuel supply, but is generally more expensive and has greater environmental burdens than petroleum from conventional sources. Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of alternative fuel-vehicle technologies typically consider conventional internal combustion engine vehicles fueled by gasoline produced from the average petroleum slate used in refineries as a baseline. Large-scale deployment of alternative fuel-vehicle technologies will decrease petroleum demand and lead to decreased production at the economic margin (unconventional oil), but this is not considered in most current LCAs. If marginal petroleum resources have larger impacts than average petroleum resources, the environmental benefits of petroleum demand reduction are underestimated by the current modeling approaches. Often, models include some consequential-based impacts (such as indirect land-use change for biofuels), but exclude others (such as avoided unconventional oil production). This approach is inconsistent and does not provide a robust basis for public policy and private investment strategy decisions. We provide an example to illustrate the potential scale of these impacts, but further research is needed to establish and quantify these marginal effects and incorporate them into LCAs of both conventional and alternative fuel-vehicle technologies. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Brazil is considered one of the world’s leading producers of biofuels given the predominance of ethanol fuel in its energy matrix. However, despite the prominence of Brazil in ethanol production, the vast majority of biodiesel production plants in Brazil use methanol instead of ethanol as the alcohol for transesterification reaction, as is generally the case in the rest of the world. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the transesterification process in the Brazilian biodiesel production in terms of sustainability. In this regard, it was necessary to evaluate the way in which the industrial process is currently carried out, the role of government incentives or subsidies for the use of ethanol to produce biodiesel, and the investments of companies in technology development for the same purpose. This study presents indications that the development of the biodiesel market in Brazil is still oriented toward a production model which is inconsistent with the environmental and social aspects of sustainability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has come to be seen as one of the most viable technologies to provide the negative carbon dioxide emissions needed to constrain global temperatures. In practice, algal biotechnology is the only form of BECCS that could be realized at scale without compromising food production. Current axenic algae cultivation systems lack robustness, are expensive and generally have marginal energy returns. Results: Here it is shown that microbial communities sampled from alkaline soda lakes, grown as biofilms at high pH (up to 10) and high alkalinity (up to 0.5 kmol m-3 NaHCO3 and NaCO3) display excellent (&gt;1.0 kg m-3 day-1) and robust (&gt;80 days) biomass productivity, at low projected overall costs. The most productive biofilms contained &gt;100 different species and were dominated by a cyanobacterium closely related to Phormidium kuetzingianum (&gt;60%). Conclusion: Frequent harvesting and red light were the key factors that governed the assembly of a stable and productive microbial community. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The reintegration of crop and livestock systems within the same land area has the potential to improve soil quality and reduce water and air pollution, while maintaining high yields and reducing risk. In this study, we characterize the degree to which federal policies in three major global food production regions that span a range of socioeconomic contexts, Brazil, New Zealand, and the United States, incentivize or disincentivize the use of integrated crop and livestock practices (ICLS). Our analysis indicates that Brazil and New Zealand have the most favorable policy environment for ICLS, while the United States provides the least favorable environment. The balance of policy incentives and disincentives across our three cases studies mirrors current patterns of ICLS usage. Brazil and New Zealand have both undergone a trend toward mixed crop livestock systems in recent years, while the United States has transitioned rapidly toward continuous crop and livestock production. If transitions to ICLS are desired, particularly in the United States, it will be necessary to change agricultural, trade, environmental, biofuels, and food safety policies that currently buffer farmers from risk, provide too few incentives for pollution reduction, and restrict the presence of animals in crop areas. It will also be necessary to invest more in research and development in all countries to identify the most profitable ICLS technologies in each region. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Cellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobic bacterium as a suitable host for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) has been proposed as an economically suited platform for the production of second-generation biofuels. To recognize the overall objective of CBP, fermentation using co-culture of different cellulolytic and sugar-fermenting thermophilic anaerobic bacteria has been widely studied as an approach to achieving improved ethanol production. We assessed monoculture and co-culture fermentation of novel thermophilic anaerobic bacterium for ethanol production from real substrates under controlled conditions. Results: In this study, Clostridium sp. DBT-IOC-C19, a cellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobic bacterium, was isolated from the cellulolytic enrichment cultures obtained from a Himalayan hot spring. Strain DBT-IOC-C19 exhibited a broad substrate spectrum and presented single-step conversion of various cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates to ethanol, acetate, and lactate with ethanol being the major fermentation product. Additionally, the effect of varying cellulose concentrations on the fermentation performance of the strain was studied, indicating a maximum cellulose utilization ability of 10 g L-1 cellulose. Avicel degradation kinetics of the strain DBT-IOC-C19 displayed 94.6% degradation at 5 g L-1 and 82.74% degradation at 10 g L-1 avicel concentration within 96 h of fermentation. In a comparative study with Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1313, the ethanol and total product concentrations were higher by the newly isolated strain on pretreated rice straw at an equivalent substrate loading. Three different co-culture combinations were used on various substrates that presented two-fold yield improvement than the monoculture during batch fermentation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the direct fermentation ability of the novel thermophilic anaerobic bacteria on various cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates into ethanol without the aid of any exogenous enzymes, representing CBP-based fermentation approach. Here, the broad substrate utilization spectrum of isolated cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobic bacterium was shown to be of potential utility. We demonstrated that the co-culture strategy involving novel strains is efficient in improving ethanol production from real substrate. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Although the United States has pursued rapid development of corn ethanol as a matter of national biofuel policy, relatively little is known about this policy's widespread impacts on agricultural land conversion surrounding ethanol refineries. This knowledge gap impedes policy makers' ability to identify and mitigate potentially negative environmental impacts of ethanol production. We assessed changes to the landscape during initial implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard v2 (RFS2) from 2008 to 2012 and found nearly 4.2 million acres of arable non-cropland converted to crops within 100 miles of refinery locations, including 3.6 million acres of converted grassland. Aggregated across all ethanol refineries, the rate of grassland conversion to cropland increased linearly with proximity to a refinery location. Despite this widespread conversion of the landscape, recent cropland expansion could have made only modest contributions to mandated increases in conventional biofuel capacity required by RFS2. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a shortcoming in the existing 'aggregate compliance' method for enforcing land protections in the RFS2 and suggest an alternative monitoring mechanism would be needed to appropriately capture the scale of observed land use changes. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Global warming, environmental issues, food crisis and energy security are the main concerning problems which have triggered a sense of urgency among policymakers and development practitioners to find sustainable and viable solutions in the area of bioenergy. Among various edible and non-edible bioenergy feedstocks specified for biodiesel production, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) and waste cooking oil (WCO) have been introduced to be promising and sustainable. In this study, an integrated hybrid approach based on a data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mathematical programming techniques is presented for the strategic design of biodiesel supply chain network in Iran. In the first phase, JCL cultivation areas are assessed according to climatic and social criteria by a unified DEA (UDEA) model. In the second phase, the locations which have achieved desired efficiency scores are considered as candidate locations for JCL cultivation within a mathematical programming model developed for designing the biodiesel supply chain network. The proposed mathematical programming model optimizes the numbers, locations and capacities of JCL cultivation centers, JCL seeds and WCO collection centers, bio-refineries, and distribution centers. The proposed approach is implemented in Iran for 10 years planning horizon. The results show the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed method in assisting the policymakers to take suitable strategic and tactical level decisions related to biodiesel supply chain planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Resistance to deconstruction is a major limitation to the use of lignocellulosic biomass as a substrate for the production of fuels and chemicals. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), the use of microbes for the simultaneous hydrolysis of lignocellulose into soluble sugars and fermentation of the resulting sugars to products of interest, is a potential solution to this obstacle. The pretreatment of plant biomass, however, releases compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of microbes used for CBP. Results: Heterologous expression of the Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E bdhA gene, that encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase, in Clostridium thermocellum significantly increased resistance to furan derivatives at concentrations found in acid-pretreated biomass. The mechanism of detoxification of hydroxymethylfurfural was shown to be primarily reduction using NADPH as the cofactor. In addition, we report the construction of new expression vectors for homologous and heterologous expression in C. thermocellum. These vectors use regulatory signals from both C. bescii (the S-layer promoter) and C. thermocellum (the enolase promoter) shown to efficiently drive expression of the BdhA enzyme. Conclusions: Toxic compounds present in lignocellulose hydrolysates that inhibit cell growth and product formation are obstacles to the commercialization of fuels and chemicals from biomass. Expression of genes that reduce the effect of these inhibitors, such as furan derivatives, will serve to enable commercial processes using plant biomass for the production of fuels and chemicals. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The spatio-temporal variation in black carbon (BC) mass concentration and total aerosol optical properties simulated from regional climate model RegCM Versions 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 are investigated and compared with in situ and remote sensing measurements. Higher BC mass concentrations (&gt;3 µg m−3) are found over the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) in all versions. BC mass in RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 are closer to observations. BC mass estimated from RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 is found to agree within 20% with respect to observation during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The differences in observed and simulated mass are &gt;50% during winter over all locations and during winter and post-monsoon over western India, which suggests the need of improvement in emission inventory over the region, as emissions from the biofuel and crop residue burning in agriculture are very low in the emission inventories. RegCM 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5-simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) are found to have more than 40% underestimation during winter and the post-monsoon over Kanpur, while 4.3 overestimates AOD during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons over Kanpur, and during all seasons except winter over Gandhi College. Single scattering albedo (SSA) values range from 0.75 to 0.95 in 4.4 and 4.5. Lower SSA values are found over the IGB where anthropogenic emissions dominate. SSA simulated by RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 are lowered by 2–10% with respect to aerosol robotic network (AERONET)-derived SSA. Moreover, during winter such differences are higher (&gt;10%). The RegCM 4.4 and 4.5-simulated BC mass concentrations are nearer to observations, while for columnar optical properties, RegCM 4.3 is more close to measurement. BC mass is 10–30% closer to observations when model for ozone and related chemical tracers-chemical transport model chemical boundary condition are utilized in addition to CAM + EC-EARTH. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society

AB  - Background: The introduction of renewable jet fuel (RJF) is considered an important emission mitigation measure for the aviation industry. This study compares the well-to-wake (WtWa) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performance of multiple RJF conversion pathways and explores the impact of different co-product allocation methods. The insights obtained in this study are of particular importance if RJF is included as an emission mitigation instrument in the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Results: Fischer-Tropsch pathways yield the highest GHG emission reduction compared to fossil jet fuel (86-104%) of the pathways in scope, followed by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (77-80%) and sugarcane- (71-75%) and corn stover-based Alcohol-to-Jet (60-75%). Feedstock cultivation, hydrogen and conversion inputs were shown to be major contributors to the overall WtWa GHG emission performance. The choice of allocation method mainly affects pathways yielding high shares of co-products or producing co-products which effectively displace carbon intensive products (e.g., electricity). Conclusions: Renewable jet fuel can contribute to significant reduction of aviation-related GHG emissions, provided the right feedstock and conversion technology are used. The GHG emission performance of RJF may be further improved by using sustainable hydrogen sources or applying carbon capture and storage. Based on the character and impact of different co-product allocation methods, we recommend using energy and economic allocation (for non-energy co-products) at a global level, as it leverages the universal character of energy allocation while adequately valuing non-energy co-products. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding which energy future configurations provide publicly acceptable levels of energy security, affordability, and environmental protection is critical for institutional decision-making. However, little is known about how scenarios influence energy preferences. Here we present nationally representative UK data on public preferences for energy futures using the my2050 scenario-building tool that encourages engagement with the holistic complexities of system change. Engagement with the tool strengthened existing preferences for renewable energy and intentions to take personal action. Importantly, patterns of energy preferences were influenced by exemplar scenarios, which served as reference points that anchored choices. Carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, biofuels, and changes to heating and travel were particularly impacted by scenarios indicating uncertainty and ambivalence regarding these options. Scenarios (and scenario-building tools) are valuable for engaging citizens about future energy systems. However, care is required in their design and interpretation to reach robust conclusions about underlying preferences and acceptance. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While much work has examined approaches to increase uptake of a variety of household environmental, health and energy technologies, researchers and policymakers alike have struggled to ensure long-term use. Drawing on a pilot-scale experiment conducted in rural Cambodia, this study evaluates whether economic incentives enhance continued use of - and fuel savings from - improved cookstoves (ICS). Capital-cost subsidies that have been traditionally employed to enhance ICS adoption were augmented with rebates linked to stated and objectively measured use in order to investigate impacts on both initial and sustained adoption in the treatment group. Results show that households do respond to these rebates by adopting the intervention ICS at significantly higher rates, and by using it more frequently and for longer periods. Consistent with these stove-use patterns, solid-fuel use and time spent collecting or preparing fuels also decline. However, this effect appears to diminish over time. Thus, while economic inducements may significantly increase adoption and use of new environmental health technologies, corresponding reductions in environmental or livelihood burdens are not guaranteed. Additional research on the design and implementation of incentive-based interventions targeting households directly - such as carbon financing or other forms of results-based financing (RBF) for improved cookstoves - therefore seems warranted prior to wider implementation of such solutions. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Ozone (O3) pollution is becoming increasingly severe in China. In addition, our limited understanding of the relationship between O3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is an obstacle to improving air quality. By developing an improved source-oriented speciated VOC emission inventory in 2013, we estimated the ozone formation potential (OFP) and investigated its characteristics in China. Besides, a comparison was made between our estimates and space-based observations from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Aura satellite. According to our estimates, m-/p-xylene, ethylene, formaldehyde, toluene, and propene were the five species that had the largest potential to form ozone, and on-road vehicles, industrial processes, biofuel combustion, and surface coating were the key contributing sectors. Among different regions of China, the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta had the highest OFP values. Our results suggest that O3 formation is VOC-limited in major urban areas of China. Additionally, considering the different photochemical reactivities of various VOC species and the disparate energy and industry structures in the different regions of China, more efficient OFP-based and localized VOC control measures should be implemented, instead of the current mass-based and nationally uniform policies.

AB  - The depletion of energy resources from fossil fuels and global warming have pushed to consider the agro-energy as one of the renewable energy sources for mitigation of climate change. In this context, agro-energy based on cultivation of energy crops in marginal lands allows to reduce competition with food crops and marginal lands abandonment, producing incomes for farmers. The aim of this work is to improve the knowledge on a promising crop (Arundo donax L.) for the production of bio-energy in marginal lands. Therefore, the behaviour of this crop was evaluated in three study areas of Campania region, under different energy inputs: two levels of nitrogen fertilisation, N100 and N50 in Sant’Angelo dei Lombardi (SA) and Bellizzi (BL). In Acerra (AC) site compost fertilisation was made to verify its effect on pollutant phytoextraction. In the last year, also crop growth analysis was done in the three sites. The results showed that giant reed confirms its adaptability to low fertility soils, allowing interesting biomass yield also in marginal lands. In more fertile environments, effect of fertilisation is not significant at least in the short term. Nevertheless, nitrogen uptake (65-130 kg N ha-1), also if lower than other highyielding crops, needs to be compensated with fertilisation to avoid depletion of soil nutrient reserves and to guarantee sustainability of this cropping system. Giant reed had a positive environmental impact, due to the improvement in soil fertility (soil organic matter and nitrogen increase) and to the mitigation of climate change (C storage in the soil). In marginal soils of Southern Italy this crop confirms an increasing trend of yield during the first 3-4 years. High productivity levels of this crop are related to the extremely high duration of the vegetative period and thus of the photosynthetic activity (from March to November in the Mediterranean area). These last are well expressed by the leaf area duration index, which is more than double than other high-yielding crops such as maize (280 vs 140 days). © A. Impagliazzo et al., 2017.

AB  - Background: Future sustainable energy production can be achieved using mass cultures of photoautotrophic microorganisms, which are engineered to synthesize valuable products directly from CO2 and sunlight. As cyanobacteria can be cultivated in large scale on non-arable land, these phototrophic bacteria have become attractive organisms for production of biofuels. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, one of the cyanobacterial model organisms, provides many attractive properties for biofuel production such as tolerance of seawater and high light intensities. Results: Here, we performed a systems analysis of an engineered ethanol-producing strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, which was grown in artificial seawater medium over 30 days applying a 12:12 h day-night cycle. Biosynthesis of ethanol resulted in a final accumulation of 0.25% (v/v) ethanol, including ethanol lost due to evaporation. The cultivation experiment revealed three production phases. The highest production rate was observed in the initial phase when cells were actively growing. In phase II growth of the producer strain stopped, but ethanol production rate was still high. Phase III was characterized by a decrease of both ethanol production and optical density of the culture. Metabolomics revealed that the carbon drain due to ethanol diffusion from the cell resulted in the expected reduction of pyruvate-based intermediates. Carbon-saving strategies successfully compensated the decrease of central intermediates of carbon metabolism during the first phase of fermentation. However, during long-term ethanol production the producer strain showed clear indications of intracellular carbon limitation. Despite the decreased levels of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, soluble sugars and even glycogen accumulated in the producer strain. The changes in carbon assimilation patterns are partly supported by proteome analysis, which detected decreased levels of many enzymes and also revealed the stress phenotype of ethanol-producing cells. Strategies towards improved ethanol production are discussed. Conclusions: Systems analysis of ethanol production in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 revealed initial compensation followed by increasing metabolic limitation due to excessive carbon drain from primary metabolism. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The production and use of fossil fuels have caused a drastic increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is associated directly with the global warming problem. Biofuels and carbon capture through forest plantations are interesting alternatives to address this problem. This paper presents an optimization model for the design of an integrated energy system for producing fuels and biofuels considering the interaction with eco-industries able to capture emissions from biorefineries and refineries and receive a monetary benefit. The proposed mathematical model takes into account the availability of biomass, the production of oil, and a set of existing biorefineries and refineries as well as the possibility to install new eco-industries. The mathematical approach was applied to a nationwide case study for Mexico, considering the creation of new jobs, overall emissions, and net profit as objectives. The results are shown in a Pareto curve, which is useful for making decisions about the interactions between these industries as well as determining the configuration of the supply chain to satisfy the fuel demands. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a viable thermochemical process for converting wet solid wastes into biocrude that can be hydroprocessed to liquid transportation fuel blendstocks and specialty chemicals. The aqueous byproduct from HTL contains significant amounts (20-50%) of the biogenic feed carbon, which must be valorized to enhance economic sustainability of the process on an industrial scale. In this study, aqueous fractions produced from HTL of food industry wastes, municipal wastes, and biomass cultivated on wastewater were characterized using a wide variety of analytical approaches. Organic species present in these aqueous fractions were identified using two-dimensional gas chromatography equipped with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Identified compounds include organic acids, nitrogen compounds, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. Conventional gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection and liquid chromatography utilizing refractive index detection were employed to quantify the identified compounds. Inorganic species in the aqueous streams were also were quantified using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The concentrations of organic compounds and inorganic species are reported, and the significance of these results are discussed in detail. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The convergence of diverse global factors–food price volatility, the increased demand for biofuels and feeds, climate change and the financialisation of commodity markets–has resulted in renewed interest in land resources, leading to a rapid expansion in the scope and scale of (trans)national acquisition of arable land across many developing countries. Much of this land is on peripheral indigenous peoples’ territories and considered a common property resource. Those most threatened are poor rural people with customary tenure systems–including indigenous ethnic minority groups, pastoralists and peasants–who need land most. In Ethiopia large areas have been leased to foreign and domestic capital for large-scale production of food and agrofuels, mainly in lowland regions where the state has historically had limited control. Much of the land offered is classified by the state and other elites as ‘unused’ or ‘underutilised’, overlooking the spatially extensive use of land in shifting cultivation and pastoralism. This threatens the land rights and livelihoods of ethnic minority indigenous communities in these lowlands. This article argues that recent large-scale land acquisitions are part of state strategy for enforcing political authority over territory and people. It examines the implications of such strategy for indigenous ethnic minority groups, focusing particularly on the Benishangul-Gumuz region. © 2016, © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The industrial production and use of nitrogenous fertilizer involves significant environmental and economic costs. Strategies to reduce fertilizer dependency are required to address the world’s increasing demand for sustainable food, fibers, and biofuels. Biological nitrogen fixation, a process unique to diazatrophic bacteria, is catalyzed by the nitrogenase complex, and reconstituting this function in plant cells is an ambitious biotechnological strategy to reduce fertilizer use. Here we establish that the full array of biosynthetic and catalytic nitrogenase (Nif) proteins fromthe diazotroph Klebsiella pneumoniae can be individually expressed as mitochondrial targeting peptide (MTP)-Nif fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana. We showthat these are correctly targeted to the plant mitochondrial matrix, a subcellular location with biochemical and genetic characteristics potentially supportive of nitrogenase function. Although Nif proteins B, D, E, F, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, and Z were all detectable by Western blot analysis, the NifD catalytic component was the least abundant. To address this problem, a translational fusion between NifD and NifK was designed based on the crystal structure of the nitrogenase MoFe protein heterodimer. This fusion protein enabled equimolar NifD:NifK stoichiometry and improved NifD expression levels in plants. Finally, four MTP-Nif fusion proteins (B, S, H, Y) were successfully co-expressed, demonstrating that multiple components of nitrogenase can be targeted to plant mitochondria. These results establish the feasibility of reconstituting the complete componentry for nitrogenase in plant cells, within an intracellular environment that could support the conversion of nitrogen gas into ammonia. © 2017 Allen, Tilbrook, Warden, Campbell, Rolland, Singh and Wood.

AB  - Xylan-degrading enzymes are crucial for the deconstruction of hemicellulosic biomass, making the hydrolysis products available for various industrial applications such as the production of biofuel. To determine the substrate specificities of these enzymes, we prepared a collection of complex xylan oligosaccharides by automated glycan assembly. Seven differentially protected building blocks provided the basis for the modular assembly of 2-substituted, 3-substituted, and 2-/3-substituted arabino- and glucuronoxylan oligosaccharides. Elongation of the xylan backbone relied on iterative additions of C4-fluorenylmethoxylcarbonyl (Fmoc) protected xylose building blocks to a linker-functionalized resin. Arabinofuranose and glucuronic acid residues have been selectively attached to the backbone using fully orthogonal 2-(methyl)naphthyl (Nap) and 2-(azidomethyl)benzoyl (Azmb) protecting groups at the C2 and C3 hydroxyls of the xylose building blocks. The arabinoxylan oligosaccharides are excellent tools to map the active site of glycosyl hydrolases involved in xylan deconstruction. The substrate specificities of several xylanases and arabinofuranosidases were determined by analyzing the digestion products after incubation of the oligosaccharides with glycosyl hydrolases. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - The development and utilization of crop straw biogas resources can effectively alleviate the shortage of energy, environmental pollution, and other issues. This study performed a continuous batch test at 35°C to assess the methane production potential and volatile organic acid contents using the modified Gompertz equation. Illumina MiSeq platform sequencing, which is a sequencing method based on sequencing-by-synthesis, was used to compare the archaeal community diversity, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to analyze the bacterial community diversity in rice straw, dry maize straw, silage maize straw, and tobacco straw. The results showed that cumulative gas production values for silage maize straw, rice straw, dry maize straw, and tobacco straw were 4,870, 4,032.5, 3,907.5, and 3,628.3 ml/g ·VS, respectively, after 24 days. Maximum daily gas production values of silage maize straw and rice straw were 1,025 and 904.17 ml/g ·VS, respectively, followed by tobacco straw and dry maize straw. The methane content of all four kinds of straws was > 60%, particularly that of silage maize straw, which peaked at 67.3%. Biogas production from the four kinds of straw was in the order silage maize straw > rice straw > dry maize straw > tobacco straw, and the values were 1,166.7, 1,048.4, 890, and 637.4 ml/g ·VS, respectively. The microbial community analysis showed that metabolism was mainly carried out by acetate-utilizing methanogens, and that Methanosarcina was the dominant archaeal genus in the four kinds of straw, and the DGGE bands belonged to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi. Silage maize is useful for biogas production because it contains four kinds of straw. © 2017 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The potential of bioreactor landfills to treat mechanically biologically treated municipal solid waste is analysed in this study. Developing countries like India and China have begun to investigate bioreactor landfills for municipal solid waste management. This article describes the impacts of leachate recirculation on waste stabilisation, landfill gas generation, leachate characteristics and long-term waste settlement. A small-scale and large-scale anaerobic cell were filled with mechanically biologically treated municipal solid waste collected from a landfill site at the outskirts of Bangalore, India. Leachate collected from the same landfill site was recirculated at the rate of 2-5 times a month on a regular basis for 370 days. The total quantity of gas generated was around 416 L in the large-scale reactor and 21 L in the small-scale reactor, respectively. Differential settlements ranging from 20%-26% were observed at two different locations in the large reactor, whereas 30% of settlement was observed in the small reactor. The biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio indicated that the waste in the large reactor was stabilised at the end of 1 year. The performance of the bioreactor with respect to the reactor size, temperature, landfill gas and leachate quality was analysed and it was found that the bioreactor landfill is efficient in the treatment and stabilising of mechanically biologically treated municipal solid waste. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Vegetables waste is generally utilized through a bioconversion process or disposed of at municipal landfills, dumping sites or dumped on open land, emitting a foul odor and causing health hazards. The presents study deals with an alternative way to utilize solid vegetable waste through a thermochemical route such as briquetting and gasification for its energy recovery and subsequent power generation. Briquettes of 50 mm diameter were produced from four different types of vegetable waste. The bulk density of briquettes produced was increased 10 to 15 times higher than the density of the dried vegetable waste in loose form. The lower heating value (LHV) of the briquettes ranged from 10.26 MJ kg '1 to 16.60 MJ kg '1 depending on the type of vegetable waste. The gasification of the briquettes was carried out in an open core downdraft gasifier, which resulted in syngas with a calorific value of 4.71 MJ Nm '3 at the gasification temperature between 889°C and 1011°C. A spark ignition, internal combustion engine was run on syngas and could generate a maximum load up to 10 kW e . The cold gas efficiency and the hot gas efficiency of the gasifier were measured at 74.11% and 79.87%, respectively. Energy recovery from the organic vegetable waste was possible through a thermochemical conversion route such as briquetting and subsequent gasification and recovery of the fuel for small-scale power generation. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Recent focus on climate change and global energy production has increased interest in developing biofuels including perennial native grasses (e.g. switchgrass [Panicum virgatum]) as viable energy commodities while simultaneously maintaining ecosystem function and biodiversity. However, there is limited research examining the effects of biofuel-focused grasslands on grassland bird reproductive success and conservation. In 2011–2013 we studied the effects of vegetation composition and harvest regimens of switchgrass monocultures and native warm-season grass (NWSG) mixtures on nest success, nest density, and productivity for dickcissels (Spiza americana) in Clay Co. MS, USA. There was no effect of vegetation metrics, harvest frequency, or biofuel treatment on nest survival. However, both vegetation composition and harvest frequencies influenced nest density and productivity. Native warm season grasses contained 54–64 times more nests relative to switchgrass treatments, and nest density and productivity were 10% greater in single harvest plots. Our results suggest semi-natural grasslands can balance biofuel production, ecosystem functionality, and conservation so that biofuels offer an opportunity for wildlife conservation rather than a continued threat to grassland birds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A synthesis of work on integrating short-rotation biomass plantings into existing mixed crop and livestock farming regimes with the biomass being converted to biofuels, including aviation fuel, is provided. This agroforestry system, based on mallee eucalypt species native to Australia, provides broader environmental benefits, including biodiversity protection. These species are suited to the edaphic and climatic conditions of rainfed farming systems in southern Australia. The study focused on the Great Southern region of Western Australia, with an average annual rainfall of 400–600 mm. Compared to other locations in Australia, significantly more research and development has been conducted in this region, with a mallee biomass-to-jet fuel business case and farmer cooperation providing reliable data for assessing the viability and sustainability of commercial supply chain development. The limited capacity of Australian agricultural systems to produce biomass due to the relatively dry climate means that the available biomass resources should be directed to strategically important energy uses such as aviation fuel. Technical, economic, and environmental insights gained from these long-term studies have demonstrated that it is feasible to integrate this new production system into the overall farming enterprise and indicate strong prospects for a biomass industry in this region should political and economic uncertainties currently facing the renewable energy industry in Australia be resolved.

AB  - We implemented a spatial application of a previously evaluated model of soil GHG emissions, ECOSSE, in the United Kingdom to examine the impacts to 2050 of land-use transitions from existing land use, rotational cropland, permanent grassland or woodland, to six bioenergy crops; three ‘first-generation’ energy crops: oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet, and three ‘second-generation’ energy crops: Miscanthus, short rotation coppice willow (SRC) and short rotation forestry poplar (SRF). Conversion of rotational crops to Miscanthus, SRC and SRF and conversion of permanent grass to SRF show beneficial changes in soil GHG balance over a significant area. Conversion of permanent grass to Miscanthus, permanent grass to SRF and forest to SRF shows detrimental changes in soil GHG balance over a significant area. Conversion of permanent grass to wheat, oilseed rape, sugar beet and SRC and all conversions from forest show large detrimental changes in soil GHG balance over most of the United Kingdom, largely due to moving from uncultivated soil to regular cultivation. Differences in net GHG emissions between climate scenarios to 2050 were not significant. Overall, SRF offers the greatest beneficial impact on soil GHG balance. These results provide one criterion for selection of bioenergy crops and do not consider GHG emission increases/decreases resulting from displaced food production, bio-physical factors (e.g. the energy density of the crop) and socio-economic factors (e.g. expenditure on harvesting equipment). Given that the soil GHG balance is dominated by change in soil organic carbon (SOC) with the difference among Miscanthus, SRC and SRF largely determined by yield, a target for management of perennial energy crops is to achieve the best possible yield using the most appropriate energy crop and cultivar for the local situation. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The recalcitrance of lignocellulose forms a strong barrier for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass in chemical or biofuel industries. Filamentous fungi are major plant biomass decomposer, and capable of forming all the required enzymes. Here, they characterized the GH10 and GH11 endo-xylanases and a CE1 acetyl-xylan esterase (Axe1) from a superior biomass-degrading strain, Aspergillus fumigatus Z5, and examined how they interact in xylan degradation. Cellulose-binding (CBM1) domain inhibited GH10 xylanase activities for pure xylan, but afforded them an ability to hydrolyze washed corncob particles (WCCP). CBM1-containing GH10 xylanases also showed synergism with CBM1-containing Axe1 in WCCP hydrolysis, and this synergy was strictly dependent on the presence of their CBM1 domains. In contrast, GH11 xylanases had no CBM1, but still could bind xylan and hydrolyzed WCCP; however, no synergism displayed with Axe1. GH10 xylanases and GH11 xylanases showed a pronounced synergism in WCCP hydrolysis, which was dependent on the presence of the CBM1 in GH10 xylanases and absence from GH11 xylanases. They exhibit different mechanisms to bind to cellulose and xylan, and act in synergy when these two structures are intact. These findings will be helpful for the further development of highly efficient enzyme mixtures for lignocellulosic biomass conversion. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - If the US mandates for the use of cellulosic biofuels are ultimately enforced, cellulosic feedstock will be demanded. Native switchgrass is a cellulosic feedstock that has been of substantial interest for this purpose because it is widely grown across the USA, it can be grown on marginal cropland and thus compete minimally with food supplies, it has a low carbon footprint, and in many ways, it is a sustainable source of energy. The purpose of the research reported here is to quantify the potential willingness of producers across 358 counties in a 10-state area in North Central USA to produce this biomass. We conducted a contingent valuation survey of randomly selected farm operators in this area. From the more than 1100 responses, we found that the mean reservation price at which respondents were willing to supply switchgrass from their least productive field is a return of about $228 per acre, which translates to about $82 per dry ton. Respondents were somewhat less willing to lease out their land for this purpose, requiring an additional $3.50 per dry ton to be willing to lease. In sub-regions of counties grouped by opportunity cost, mean reservation prices are equivalent to $75 per ton, $82 per ton, and $99 per ton, very close in the first two subregions to the Department of Energy goal of $84 per dry ton delivered to the biorefinery. Thus, prospects appear favorable that substantial fractions of farmers would be willing to supply switchgrass in this area, particularly in the sub-areas with lower land costs. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Concern is rising that ecologically important, carbon-rich natural lands in the United States are losing ground to agriculture. We investigate how quantitative assessments of historical land-use change (LUC) to address this concern differ in their conclusions depending on the data set used through an examination of LUC between 2006 and 2014 in 20 counties in the Prairie Pothole Region using the Cropland Data Layer, a modified Cropland Data Layer dataset, data from the National Agricultural Imagery Program, and in-person ground-truthing. The Cropland Data Layer analyses overwhelmingly returned the largest amount of LUC with associated error that limits drawing conclusions from it. Analysis with visual imagery estimated a fraction of this LUC. Clearly, analysis technique drives understanding of the measured extent of LUC; different techniques produce vastly different results that would inform land management policy in strikingly different ways. Best practice guidelines are needed. © 2017 The Authors. Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining published by Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Global rice production will be increasingly challenged by providing healthy food for a growing population at minimal environmental cost. In this study, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of a novel rice cultivation mode (screenhouse cultivation, SHC) and organic material (OM) incorporation (wheat straw and wheat straw-based biogas residue) on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and rice yields. In addition, the environmental factors and soil properties were also determined. Relative to the traditional open-field cultivation (OFC), SHC decreased the CH4 and N2O emissions by 6.58–18.73 and 2.51–21.35%, respectively, and the global warming potential (GWP) was reduced by 6.49–18.65%. This trend was mainly because of lower soil temperature and higher soil redox potential in SHC. Although the rice grain yield for SHC were reduced by 2.51–4.98% compared to the OFC, the CH4 emissions and GWP per unit of grain yield (yield-scaled CH4 emissions and GWP) under SHC were declined. Compared to use of inorganic fertilizer only (IN), combining inorganic fertilizer with wheat straw (WS) or wheat straw-based biogas residue (BR) improved rice grain yield by 2.12–4.10 and 4.68–5.89%, respectively. However, OM incorporation enhanced CH4 emissions and GWP, leading to higher yield-scaled CH4 emissions and GWP in WS treatment. Due to rice yield that is relatively high, there was no obvious effect of BR treatment on them. These findings suggest that apparent environmental benefit can be realized by applying SHC and fermenting straw aerobically before its incorporation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This article aims to present the shear strength of soil-geosynthetic interface through laboratory tests. Shear strength of a soil-geosynthetic interface is defined as the primary parameter of slope stability in cases where the potential slip surface runs along a geosynthetic. Besides, palm biodiesel contamination can affect the geotechnical properties of foundation soils. In this study, interface interaction between soil and various geosynthetics, namely A, B, and C was investigated in term of shear strength parameters. The type of palm oil used for contaminating is B20 palm biodiesel ranging from 3% to 10% by the weight of dry sand. The objective of this research is to assess the shear strength parameters at the soil-geosynthetic interface. For this purpose, test specimens of both clean and contaminated sample with different geosynthetics were tested under direct shear test in order to evaluate their shear strength. Results were analyzed based on the behavior of three different geosynthetics as reinforcements and contaminated mining sand. The results of direct shear tests indicate that shear strength varies considerably along the soil-geosynthetic interface. It was found that the shear strength of reinforced sand with geosynthetic C was increased by almost 1.3 times as compared to that of the unreinforced test specimen. A notable discovery is that the reinforced sand with geosynthetic C could improve the shear strength of the soil sample to protect the slopes, particularly shallow foundations on mining sand. However, further laboratory and field investigations are recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.), a common winter annual weed species in North America, has received attention in recent years as a potential oilseed feedstock for biofuel production but little is known about best practices for its production as a managed crop. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine optimum sowing date to maximize pennycress yield, oil content, and crude protein. Four field experiments with 10 unique sowing and harvest dates over 3 crop years were conducted in Morris, MN, USA. Pennycress was no-till seeded from late August to late October at a rate of 6.7 kg ha−1. Seed yield averaged between 99 and 1109 kg ha−1 when sown in late October and early September, respectively, while oil content for the same sowing period averaged between 26.8 and 36.3%, respectively. Yield was not related to in-season environmental variables, such as cumulative precipitation, soil temperature at planting, or accumulated photohydrothermal time. However, oil content was maximized under greater precipitation (r2 = 0.86), warmer soil temperatures (r2 = 0.62) and greater photohydrothermal time when modeled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 25, 50 and 100 cm soil depths (between r2 = 0.53 to r2 = 0.85). Results indicate that environment conditions favoring a long maturation period increased oil accumulation in seeds. Conversely, a longer growth period reduced seed crude protein. Although pennycress protein is expected to have industrial uses, managing for yield and oil content is preferred. Therefore sowing pennycress in late August through September in the northern Corn Belt will maximize yields and oil content. © 2016

AB  - While the production of biofuels holds potential to contribute to energy security, concerns on food prices, land use, and carbon emissions have arisen from increased production of first-generation bioethanol. While second-generation bioethanol from lignocellulosic agricultural waste faces difficult-to-overcome technological barriers, renewed promise is held in microalgae biomass as an alternative feedstock. In this work we show the results of bioprospecting for microalgae native of South America for accumulation of carbohydrates under conditions of nitrogen deficiency, and constant light and temperature. After a preliminary analysis of seventeen strains, we selected strain SP2-3, because its biomass could be enriched in carbohydrates over 70% (w/w) on a dry biomass basis, and Desmodesmus sp. strain FG for its fermentable sugars productivity. After optimization of microalgae culture conditions, biomass hydrolysis and fermentation with baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrated ethanol yields of up to 0.24 g ethanol·g of biomass− 1, and an ethanol concentration in the fermentation broth of 24 g ethanol·L of fermentation broth− 1, for up to 87.4% of the maximum theoretical value. These results contribute to support the potential of microalgae biomass as an alternative feedstock for bioethanol and the value of bioprospecting programs to identified candidate strains among natural biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) have become a common tool for measuring the environmental performance of various products and processes. This study reviewed the life cycle of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock-based (pine, eucalyptus, and switchgrass) ethanol biofuels and compared the results to gasoline. Uncertainty analysis of the cradle-to-wheel results was conducted using a pedigree matrix method to address uncertainty of life cycle inventory items. A tool called stochastic multi-attribute analysis for life cycle impact assessment (SMAA-LCIA) was used to interpret the results generated from the LCA. The normalized results showed that gasoline had high environmental impacts in categories such as carcinogenics and global warming, followed by switchgrass. But the use of a single-score metric indicated that all bio-based feedstocks had similar environmental performance, all significantly better than gasoline. The SMAA-LCIA results showed that when all impacts were weighted equally, the preference from highest to lowest was for loblolly pine, eucalyptus, gasoline, and switchgrass. This rank order switched when differing weighting schemes of Producer, User, and LCA Expert were used. Overall, this method highlights the trade-offs associated with the selection of different feedstocks and improves the comparison of overall results amongst fuel sources, which can then be more clearly presented to a decision-maker. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Miscanthus spp. are promising lignocellulosic energy crops, but cell wall recalcitrance to deconstruction still hinders their widespread use as bioenergy and biomaterial feedstocks. Identification of cell wall characteristics desirable for biorefining applications is crucial for lignocellulosic biomass improvement. However, the task of scoring biomass quality is often complicated by the lack of a reference for a given feedstock. A multidimensional cell wall analysis was performed to generate a reference profile for leaf and stem biomass from several miscanthus genotypes harvested at three developmentally distinct time points. A comprehensive suite of 155 monoclonal antibodies was used to monitor changes in distribution, structure and extractability of noncellulosic cell wall matrix glycans. Glycan microarrays complemented with immunohistochemistry elucidated the nature of compositional variation, and in situ distribution of carbohydrate epitopes. Key observations demonstrated that there are crucial differences in miscanthus cell wall glycomes, which may impact biomass amenability to deconstruction. For the first time, variations in miscanthus cell wall glycan components were comprehensively characterized across different harvests, organs and genotypes, to generate a representative reference profile for miscanthus cell wall biomass. Ultimately, this portrait of the miscanthus cell wall will help to steer breeding and genetic engineering strategies for the development of superior energy crops. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural land and urban areas plays a threat to the protected areas and the natural ecosystems conservation. The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of the agricultural expansion and its impact on the landscape spatial and temporal patterns in a buffer zone of a protected area located in the transition zone between the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The land use and land cover were mapped between 1971 and 2008 and landscape metrics were calculated to provide a spatiotemporal analysis of the forest structure and the expansion of the croplands. The results showed that the landscape patterns were affected by the economic cycles. The predominant crop surrounding the protected area is sugar cane, which increased by 39% during this period, followed by citrus. This landscape change is connected to the Brazilian oil crisis in 1973. The rapid expansion of sugar cane was largely driven by Brazil's biofuel program, the “Proálcool” (pro-alcohol), a project in 1975 that mixed ethanol with gas for automotive fuel. The forest loss occurred mainly between 1971 and 1988, decreasing the forest cover from 17% in 1971 to 12.7% in 2008. Most of the forest patches are smaller than 50 ha and has low connectivity. Throughout the years, the fragments in the buffer zone have become smaller and with an elongated shape, and the park has become isolated. This forest fragmentation process and the predominance of monoculture lands in the buffer zone threaten the protected areas, and can represent a barrier for these areas to provide the effective biodiversity conservation. The measures proposed are necessary to ensure the capability of this ecosystem to sustain its original biodiversity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cropping practices of Miscanthus × giganteus, a promising energy crop, can influence C and N cycles and therefore potentially affect N2O emissions. They may vary in harvesting date, either early (EH) or late harvest (LH), and the fertiliser form (NH4 or NO3). In this study, we combined a long-term field experiment and simulations with the STICS model to investigate the effect of these practices on soil parameters, N2O emissions and the contribution of nitrification and denitrification. Daily N2O fluxes and soil parameters were measured during the 4-month period following fertilisation in 2014 and 2015. Mean cumulative N2O emissions were markedly higher in LH than EH (4.21 vs. 0.89 kg N2O–N ha−1 year−1) but did not differ significantly between fertiliser forms or years. The difference was mainly attributed to the higher soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) observed in LH (80 vs. 56 % in EH) which resulted itself from the leaf mulch present in LH and not in EH. WFPS explained 67 % of the variance of N2O emissions. The large decrease in pH observed after NH4 fertilisation stimulated N2O emissions probably through less-efficient reduction of N2O to N2 as simulated by STICS. Model outputs suggest a large contribution of nitrification in EH and a dominant contribution of denitrification in LH. Our study highlights the crucial impact of management practises on N2O emissions in Miscanthus crops through changes in physico-chemical parameters and soil processes on the short and long term and brings knowledge required to maximise the benefits of bioenergy crops. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study conducts a life cycle assessment of a simulated dry mill corn ethanol facility in California’s Central Valley retrofitted to also produce ethanol from corn stover, a cellulosic feedstock. The assessment examines three facility designs, all producing corn ethanol and wet distiller’s grains and solubles as a co-product: a baseline facility with no cellulosic retrofit, a facility retrofitted with a small capacity for stover feedstock, and a facility retrofitted for a large capacity of stover feedstock. Corn grain is supplied by rail from the Midwest, while stover is sourced from in-state farms and delivered by truck. Two stover feedstock supply scenarios are considered, testing harvest rates at 25 or 40 % of stover mass. Allocation is required to separate impacts attributable to co-products. Additional scenarios are explored to assess the effect of co-product allocation methods on life cycle assessment results for the two fuel products, corn ethanol and stover ethanol. The assessment tracks greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, criteria air pollutants, and direct water consumption. The GHG intensity of corn ethanol produced from the three facility designs range between 61.3 and 68.9 g CO2e/MJ, which includes 19.8 g CO2e/MJ from indirect land use change for Midwestern corn grain. The GHG intensity of cellulosic ethanol varies from 44.1 to 109.2 g CO2e/MJ, and 14.6 to 32.1 g CO2e/MJ in the low and high stover capacity cases, respectively. Total energy input ranges between 0.60 and 0.71 MJ/MJ for corn ethanol and 0.13 to 2.29 MJ/MJ for stover ethanol. This variability is the result of the stover supply scenarios (a function of harvest rate) and co-product allocation decisions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The handling of multi-output systems presents a crucial aspect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission calculation as well as the certification of biofuels, and finding a robust and applicable method that accounts for distinctive characteristics of and benefits generated by all products is a challenge. In this work, GHG emission savings of 11 biofuel production concepts are assessed and the implications of methodological assumptions are discussed by applying the methodology defined by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), allocation based on physical parameters, two hybrid approaches, as well as six variants of substitution. GHG emission savings according to RED methodology range from 35 to 57 %. Sugar beet-based ethanol shows highest savings. Results reveal that GHG savings according to the RED methodology present, in sum, a relatively good approximation of emission savings occurring due to substitution effects under given assumptions. An introduction of credits for products that are barely or not considered by the RED methodology due to allocation based on the lower heating value (LHV), i.e. fertilizers and wet feed co-products, reduces the difference between RED results and results based on substitution. If displacement mechanisms are considered by substitution, sugar beet-based ethanol, ethanol production by wet milling of wheat and sunflower biodiesel result in highest emission savings under given assumptions if oil that needs to be supplied due to occurring displacement mechanisms stems from rapeseed. The implementation of a method that supports concepts with high emission saving potential, e.g. allocation based the lower heating value of dry material, could promote emission reductions from biofuel provision. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The carbon (C) dynamics of a bioenergy system are key to correctly defining its viability as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuel energy sources. Recent studies have quantified the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of these bioenergy crops, often concluding that C sequestration in soils plays a primary role in offsetting emissions through energy generation. Miscanthus is a particularly promising bioenergy crop and research has shown that soil C stocks can increase by more than 2 t C ha−1 yr−1. In this study, we use a stable isotope (13C) technique to trace the inputs and outputs from soils below a commercial Miscanthus plantation in Lincolnshire, UK, over the first 7 years of growth after conversion from a conventional arable crop. Results suggest that an unchanging total topsoil (0–30 cm) C stock is caused by Miscanthus additions displacing older soil organic matter. Further, using a comparison between bare soil plots (no new Miscanthus inputs) and undisturbed Miscanthus controls, soil respiration was seen to be unaffected through priming by fresh inputs or rhizosphere. The temperature sensitivity of old soil C was also seen to be very similar with and without the presence of live root biomass. Total soil respiration from control plots was dominated by Miscanthus-derived emissions with autotrophic respiration alone accounting for ∼50 % of CO2. Although total soil C stocks did not change significantly over time, the Miscanthus-derived soil C accumulated at a rate of 860 kg C ha−1 yr−1 over the top 30 cm. Ultimately, the results from this study indicate that soil C stocks below Miscanthus plantations do not necessarily increase during the first 7 years. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Current quantification of climate warming mitigation potential (CWMP) of biomass-derived energy has focused primarily on its biogeochemical effects. This study used site-level observations of carbon, water, and energy fluxes of biofuel crops to parameterize and evaluate the community land model (CLM) and estimate CO2 fluxes, surface energy balance, soil carbon dynamics of corn (Zea mays), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) ecosystems across the conterminous United States considering different agricultural management practices and land-use scenarios. We find that neglecting biophysical effects underestimates the CWMP of transitioning from croplands and marginal lands to energy crops. Biogeochemical effects alone result in changes in carbon storage of −1.9, 49.1, and 69.3 g C m−2 y−1 compared to 20.5, 78.5, and 96.2 g C m−2 y−1 when considering both biophysical and biogeochemical effects for corn, switchgrass, and miscanthus, respectively. The biophysical contribution to CWMP is dominated by changes in latent heat fluxes. Using the model to optimize growth conditions through fertilization and irrigation increases the CWMP further to 79.6, 98.3, and 118.8 g C m−2 y−1, respectively, representing the upper threshold for CWMP. Results also show that the CWMP over marginal lands is lower than that over croplands. This study highlights that neglecting the biophysical effects of altered surface energy and water balance underestimates the CWMP of transitioning to bioenergy crops at regional scales. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding the complex interactions among food security, bioenergy sustainability, and resource management requires a focus on specific contextual problems and opportunities. The United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals place a high priority on food and energy security; bioenergy plays an important role in achieving both goals. Effective food security programs begin by clearly defining the problem and asking, ‘What can be done to assist people at high risk?’ Simplistic global analyses, headlines, and cartoons that blame biofuels for food insecurity may reflect good intentions but mislead the public and policymakers because they obscure the main drivers of local food insecurity and ignore opportunities for bioenergy to contribute to solutions. Applying sustainability guidelines to bioenergy will help achieve near- and long-term goals to eradicate hunger. Priorities for achieving successful synergies between bioenergy and food security include the following: (1) clarifying communications with clear and consistent terms, (2) recognizing that food and bioenergy need not compete for land and, instead, should be integrated to improve resource management, (3) investing in technology, rural extension, and innovations to build capacity and infrastructure, (4) promoting stable prices that incentivize local production, (5) adopting flex crops that can provide food along with other products and services to society, and (6) engaging stakeholders to identify and assess specific opportunities for biofuels to improve food security. Systematic monitoring and analysis to support adaptive management and continual improvement are essential elements to build synergies and help society equitably meet growing demands for both food and energy. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Jatropha spp. from Mexico includes high species richness and endemism; five species inhabit in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve (TCBR), and they are important resources as food, medicine and biofuel. The assessment of morphological and agronomic characteristics is essential to identify, use and maintain plant genetic resources. Given the lack of information on the morphological variability of Jatropha species in relation to environment, the objective was to analyze the influence of physiographic, climatic, and anthropogenic factors in the morphological variability of the species: Jatrophaneopauciflora and J. rzedowskii, both not-endangered; J. oaxacana, special protection; J. ciliata and J. rufescens, both endangered in the Reserve. Twelve quantitative morphological variables were measured in 24 populations of these species; 14 environmental variables were registered, and the disturbance index in the sites was estimated. The information was analyzed with Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Cluster Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). PCA detected interspecific variation: J. ciliata and J. rufescens have longer and broader leaves and longer flowers, while the other three species have smaller leaves and flowers. J. oaxacana population has intermediate size of leaves, fruits and seeds, compared with those of J. neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii. CCA detected intra-specific variation among the populations of J. neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii, which were separated in two groups due to fruit and seed size. Axis 1 of CCA correlated positively with altitude and annual temperature range, and negatively with mean annual temperature; at the intra-specific level, both species are adapted to variations of temperature and altitude. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Sewage sludge liquefaction bio-oil is capturing extensive attention for its sustainability and easy availability. However, some limitations of bio-oil such as high viscosity and poor cold flow properties hamper its direct application in engines. Two microemulsions including ethanol-in-diesel (M1) and diesel microemulsion (M2) were produced to upgrade bio-oil. Adding ethanol in M1 facilitated bio-oil solubilization and improved fuel properties of bio-oil. Because of low viscosity and low pour point of ethanol, M1 with ethanol as polar phase produced a more promising biofuel with acceptable viscosity and better cold flow properties compared with M2. Through microemulsification in diesel, hydrophilic and hydrophobic bio-oil components may penetrate into the polar core and the continuous phase, respectively, while amphiphilic components mainly located at the interface. The hydrogen bonding between ethanol and hydrophilic bio-oil components could enhance solubility and improve stability. Besides, polar phase ethanol could also act as a solvent to dissolve more less-hydrophilic bio-oil components into the polar core. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Many coal beds contain microbial communities that can convert coal to natural gas (coalbed methane). Native microorganisms were obtained from Powder River Basin (PRB) coal seams with a diffusive microbial sampler placed downhole and used as an inoculum for enrichments with different nutrients to investigate microbially-enhanced coalbed methane production (MECoM). Coal-dependent methanogenesis more than doubled when yeast extract (YE) and several less complex components (proteins and amino acids) were added to the laboratory microcosms. Stimulated coal-dependent methanogenesis with peptone was 86% of that with YE while glutamate-stimulated activity was 65% of that with YE, and a vitamin mix had only 33% of the YE stimulated activity. For field application of MECoM, there is interest in identifying cost-effective alternatives to YE and other expensive nutrients. In laboratory studies, adding algal extract (AE) with lipids removed stimulated coal-dependent methanogenesis and the activity was 60% of that with YE at 27 d and almost 90% of YE activity at 1406 d. Analysis of British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of coal (a measure of potential energy yield) from long-term incubations indicated &gt; 99.5% of BTU content remained after coalbed methane (CBM) stimulation with either AE or YE. Thus, the coal resource remains largely unchanged following stimulated microbial methane production. Algal CBM stimulation could lead to technologies that utilize coupled biological systems (photosynthesis and methane production) that sustainably enhance CBM production and generate algal biofuels while also sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). © 2017

AB  - Short rotation woody crop (SRWC) systems continue to be investigated as energy crops for a range of energy products including liquid biofuels and electricity. To understand their market potential and economic viability, regional biomass yield and production estimates are used as primary inputs. Biomass is generally estimated using growth models which often utilize gridded weather datasets when implemented for regional simulations. With such models, the accuracy of weather data will affect the uncertainty of estimated biomass and subsequent bioenergy analyses. This study evaluates the biases in weather variables of commonly used high resolution gridded datasets including PRISM, Daymet, NARR, and NLDAS in comparison with observed weather at five flux tower stations. Further, impacts of inaccuracies in gridded data sources on biomass estimates of SRWC hybrid poplar was investigated at site and regional levels using a version of the 3-PG growth model modified to model production with multiple harvests through coppicing or periodic cutting of the trees with regrowth from the tree stump. Results suggest that weather variables in all gridded datasets are characterized by some degree of bias leading to considerable bias in biomass estimates, in some cases up to 45%. PRISM and Daymet were shown to have lower uncertainty in most of the weather variables, likely due to their higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on station weather. Site level simulations indicate that relative to the reference biomass estimates based on actual weather measurements, NARR data yielded 4.1 Mg ha−1 y−1 higher biomass while NLDAS, Daymet, and PRISM resulted in 3.3, 1.2 and 0.3 Mg ha−1 y−1 lower biomass. Regional simulations suggest that total biomass varied substantially with gridded data sources ranging between 47.4 and 58.3 Tg on the croplands and rangelands in the region (Columbia Plateau), which subsequently led up to 23% variation in the estimate of poplar based jet fuel production from the SRWC resource. Therefore, findings of this study reinforce the need to account for uncertainties in biomass estimates introduced by biases in gridded weather when modeling bioenergy production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Miscanthus is a woody rhizomatous C4 grass that can be used as a CO2 neutral biofuel resource. It has potential to grow in marginal areas such as saline soils, avoiding competition for arable lands with food crops. This study explored genetic diversity for salt tolerance in Miscanthus and discovered mechanisms and traits that can be used to improve the yield under salt stress. Seventy genotypes of Miscanthus (including 57 M. sinensis, 5 M. sacchariflorus, and 8 hybrids) were evaluated for salt tolerance under saline (150 mM NaCl) and normal growing conditions using a hydroponic system. Analyses of shoot growth traits and ion concentrations revealed the existence of large variation for salt tolerance in the genotypes. We identified genotypes with potential for high biomass production both under control and saline conditions that may be utilized for growth under marginal, saline conditions. Several relatively salt tolerant genotypes had clearly lower Na+ concentrations and showed relatively high K+/Na+ ratios in the shoots under salt stress, indicating that a Na+ exclusion mechanismwas utilized to prevent Na+ accumulation in the leaves. Other genotypes showed limited reduction in leaf expansion and growth rate under saline conditions, which may be indicative of osmotic stress tolerance. The genotypes demonstrating potentially different salt tolerance mechanisms can serve as starting material for breeding programs aimed at improving salinity tolerance of Miscanthus. © 2017 Chen, van der Schoot, Dehghan, Alvim Kamei, Schwarz, Meyer, visser and van der linden.

AB  - One of the grand challenges facing our society today is finding solutions for feeding the world sustainably. The food-versus-fuel debate is a controversy embedded in this challenge, involving the trade-offs of using grains and oilseeds for biofuels production versus animal feed and human food. However, only 6% of total global grain produced is used to produce ethanol. Furthermore, biofuels coproducts contribute to sustainability of food production because only 1% to 2.5% of the overall energy efficiency is lost from converting crops into biofuels and animal feed, and approximately one-third of the corn used to produce ethanol is recovered as feed coproducts. Extensive research has been conducted over the past 15 years on biofuels coproducts to (a) optimize their use for improving caloric and nutritional efficiency in animal feeds, (b) identify benefits and limitations of use in various animal diets, (c) characterize their unique nutraceutical properties, and (d) evaluate their environmental impacts.

AB  - Commodity crop expansion has increased with the globalization of production systems and consumer demand, linking distant socio-ecological systems. Oil palm plantations are expanding in the tropics to satisfy growing oilseed and biofuel markets, and much of this expansion has caused extensive deforestation, especially in Asia. In Latin America, palm oil output has doubled since 2001, and the majority of expansion seems to be occurring on non-forested lands. We used MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution) to map current oil palm plantations in Latin America and determined prior land use and land cover (LULC) using high-resolution images in Google Earth. In addition, we compiled trade data to determine where Latin American palm oil flows, in order to better understand the underlying drivers of expansion in the region. Based on a sample of 342 032 ha of oil palm plantations across Latin America, we found that 79% replaced previously intervened lands (e.g. pastures, croplands, bananas), primarily cattle pastures (56%). The remaining 21% came from areas that were classified as woody vegetation (e.g. forests), most notably in the Amazon and the Petén region in northern Guatemala. Latin America is a net exporter of palm oil but the majority of palm oil exports (70%) stayed within the region, with Mexico importing about half. Growth of the oil palm sector may be driven by global factors, but environmental and economic outcomes vary between regions (i.e. Asia and Latin America), within regions (i.e. Colombia and Peru), and within single countries (i.e. Guatemala), suggesting that local conditions are influential. The present trend of oil palm expanding onto previously cleared lands, guided by roundtable certifications programs, provides an opportunity for more sustainable development of the oil palm sector in Latin America. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This work is aimed to evaluate the applicability of solid portion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) for its utility as a renewable biofuel. A solar still unit was used to separate the solid residual from the liquid part of OMW. Three triplicate samples of solid residue were collected and tested for their calorific value, proximate analysis, and elemental analysis. The average calorific values obtained based on oxygen bomb calorimeter were 24 ± 0.65 kJ/g which agreed well with that obtained from elemental analysis (23 ± 1.3 kJ/g). This value is higher than that of refuse-derived fuel and lower than that of oil or natural gas but close to that of coal. Results of proximate analysis indicate a high combustible portion (83%) of OMW-Biofuel. The total amount of energy that can be produced from OMW-Biofuel in Jordan, expressed in terms of oil equivalent, accounts for <1.0% of the total imported oil by Jordan in 2014 and, if utilized, would result in annual savings of about US$ 17 million. These results suggest that the OMW-Biofuel can be applicable as a potential fuel. © 2016, Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - With its high seed oil content, the mustard family plant Camelina sativa has gained attention as a potential biofuel source. As a bioenergy crop, camelina has many advantages. It grows on marginal land with low demand for water and fertilizer, has a relatively short life cycle, and is stress tolerant. As most other crop seed oils, camelina seed triacylglycerols (TAGs) consist of mostly long, unsaturated fatty acyl moieties, which is not desirable for biofuel processing. In our efforts to produce shorter, saturated chain fatty acyl moieties in camelina seed oil for conversion to jet fuel, a 12:0-acyl-carrier thioesterase gene, UcFATB1, from California bay (Umbellularia californica Nutt.) was expressed in camelina seeds. Up to 40% of short chain laurate (C12:0) and myristate (C14:0) were present in TAGs of the seed oil of the transgenics. The total oil content and germination rate of the transgenic seeds were not affected. Analysis of positions of these two fatty acyl moieties in TAGs indicated that they were present at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions, but not sn-2, on the TAGs. Suppression of the camelina KASII genes by RNAi constructs led to higher accumulation of palmitate (C16:0), from 7.5% up to 28.5%, and further reduction of longer, unsaturated fatty acids in seed TAGs. Co-transformation of camelina with both constructs resulted in enhanced accumulation of all three medium-chain, saturated fatty acids in camelina seed oils. Our results show that a California bay gene can be successfully used to modify the oil composition in camelina seed and present a new biological alternative for jet fuel production. © 2017 Hu et al.

AB  - Rice straw is one of the largest biomasses in the world that can potentially be exploited for biofuel. Nevertheless, the association of lignin with cellulose and hemicellulose has hindered the efficient utilization of rice straw for cellulosic biofuel. The objective of this study was to down-regulate key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis pathway, such as hydroxycinnamoyl CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), through “terminator-less” constructs to reduce lignin in transgenic rice. Real-time qPCR analyses of the selected T1 transgenic rice plants indicated 36–86% transcript reduction in HCT lines, 75–94% in CCR lines, and 10–85% in CAD lines. Of the nine down-regulated lines (three lines from each genes) subjected to lignin analysis, seven showed significant reduction in total lignin content (HCT-4, HCT-7, CAD-1, CAD-7, CCR-3, CCR-7, and CCR-12) with lignin reduction ranging from 4.6 to 10.8%. The results from this study indicated that truncated gene fragments lacking transcription termination sequence can be used for down-regulation of lignin genes in rice, and the rice straw from these transgenic lines could be useful as feedstock for cellulosic biofuel. © 2017, Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer Japan.

AB  - Developing drought-resistance varieties is a major goal for bioenergy crops, such as poplar (Populus), which will be grown on marginal lands with little or no water input. Root architecture can affect drought resistance, but few genes that affect root architecture in relation to water availability have been identified. Here, using activation tagging in the prime bioenergy crop poplar, we have identified a mutant that overcomes the block of lateral root (LR) formation under osmotic stress. Positioning of the tag, validation of the activation and recapitulation showed that the phenotype is caused by the poplar PtabZIP1-like (PtabZIP1L) gene with highest homology to bZIP1 from Arabidopsis. PtabZIP1L is predominantly expressed in roots, particularly in zones where lateral root primordia (LRP) initiate and LR differentiate and emerge. Transgenics overexpressing PtabZIP1L showed precocious LRP and LR development, while PtabZIP1L suppression significantly delayed both LRP and LR formation. Transgenic overexpression and suppression of PtabZIP1L also resulted in modulation of key metabolites like proline, asparagine, valine and several flavonoids. Consistently, expression of both of the poplar Proline Dehydrogenase orthologs and two of the Flavonol Synthases genes was also increased and decreased in overexpressed and suppressed transgenics, respectively. These findings suggest that PtabZIP1L mediates LR development and drought resistance through modulation of multiple metabolic pathways. © 2016 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - While there is ample scholarly work on regulatory science within the state, or single-sited global institutions, there is less on its operation within complex modes of global governance that are decentered, overlapping, multi-sectorial and multi-leveled. Using a co-productionist framework, this study identifies ‘epistemic jurisdiction’ – the power to produce or warrant technical knowledge for a given political community, topical arena or geographical territory – as a central problem for regulatory science in complex governance. We explore these dynamics in the arena of global sustainability standards for biofuels. We select three institutional fora as sites of inquiry: the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, and the International Organization for Standardization. These cases allow us to analyze how the co-production of sustainability science responds to problems of epistemic jurisdiction in the global regulatory order. First, different problems of epistemic jurisdiction beset different standard-setting bodies, and these problems shape both the content of regulatory science and the procedures designed to make it authoritative. Second, in order to produce global regulatory science, technical bodies must manage an array of conflicting imperatives – including scientific virtue, due process and the need to recruit adoptees to perpetuate the standard. At different levels of governance, standard drafters struggle to balance loyalties to country, to company or constituency and to the larger project of internationalization. Confronted with these sometimes conflicting pressures, actors across the standards system quite self-consciously maneuver to build or retain authority for their forum through a combination of scientific adjustment and political negotiation. Third, the evidentiary demands of regulatory science in global administrative spaces are deeply affected by 1) a market for standards, in which firms and states can choose the cheapest sustainability certification, and 2) the international trade regime, in which the long shadow of WTO law exerts a powerful disciplining function. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Land to produce biomass is essential if the United States is to expand bioenergy supply. Use of agriculturally marginal land avoids the food vs. fuel problems of food price rises and carbon debt that are associated with crop and forestland. Recent remote sensing studies have identified large areas of US marginal land deemed suitable for bioenergy crops. Yet the sustainability benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal land only pertain if land is economically available. Scant attention has been paid to the willingness of landowners to supply land for bioenergy crops. Focusing on the northern tier of the Great Lakes, where grassland transitions to forest and land prices are low, this contingent valuation study reports on the willingness of a representative sample of 1124 private, noncorporate landowners to rent land for three bioenergy crops: corn, switchgrass, and poplar. Of the 11% of land that was agriculturally marginal, they were willing to make available no more than 21% for any bioenergy crop (switchgrass preferred on marginal land) at double the prevailing land rental rate in the region. At the same generous rental rate, of the 28% that is cropland, they would rent up to 23% for bioenergy crops (corn preferred), while of the 55% that is forestland, they would rent up to 15% for bioenergy crops (poplar preferred). Regression results identified deterrents to land rental for bioenergy purposes included appreciation of environmental amenities and concern about rental disamenities. In sum, like landowners in the southern Great Lakes region, landowners in the Northern Tier are reluctant to supply marginal land for bioenergy crops. If rental markets existed, they would rent more crop and forestland for bioenergy crops than they would marginal land, which would generate carbon debt and opportunity costs in wood product and food markets. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Brazil is a country historically characterized by high levels of capital and land ownership concentration, and some areas where family farming is traditionally strong are potentially impacted by the expansion of sugarcane, through land renting contracts between farmers (landowners) and sugar mills (tenants). This paper examines the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of mill-cultivated sugarcane expansion on family farming in the municipality of Ipiranga de Goiás, Goiás state, Brazil, where sugarcane plantations compete with corn, pasture and dairy cattle. Using a questionnaire composed of closed-and open-ended questions, we interviewed 28 family farmers, which were divided into two groups: those with and those without land renting contracts with the ethanol and sugar mill. The results show differences between both groups, such as average area size, main source of income, past and current activities, and perceptions about the pros and cons of sugarcane expansion. Land leasing emerged as a short-term solution to the shortage of on-farm labor and other economic difficulties small farmers continue to face. There are some farmers, however, who have resisted leasing their land for a number of reasons, including revenue is too low due to the small area in question; they also want to avoid loss of autonomy in production and the deep transformation of their rural way of life and landscape. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficient use of solid organic waste materials is an issue of particular importance for the wine industry. This paper focuses on the valorization of grape marc, the major component of winery organic waste (60–70%). Two methods were designed and compared: combustion to generate electricity, and the pyrolysis for the production of bio-char, bio-oil, and bio-gas. Each of these processes was analysed to determine their economic and environmental viability. The flow-sheeting software, ASPEN PLUS, was used to model the two cases. Data from the simulations was used to inform techno-economic and environmental analyses. Pyrolysis was found to be the superior method of utilizing grape marc from both economic and environmental perspectives. Both pyrolysis and combustion exploit the energy content of the waste, which is not recovered by the traditional treatments, composting or distillation. In addition to the production of energy, pyrolysis yielded 151 kg of bio-char and 140 kg of bio-oil per tonne of grape marc. These products may be used in place of fossil fuels, resulting in a net reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. However, the potential deleterious effects resulting from the replacement of the traditional treatments was not considered. Investment in either pyrolysis or combustion had a negligible impact on the price of the wine produced for wineries with an annual grape crush larger than 1000 tonnes. Composting has significant economic advantages in wineries with a small grape crush of less than 50 tonnes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work is a preliminary study for the development of a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used lubrication oils, with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used lubrication oils) in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic wastes and used lubrication oils. On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1 Pa s at 90°C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40% and 60%, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350–400°C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1 kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60% was estimated at about 8 MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29 MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis. Hence, this co-pyrolysis process could be economically viable, provided heat losses are addressed carefully when designing an industrial reactor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly understood to be a key mitigation technology, yet modeling analyses provide different results regarding the applications in which it might be used most effectively. Here we use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to explore the sensitivity of CCS deployment across sectors and fuels to future technology cost assumptions. We find that CCS is deployed preferentially in electricity generation or in liquid fuels production, depending on CCS and biofuels production cost assumptions. We consistently find significant deployment across both sectors in all of the scenarios considered here, with bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) often the dominant application. As such, this study challenges the view that CCS will primarily be coupled with power plants and used mainly in conjunction with fossil fuels, and suggests greater focus on practical implications of significant CCS and BECCS deployment to inform energy system transformation scenarios over the 21st century. © 2016

AB  - The Department of Energy's Clean Cities program was created in 1993 to reduce petroleum usage in the transportation sector. The program promotes alternative fuels such as biofuels and fuel-saving strategies such as idle reduction and fleet management through coalitions of local government, non-profit, and private actors. Few studies have evaluated the impact of the program because of its complexity that include interrelated strategies of grants, education and training and diversity of participants. This paper uses a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the program between 1990 and 2010. We quantify the effectiveness of the Clean Cities program by focusing on performance measures such as air quality, number of alternative fueling stations, private vehicle occupancy and transit ridership. We find that counties that participate in the program perform better on all these measures compared to counties that did not participate. Compared to the control group, counties in the Clean Cities program experienced a reduction in days with bad air quality (3.7%), a decrease in automobile commuters (2.9%), an overall increase in transit commuters (2.1%) and had greater numbers of new alternative fueling stations (12.9). The results suggest that the program is a qualified success. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The environmental impacts with regard to agro-based biofuel production have been associated with the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, field GHG emissions during plantation stage of palm oil-based biofuel production associated with land use changes for oil palm plantation development have been evaluated. Three different sites of different land use changes prior to oil palm plantation were chosen; converted land-use (large and small-scales) and logged-over forest. Field sampling for determination of soil N-mineralisation and soil organic carbon (SOC) was undertaken at the sites according to the age of palm, i.e. &lt;5 years (immature), 5–20 and &gt;21 years (mature oil palms). The field data were incorporated into the estimation of nitrous oxide (N2O) and the resulting CO2-eq emissions as well as for estimation of carbon stock changes. Irrespective of the land conversion scenarios, the nitrous oxide emissions were found in the range of 6.47–7.78 kg N2O-N/ha resulting in 498–590 kg CO2-eq/ha. On the other hand, the conversion of tropical forest into oil palm plantation has resulted in relatively higher GHG emissions (i.e. four times higher and carbon stock reduction by &gt;50%) compared to converted land use (converted rubber plantation) for oil palm development. The conversion from previously rubber plantation into oil palm plantation would increase the carbon savings (20% in increase) thus sustaining the environmental benefits from the palm oil-based biofuel production. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The co-digestion of Chromolaena odorata with poultry manure was evaluated in this study. Two samples of the weed: (A: which was pre-treated with mechanical, chemical and thermal methods) and (B: which was pretreated using mechanical and chemical methods only) were separately digested with poultry manure. Biogas generation started from the 2nd to 4th and 4th to 7th day for samples ‘A’ and ‘B’ respectively. The most desired actual biogas yield from samples ‘A’ and ‘B’ were 3884.20 and 2544.70 (10−4 m3/kg VS) respectively and the gas composition was 68 ± 2% Methane and 20 ± 2% Carbon dioxide for sample A while it was 62 ± 3% Methane and 22 ± 2% Carbon dioxide for sample B. In all, there was a 38.06% increase in gas generation in ‘A’ over ‘B’. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) model (0.9009) was high suggesting high accuracy in the modeling and prediction. The worldwide usage of C. odorata is encouraged. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels, such as those produced from crop residues, offer the possibility of reducing GHG emissions in the transport sector. Wheat straw is one potential feedstock for these fuels but grain yield has been prioritised over straw yield in crop breeding as straw currently has limited value. Should a new market for straw develop then dual-purpose cultivars (DPCs) that are optimised for food and bioenergy may become desirable. Field experiments were used to assess four key traits – grain yield, straw yield, lodging resistance and straw saccharification potential (i.e. the biofuel yield) – of a selection of modern and older UK wheat cultivars (with release dates ranging from 1964 to 2010) with the aim of identifying dual-purpose cultivars and any trade-offs among the key traits. None of the cultivars assessed were outstanding candidates for use as DPCs. Among the semi-dwarf cultivars there were only minor relationships between traits; including the non-semi-dwarf cultivar showed trade-offs between grain and straw yields. The findings suggest that selecting from among currently grown cultivars offers limited possibility for growing truly DPCs. However, the results indicate that high straw yields can be achieved by selecting high grain-yielding cultivars and managing these to maximise grain yield. Plant growth regulators should continue to be used as these do not significantly reduce straw yields but do decrease lodging susceptibility. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Growing demand for energy worldwide has increased interest in the production of renewable fuels, with microalgae representing a promising third generation feedstock. This study presents the use of a modular engineering process model, informed through literature, to evaluate the nitrogen and phosphorus resource demand of five microalgae to biofuels production systems. The baseline scenario, representative of an economically viable large-scale production system, includes sub-process models for growth, dewater, lipid extraction, anaerobic digestion, and biofuel conversion. Baseline modeling results combined with current US resource availability from fertilizer and wastewater show nitrogen and phosphorus requirements represent a potential barrier to the large-scale development of microalgae based biofuels. Baseline results show municipal wastewater sources can provide sufficient nutrients to produce 3.8 billion gallons of fuel per year, corresponding to 6% of the DOE goal of 60 billion gallons per year. Results from modeling of alternative production scenarios shows hydrothermal liquefaction to be a promising technology in terms of resource consumption. The use of lipid extracted algae as a value-added co-product is shown to be limitting due to nutrient recovery requirements for scalability. Optimistic and conservative process scenarios are simulated to bound the total resource demand and represent practical best and worst case scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work proposes a multi-objective optimization model to design a sustainable multi-period second generation biomass-to-bioethanol supply chain under multiple uncertainties. The objective is to simultaneously maximize the economic, environmental, and social performance. The strategic decisions such as land allocation for switchgrass cultivation, biorefinery locations and capacities, and the biomass-to-bioethanol conversion pathway are determined for each planning period which are staggered across the entire planning horizon. The augmented ε–constraint method is used to trade-off among the competing objectives and to obtain feasible solutions that achieve desired levels of sustainability. In order to solve the proposed stochastic optimization model efficiently and effectively, this work proposes a solution approach involving sequential application of a modified Sample Average Approximation method and Benders decomposition. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model and its impact on land usage and sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainability guidelines and regulations in the United States often focus exclusively on carbon or petroleum reductions. Though some of these policies have resulted in substantial progress toward their goals, the effects of these efforts on other social and environmental externalities are often ignored. In this study, we examine the life-cycle air pollutant emissions for alternative fuel and vehicle purchase scenarios at a military installation near a typical urban area in the United States (U.S.). We find that scenarios which minimize petroleum use or greenhouse gas emissions do not concomitantly minimize criteria air pollutant emissions. We also employ social cost methodologies to quantify economic externalities due to climate change and health-related air pollutant impacts. Accounting for the social costs of climate change and air pollution from vehicle use reveals that criteria air pollutants may have a greater total impact than greenhouse gas emissions in locations similar to the urban area examined in this study. Use of first-generation biofuels, particularly corn grain ethanol, may reduce net petroleum use at the cost of increased total health impacts. More comprehensive policies may be needed to ensure that sustainability policies result in a net benefit to society. © 2016

AB  - Agave bagasse (AGB) has gained recognition as a drought-tolerant biofuel feedstock with high productivity in semiarid regions. A comparative analysis of ionic liquid (IL) and organosolv (OV) pretreatment technologies in AGB was performed using a sequential enzymatic saccharification and fermentation (SESF) strategy with cellulolytic enzymes and the ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain MS04. After pretreatment, 86% of xylan and 45% of lignin were removed from OV-AGB, whereas IL-AGB reduced lignin content by 28% and xylan by 50% when compared to the untreated biomass. High glucan (>90%) and xylan (>83%) conversion was obtained with both pretreated samples. During the fermentation stage (48 h), 12.1 and 12.7 kg of ethanol were produced per 100 kg of untreated AGB for IL and OV, respectively. These comparative analyses showed the advantages of SESF using IL and OV in a biorefinery configuration where a better understanding of AGB recalcitrance is key for future applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic bioenergy crops such as shrub willow (Salix spp.) are expected to have a significant role in climate mitigation strategies. Yield is perhaps the most important trait for genetic selection and development of biomass feedstocks, but the selection process is complicated by the strong influence that environmental factors has on cultivar performance. Understanding the genotype-by-environment interactions using regional yield trials of shrub willow will inform future breeding efforts and improve the ability to make regionally-specific cultivar recommendations. We analyzed two yield trial datasets containing genotypes from successive rounds of breeding using a series of mixed models. Stability variance parameters were used together with overall yields to identify genotypes with stable yields or specific adaptation. Analysis of the first dataset revealed a group of triploid interspecific hybrid cultivars with exceptional performance and specific adaptation to either poor or good quality environments. The best performing cultivar showed a 14% yield improvement over the mean of the check cultivars. In the second dataset, new selections were assessed along with the top performing cultivars from dataset 1. New triploid hybrids had yields 19 to 27% greater than the check cultivar and exhibited similar patterns of specific adaptation as some of the selections from the first dataset. Partial least squares regression analysis indicated that top-yielding genotypes were favored in environments with higher temperatures and greater growing degree days. This analysis demonstrates incremental improvements in yield with successive rounds of breeding through the development of interspecific triploid hybrids. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The main goal of the present study was a complete proteomic characterization of total proteins eluted from residual substrate-bound proteins (RSBP), and cellulosomes secreted by Clostridium thermocellum B8 during growth in the presence of microcrystalline cellulose as a carbon source. The second goal was to evaluate their potential use as enzymatic blends for hydrolyzing agro-industrial residues to produce fermentable sugars. Protein identification through LC–MS/MS mass spectrometry showed that the RSBP sample, in addition to cellulosomal proteins, contains a wide variety of proteins, including those without a well-characterized role in plant cell wall degradation. The RSBP subsample defined as purified cellulosomes (PC) consists mainly of glycoside hydrolases grouped in families 5, 8, 9, 10 and 48. Dynamic light scattering, DLS, analysis of PC resulted in two protein peaks (pi1 and pi2) presenting molecular masses in agreement with those previously described for cellulosomes and polycellulosomes. These peaks weren't detected after PC treatment with 1.0% Tween. PC and RSBP presented maximal activities at temperatures ranging from 60° to 70 °C and at pH 5.0. RSBP retained almost all of its activity after incubation at 50, 60 and 70 °C and PC showed remarkable thermostability at 50 and 60 °C. RSBP holocellullolytic activities were inhibited by phenolic compounds, while PC showed either increasing activity or a lesser degree of inhibition. RSBP and PC hydrolyze sugar cane straw, cotton waste and microcrystalline cellulose, liberating a diversity of saccharides; however, the highest concentration of released sugar was obtained for assays carried out using PC as an enzymatic blend and after ten days at 50 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mine tailings contain high concentrations of metal contaminants and only little nutrients, making the tailings barren for decades after the mining has been terminated. Effective phytoremediation of mine tailings calls for deep-rooted, metal accumulating, and soil fertility increasing plants with tolerance against harsh environmental conditions. We assessed the potential of the biofuel leguminous tree Pongamia pinnata inoculated with plant growth promoting rhizobia to remediate iron–vanadium–titanium oxide (V–Ti magnetite) mine tailing soil by pot experiment and in situ remediation test. A metal tolerant rhizobia strain PZHK1 was isolated from the tailing soil and identified as Bradyrhizobium liaoningense by phylogenetic analysis. Inoculation with PZHK1 increased the growth of P. pinnata both in V–Ti magnetite mine tailings and in Ni-contaminated soil. Furthermore, inoculation increased the metal accumulation capacity and superoxide dismutase activity of P. pinnata. The concentrations of Ni accumulated by inoculated plants were higher than the hyperaccumulator threshold. Inoculated P. pinnata accumulated high concentration of Fe, far exceeding the upper limit (1000 mg kg−1) of Fe in plant tissue. In summary, P. pinnata–B. liaoningense PZHK1 symbiosis showed potential to be applied as an effective phytoremediation technology for mine tailings and to produce biofuel feedstock on the marginal land. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this study an alternative valorization of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) Bottom Ash (BA) for H2S elimination from landfill biogas was evaluated. Emphasis was given to the influence of water content in biogas on H2S removal efficiency by BA. A small-scale pilot was developed and implemented in a landfill site located in France. A new biogas analyzer was used and allowed real-time continuous measurement of CH4, CO2, O2, H2S and H2O in raw and treated biogas. The H2S removal efficiency of bottom ash was evaluated for different inlet biogas humidities: from 4 to 24 gwater/m3. The biogas water content was found to greatly affect bottom ash efficiency regarding H2S removal. With humid inlet biogas the H2S removal was almost 3 times higher than with a dry inlet biogas. Best removal capacity obtained was 56 g H2S/kg dry BA. A humid inlet biogas allows to conserve the bottom ash moisture content for a maximum H2S retention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (Pjdr2) has been studied as a model for development of bacterial biocatalysts for efficient processing of xylans, methylglucuronoxylan, and methylglucuronoarabinoxylan, the predominant hemicellulosic polysaccharides found in dicots and monocots, respectively. Pjdr2 produces a cell-associated GH10 endoxylanase (Xyn10A1) that catalyzes depolymerization of xylans to xylobiose, xylotriose, and methylglucuronoxylotriose with methylglucuronate-linked α-1,2 to the nonreducing terminal xylose. A GH10/GH67 xylan utilization regulon includes genes encoding an extracellular cell-associated Xyn10A1 endoxylanase and an intracellular GH67 α-glucuronidase active on methylglucuronoxylotriose generated by Xyn10A1 but without activity on methylglucuronoxylotetraose generated by a GH11 endoxylanase. The sequenced genome of Pjdr2 contains three paralogous genes potentially encoding GH115 α-glucuronidases found in certain bacteria and fungi. One of these, Pjdr2_5977, shows enhanced expression during growth on xylans along with Pjdr2_4664 encoding a GH11 endoxylanase. Here, we show that Pjdr2_5977 encodes a GH115 α-glucuronidase, Agu115A, with maximal activity on the aldouronate methylglucuronoxylotetraose selectively generated by a GH11 endoxylanase Xyn11 encoded by Pjdr2_4664. Growth of Pjdr2 on this methylglucuronoxylotetraose supports a process for Xyn11-mediated extracellular depolymerization of methylglucuronoxylan and Agu115A-mediated intracellular deglycosylation as an alternative to the GH10/GH67 system previously defined in this bacterium. A recombinantly expressed enzyme encoded by the Pjdr2 agu115A gene catalyzes removal of 4-O-methylglucuronate residues α-1,2 linked to internal xylose residues in oligoxylosides generated by GH11 and GH30 xylanases and releases methylglucuronate from polymeric methylglucuronoxylan. The GH115 α-glucuronidase from Pjdr2 extends the discovery of this activity to members of the phylum Firmicutes and contributes to a novel system for bioprocessing hemicelluloses. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass is an alternative to petroleum-based liquid transportation fuels. The cost-effectiveness of cellulosic ethanol manufacturing has been hindered by several technical barriers. One such barrier is that low density of biomass causes high costs of biomass transportation, handling, and storage. Another barrier is low sugar yield in enzymatic hydrolysis, making enzymatic hydrolysis an expensive and slow step. Ultrasonic vibration-assisted (UV-A) pelleting of cellulosic biomass can increase its density and reduce the costs of biomass transportation and handling. In addition, sugar yield of biomass pellets processed by UV-A pelleting was higher than that of particles (unpelleted biomass) with diluted acid pretreatment. The reason that UV-A pelleting could increase sugar yield of biomass is still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate reasons that UV-A pelleting combined with diluted acid pretreatment could increase sugar yield of biomass. High sugar yield is preferred to achieve high ethanol yield. Effects of UV-A pelleting on biomass characteristics (such as chemical composition, crystallinity index, thermal properties, and morphological structure) were investigated. The results showed there was no significant difference in chemical composition between pellets and particles. However, crystallinity of biomass increased after UV-A pelleting. In addition, pellets had higher decomposition temperature than particles, indicating that pellets were more thermally stable than particles. Examinations on morphological structure of biomass showed that softened surface regions of biomass were removed and cellulose microfibrils were revealed after UV-A pelleting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Uncertainty in soil carbon (C) fluxes across different land-use transitions is an issue that needs to be addressed for the further deployment of perennial bioenergy crops. A large-scale short-rotation coppice (SRC) site with poplar (Populus) and willow (Salix) was established to examine the land-use transitions of arable and pasture to bioenergy. Soil C pools, output fluxes of soil CO2, CH4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and volatile organic compounds, as well as input fluxes from litter fall and from roots, were measured over a 4-year period, along with environmental parameters. Three approaches were used to estimate changes in the soil C. The largest C pool in the soil was the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and increased after four years of SRC from 10.9 to 13.9 kg C m−2. The belowground woody biomass (coarse roots) represented the second largest C pool, followed by the fine roots (Fr). The annual leaf fall represented the largest C input to the soil, followed by weeds and Fr. After the first harvest, we observed a very large C input into the soil from high Fr mortality. The weed inputs decreased as trees grew older and bigger. Soil respiration averaged 568.9 g C m−2 yr−1. Leaching of DOC increased over the three years from 7.9 to 14.5 g C m−2. The pool-based approach indicated an increase of 3360 g C m−2 in the SOC pool over the 4-year period, which was high when compared with the −27 g C m−2 estimated by the flux-based approach and the −956 g C m−2 of the combined eddy-covariance + biometric approach. High uncertainties were associated to the pool-based approach. Our results suggest using the C flux approach for the assessment of the short-/medium-term SOC balance at our site, while SOC pool changes can only be used for long-term C balance assessments. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Non Timber Forest Products play an important role as source of food and income generation in developing countries. In Burkina Faso, many wild tree species provide various useful products, among them the local oil tree, Lophira lanceolata which occurs in the western part of the country. This study aimed at assessing the habitat diversity and population structure of L. lanceolata’s natural stands according to land cover types. Two sites were considered: Banfora, where the use value of fruits is unknown and Orodara, where fruits are exploited for oil production. A stratified and oriented sampling scheme based on the occurrence of L. lanceolata and land cover was applied using rectangular plots of 50 m × 20 m. Phytosociological and quantitative inventories were carried out to assess the woody species diversity of stands and L. lanceolata population structure, respectively. Species diversity indices, structural parameters were computed and analyses of variance, Chi square test were performed to compare sites according to land cover types. The results showed high woody species diversity associated with L. lanceolata stands (H = 3.2–3.6). The densities of L. lanceolata ranged between 94 and 280 trees per hectare, with significant differences between land cover types and sites. The population pattern showed a good regeneration potential and high resource availability. L. lanceolata was fairly resilient to human pressure and tended to recolonize disturbed lands. With a high potential for sustainable management, L. lanceolata is a promising NTFP species which can contribute to improve the local and national economy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Land-use change to bioenergy crop production can contribute towards addressing the dual challenges of greenhouse gas mitigation and energy security. Realisation of the mitigation potential of bioenergy crops is, however, dependent on suitable crop selection and full assessment of the carbon (C) emissions associated with land conversion. Using eddy covariance-based estimates, ecosystem C exchange was studied during the early-establishment phase of two perennial crops, C3 reed canary grass (RCG) and C4 Miscanthus, planted on former grassland in Ireland. Crop development was the main determinant of net carbon exchange in the Miscanthus crop, restricting significant net C uptake during the first 2 years of establishment. The Miscanthus ecosystem switched from being a net C source in the conversion year to a strong net C sink (−411 ± 63 g C m−2) in the third year, driven by significant above-ground growth and leaf expansion. For RCG, early establishment and rapid canopy development facilitated a net C sink in the first 2 years of growth (−319 ± 57 (post-planting) and −397 ± 114 g C m−2, respectively). Peak seasonal C uptake occurred three months earlier in RCG (May) than Miscanthus (August), however Miscanthus sustained net C uptake longer into the autumn and was close to C-neutral in winter. Leaf longevity is therefore a key advantage of C4 Miscanthus in temperate climates. Further increases in productivity are projected as Miscanthus reaches maturity and are likely to further enhance the C sink potential of Miscanthus relative to RCG. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The carbon footprint (CF) of biofuels and biomaterials is a barrier to their acceptance, yet the greenhouse gas emissions associated with disposing of biomaterials are frequently omitted from analyses. This article investigates whether harmonization is appropriate for calculating the importance of biomaterials’ disposal. This research shows that disposal stages could double a biomaterial's CF, or reduce it to the point that it could claim to be zero carbon. Incineration with combined heat and power coupled with on-site energy production in the biorefinery are identified as prerequisites to being zero carbon. The article assesses the current UK waste infrastructure's ability to support a low-carbon bio-based future economy, and finds that presently it only achieves marginal net reductions when compared to landfill and so cannot be said to support low-carbon biomaterials, though the article challenges the polluter pays principle where low-carbon disposal infrastructure are not available. Reuse and recycling are shown to have the potential to offset all the emissions caused by landfill of biomaterials. However, the savings are not so great as to offset the biomaterial's upstream emissions. The study explores the ability to overcome the barriers to incorporating disposal into life cycle assessment while identifying limitations of using harmonization as an assessment method. Specifically, data availability and industry consensus are flagged as major barriers. The study also uses sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of methodological choices, such as allowing additional reuse and recycling stages, classifying biomaterials into different types, and choosing between opposing allocation methods. © 2016 by Yale University

AB  - Producing biofuel feedstocks on current agricultural land raises questions of a ‘food-vs.-fuel’ trade-off. The use of current or former Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land offers an alternative; yet the volumes of ethanol that could be produced and the potential environmental impacts of such a policy are unclear. Here, we applied the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model to a US Department of Agriculture database of over 200 000 CRP polygons in Iowa, USA, as a case study. We simulated yields and environmental impacts of growing three cellulosic biofuel feedstocks on CRP land: (i) an Alamo-variety switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.); (ii) a generalized mixture of C4 and C3 grasses; (iii) and no-till corn (Zea mays L.) with residue removal. We simulated yields, soil erosion, and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks and fluxes. We found that although no-till corn with residue removal produced approximately 2.6–4.4 times more ethanol per area compared to switchgrass and the grass mixture, it also led to 3.9–4.5 times more erosion, 4.4–5.2 times more cumulative N loss, and a 10% reduction in total soil carbon as opposed to a 6–11% increase. Switchgrass resulted in the best environmental outcomes even when expressed on a per liter ethanol basis. Our results suggest planting no-till corn with residue removal should only be done on low slope soils to minimize environmental concerns. Overall, this analysis provides additional information to policy makers on the potential outcome and effects of producing biofuel feedstocks on current or former conservation lands. Published 2016.

AB  - Native perennial bioenergy crops can mitigate greenhouse gases (GHG) by displacing fossil fuels with renewable energy and sequestering atmospheric carbon (C) in soil and roots. The relative contribution of root C to net GHG mitigation potential has not been compared in perennial bioenergy crops ranging in species diversity and N fertility. We measured root biomass, C, nitrogen (N), and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the upper 90 cm of soil for five native perennial bioenergy crops managed with and without N fertilizer. Bioenergy crops ranged in species composition and were annually harvested for 6 (one location) and 7 years (three locations) following the seeding year. Total root biomass was 84% greater in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and a four-species grass polyculture compared to high-diversity polycultures; the difference was driven by more biomass at shallow soil depth (0–30 cm). Total root C (0–90 cm) ranged from 3.7 Mg C ha−1 for a 12-species mixture to 7.6 Mg C ha−1 for switchgrass. On average, standing root C accounted for 41% of net GHG mitigation potential. After accounting for farm and ethanol production emissions, net GHG mitigation potential from fossil fuel offsets and root C was greatest for switchgrass (−8.4 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1) and lowest for high-diversity mixtures (−4.5 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1). Nitrogen fertilizer did not affect net GHG mitigation potential or the contribution of roots to GHG mitigation for any bioenergy crop. SOC did not change and therefore did not contribute to GHG mitigation potential. However, associations among SOC, root biomass, and root C : N ratio suggest greater long-term C storage in diverse polycultures vs. switchgrass. Carbon pools in roots have a greater effect on net GHG mitigation than SOC in the short-term, yet variation in root characteristics may alter patterns in long-term C storage among bioenergy crops. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Expert elicitations are now frequently used to characterize uncertain future technology outcomes. However, their usefulness is limited, in part because: estimates across studies are not easily comparable; choices in survey design and expert selection may bias results; and overconfidence is a persistent problem. We provide quantitative evidence of how these choices affect experts’ estimates. We standardize data from 16 elicitations, involving 169 experts, on the 2030 costs of five energy technologies: nuclear, biofuels, bioelectricity, solar, and carbon capture. We estimate determinants of experts’ confidence using survey design, expert characteristics, and public R&D investment levels on which the elicited values are conditional. Our central finding is that when experts respond to elicitations in person (vs. online or mail) they ascribe lower confidence (larger uncertainty) to their estimates, but more optimistic assessments of best-case (10th percentile) outcomes. The effects of expert affiliation and country of residence vary by technology, but in general: academics and public-sector experts express lower confidence than private-sector experts; and E.U. experts are more confident than U.S. experts. Finally, extending previous technology-specific work, higher R&D spending increases experts’ uncertainty rather than resolves it. We discuss ways in which these findings should be seriously considered in interpreting the results of existing elicitations and in designing new ones. © 2016 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Development of dedicated bioenergy crop production systems will require accurate yield estimates, which will be important for determining many of the associated environmental and economic impacts of their production. Shrub willow (Salix spp) is being promoted in areas of the USA and Canada due to its adaption to cool climates and wide genetic diversity available for breeding improvement. Willow breeding in North America is in an early stage, and selection of elite genotypes for commercialization will require testing across broad geographic regions to gain an understanding of how shrub willow interacts with the environment. We analyzed a dataset of first-rotation shrub willow yields of 16 genotypes across 10 trial environments in the USA and Canada for genotype-by-environment interactions using the additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) model. Mean genotype yields ranged from 5.22 to 8.58 oven-dry Mg ha−1 yr−1. Analysis of the main effect of genotype showed that one round of breeding improved yields by as much as 20% over check cultivars and that triploid hybrids, most notably Salix viminalis × S. miyabeana, exhibited superior yields. We also found important variability in genotypic response to environments, which suggests specific adaptability could be exploited among 16 genotypes for yield gains. Strong positive correlations were found between environment main effects and AMMI parameters and growing environment temperatures. These findings demonstrate yield improvements are possible in one generation and will be important for developing cultivar recommendations and for future breeding efforts. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of preceding crops (soybeans, sunn hemp, upland rice, and sweet sorghum) on the succeeding sugarcane yield, total bioethanol production, and soil chemical properties within the sugarcane cropping system. Treatments with upland rice and sweet sorghum provided the greatest increase in soil available P, compared to uncultivated land (control) at the final sampling, preceding the sugarcane harvest. Treatments effects were not significantly different for soil organic matter. At sugarcane harvest, the upland rice treatment provided the highest cane yield compared to the unplanted land, yet was not significantly higher than the yield of the sweet sorghum treatment. The highest sugarcane ethanol yields were observed in the sweet sorghum–sugarcane and upland rice–sugarcane treatments. However, the total ethanol yield in both preceding and succeeding crops was found to be highest in the sweet sorghum treatment, followed by the upland rice treatment. Upland rice proved to be most suitable for farming systems which emphasized food security, whereas sweet sorghum was most desirable for farming systems which emphasized alternative biofuel production. Both crops improved the sustainable production of soil and sugarcane. © 2016, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AB  - Miscanthus is a rhizomatous C4 grass of great interest as a biofuel crop because it has the potential to produce high yields over a wide geographical area with low agricultural inputs on marginal land less suitable for food production. At the moment, a clonal interspecific hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus is the most widely cultivated and studied in Europe and the United States, but breeding programmes are developing newer more productive varieties. Here, we quantified the physiological processes relating to whole season yield in a replicated plot trial in Wales, UK. Light capture and conversion efficiency were parameterized for four carefully selected genotypes (M. sinensis, M. sacchariflorus and Miscanthus × giganteus). Differences in the canopy architecture in mature stands as measured by the extinction coefficient (k) were small (0.55–0.65). Sensitivity analysis on a mathematical model of Miscanthus was performed to quantify the accumulative intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) in the growing season using (i) k, (ii) variation in the thermal responses of leaf expansion rate, (iii) base temperature for degree days and (iv) date start of canopy expansion. A 10% increase in k or leaf area per degree day both had a minimal effect on iPAR (3%). Decreasing base temperature from 10 to 9 °C gave an 8% increase in iPAR. If the starting date for canopy expansion was the same as shoot emergence date, then the iPAR increases by 12.5%. In M. × giganteus, the whole season above ground and total (including below ground) radiation-use efficiency (RUE) ranged from 45% to 37% higher than the noninterspecific hybrid genotypes. The greater yields in the interspecific hybrid M. × giganteus are explained by the higher RUE and not by differences in iPAR or partitioning effects. Studying the mechanisms underlying this complex trait could have wide benefits for both fuel and food production. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Agave species are high-yielding crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants, some of which are grown commercially and recognized as potential bioenergy species for dry regions of the world. This study is the first field trial of Agave species for bioenergy in the United States, and was established to compare the production of Agave americana with the production of Agave tequilana and Agave fourcroydes, which are produced commercially in Mexico for tequila and fiber. The field trial included four experimental irrigation levels to test the response of biomass production to water inputs. After 3 years, annual production of healthy A. americana plants reached 9.3 Mg dry mass ha−1 yr−1 (including pup mass) with 530 mm of annual water inputs, including both rainfall and irrigation. Yields in the most arid conditions tested (300 mm yr−1 water input) were 2.0–4.0 Mg dry mass ha−1 yr−1. Agave tequilana and Agave fourcroydes were severely damaged by cold in the first winter, and produced maximum yields of only 0.04 Mg ha−1 yr−1 and 0.26 Mg ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The agave snout weevil (Scyphophorus acupunctatus) emerged as an important challenge for A. americana cropping, killing a greater number of plants in the higher irrigation treatments. Physiological differences in A. americana plants across irrigation treatments were most evident in the warmest season, with gas exchange beginning up to 3 h earlier and water use efficiency declining in treatments with the greatest water input (780 mm yr−1 water input). Yields were lower than previous projections for Agave species, but results from this study suggest that A. americana has potential as a bioenergy crop and would have substantially reduced irrigation requirements relative to conventional crops in the southwestern USA. Challenges for pest management and harvesting must still be addressed before an efficient production system that uses Agave can be realized. © 2016 The Authors.

This study comprises economic policies, processes of technological diffusion of emerging technologies and a methodology for modelling possible transportation fuel scenarios. In order to model future scenarios, Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN) are used, a structured formalism that provides a high-level abstraction to represent continuous and discrete-time Markovian models. The results show that in order to boost development of advanced biofuels, public investment in R&D is the most important policy to be adopted. Developing strategies aimed to renewable resources; applying tax incentives and subsidies; and issuing mandatory country objectives are also encouraged. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a member of the third generation of biofuels, biodiesel from bacteria requires substantial further research and development to assess its viability for commercial production. However, this biofuel is a promising solution to global renewable energy demands. As a result, the cultivation of Arthrobacter AK19 was investigated for higher lipid production through media optimization parameters and stress conditions. The results showed that when the Box-Behnken design was applied, the maximum biomass concentration was 4.78 times higher than that from unoptimized condition. Additionally, with sodium chloride and potassium permanganate at a concentration of 1.5 g/l and 3.2 mg/l as a stress agent, the lipid content was 3.34 and 1.95 times higher than that obtained under normal condition. The lipid class composition of Arthrobacter AK19 under sodium chloride stress contained neutral lipids, glycolipids and phospholipids at levels of 63.45, 28.59 and 7.96 wt%, respectively. Additionally, the major components in the total lipids were linoleic acid, lignoceric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thailand has been promoting biofuel production and consumption to substitute transport fuels in order to utilize domestic resources and contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. This study adopted a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method using “distance-to-target” approach based on the Swiss Eco Scarcity method. It is developed by using Thailand's current situation of pollutants emissions and natural resources use in line with the three related national policy goals i.e. GHG, primary energy and freshwater resources; the Eco-Factors are 1.6, 0.13 and 1.9 Thai Eco Point (TEP) per kgCO2e, MJ NRE-eq and m3 in respective units. These were used for an LCA comparison between cassava-based ethanol and palm oil-biodiesel with their fossil fuel counterparts on an energy basis. The LCA results indicate both biofuels have lower impacts than the equivalent fossil fuels and the main contributor is GHG emissions from biofuel production. The sensitivity analysis also indicated the given policy related to freshwater and GHG influence the biofuel benefits. Therefore, the strong policy and technical options in energy production are still required for sustainable biofuels following the government intention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The non-recyclable fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW refuse) represents over half of the total MSW production in Europe, with an energetic potential of 1250 PJ/year, a similar quantity to the current potential for energy production from agricultural residues. Currently, there are no alternative uses for MSW refuse other than landfilling or incineration. Thus, it represents an important untapped resource for biofuel production in Europe. Standard attributional LCAs have not been able to capture some of the bioenergy interactions with the climate system and neither to properly assess the climate change mitigation potential of bioenergy technologies. This study aims to fill this gap and properly assess the impact of the production of biofuels from MSW refuse on climate change by applying several methodological improvements in a time-dependent assessment, i.e., an explicit consideration of biogenic carbon flows using a dynamic LCA and an absolute formulation of the cumulative and instantaneous climate metrics. Two diverging examples of current MSW management systems are selected as references against which to assess the potential climate benefit of biofuel production: with or without dominant landfill disposal and with high or low GHG emissions from the power generation sector. The results show that in countries with current negligible landfilling, the production of biofuels would lead to a clear climate benefit. For landfill-dominant countries, the climate benefit would only be temporarily achieved in the medium term as the impact of landfills on climate decreases in the long term. However, considering a progressive banning of landfilling promoted by other policies for environmental protection and resource efficiency, the results would become positive for both countries with climate change mitigation guaranteed by using MSW refuse for biofuel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thailand has recently implemented the Alternative Energy Development Plan (2015–2036) aiming to reduce the dependency on conventional fuels, notably diesel from oil palm. To ensure sustainability of substituting diesel, this study aims to assess the environmental effects of three promising biofuels namely, conventional biodiesel or Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) and the newest alternative fuel, Partially Hydrogenated Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (H-FAME) compared to diesel in transport sector. The system boundary is “Well-to-Wheels. This study does not show a significant difference in the energy performances and environmental effects of the studied biofuels. The partial substitution of diesel by FAME, H-FAME and BHD can decrease fossil use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly. In terms of global warming potential GWP, more than 100 million tonnes CO2eq would be reduced in the next 20 years according to the projection of 25% replaced conventional diesel consumption. To improve the performance in terms of resource use and GHG mitigation, the study results suggest encouraging the use of H-FAME and BHD as a good choice. Both these alternative fuels can be blended with conventional diesel more than 2 times compared with FAME. In the initial stage, substitution could start with implementing H-FAME and slightly reduce the use of FAME after which BHD could be implemented along with FAMEand H-FAME. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An increase in the output of crops such as cassava, sugarcane, and oil palm, is necessary for biofuels development. To increase the crop yield, a large amount of water is required which can have an impact on the net social welfare. This study aims to assess the benefit and cost of water resource use in biofuel crops production to support the cost-benefit analysis of biofuels development. Benefit of water is presented through the value of its marginal product estimated by using economic valuation methods. The loss due to water consumption is assessed and monetized based on life cycle impact assessment. To show how the approach is applied to the regional level, Thailand is considered as a case study. The results show that the economic gains from using a cubic meter of water in cassava, sugarcane, and oil palm production are 1.6–6.9, 1.0–5.0, and 0.8–2.9 Thai baht, respectively. However, using this amount of water can also bring about the external cost around 0.2 Thai baht, leading to the net benefits of using a cubic meter of water in cassava, sugarcane, and oil palm production between 1.5 and 6.7, 0.9–4.8, and 0.6–2.6 Thai baht, respectively. Gain and loss of the water used in cassava, sugarcane, and oil palm cultivation are expressed in monetary units for the first time by this study. Besides, this paper could be a guideline for future research towards an integration of life cycle impact assessment and the economic analysis tool, cost-benefit analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most germplasms of the biofuel plant Jatropha curcas are monoecious. A gynoecious genotype of J. curcas was found, whose male flowers are aborted at early stage of inflorescence development. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of transition from monoecious to gynoecious plants, a comparative transcriptome analysis between gynoecious and monoecious inflorescences were performed. A total of 3,749 genes differentially expressed in two developmental stages of inflorescences were identified. Among them, 32 genes were involved in floral development, and 70 in phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways. Six genes homologous to KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX GENE 6 (KNAT6), MYC2, SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE 5 (SRS5), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), and TASSELSEED2 (TS2), which control floral development, were considered as candidate regulators that may be involved in sex differentiation in J. curcas. Abscisic acid, auxin, gibberellin, and jasmonate biosynthesis were lower, whereas cytokinin biosynthesis was higher in gynoecious than that in monoecious inflorescences. Moreover, the exogenous application of gibberellic acid (GA3) promoted perianth development in male flowers and partly prevented pistil development in female flowers to generate neutral flowers in gynoecious inflorescences. The arrest of stamen primordium at early development stage probably causes the abortion of male flowers to generate gynoecious individuals. These results suggest that some floral development genes and phytohormone signaling pathways orchestrate the process of sex determination in J. curcas. Our study provides a basic framework for the regulation networks of sex determination in J. curcas and will be helpful for elucidating the evolution of the plant reproductive system. © 2017, Chen, Pan, Fu, Tao, Martínez-Herrera, Niu, Ni, Dong, Zhao and Xu.

AB  - Oil palm is a commercial crop that is important for its food value and as a biofuel, along with its other benefits towards the economy and human health. Currently, Malaysia cultivates approximately 5.64 million ha of oil palm. To date, a study identifying abandoned oil palm areas using satellite images is almost non-existent. Conventionally, the monitoring of abandoned oil palm lands is tedious and time consuming, especially over large areas. Hence, in this article, the capability of high resolution satellite image via Satellite Pour I’Observation de la Terre-6 (SPOT-6) products to extract abandoned oil palm areas was explored, as was the use of multi-temporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to develop the phenology of abandoned oil palm sites. Homogeneity measures derived through SPOT images played a more important role to identify abandoned oil palm than crop phenology characteristics extracted from high spectral resolution of Landsat images. With the advancement of object-oriented classification, monitoring of abandoned oil palm areas can be done semi-automatically with an accuracy of 92±1%. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Conversion of annual grain crop systems to biofuel production systems can restore soil hydrologic function; however, information on these effects is limited. Hence, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of topsoil thickness on water infiltration in claypan soils for grain and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production systems. The experiment was performed at the University of Missouri South Farm (38°54′N, 92°16′W) on a Mexico silt loam (Vertic Luvisols) soil. Since 2009, plots were planted with either switchgrass or a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation. Infiltration rates were measured using ponded infiltrometers during two years (2014 and 2015) under switchgrass and grain crop management each with two levels of topsoil thickness (0 and 37.5 cm). Physically-based Parlange and Green-Ampt infiltration models were used to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and sorptivity (S) parameters. Switchgrass planted on degraded soil (shallow topsoil treatment) resulted in greater Ks, S, qs (quasi-steady infiltration rate) and Kfs (field-saturated hydraulic conductivity) values than with row crop management for both 2014 and 2015 measurement years. Results for selected 24-hour mean frequency (11.8, 14.2, and 16.2 cm) storms showed that switchgrass production systems enhanced estimated water infiltration, reduced estimated runoff, and decreased estimated time from water ponding to end of ponding compared with row crop management. Switchgrass is recommended to be planted on degraded soils especially in claypan landscapes for improved water use. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Clostridium thermocellum is capable of solubilizing and converting lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol. Although much of the work-to-date has centered on characterizing this microbe's growth on model cellulosic substrates, such as cellobiose, Avicel, or filter paper, it is vitally important to understand its metabolism on more complex, lignocellulosic substrates to identify relevant industrial bottlenecks that could undermine efficient biofuel production. To this end, we have examined a time course progression of C. thermocellum grown on switchgrass to assess the metabolic and protein changes that occur during the conversion of plant biomass to ethanol. Results: The most striking feature of the metabolome was the observed accumulation of long-chain, branched fatty acids over time, implying an adaptive restructuring of C. thermocellum's cellular membrane as the culture progresses. This is undoubtedly a response to the gradual accumulation of lignocellulose-derived inhibitory compounds as the organism deconstructs the switchgrass to access the embedded cellulose. Corroborating the metabolomics data, proteomic analysis revealed a corresponding time-dependent increase in various enzymes, including those involved in the interconversion of branched amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine to iso- and anteiso-fatty acid precursors. Additionally, the metabolic accumulation of hemicellulose-derived sugars and sugar alcohols concomitant with increased abundance of enzymes involved in C5 sugar metabolism/pentose phosphate pathway indicates that C. thermocellum shifts glycolytic intermediates to alternate pathways to modulate overall carbon flux in response to C5 sugar metabolites that increase during lignocellulose deconstruction. Conclusions: Integrated omic platforms provided complementary systems biological information that highlight C. thermocellum's specific response to cytotoxic inhibitors released during the deconstruction and utilization of switchgrass. These additional viewpoints allowed us to fully realize the level to which the organism adapts to an increasingly challenging culture environment - information that will prove critical to C. thermocellum's industrial efficacy. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Combustion of fossil fuels in the transport sector represents the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, governments are fostering diversification of energy sources by creating a set of governmental environmental policies and initiatives. In this context, biofuels are expected to represent a substantial part of source diversification, but it is necessary to assess the sustainability of their market to explore its effect on economical, technological, social, political and environmental dimensions. This research presents a dynamic simulation modelling of the Colombian biodiesel market and analyzes the policy support instruments for creating and managing it. A system dynamics based model is proposed to enable decision-makers to understand the influences between the different variables that describe the system and the impact of the biodiesel government policy in Colombia. The primary focus of this paper is to establish the characteristics of each sustainability dimension for the case of study and apply the system dynamics methodology with different types of validation. Finally, the Colombian market status and a sensitivity analysis are developed. The results show that in order to support the development of this sector, it is necessary to diversify the raw materials for the production of biodiesel in the medium term, which means raw materials without competence for the primary rainforest or competition with food productive lands. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deriving biofuels and other lipoid products from algae is a promising future technology directly addressing global issues of atmosphericCO2 balance.Tobetter understand the metabolism of triglyceride synthesis in algae,weexamined their metabolic origins in the model species, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C169, using stable isotopic labeling. Labeling patterns arising from [U-13C]glucose, 13CO2, or D2O supplementation were analyzed by GC-MS and/or LC-MSover time courses during nitrogen starvation to address the roles of cataboliccarbonrecycling, acyl chain redistribution,andde novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis during the expansion of the lipid bodies. The metabolic origin of stress-induced triglyceride was found to be a continuous 8:2 ratio between de novo synthesized FA and acyl chain transfer from pre-stressed membrane lipids with little input from lipid remodeling. Membrane lipids were continually synthesized with associated acyl chain editing during nitrogen stress, in contrast to an overall decrease in total membrane lipid. Theincorporation rates of de novo synthesizedFAinto lipid classes were measured over a time course of nitrogen starvation. The synthesis of triglycerides, phospholipids, and galactolipids followed a two-stage pattern where nitrogen starvation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase followed by a gradual decline. Acyl chain flux into membrane lipids was dominant in the first stage followed by triglycerides. These data indicate that the level of metabolic control that determines acyl chain flux between membrane lipids and triglycerides during nitrogen stress relies primarily on the Kennedy pathway and de novo FA synthesis with limited, defined input from acyl editing reactions. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc..

AB  - Background: Photosynthetic microalgae are considered a viable and sustainable resource for biofuel feedstocks, because they can produce higher biomass per land area than plants and can be grown on non-arable land. Among many microalgae considered for biofuel production, Nannochloropsis oceanica (CCMP1779) is particularly promising, because following nutrient deprivation it produces very high amounts of triacylglycerols (TAG). The committed step in TAG synthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Remarkably, a total of 13 putative DGAT-encoding genes have been previously identified in CCMP1779 but most have not yet been studied in detail. Results: Based on their expression profile, six out of 12 type-2 DGAT-encoding genes (NoDGTT1-NoDGTT6) were chosen for their possible role in TAG biosynthesis and the respective cDNAs were expressed in a TAG synthesis-deficient mutant of yeast. Yeast expressing NoDGTT5 accumulated TAG to the highest level. Over-expression of NoDGTT5 in CCMP1779 grown in N-replete medium resulted in levels of TAG normally observed only after N deprivation. Reduced growth rates accompanied NoDGTT5 over-expression in CCMP1779. Constitutive expression of NoDGTT5 in Arabidopsis thaliana was accompanied by increased TAG content in seeds and leaves. A broad substrate specificity for NoDGTT5 was revealed, with preference for unsaturated acyl groups. Furthermore, NoDGTT5 was able to successfully rescue the Arabidopsis tag1-1 mutant by restoring the TAG content in seeds. Conclusions: Taken together, our results identified NoDGTT5 as the most promising gene for the engineering of TAG synthesis in multiple hosts among the 13 DGAT-encoding genes of N. oceanica CCMP1779. Consequently, this study demonstrates the potential of NoDGTT5 as a tool for enhancing the energy density in biomass by increasing TAG content in transgenic crops used for biofuel production. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Land availability for growing feedstocks at scale is a crucial concern for the bioenergy industry. Feedstock production on land not well-suited to growing conventional crops, or marginal land, is often promoted as ideal, although there is a poor understanding of the qualities, quantity, and distribution of marginal lands in the United States. We examine the spatial distribution of land complying with several key marginal land definitions at the United States county, agro-ecological zone, and national scales, and compare the ability of both marginal land and land cover data sets to identify regions for feedstock production. We conclude that very few land parcels comply with multiple definitions of marginal land. Furthermore, to examine possible carbon-flow implications of feedstock production on land that could be considered marginal per multiple definitions, we model soil carbon changes upon transitions from marginal cropland, grassland, and cropland-pastureland to switchgrass production for three marginal land-rich counties. Our findings suggest that total soil organic carbon changes per county are small, and generally positive, and can influence life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of switchgrass ethanol.

AB  - Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed in the photooxidation of diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, and 20% biodiesel fuel/80% diesel fuel mixture, are prepared under high-NOx conditions in the presence and absence of sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), and relative humidity (RH). The composition of condensed-phase organic compounds in SOA is measured using several complementary techniques including aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), high-resolution nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-DESI/HRMS), and ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy 21T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (21T FT-ICR MS). Results demonstrate that sulfuric acid and condensed organosulfur species formed in photooxidation experiments with SO2 are present in the SOA particles. Fewer organosulfur species are formed in the high humidity experiments, performed at RH 90%, in comparison with experiments done under dry conditions. There is a strong overlap of organosulfur species observed in this study with previous field and chamber studies of SOA. Many MS peaks of organosulfates (R-OS(O)2OH) previously designated as biogenic or of unknown origin in field studies might have originated from anthropogenic sources, such as photooxidation of hydrocarbons present in diesel and biodiesel fuel.

AB  - Gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa) has potential as a biofuel/biomaterial crop in arid lands. Two years of biomass production data at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) field plots varied from 6700 kg/ha up to 14900 kg/ha with an average of 9950 kg/ha. Gumweed was planted in 4 m × 4 m plots at spacings of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 37 cm with three replications each. Acetone extraction of the ground, dried biomass yielded about 12.5% extractable hydrocarbons, called biocrude or crude resin. Approximately 52% of the biocrude extract consists of the C20 diterpene acid grindelic acid, which is also approximately 6.5% of the dried plant biomass. Additional carboxylic acids bring the total carboxylic acid fraction to approximately 68% of the biocrude. Also found in the biocrude is approximately 4.7% monoterpenes, including pinene, limonene, germacrene, elemene, and camphene. Acid-catalyzed methylation of the biocrude followed by hexane extraction and removal of the hexane and remaining methanol produced an approximately 72.5% yield of biofuel materials from the original extract. This mixture contained the methyl esters of the carboxylic acids, terpenes, and other unidentified compounds. When mixed with diesel fuel up to 20%, this blend produced a biofuel that met biofuel standards, although viscosity issues limit the percentage of gumweed biocrude that can be used in the blend. Grindelic acid methyl ester and a second ester produced during the acid-catalyzed methylation reaction (also identified as grindelic acid by GC-MS) eluted toward the end of a diesel fuel chromatogram. The Grindelia biofuel materials can be produced up to 1290 L/ha on a biennial basis, which is equivalent to 138 gal/acre, when extracted in hexane. This potential fuel can be produced on the arid lands of Nevada with minimal inputs of water, nutrients, and other agricultural services. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - What factors drive labor substitution in the biofuels sector? Can labor substitution engender positive environmental outcomes, such as decreasing carbon emissions? Using the Brazilian sugar–ethanol industry as a case study, this article examines the motivations and consequences of substituting machine harvesters for cane-cutters and ending field burning. Not only does this article interrogate key claims from techno-optimistic and sociological theories of environmental change on how and why producers adopt new practices, but it also highlights the role of labor in processes of environmental change. Using a multi-sited ethnographic method, I collected data in 3 ethanol-producing states in Brazil, where I interviewed 61 mill managers, variety breeders, consultants, and producer syndicate officials and conducted observations at 9 mills. Two main findings emerge. First, labor challenges with farmworkers, not environmental authority, were the primary motivations for changing production practices. Second, although new practices generated positive environmental effects locally, such gains are likely to vanish at the regional level since an expanding industrial sector, with its new employment opportunities, undergirded and made viable mechanization in the biofuels sector. Overall, this article is an empirical account of how an emerging market economy seeks to balance climate change mitigation with an active development agenda. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident, alternative energy paths have been discussed for Japan, but except for a few studies the assumption is usually made that Japan is too densely populated to be suited for a near-100% sustainable, indigenous energy provision. The studies emphasizing renewable energy have proposed the use of photovoltaic power as the main source of electricity supply, in combination with diurnal battery storage and supplemented by other renewable sources such as wind, hydro, and geothermal power. Here, an alternative approach is explored, with wind and derived hydrogen production as the main energy source, but still using solar energy, biofuels, and hydropower in a resilient combination allowing full satisfaction of demands in all sectors of the economy, i.e., for dedicated electricity, transportation energy as well as heat for processes and comfort. Furthermore, the possible advantage of establishing a regional energy system with energy interchange and coordinated management of the mix of renewable energy resources across a wider region is discussed. As the closest neighbor, the energy system of South Korea is considered, first regarding the possibility of a similar full renewable energy reliance, and then for possible synergetic effects of connecting the Korean and the Japanese energy systems, in order to be able to better cope with the intermittency of renewable energy source flows. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper presents the development and evaluation of three fuzzy neural network (FNN) models for a full-scale anaerobic digestion system treating paper-mill wastewater. The aim was the investigation of feasibility of the approach-based control system for the prediction of effluent quality and biogas production from an internal circulation (IC) anaerobic reactor system. To improve FNN performance, fuzzy subtractive clustering was used to identify model's architecture and optimize fuzzy rule, and a total of 5 rules were extracted in the IF-THEN format. Findings of this study clearly indicated that, compared to NN models, FNN models had smaller RMSE and MAPE as well as bigger R for the testing datasets than NN models. The proposed FNN model produced smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance on forecasting of both effluent quality and biogas (methane) production rates with satisfactory determination coefficients greater than 0.90. From the results, it was concluded that FNN modeling could be applied in IC anaerobic reactor for predicting the biodegradation and biogas production using paper-mill wastewater. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article traces European Union (EU) biofuels policy development from the late 1990s through to 2015, demonstrating the effects of the early multiple rationales for biofuels in generating both self-reinforcing processes of policy continuity as well as self-undermining processes of policy discontinuity. It argues that features of the EU political and institutional context–most importantly, institutional imperatives for a consensus across multiple EU decision-making bodies and the provision of institutionalised opportunities for policy reviews–are deeply implicated in both self-reinforcing and self-undermining feedback processes. The shift in the balance away from self-reinforcing feedback processes to self-undermining processes after 2009 is explained by the interaction of biofuel interpretive feedbacks with contextual changes, including processes of knowledge accumulation regarding the negative environmental impacts of food-based biofuels. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biofuels are an important component in the suite of renewable energy alternatives but their development trajectory has been fraught with controversy. This study investigated the representation of biofuels in political cartoons on the Internet. Political cartoons have relied on informative, persuasive, and performative attributes to engender critical reflection and mobilize action. We analyzed a corpus of 130 relevant cartoons obtained through Google Images which were then thematically categorized. The problems highlighted in these cartoons focused on the social injustices arising from the diversion of food sources to fuel, the environmental destruction arising from deforestation, the unfulfilled expectations for climate change mitigation, and the policy contradictions that emerged. We suggest that political cartoons’ discursive dimensions allow us to make immediate connections between the image and our cultural stores of meaning, while at the same time further elucidate the dilemmas and contradictions embedded in the public's interface with biofuels as an environmental issue. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Vegetable oils became a very popular bioliquid for renewable power and transport applications. At local level, the short chain production of vegetable oils is currently important in terms of sustainability and use of rural area. This present work investigates the development of vegetable oils production chain in the Tuscany territory, focusing also to valorisation of the co-products (i.e., oil cake). The work is based on the study of the cultivation of rapeseed and sunflower, and the creation of an extraction plant based on cold-screw pressing technology, in order to obtain a raw vegetable oil suitable as biofuel. The German DIN 51623 standard was adopted to investigate the quality of vegetable oils obtained from different oil crops. Vegetable oils quality was evaluated by comparing the oil produced by a bench press at lab scale, comparing the results in terms of process yields and lipid fraction recovered. Due to the high phosphorous content of rapeseed oil, out of the DIN limits, an experimental procedure to remove P content and restore the oxidation stability of the oils was performed. The results showed a substantial P reduction by adding 2 wt% of P-removing additive. The oil cake properties were evaluated in view of its potential use for bioenergy production, in particular in terms of metals content.

AB  - Emissions of black carbon (BC), a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass, are high in the Asia-Pacific region, yet input pathways and rates to the ocean are not well constrained. Atmospheric and riverine inputs of BC in Halong Bay (Vietnam), a hotspot of atmospheric BC, were studied at monthly intervals during one year. Climate in Halong Bay is governed by the monsoon regime, characterized by a northeast winter monsoon (dry season) and southeast summer monsoon (wet season). During the dry season, atmospheric BC concentrations averaged twice those observed during the wet season. In the sea surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (ULW), concentrations of particulate BC (PBC) averaged 539 and 11 µmol C L –1 , respectively. Dissolved BC (DBC) concentrations averaged 2.6 µmol C L –1 in both the SML and ULW. Seasonal variations indicated that PBC concentration in the SML was controlled by atmospheric deposition during the dry season, while riverine inputs controlled both PBC and DBC concentrations in ULW during the wet season. Spatiotemporal variations of PBC and DBC during the wet season suggest that river runoff was efficient in transporting PBC that had accumulated on land during the dry season, and in mobilizing and transporting DBC to the ocean. The annual river flux of PBC was about 3.8 times higher than that of DBC. The monsoon regime controls BC input to Halong Bay by favoring dry deposition of BC originating from the north during the dry season, and wet deposition and river runoff during the wet season. High PBC concentrations seem to enhance the transfer of organic carbon from dissolved to particulate phase by adsorbing dissolved organic carbon and stimulating aggregation. Such processes may impact the availability and biogeochemical cycling of other dissolved substances, including nutrients, for the coastal marine ecosystem. Copyright: © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aldehydes are major intermediates in oxidation and pyrolysis of hydrocarbons and particularly biofuels. While the high temperature oxidation chemistry of C3-C5 aldehydes have been studied in the literature, a comprehensive low temperature kinetics remains unaddressed. In this work, acetaldehyde, propanal, and 2-propenal (acrolein) oxidation was investigated at lowerature combustion condition (500-700 K). The isomer-specific product concentrations as well as the time-resolved profiles were studied using Sandia's multiplexed photoionization mass spectroscopy (MPIMS) with synchrotron radiation from the advanced light source (ALS). The laser-pulsed photolysis generates chlorine atoms which react with aldehydes to form the parent radicals. In the presence of excess oxygen, these radicals react with O2 and form RO2 radicals. The temperature-dependent product yields are determined for 500 K to 700 K and the competition between the channels contributing to the formation of each product is discussed. In acetaldehyde oxidation, the formation of the main products is associated with HO2 elimination channel from QOOH or direct H atom elimination from the parent radicals. In propanal oxidation, the most intensive signal peak was associated with acetaldehyde (m/z = 44) which was formed through the reaction of α′-R with O2.The α′-RO2 intermediate decomposes to acetaldehyde+OH+CO via Waddington mechanism and formation of five-member ring transition state. In 2-propenal oxidation, the unsaturated radical produced from α-R reacts with O2 to form the primary products. © 2017 by ASME.

AB  - Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass helps to mitigate climate change and alleviate our reliance on fossil fuels. Great efforts have been made to produce biofuels in an economical way. However, high cost is still a major limitation for industrial production of biofuels. In this context, consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) renders a possible strategy to lower the total cost by integrating enzyme production, sugar release, and biofuel fermentation into a single unit operation. A robust CBP system entails an efficient enzyme system to liberate sugars from lignocellulosic biomass and for conversion of both hexoses and pentoses into desired biofuels with satisfying yield and productivity. It is quite difficult for a single wild-type microorganism to perform several different tasks simultaneously without compromising conversion efficiency. Metabolically engineered microbes, microbial consortia, or combination of these two approaches may outperform a single wild-type CBP strain. Engineering a single strain or consortia with desired traits requires detailed knowledge of mechanisms of enzyme action, deep insights into the interaction between different enzymes and discovery of novel metabolic pathways and enzymes. This review covers enzyme systems involved in CBP, potential wild-type CBP strains, strategies for engineering a CBP strain or consortium, as well as major barriers for conducting CBP. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus is wildly cultivated as a potential biofuel feedstock around the world; however, the narrow genetic basis and sterile characteristics have become a limitation for its utilization. As a progenitor of M. × giganteus, M. sinensis is widely distributed around East Asia providing well abiotic stress tolerance. To enrich the M. sinensis genomic databases and resources, we sequenced and annotated the transcriptome of M. sinensis by using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Approximately 316 million high-quality trimmed reads were generated from 349 million raw reads, and a total of 114,747 unigenes were obtained after de novo assembly. Furthermore, 95,897 (83.57%) unigenes were annotated to at least one database including NR, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, GO, and NT, supporting that the sequences obtained were annotated properly. Differentially expressed gene analysis indicates that drought stress 15 days could be a critical period for M. sinensis response to drought stress. The high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of M. sinensis under drought stress has greatly enriched the current genomic available resources. The comparison of DEGs under different periods of drought stress identified a wealth of candidate genes involved in drought tolerance regulatory networks, which will facilitate further genetic improvement and molecular studies of the M. sinensis. © 2017 Gang Nie et al.

AB  - The global interest in biofuels production is agued to have substantial impacts on food security. A slew of studies have identified a nexus between biofuel production intensification and food price hikes in the international market. Regardless of the results of these studies, global biofuels production keeps increasing and it is projected to escalate even further within the next decade. A major concern is that some sub-Saharan African countries with food security worries have policies to enhance the production and use of first generation biofuels. In view of that, this paper examines the potential consequences of diverting food and agricultural lands for biofuels production with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. It reviews the current and projected trends in the production of biofuels and trade of feedstocks, analyses the potential of "food gap", land use change and associated carbon emissions and the effects on biodiversity and water resources within the region. In conclusion, the study accentuates the doubt on the potential of first generation biofuels as a realistic source of energy particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as it could have substantial effects on the regions' food security as well as on its natural resource. It also suggests ways to enhance the sustainability of the region's biofuel policies to maximize welfare gains and enhance food security. © Renewable Energy Research, 2017.

AB  - Biofuel feedstock development is in limelight because of its pronounced capability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The move towards renewable energy intensified researches to provide concrete attestations that could be benefited from the effort. This research assessed the GHG reduction potential of biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas L., relative to that of the conventional petroleum diesel. Computations were based on a standard 30-MLPY biodiesel plant with a co-generation facility, utilizing the byproducts of the process for electricity production. The GHG emissions were standardized and presented as equivalent carbon dioxide emission (CO2e). The boundary set for the analysis was from cradle to grave, considering the life-cycle from the production of the feedstock to the production of biodiesel, and eventually, its end-use. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) resulted to a negative net carbon footprint due to the carbon dioxide sequestration capability of the Jatropha plants. The whole system has a net CO2e footprint equivalent to 1,706,365.26 Mg CO2e a-1. Without considering the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants, LCA of Jatropha biodiesel is still about 25% cleaner than petroleum diesel fuel. With sequestration, the GHG emission reduction can go as high as 548.38%. With the current Philippine biodiesel blending of 2%, if Jatropha methyl ester was used for the blending, this study shows that emission can be cut by 11%. And with increase in the blending, a more positive amount of savings will be achieved, which if at B100, savings could go as high as 581.18%. © 2017, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

AB  - The lack of sustainability and negative environmental impacts of using fossil fuel resources for energy production and their consequent increase in prices during last decades have led to an increasing interest in the development of renewable biofuels. Among possible biomass fuel sources, microalgae represent one of the most promising solutions. The present work is based on the implementation of a model that facilitates identification of optimal geographic locations for large-scale open ponds for microalgae cultivation for biofuels production. The combination of a biomass production model with specific site location parameters such as irradiance, geographical constraints, land use, topography, temperatures and CO2 for biofuels plants were identified in Sicily (Italy). A simulation of CO2 saved by using the theoretical biofuel produced in place of traditional fuel was implemented. Results indicate that the territory of Sicily offers a good prospective for these technologies and the results identify ideal locations for locating biomass fuel production facilities. Moreover, the research provides a robust method that can be tailored to the specific requirements and data availability of other territories. © Research India Publications.

AB  - This paper explores the determinants of biofuel energy consumption for 12 OECD countries over the period 2002-2012. While a growing literature has examined the determinants of aggregate renewable energy consumption, studies on the drivers of disaggregated renewable energy consumption are scarce. Thus, this study fills the gap by focusing on biofuel energy consumption for OECD countries. Results reveals that biofuel energy consumption depends on real income, CO2 emissions, oil prices and biofuel prices, however, impact of income and CO2 emissions is more pronounced than that of biofuel and oil prices. Moreover, results depict that carbon emissions affect is negative on biofuel consumption and granger causes without feedback, suggesting that biofuels are not able to mitigate carbon emissions. Based on results, it is suggested to stimulate the development and deployment of advanced biofuels. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The analysis of biological resources for biofuels production in Ukraine has been carried out, and it has been shown that usage of alternative energy sources has great potential for substantially improving energy supply of the state and solving environmental problems. The directions of development and new technologies of obtaining motor fuels from biomass are systematized. It has been established that usage of different types of biofuels and their mixtures for feeding internal combustion engines involves application of modified engines in terms of structure and algorithms and usage of traditional designs of cars without significant structural changes. Moreover, the impact of biofuels on the efficient operation of the engine requires further integrated research.

AB  - The continued expansion in the use of bioenergy is vital if the EU is to achieve its targets for renewable energy in 2020 and 2030. Several Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) are candidates for accession to the EU and this potential enlargement of the Union could extend the production of bioenergy to this region. This research explores the impacts of policies, regulatory frameworks, legislative environment and the role of civil society organizations in shaping the biofuel investment climate in CEECs. Specifically, we bring to light aspects that could hinder the potential introduction and development of bioenergy in the CEECs by using the Republic of Macedonia as the case study. We find the predominant resisting factors to bioenergy projects in the CEECs to be - legislative vacillations, regulatory reservations in EU policies, uncertainties in biofuel targets for the post-2020 phase and aggressive lobbying by the civil society on grounds of sustainability of biofuels. We believe that, for advanced biofuel projects to succeed in the CEECs, the challenge does not lie in commercialization of an unproven, new-to-market technology; the real test will be to see if relevant stakeholders can shape the narratives adopted by the EU for its post-2020 phase of the Renewable Energy Directive and ensure that the Government of Macedonia complies with its provisions.

AB  - Sugarbeet is being considered as one of the most viable feedstock alternatives to corn for biofuel production since herbicide-resistant energy beets were deregulated by the USDA in 2012. Growing sugarbeets for biofuel production may have significant impacts on soil health and water quality in the north-central regions of the U.S., where 50% of the nation's total sugarbeets were produced in 2015. Almost all the current sugarbeet models simulate only plant growth and yield but have no capability to simulate the effects of sugarbeet production on soil and water quality. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) is a widely used model that simulates crop yield, water flow, and transport of salts and nitrogen in crop fields. RZWQM is currently linked to 23 specific crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4.0, not including a sugarbeet model. In this study, the Crop and Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES) in RZWQM was adapted for sugarbeet simulation to model the soil and water quality impact of sugarbeet for biofuel production. The Beet model was then evaluated against dryland sugarbeet production at the Carrington Research and Extension Station (North Dakota) in 2014 and 2015. The PEST (Parameter ESTimation) tool in RZWQM was used for parameter estimation and sensitivity and identifiability analysis. The model did reasonably well in both 2014 (d-statistic = 0.709 to 0.992; rRMSE = 0.066 to 1.211) and 2015 (d-statistic = 0.733 to 0.990; rRMSE = 0.043 to 0.930) in terms of simulating leaf area index, top weight, root weight, soil water content, and soil nitrates. Under dry conditions, the most sensitive soil parameters were soil bulk densities and saturated hydraulic conductivities in different layers. Identifiability analysis also showed that three to five model parameters may be identifiable by calibration datasets. RZWQM enhanced with a sugarbeet module and its parameter analysis can be used for water use optimization under dryland conditions.

AB  - Biodiesel is a very attractive, biodegradable, renewable, and virtually nontoxic form of fuel. It is derived through base-catalysed transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Analysis of biodiesel has become relevant, since the higher quality of the fuel is a key factor in commercialisation and market acceptance. The analytical methods employed are being constantly improved to meet this requirement. The most popular techniques for analysis of biodiesel include mainly chromatography and molecular spectroscopy. FTIR infrared spectroscopy is one of the most important spectroscopic techniques. The article presents the results of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and FTIR infrared spectroscopy analysis employed for investigating methyl esters of higher fatty acids obtained with laboratory methods from selected sunflower and rapeseed oils and waste animal fats provided by a slaughterhouse. Commercial methyl esters were included in the analyses for comparison. In all samples, the contents of free glycerol, methanol, esters, and linolenic acid methyl ester in FAME were determined mainly to facilitate the spectroscopic analysis. The results of the investigations conducted with the aforementioned methods clearly indicate that the analysed WCO esters can be successfully used as potential industrial-scale biofuels. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - Bio-energy (like other renewable energy sources) is proposed as a solution for climate change and other energy-related and economic issues. The predominant production model, however, which is based on firstgeneration biofuels developed on a global scale, creates ecological impacts throughout the production chain, resulting in a sustainability paradox, as well as social unrest and territorial conflict. Therefore, attention here is focussed on agro-energy and second-generation biofuels, investigating the structural differences the advantages, the potential problems and the possible solutions of some local biofuel initiatives in North Western Europe. Finally, we propose a regional agrarian model to avoid the impacts and contradictions of the global industrial model, to produce a better ecological balance at both the local and the global levels, and to improve the democratic character of energy governance. In addition, we suggest a paradigmatic reading to better understand the cultural, political and socio-economic implications of the two models.

AB  - Using second generation of biofuel that does not affect food crop production is an issue of global concern. Remote sensing (RS) proved to be efficient technique for inventory and monitoring the spatial distribution of biofuel plants at both local and regional scales. It is used also for site selection of the most suitable sites for the plantation of these plants through the integration of multi spatial layers. Spectral identification of these plants and the relationship between spectral and morphological parameters were not observed. This work is considered the first step of a series of studies deals with the identification of the spectroscopic parameters and their relation with morphological parameters of the most common Egyptian natural vegetation. At this stage, two sources of fossil oil plants Jatropha and Jojoba were investigated. Spectral reflectance was measured using ASD spectroradiometer device and the spectral signature was identified for the two taxa. Secondly, optimal spectral zone and wavelength/s were identified for each sample. A Strong relation was found between chlorophyll content and spectral reflectance at visible spectral region. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was found to be highly correlated with chlorophyll content. Further work will be carried out to quantitatively relate the amount of ingredient fossil oil of these plants with spectroscopic characteristics.

AB  - Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) A.J. Scott is a dicotyledonous halophyte that grows in areas with an arid climate such as the marshes of southern Spain. The species has potential uses for saline agriculture and biofuel production, but the effects of salt stress on its nutrition and physiology remain unclear. Plants of S. fruticosa were grown in pots with a mixture of sphagnum peat-moss and Perlite. In order to evaluate the effects of different levels of salinity, five treatments using different NaCl concentrations (10 (control), 60, 100, 200 and 300mM NaCl) were applied over a period of 60 days. At the end of the experiment, the dry weight, the biomass allocation and the tissue water content were measured for each salinity treatment. The net uptake of various nutrients and their translocation rates were calculated for each salt treatment. Salt loss, shedding of plant parts and succulence in shoots were evaluated together with the K+/Na+ ratio, K-Na selectivity, concentrations of osmolytes and their estimated contributions to the osmotic potential. Our results showed that S. fruticosa can maintain its major physiological processes at 60mM NaCl without significant dry weight reduction. Higher salinity resulted in negative values for net uptake and translocation rates from roots to shoots of N and P. As might be predicted from other dicotyledonous halophytes, S. fruticosa plants increased Cl- and Na+ uptake using both as osmotica instead of organic osmolytes. However, to survive salinity, this species has also evolved others mechanisms such as shedding old shoots, increased succulence in shoots at higher salt concentrations and the ability to maintain a lower K+/Na+ ratio and higher K-Na selectivity in all organs.

AB  - Human population has dramatically increased in the past few decades, stretching finite fossil fuel resources. Renewable energy is an alternative and solution to growing energy demands. Among all renewable energy resources, bioethanol and biodiesel seem to be the future’s energy resources. Biofuels can be produced from various feedstocks comprising energy crops, non-food crops, and algae. In this review, we have described biofuel production using algae. Algae, a third generation fuel crop, can be used for both bioethanol and biodiesel production. Besides biofuel, algae can also be used for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceutical products. Algae can serve as a good source of biomass for biofuel production, however, to be economically viable, optimized methods for growth conditions, harvesting, and oil extraction should be employed. Furthermore, we have described the genomic strategies to improve algae strains for its photosynthetic ability and rate of photosynthesis. © Begell House Inc., 2017.

AB  - Aims: Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a major agricultural waste product of Malaysia. The aim of this study was to identify endophytic fungi capable of producing biofuel feedstock utilizing POME. Methodology and results: Endophytes were isolated from the Nipah palm tree, Nypa fruticans, and exposed to different POME concentrations (25%, 50% and 75%), with and without the addition of nutrients. The utilization of glucose was measured using the Dinitrosalicylic Acid assay whereas the lipid content in the fungal cells was extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method with slight modifications. Three endophytic fungi that displayed the highest growth on POME were identified using ITS 1 and 4 primers and found to be related to Pestalotiopsis sp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Rhizoctonia bataticola. Nutrient addition caused an average increase of 8 times in biomass, indicating nitrogen requirement for cell proliferation. The highest POME concentration (75%) resulted in lower biomass yield. Furthermore, all fungal samples in high POME concentration and nutrient conditions showed a decrease in lipids accumulated per milligram of biomass whereby lipid synthesis was enhanced under nitrogen limitation (25% without nutrients). Conclusion, significance and impact of study: In conclusion, all fungal samples can be classified as oleaginous microorganisms with Pestalotipsis sp. being the most efficient (up to 70% of its biomass). This is to our knowledge the first study that shows the potential use of Pestalotiopsis sp., L. theobromae and R. bataticola for the utilisation of POME as biofuel feedstock and could in the future potentially provide an alternative approach to the treatment of POME with value-added effect.

AB  - The revolutionized economic growth, immense mobility and energy dependent lifestyles of the humankind have raised several new trends on the face of the earth. Exploration and development of renewable energy sources has become one of the leading research areas. Several attempts have been made to develop renewable energy sources, but high production cost of biomass-based biofuels is still a great challenge with issues, such as low yields, substantial feedback inhibition and limited stress tolerance. On the one hand, the inherent difficulty in conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels calls for development of robust biofuel-producing microbes. On the other hand, recent advances in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics and genome-editing tools have enabled us to develop deep understanding of microbial pathways followed by targeted engineering of the key genes involved. In this chapter, development of yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and various bacteria for renewable energy production is summarized. Besides conventional metabolic engineering methods, we mainly focused on the employment of synthetic biology–based genetic engineering strategies for the bioconversion of renewable feedstocks. The development of xylose assimilating and stress tolerant S. cerevisiae strains is discussed in particular. Moreover, the latest development of S. cerevisiae strains with CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing tool is also summarized. This chapter is an effort to provide insights for further development of biofuels producers using advanced genome-editing technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Interplanting a cellulosic bioenergy crop (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L.) between loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) rows could potentially provide a sustainable source of bio-feedstock without competing for land currently in food production. The objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the concentrations and loads of drainage water nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (phosphate) associated with establishment and growth of switchgrass treatments and compare them with those for a mid-rotation pine forest (control), and (2) quantify the treatment effects on drainage water N and phosphate compared to the control and compare the effects between treatments, i.e., switchgrass intercropped into young loblolly pine (IC) and switchgrass only (SG). Thinned mid-rotation loblolly pine with natural understory (MP) was used as the control. Pretreatment calibration equations for nutrients were obtained using a paired watershed approach and bootstrap geometric regression with 2007-2008 data, when pine on all sites had reached canopy closure. Treatment effects on IC and SG were calculated as the difference between expected respective values from the pretreatment relationship and measured data for the treatment period. Precipitation, outflow, and N and phosphate concentrations in the outflow were measured during calibration (Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2008), site preparation for switchgrass establishment (Nov. 2009 to Mar. 2012), and switchgrass growth (Apr. 2012 to Apr. 2014). Mean NO3-N concentrations and loads were significantly (α = 0.05) greater for SG than for IC during the switchgrass growth period. Average treatment concentrations with standard errors and total load effects during switchgrass growth for NO3-N followed the trends SG (-0.002 ±0.01 mg L-1) &gt; IC (-0.12 ±0.04 mg L-1) and SG (0.75kg ha-1) &gt; IC (0.23kg ha-1), respectively. For phosphate average concentrations and loads, the treatment effects during switchgrass growth followed the trends SG (-0.004 ±0.0 mg L-1) &gt;IC (-0.02 ±0.0 mg L-1) and IC (-0.43 kg ha-1) &gt; SG (- 0.70 kg ha-1), respectively. Average concentration effects for NO3-N and phosphate and total load effects for phosphate significantly (α = 0.05) decreased for IC compared to the MP control. These results suggest that the intercropping treatment (IC) with loblolly pine and switchgrass improved water quality by reducing NO3-N and phosphate concentrations and phosphate loads. © 2017 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - In this paper, a biofuel production supply chain optimization framework is developed that can supply the fuel demand for 10% of Ontario. Different biomass conversion technologies are considered, such as pyrolysis and gasification and subsequent hydro processing and the Fischer-Tropsch process. A supply chain network approach is used for the modeling, which enables the optimization of both the biorefinery locations and the associated transportation networks. Gasification of corn stover is examined to convert waste biomass into valuable fuel. Biomass-derived fuel has several advantages over traditional fuels including substantial greenhouse gas reduction, generating higher quality synthetic fuels, providing a use for biomass waste, and potential for use without much change to existing infrastructure. The objective of this work is to show the feasibility of the use of corn stover as a biomass feedstock to a hydrocarbon biofuel supply chain in Ontario using a mixed-integer linear programming model while accounting for the uncertainty in the availability of corn stover. In the case study, the exact number of biorefineries is left as a policy decision and the optimization is carried out over a range of the possible numbers of facilities. The results obta ined from the case study suggests implementing gasification technology followed by Fischer-Tropsch at two different sites in Ontario. The optimal solution satisfied 10% of the yearly fuel demand of Ontario with two production plants (14.8 billion L of fuel) a nd requires an investment of $42.9 billion, with a payback period of about 3 years. © 2017 BRTeam.

AB  - Biogas production from animal waste is an economically viable way to reduce environmental pollution and produce valuable products, i.e., methane and a nutrient-rich organic waste product. An anaerobic digestion reactor for biogas production from pig waste was sampled at the entrance, middle (digestion chamber), and exit of a digester, while the bacterial and archaeal community structure was studied by 16S rRNA gene metagenomics. The number of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU)-97% was 3-7 times larger than that of archaeal ones. Bacteria and Archaea found in feces of animals (e.g., Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Methanosarcina, Methanolobus, Methanosaeta, and Methanospirillum) dominated the entrance of the digester. The digestion chamber was dominated by anaerobic sugar-fermenting OP9 bacteria and the syntrophic bacteria Candidatus Cloacamonas (Waste Water of Evry 1; WWE1). The methanogens dominant in the digestion chamber were the acetoclastic Methanosaeta and the hydrogenothrophic Methanoculleus and Methanospirillum. Similar bacterial and archaeal groups that dominated in the middle of the digestion chamber were found in the waste that left the digester. Predicted functions associated with degradation of xenobiotic compounds were significantly different between the sampling locations. The microbial community found in an anaerobic digestion reactor loaded with pig manure contained microorganisms with biochemical capacities related to the 4 phases of methane production. © 2017 S.

AB  - This study investigates stakeholder knowledge, attitudes, and public perception concerning biofuels as an enabler towards a bio-based economy. In innovation and adoption studies, perceptions play a critical role in the acceptance of a technology. Biofuels have been touted as a clean fuel with an ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously creating employment and growing economies. South Africa is in the process of transitioning towards a bio-based economy. Accordingly, policies and institutions have been developed to promote biofuels production and distribution. Knowledge, at-titude and perception (KAP) surveys were carried out to deepen knowledge and understanding of the stakeholder's KAP. Emails as well as telephonic and group interviews based on open questions and social media were used to gather data. The study employed cluster, purposive random and snowball sampling to select the participants with descriptive statistics, thematic analysis and discourse analysis used to analyse the data. The study found that the introduction of biofuels presents many opportunities and benefits for the economy and unlocking the po-tentials for rural entrepreneurs. Stakeholders have concerns and issues regarding the use of biofuels on their internal combustion engines. The study recommends proper communication and education should be done on the benefits of biofuels in a biobased economy.

AB  - An increasing awareness of the negative environmental cost associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and concerns over the geopolitical instability of the main oil producing regions is driving the development of renewable energy sources and biofuels. Use of solid biofuels made of different types of biomass became perspective alternative to conventional fuels in many countries. Such positive indicators as low cost of the final product that meets the quality of standards, not capital intensive production, possibility of producing briquettes/pellets from almost any agricultural waste or combination of raw materials are undoubted advantages of biomass based fuels. The main challenges for Tajikistan’s energy sector, which is depended on energy imports, are: to increase energy supply through better exploitation of hydropower and other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and primary biofuels. Within the agricultural sector of Tajikistan, which is highly agrarian country, cotton accounts for 60% of agricultural output. According to the Ministry of Agriculture of Tajikistan 199,400 hectares of lands have been allocated to cotton cultivation in the year of 2014. Plenty of unused cotton residual biomass could be effectively utilized for winter heating in rural areas. The main focus of the research was to investigate and assess physical, chemical and mechanical properties of pellets and briquettes produced form cotton waste biomass. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Background: Domain of Unknown Function 266 (DUF266) is a plant-specific domain. DUF266-containing proteins (DUF266 proteins) have been categorized as ‘not classified glycosyltransferases (GTnc)’ due to amino acid similarity with GTs. However, little is known about the function of DUF266 proteins. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DUF266 proteins are only present in the land plants including moss and lycophyte. We report the functional characterization of one member of DUF266 proteins in Populus, PdDUF266A. PdDUF266A was ubiquitously expressed with high abundance in the xylem. In Populus transgenic plants overexpress-ing PdDUF266A (OXPdDUF266A), the glucose and cellulose contents were significantly higher, while the lignin content was lower than that in the wild type. Degree of polymerization of cellulose in OXPdDUF266A transgenic plants was also higher, whereas cellulose crystallinity index remained unchanged. Gene expression analysis indicated that cellulose biosynthesis-related genes such as CESA and SUSY were upregulated in mature leaf and xylem of OXPdDUF266A transgenic plants. Moreover, PdDUF266A overexpression resulted in an increase of biomass production. Their glucose contents and biomass phenotypes were further validated via heterologous expression of PdDUF266A in Arabidopsis. Results from saccharification treatment demonstrated that the rate of sugar release was increased by approximately 38% in the OXPdDUF266A transgenic plants. Conclusions: These results suggest that the overexpression of PdDUF266A can increase cellulose content, reduce recalcitrance, and enhance biomass production, and that PdDUF266A is a promising target for genetic manipulation for biofuel production. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - The vast majority of the biofuels presently used in the EU are so called first generation biofuels produced from crops. Concerns of food security, displacement of food crop production and indirect land use change (iLUC) has led to the introduction of measures to reduce the use of first generations biofuels and promote so called advanced biofuels based on feedstock that does not compete with food/feed crops, such as waste and agricultural residues. In Sweden, 60% of the biofuel consumption is already based on waste/residual feedstock, and a unique feature of the Swedish biofuel supply is the relatively large use of biogas for transport, representing 9% of the current use of biofuels. The use of waste/residues dominates the biogas production, but agricultural residues, representing a large domestic feedstock potential, are barely used at present. This could indicate that biofuels from such feedstock is non-competitive compared both to fossil fuels and to biofuels produced from crops and waste under existing policy framework. This study show that without subsidies, the production cost of biogas as biofuel from all non-food feedstocks investigated (grass, crop residues and manure) is higher than from food crops. A shift from food crops to residues, as desired according to EU directives, would thus require additional policy instruments favoring advanced biofuel feedstock. Investment or production subsidies must however be substantial in order for biogas from residues to be competitive with biogas from crops. © 2017 Mikael Lantz, et al.

AB  - Olive crop and olive oil industry generates several residues, i.e., olive tree pruning biomass (OTPB), extracted olive pomace (EOP) and olive leaves (OL) that could be used to produce high-added value products in an integrated biorefinery. OTPB is generated in the field as a result of pruning operation to remove old branches; EOP is the main residue of the pomace olive oil extracting industry after extraction with hexane of residual oil contained in olive pomace; and OL comes from the olive cleaning process carried out at olive mills, where small branches and leaves are separated by density. In this work, an analysis of the potential of OTPB, EOP and OL residues was addressed by estimating the production volumes at national level and the spatial distribution of these residues using geographic information system software. Information provided by public institutions and personal surveys to the industries was evaluated. Moreover, chemical analysis of the residues was undertaken and the results used to make a first assessment of valorization into biofuels such as bioethanol and bio based chemicals. Results show that close to 4.2 million tons/year of EOP, OL and OTPB derived from olive oil industry and olive tree cultivation in Spain could be available as a raw material for biorefineries in Spain. The analysis of the chemical characteristics indicates the relevant potential of these feedstocks for the production of bioethanol and other compounds such as phenols based on suitable processing and conversion routes, although techno-economic evaluations must be tackled to refine this approach. © 2017 INIA.

AB  - Background and Objective: Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) is a non-edible biodiesel producer plant that has a good prospect due to the higher seed production capacity and oil content. In addition, it also able to grow well under unfavourable environment. The study aimed to analyze the response of Reutealis trisperma (R. trisperma) to gold mined wastewater. Materials and Methods: Five varieties of R. trisperma i.e., Kemiri Minyak-1 (KM1), Kemiri Minyak-2 (KM2), Kermindo-1 (KD1), Kermindo-2 (KD2) and Harapan (HR) grown in water culture, were treated with wastewater from gold mining industry with concentration of 0, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mL for 2 weeks. Shoot and root growth, anatomy as well as some physiological characters were analyzed during the treatment. Results: Wastewater treatments for 14 days caused decrease of shoot growth and induced leaf yellowing of the plants. The treatments caused increase in malondialdehyde content up to 4 fold, while chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll of the plants decreased significantly. TEM analysis indicated that the root cell of plants exposed to highest concentration of wastewater started to degenerate and had higher number of mitochondria and peroxisome vesicles suggesting that the cellular respiration and anti-oxidative mechanism presumably became more active due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Conclusion: Gold mine wastewater treatment caused all the plants to undergo stress characterized by the increase of malondialdehyde and the decrease of chlorophyll content and leaf growth of R. trisperma, even though there was variation among the varieties. KM2 and KD2 had the best performance among all varieties in response to gold-mine wastewater. © 2017 Hamim Hamim et al.

AB  - Expansion of sugarcane crop due to the increasing demand for sugar and ethanol can affect both existing soil carbon (C) stocks, and subsequent input of new C from above and belowground biomass, influencing the overall C intensity and C payback times due to the change of land use. We present above and belowground dry biomass production, shoot-to-root ratio (S:R) as well as the net annual C inputs to the soil for sugarcane in different ratoon stages. The selected areas were as follows: (1) recently planted sugarcane area (PC), (2) first year ratoon cane (RC1) and (3) 4-year ratoon cane (RC4), which were established under Typic Quartzipsamments located in north-eastern São Paulo State. The sugarcane S:R ratios ranged from 6.6 in PC to 3.4 in RC4, and total sugarcane C inputs from 29.6 to 30.8 Mg C ha-1. The overall C balance for land use change requires effects on soil C and also C inputs from previous and future land uses. The sugarcane C input was between 3.7 and 4.0 Mg C ha-1 for each sugarcane cycle of 5 years. When accounting for soil C stock changes and aboveground biomass C losses from the prior land use, the payback times for sugarcane biofuel C debts are reduced by 3, 2 and 1 years for Cerrado wooded, Cerrado grassland and pasture conversions into sugarcane respectively, ©CSIRO 2017.

AB  - Biogenic ethanol from corn has proven effective as an oxygenate that improves gasoline engine performance. However, the US Renewable Fuel Portfolio legislation was written before shale gas became a huge technically recoverable resource in the US. This work investigates tapping this large methane resource as an alternative to biogenic ethanol. Recent technological advances have enabled inexpensive production of natural gas from shale that could be used for ethanol production instead of corn. This research compares these two options from several perspectives. Ethanol from corn is controversial because corn is a fundamental source for both human ingestion and as animal feed. As such, the ultimate objective has been to develop technologies for cellulosic ethanol produced from the plant residual biomass instead of the fruit or grains from the plant. However, so far these new technologies result in a much more expensive biofuel. Without cost-effective cellulosic ethanol, the amount of ethanol production is limited. The abundance of natural gas from shale could offer an alternative feedstock for ethanol production. Recent drops in natural gas price only improve the competitiveness of ethanol from natural gas over biofuels. In the current work, a comparison between two synthesis routes for fuel ethanol was conducted. The first route is the process chain using corn as the feedstock. The second is an alternative processing route using shale gas as the feedstock. The method applied is a life cycle comparison considering each of the following four environmental elements: water, atmosphere, land, and energy. While there are important impacts related to the interaction of these elements, this research will mainly focus on each element in segregation. The comparison shows that shale gas could be competitive to corn as feedstock for ethanol production. The results provide valuable arguments and tools for political discussions and decision making that could be useful for future energy policy development. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Algal biomass has recently attracted attention as a promising source for renewable energy production due to its capability to grow on non-arable land, and assist on carbon sequestration and wastewater remediation. Although algal biomass has the potential to be utilised as a feedstock for biorefinery, there have been no definite technological pathways adopted for algae processing and biofuels production. Thus, a technological screening framework using multi criteria decision making approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with feature scaling normalisation is proposed to select the optimum processing pathway for sustainable biofuels production of an algae-based biorefinery. The technological alternatives are evaluated by defining the main criteria of the system and assigning sub-criteria under each main criterion to analyse the impacts of each criterion on the biorefinery system. The main criteria considered in this study are economic viability, and environmental and safety impacts. The sub-criteria are evaluated using pairwise comparison matrices, whereby the inputs are the numerical data normalised using the feature scaling method. A case study is presented to illustrate the normalised AHP-based technological screening methodology. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Indirect land use change (iLUC) must be considered for bioconversion technologies. These technologies, such as corn-to-ethanol technologies, require land not only for the processing facility but also indirectly require land for the cultivation of the input biomass. There are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the transformation of the required land, such as forests or pastures, into cropland for the input biomass. iLUC emissions and effects have been examined on a cursory level in the literature, but deeper analysis is needed. We present an iLUC life cycle optimization model that integrates cutting-edge iLUC modeling techniques with optimization methodology. The model minimizes total GHG emissions, composed of direct and indirect processing emissions as well as iLUC emissions of the chosen biofuel production strategy. A case study considering production of 37.9 BL/y of bioethanol in the U.S. illustrates that iLUC emissions contribute to the life cycle GHG emissions of biofuels, even in optimal scenarios. The minimum realizable iLUC emissions rate is 1.5 g CO2-eq/MJ at this production level using corn stover as a feedstock. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Bioethanol is an excellent alternative for petrol and has long-term economic advantages over non-renewable liquid biofuels. Bioethanol can be produced from different biomass materials, and it is categorized into three generations by biomass. First generation bioethanol directly competes with food items while second generation bioethanol requires more land area and fertilizers. Bioethanol produced from algae comes under third generation bioethanol and has many advantages over first and second generation bioethanol. Algae have higher growth rates than plants and require less land area also they do not need additional fertilizers for their growth. Microalgae can fix atmospheric CO2 from the environment and assimilate it into lipid and carbohydrates which can be used as a substrate for biofuel production. In this work, microalgae Chlorella sp. was cultivated at 28oC and light intensity of 25μmol m-2 s-1 and used as a source of starch for bioethanol production. Chlorella starch was hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars by amylases produced from Aspergillus niger NCIM 616 for bioethanol production by yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM 3494. Mathematical modelling gave the insight to predict the experimental profiles of bioethanol production from algal biomass. Microbial growth, reducing sugar consumption, and bioethanol production were described quantitatively by using Logistic, Pirt, and Luedeking-Piret equations respectively. The equations used in modelling of the fermentation kinetics matched very well with the experimental profiles, thus concluding that ethanol production from algal starch hydrolysate was growth-associated under the evaluated conditions. © 2017 by the C.M.B.

AB  - The whole world is trying to increase energy production from renewable energy sources. Biomass, mainly solid fuel (e.g. wood chips, sawdust, etc.), takes first place in Lithuania’s efforts to increase energy production from renewables. There are a lot off studies about minimization of greenhouse gases (GHGs) during biomass combustion for energy production due to biogenic CO2. Unfortunately, such aspects as biofuel production, in-cluding biomass collection in harvesting sites, delivery to special interim sites, processing, produced biofuel transportation to combustion plants is rarely estimated in this studies. A considerable amount of diesel fuel is used within these processes by various mechanisms (e.g., skidders, tractors, crushers, chippers, etc.); therefo¬re woody biomass production and delivery processes have significant environmental impact to air quality and climate change due to air emissions (CO, NOx, NMVOC, PM, NH3) and GHGs (CO2, N2O, NH4) from off-road and road mobile sources. This paper presents the method of evaluation and results of analysis of material and energy flows of wood chips production from traditional raw materials – firewood and forest logging waste (residues). It was estimated that up to 0.038 toe of diesel fuel is used for one toe of produced woody biomass, incl. over 52% - for biofuel delivery to combustion plant; 0.293 kg of air emissions and over 22.5 kg of GHGs are emitted to the air during production of one tonne of wood chips. Results of comparison analysis show that in case of biofuel production from logging residues, volume of GHGs is 57% higher in comparison to wood chips are produced from firewood. Several recommendations how to minimize significant environmental impact due to usage of logging residues to energy purposes are presented in article. Received environmental indicators can be successfully used for further detailed life-cycle assessment of woody biomass production and usage for alternative energy. © Kaunas University of Technology.

AB  - This study assessed farmer’s perceptions about cultivating Agave tequilana for bio-ethanol production in Australia and its economic viability. This plant has been growing in Ayr, a trial site in Queensland, Australia. This study found both farmers and stakeholders are ready to accept A. tequilana as a potential biofuel crop because farmers can use their marginalised land, where they require less water and nutrients. Commercial farming of A. tequilana could be supported in Queensland by existing sugar mills, infrastructure and technologies to minimize the cost associated with transport and processing. An economic model has been developed with a sensitivity analysis to assess the net present value of bioethanol production over a 40 year period. © 2017, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Offshore grown macroalgae biomass could provide a sustainable feedstock for biorefineries. However, tools to assess its potential for producing biofuels, food and chemicals are limited. In this work, we determined the net annual primary productivity (NPP) for Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), using a single layer cultivation in a shallow, coastal site in Israel. We also evaluated the implied potential bioethanol production under literature based conversion rates. Overall, the daily growth rate of Ulva sp. was 4.5 ± 1.1%, corresponding to an annual average productivity of 5.8 ± 1.5 gDW m−2 day−1. In comparison, laboratory experiments showed that under nutrients saturation conditions Ulva sp. daily growth rate achieved 33 ± 6%. The average NPP of Ulva sp. offshore was 838 ± 201 g C m−2 year−1, which is higher than the global average of 290 g C m−2 year−1 NPP estimated for terrestrial biomass in the Middle East. These results position Ulva sp. at the high end of potential crops for bioenergy under the prevailing conditions of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. We found that with 90% confidence, with the respect to the conversion distribution, the annual ethanol production from Ulva sp. biomass, grown in a layer reactor is 229.5 g ethanol m−2 year−1.This translates to an energy density of 5.74 MJ m−2 year−1 and power density of 0.18 W m−2. Growth intensification, to the rates observed at the laboratory conditions, with currently reported conversion yields, could increase, with 90% confidence, the annual ethanol production density of Ulva sp. to 1735 g ethanol m−2 year−1, which translates to an energy density of 43.5 MJ m−2 year−1 and a power density 1.36 W m−2. Based on the measured NPP, we estimated the size of offshore area allocation required to provide biomass for bioethanol sufficient to replace 5–100% of oil used in transportation in Israel. We also performed a sensitivity analysis on the biomass productivity, national CO2 emissions reduction, ethanol potential, feedstock costs and sizes of the required allocated areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of microalgae as a source of raw material for biofuel production has been highly targeted. Compared to other biological options for the capture and use of CO2, microalgae crops have the following advantages: high productivity, lack of competition with feed and food-based products, use of unproductive and non-arable land, and allowance of the use of wastewater for its cultivation. The use of wastewater from industrial, agricultural, and domestic sewage has been indicated as an alternative means to reduce the cost of crops, since such waste is generally released into the environment without previous treatment. This work addresses the use of petrochemical wastewater (ARP) from effluent produced at the Gabriel Passos Refinery (Petrobrás refinery unit) for the cultivation of a strain of Scenedesmus obliquus BR003. Twelve experimental units of 20 L each were constructed in the experimental area of the Biofuel Laboratory of the Federal University of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil in an uncontrolled environment, and the cultures were evaluated by quantification of total carbohydrates, total lipids, dry biomass, and growth evaluated by absorbance. The results showed that the wastewater from petrochemical effluent is an efficient growth medium for the growth of Scenedesmus obliquus BR003 microalgae for large-scale cultivation on land that is not suitable for other agricultural crops.

AB  - Source and ambient samples were collected in a city in China that uses considerable biofuel, to assess influence of biofuel combustion and other sources on particulate matter (PM). Profiles and size distribution of biofuel combustion were investigated. Higher levels in source profiles, a significant increase in heavy-biomass ambient and stronger correlations of K+, Cl−, OC and EC suggest that they can be tracers of biofuel combustion. And char-EC/soot-EC (8.5 for PM2.5 and 15.8 for PM10 of source samples) can also be used to distinguish it. In source samples, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were approximately 28.0%–68.8% (PM2.5) and 27.2%–43.8% (PM10) of OC. For size distribution, biofuel combustion mainly produces smaller particles. OC1, OC2, EC1 and EC2 abundances showed two peaks with one below 1 μm and one above 2 μm. An advanced three-way factory analysis model was applied to quantify source contributions to ambient PM2.5 and PM10. Higher contributions of coal combustion, vehicular emission, nitrate and biofuel combustion occurred during the heavy-biomass period, and higher contributions of sulfate and crustal dust were observed during the light-biomass period. Mass and percentage contributions of biofuel combustion were significantly higher in heavy-biomass period. The biofuel combustion attributed above 45% of K+ and Cl−, above 30% of EC and about 20% of OC. In addition, through analysis of source profiles and contributions, they were consistently evident that biofuel combustion and crustal dust contributed more to cation than to anion, while sulfate &amp; SOC and nitrate showed stronger influence on anion than on cation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While some studies find no room for the dedicated use of land for bioenergy because of growing food needs, other studies estimate large bioenergy potentials, even at levels greater than total existing human plant harvest. Analyzing this second category of studies, we find they have in various ways counted the carbon benefits of using land for biofuels but ignored the costs. Basic carbon opportunity cost calculations per hectare explain why alternative uses of any available land are likely to do more to hold down climate change. Because we find that solar power can provide at least 100 times more useable energy per hectare on three quarters of the world's land, any “surplus” land could also provide the same energy and mitigate climate ~ 100 times more if 1% were devoted to solar and the rest to carbon storage. Review of large bioenergy potential estimates from recent IAMs shows that they depend on many contingencies for carbon benefits, can impose many biodiversity and food costs, and are more predictions of what bioenergy might be in idealized than plausible, future scenarios. At least at this time, policy should not support bioenergy from energy crops and other dedicated uses of land. © 2017

AB  - In this work, we address the optimal design of an integrated microalgae-based biorefinery through the formulation of a mixed integer nonlinear programming model for the production of biodiesel and potential high-added value products. Main bioproducts are poly (hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and astaxanthin. A combined heat and power cycle to transform biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of waste streams is also included in the superstructure. Mass and energy balances are formulated for the biorefinery. Different alternatives for PHB extraction are taken into account. The anaerobic digestion model accounts for detailed composition of the different feed streams. Detailed capital cost models for process equipment are formulated and implemented in GAMS to maximize net present value (NPV). Results show that the production of astaxanthin and PHB provides a way to make biodiesel production economically feasible. Open pond and surfactant-chelate are selected for microalgae cultivation and PHB extraction method, respectively. Biodiesel price can be reduced to $0.48 due to incomes from astaxanthin and PHB sales. Also, an economic sensitivity analysis is performed. Further comparison between domestic and international cost conditions is carried out, showing higher NPV in the domestic case. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuel reserves which supplying a major portion of energy needs, are depleting rapidly, and its environmental damages increases day by day. Therefore, like all developed and developing countries, our country have focused on the use of renewable energy sources. Within this scope in the our country, it was aimed gain of renewable energy sources to economy, promotion of sustainable energy production, and protection of environmental. Recently, one of the growing importance of renewable energy sources is the biomass energy. As an biomass energy source, all vegetable and animal organic substances which the main components are comprising carbohydrate compounds can be used. In these energy sources, microalgae seem promising for biofuel production due to their many advantages such as they have high photosynthetic efficiency, high biomass production, and they grow quickly. From microalgae, by using biochemical methods electricity, ethanol, hydrogen, methane and biodiesel and thermochemical methods syngas, biochar, biodiesel and electricity can be produced. In this review article, isolation of microalgae, microalgal biomass production, the methods used to biomass harvesting, and the availability of microalgae as a source of raw materials for renewable biofuels were viewed.

AB  - Hybrid poplar is a woody crop grown for the production of bioenergy, biofuels and bioproducts. Harvesting is often the largest single cost in the production system and the development and optimization of equipment is evolving. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a single-pass, cut-and-chip harvesting operation in commercial plantings that included four cultivars, two spacing treatments, and two coppice planting designs (dedicated, and interplanted with sawtimber). Approximately 15 h of harvesting using a New Holland 9080 forage harvester equipped with a purpose-built coppice header was monitored over four days. Stand biomass ranged between 34 and 78 Mg ha−1of fresh biomass and effective material capacity (Cm) of the harvester ranged from 10 to 78 Mg h−1of fresh biomass excluding headland activities. Tree spacing had a significant effect on Cm but cultivar and planting design did not. The treatments did not have discernible effects on machine fuel consumption (mean 83 L h−1; ơ 16.4) or crop-specific fuel consumption for fresh biomass (mean 1.34 L Mg−1; ơ 0.31). Crop-specific fuel consumption was positively correlated with engine load, and negatively correlated with standing biomass; this result was statistically significant but negligible (&lt;1%) in terms of liters of fuel used for each additional Mg ha−1 of stand biomass for engine loads ranging between 30% and 110%. © 2017

AB  - To determine whether the bicarbonate in karst limestone soil could be used as a new carbon resource for biomass production by the catalysis of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a simulative karst drought stress experiment was designed and performed. Three plants used for biofuel energy, Orychophragmus violaceus L. (Ov), Brassica juncea L. (Bj), and Euphorbia lathyris L. (El), were grown under simulated karst drought stress. In response to drought stress, the photosynthesis of the three energy plants was inhibited, but their CA activity increased. The hypothesis was confirmed by plant physiological and stable isotope techniques. The obtained results showed that plant biomass was produced with atmospheric CO2 as well as bicarbonate under drought stress. Bicarbonate use was proportional to the CA activity of the plants. With high CA activity over a long period, El had the highest proportional bicarbonate use compared to Ov and Bj, reaching 26.95%. Additionally, a new method is proposed for the screening of plants grown for energy in karst habitats. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The focal point is to present the areas where the technology in buildings can be supported by proper motivation and take substantial advantage measurable in technical units. The need to understand the integration between ecology, society, economy and technology is crucial when global improvements are the targets. These targets should consider urban environments as natural human settlement, in the understanding that accepts human psychological needs for wide and deep education, acquiring highly professional satisfaction without resigning from family style of life and leisure as natural. It is necessary to accept human production also in its advanced levels as a natural human activity and to combine it with the other afore-mentioned components of integration. Attention has been directed to clean energy certification in newly constructed objects and refurbished buildings, formation of owner's responsibility for the possessed goods and their best use in sustainable development. Particular attention has been drawn to the increasingly popular manner of using resources only if it is justified by proportionally very high advantages to the society. This has been presented with the examples of energy savings in low energy and passive buildings. Moreover, the examples show the ways of sustainable development which include the use of renewable energy, using coal only in collective industrial systems very restricted in terms of protection against pollution and uncontrolled use of energy, and similarly, of other conventional fuels, water and land.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study dry anaerobic digestion (dry-AD) of manure bedded with straw using textile-based bioreactor in repeated batches. The 90-L reactor filled with the feedstocks (22–30% total solid) and inoculum without any further treatment, while the biogas produced were collected and analyzed. The digestate residue was also analyzed to check its suitability as bio-fertilizer. Methane yield after acclimatization increased from 183 to 290 NmlCH4/gVS, degradation time decreased from 136 to 92 days and the digestate composition point to suitable bio-fertilizer. The results then used to carry out economical evaluation, which shows dry-AD in textile bioreactors is a profitable method of handling the waste with maximum payback period of 5 years, net present value from $7,000 to $9,800,000 (small to large bioreactors) with internal rate of return from 56.6 to 19.3%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work was focused on understanding the pyrolysis of Typha latifolia. Kinetics, thermodynamics parameters and pyrolysis reaction mechanism were studied using thermogravimetric data. Based on activation energies and conversion points, two regions of pyrolysis were established. Region-I occurred between the conversion rate 0.1–0.4 with peak temperatures 538 K, 555 K, 556 K at the heating rates of 10 K min−1, 30 K min−1, and 50 K min−1, respectively. Similarly, the Region-II occurred between 0.4 and 0.8 with peak temperatures of 606 K, 621 K, 623 K at same heating rates. The best model was diffusion mechanism in Region-I. In Region-II, the reaction order was shown to be 2nd and 3rd. The values of activation energy calculated using FWO and KAS methods (134–204 kJ mol−1) remained same in both regions reflecting that the best reaction mechanism was predicted. Kinetics and thermodynamic parameters including E, ΔH, ΔS, ΔG shown that T. latifolia biomass is a remarkable feedstock for bioenergy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy is regarded as an attractive, low-carbon energy source because it supports environmentally friendly conversion of biomass to bioenergy, and has low CO2 emissions. Forecasting the development of bioenergy using econometric models can help decision makers to optimize strategies and plan roadmaps for the bioenergy industry and its supply chain. This investigation surveys nine econometric assessments that are relevant to the development of bioenergy, including those based on regression, time-series models, simultaneous equations, input-output model, linear/nonlinear programming model, computable general equilibrium models, engineering economics, data envelopment analysis, and the integrated assessment model. The fundamentals of each model are reviewed, their advantages and disadvantages are addressed; representative models in various categories are provided and compared. Eleven aspects of these models are rated. The results provide useful references for choosing econometric model to evaluate numerical impacts of circular economy, bioeconomy and bioenergy economy for decision makers of countries. © 2017

AB  - Bioelectrochemical system (BES) can act as an auxiliary technology for improving organic waste treatment and biogas production in anaerobic digestion (AD). For the first time this study directly compared the performance of a single- and a cation-exchange membrane-equipped two-chamber BES-AD systems at thermophilic conditions. The results indicated that an active glucose-fed thermophilic anaerobic sludge could readily (&lt;3 days) increase biogas production in both reactor configurations by inserting a carbon electrode poised at −0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). However, after a 3-week operation, the biogas production rates from the single- and two-chamber BES reactor decreased due to volatile fatty acids accumulation. Only the two-chamber configuration could enable methane enrichment (98% CH4 v/v) in biogas. Overall, this study suggests that integrating bioelectrodes in-situ could not sustainably improve biogas production in a thermophilic AD reactor, and future studies should be directed towards the use of bioelectrodes for improving biogas quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bound to the particulate matter (PM) during the combustion of raw pyrolysis volatiles (bio-oil and pyrogas mixture) generated from the pyrolysis of rice husk. Five different raw pyrolysis volatiles were produced at varying pyrolysis temperatures (400–800 °C) and subsequently combusted in a laboratory-scale, continuous pyrolysis-combustion facility at 850 °C. 15 priority pollutant PAH levels in the resulting biochar, bio-oil, and PM were evaluated. Results showed that combustion of the raw pyrolysis volatiles produced at elevated pyrolysis temperatures resulted in greater concentrations of PM-bound PAHs (119% increase between 400 and 800 °C) due to the increased PAH and oxy-aromatic content of the bio-oil fraction. Significantly increased benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) – equivalent toxicity of the biochar and PM was observed at elevated pyrolysis temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dedicated bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands such as reclaimed mine lands and other non-arable lands are auspicious cellulosic sources for sustainable bioenergy production. In this study, characterization of pyrolysis products were documented for two dedicated bioenergy crops grown on reclaimed coal-mine lands in West Virginia. Two clonal varieties (Private and Public varieties) of Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and two varieties (Bomaster and Kanlow varieties) of Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) were used in this study. The oven-dried samples were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed batch reactor under an inert condition and at a temperature of 500 °C to produce biochar and bio-oil (vapor condensate). The pyrolysis product, energy and carbon conversion yields were calculated. Additionally, biochar and bio-oil were characterized for elemental composition, volatile, ash and calorific values. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the biochar yields (about 30.00% yield) obtained from the clonal varieties of Switchgrass and Miscanthus. The bio-oil yields were in the range of 45.00–51.00% with the Miscanthus (Private variety) having the highest bio-oil yield of 50.61%. The carbon content of the biomass, biochar and bio-oil were found to be 46.80–48.02%, 77.72–80.23% and 54.68–59.68%, respectively. Average calorific values were found to be 19.49 MJ/kg, 29.01 MJ/kg and 24.98 MJ/kg for the biomass, biochar and bio-oil, respectively. Results for the surface chemistry of the biochars showed carbon and oxygen to be the major chemical constituents of the surfaces of the biochars. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be the major components of the non-condensable gas and the CO:CO2ratio showed that the non-condensable gas cannot be used as a fluidizing medium. © 2016

AB  - Establishing energy crops could be a cost-efficient alternative towards the valorization of the plant biomass produced in contaminated lands, where they would not compete with food production for land use. Dittrichia viscosa and Silybum marianum are two native Mediterranean species recently identified as potential energy crops for degraded lands. Here, we present the first characterization of the decomposition of the biomass of these species during thermo-chemical conversion (pyrolysis). Using a greenhouse study we evaluated whether the quality of D. viscosa and S. marianum biomass for energy production through pyrolysis could be substantially influenced by the presence of high concentrations of soluble trace element concentrations in the growing substrate. For each species, biomass produced in two different soil types (with contrasted trace element concentrations and pH) had similar elemental composition. Behavior during thermal decomposition, activation energies and concentrations of pyrolysis gases were also similar between both types of soils. Average activation energy values were 295 and 300 kJ mol−1 (for a conversion value of α = 0.5) for S. marianum and D. viscosa, respectively. Results suggest that there were no major effects of soil growing conditions on the properties of the biomass as raw material for pyrolysis, and confirm the interest of these species as energy crops for Mediterranean contaminated lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been identified as a cellulosic bioenergy feedstock crop partly because of its potential to produce high biomass yields on marginal lands. Many breeding programs are focused on increasing biomass yields to improve the economic viability of the crop. However, increasing biomass yields without selecting for reduced biomass nitrogen (N) concentration will result in substantial increases in N removal at harvest. Our objectives were (i) to determine the current trajectory of biomass yield and N removal from breeding programs, (ii) to estimate the reduction in the rate of genetic gain for biomass yield when N concentration was incorporated into a breeding program, and (iii) to estimate the effects reduced N concentration might have on biofuel quality. Biomass yield and N concentration had a negative genetic correlation (-0.43), but a 50% increase in biomass yield likely will result in a 37% increase in N removal with direct selection for biomass yield. We estimated that incorporating the goal of reducing N concentration into a breeding program would result in a 225% greater reduction in N concentration while achieving 74% of the biomass yield gains achieved with direct selection for biomass yield only. Reducing N concentration in biomass was predicted to improve quality for use of biomass in a combustion system and to have minimal effects on quality in an ethanol conversion system. We conclude that simultaneous selection for increased biomass yield and reduced N concentration is both a worthy and feasible objective for switchgrass breeding programs that should improve the likelihood that improved yields from breeding are not undermined by increased N requirements. © Crop Science Society of America | 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Variety testing by U.S. agricultural universities, often in cooperation with experiment stations, and professional crop associations is recognized as an independent, unbiased validation of the viability of commercial crop varieties. In Iowa, variety testing has also been conducted by many private agricultural companies and individual farmers. Records for crop variety evaluations within the state can be traced back to 1871, well before the creation of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station in 1888. The Iowa Corn Yield Test (ICYT) is undeniably the most famous of the Iowa variety yield trials; however, corn (Zea mays L.) varieties were being tested long before that program was initiated. Furthermore, Iowa researchers have been conducting variety yield tests on many other field crops. Knowledge of how Iowa variety tests have been organized and published could be helpful to researchers looking for similar, long-term evaluations from other states and around the world. Variety tests from the past also have the potential to help guide new research efforts and may provide an important untapped resource for unique varietal data. As crop scientists and agronomists look to find new sources for biofuels, bio-products, and other industrial uses for various crops, data from historical varieties could be useful. The objective for this review is to provide an historic account with sections on varietal testing in Iowa. It is presented in chronological order followed by sections devoted to specific crops.

We analyze the intersections of the motivations that encourage and sustain value chain participation and stocks and investments of community capitals. We use the Community Capitals Framework (Flora et al. 2016) to analyze the ways that new biofuel value chains affect various types of capital within rural communities, and to understand the context, processes, and impacts of decision-making within the biofuel value chain. Interviews and focus groups with actors along the value chain including farmers, processors, transporters, plant breeders, extension professionals, and farm service suppliers identify motivational factors and how community resources affect participation decisions. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Keeping workers safe is a continuing challenge in agricultural production. Risk assessment methodologies have been used widely in other industries to better understand systems and enhance decision making, yet their use in production agriculture has been limited. This article describes the considerations and the approach taken to measure the difference in worker injury risks between two agricultural production systems. A model was developed specifically for the comparison of worker injury risk between corn and biofuel switchgrass production systems. The model is composed of injury and exposure values that were used in a Monte Carlo simulation. The output of this risk assessment shows that approximately 99% of the values from the Monte Carlo simulation rank corn production as a greater worker injury risk than biofuel switchgrass production. Furthermore, the greatest contributing factors for each production system were identified as harvest, and that finding aligns with current literature. © 2017 ASABE.

AB  - Growing energy crops such as perennial grasses and trees on marginal land offers the possibility of reducing the competition with food crops for land resources. Identifying the productivity, economic feasibility and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact is the premise of our study on using marginal land for bioenergy production in Canada. The area of marginal land available was identified by intersecting national maps of land suitability and land cover. The costs and potential returns of growing energy crops on marginal land were then analyzed, and the GHG emissions were evaluated using a GHG emissions model. The results indicated that approximately 9.48 million ha of potentially useable marginal land was available in Canada. The land cover of the available marginal land consists of grassland (68.2%) and shrubland (31.8%). If the available marginal land was completely utilized, the biomass production would be 23.7 million tonnes of switchgrass or 51.2 million tonnes of hybrid poplar. The production of biofuel from these biomass sources would be 5.69 and 11.26 billion L, equivalent to 14.0% and 27.7% of the total transportation gasoline consumption in Canada in 2014, for switchgrass and poplar, respectively. On the marginal land, the average production cost was estimated to be approximately 68.2 CAD $/t (173.8 CAD $/ha) for switchgrass, and 26.2 CAD $/t (140.2 CAD $/ha) for coppiced hybrid poplar. The production of biomass showed a positive net return on marginal land in Ontario (eastern Canada), with a biomass price of 99 CAD $/t and 35 CAD $/t for switchgrass and coppiced hybrid poplar, respectively. When the biomass price is less than 101 CAD $/t, growing switchgrass in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where 69% of Canada's marginal land is located, was not considered economically attractive. By replacing fossil fuel, the maximum potential switchgrass production on marginal land would reduce GHG emissions by 29.49 million t CO2-eq/yr. However, when considering the economic aspect of production, the potential reduction of 6.1 million tonnes CO2/yr from planting poplar is more viable. Further analysis of the broader economic value of the current use of marginal land (primarily livestock grazing) and the impacts on biodiversity, soil quality, and water resources is needed to completely assess the practicality of a widespread increase in biomass production for bioenergy on Canada's marginal land. © 2017

AB  - The early 2000s witnessed a global awareness on adoption of renewable and environmentally friendly energy with anticipated socio-economic benefits in developing countries. Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis is an emerging and promising technology for producing cellulosic biofuels. Ex situ catalytic hydropyrolysis offers additional benefits of operational flexibility and catalyst performance. The unique feature of a two-step ex situ hydropyrolysis vapor upgrading process has been demonstrated for the first time using a double fluidized-bed reactor system. Product distribution (35.2-46.7% C5+ organic yield on a carbon basis) and oxygen content of the organic liquid product (2-17 wt%) can be tailored by adjusting process conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to identify oxygen functionalities and representative species in the organic liquid products. The structural information was further related to product stability, a key property pertaining to product storage, transportation, and processing. Unlike pyrolysis oil, the products contained minimal amounts of reactive oxygenates (e.g., aldehydes, acids, sugars, and other multifunctional oxygenates) that could cause stability issues. As a result, the products were stable in storage at 40°C for 2 months. Further thermal stability tests show that all of the products were more stable than pyrolysis oil and soybean oil at elevated temperatures. The products with 6 wt% oxygen or less showed high thermal stability (behaving much like a petroleum distillate hydrotreater feed in the tests) and possessed low total acid number (<1 mg KOH per g), indicating good petroleum refinery compatibility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - The eddy covariance method was used to investigate carbon fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET) from a high biomass forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) field in the Southern U.S. Great Plains for three growing seasons (2013–2015). Above normal precipitation and narrow row spacing (50 cm) led to higher biomass production (25 Mg ha−1) and leaf area index (LAI = 7.2) development in 2014. This also resulted in higher carbon uptake or net ecosystem production (NEP) and ET during that year. Early and late season precipitation enhanced ecosystem respiration (Reco) resulting in lower NEP in 2015. Shorter growing season (119 days) also contributed to lower cumulative NEP in 2015. Estimated gross primary production (GPP) in 2014 (1780 g m−2) was 10% higher than the GPP in 2013 (1591 g m−2) and 24% higher than the GPP in 2015 (1353 g m−2). During all growing seasons, the site was a source of carbon (negative NEP) at the beginning and transitioned to a sink (positive NEP) later in the season. Biomass-GPP relationship indicated that approximately 65% of total GPP was allocated to above ground biomass (AGB). Average monthly ecosystem WUE (expressed as gross carbon gain per unit of ET) ranged from 1.7 g mm−1 to 4.2 g mm−1. Results from our study indicate that weather conditions, growing season length and crop management are important factors in determining the magnitude of carbon uptake and release, and ET of this cellulosic biofuel feedstock crop in the Southern U.S. Great Plains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study determined the accumulated biogas, methane content, and absolute abundances (AAs) of 14 common antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and two integrons during the anaerobic digestion of swine manure for 52 days with different amounts of added zinc. The accumulated biogas increased by 51.2% and 56.0% with 125 mg L–1 (L) and 1250 mg L–1 (H) zinc, respectively, compared with the control with no added zinc (CK), but there was no significant difference between L and H. Compared with CK, excluding tetW and tetC, all the other ARGs detected in this study increased in the L and H reactors. However, the low concentration of zinc (L reactor) caused greater increases in the AAs of ARGs in the AD products. Redundancy analysis showed that NO3-N and bio-zinc significantly explained the changes in genes, where they accounted for 60.9% and 20.3% of the total variation in the environmental factors, respectively. © 2017

AB  - Can the mass utilization of biofuels help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels? Four particular types of biofuels have been the subject of extensive study in this regard: corn ethanol, sugar cane ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. This paper overviews the evidence from the literature on Lifecycle Assessment studies pertaining to these four fuels and finds that no definitive answer to these questions exists in the literature. The example of biofuels co-products is used to illustrate the reason why no easy answer can be arrived at from these studies. The deeper sources of variation within the literature are identified as well as the requirements that would be needed to formulate an LCA which can provide conclusive and actionable answers. © 2017, Emergent Publications.

AB  - The national government instated a mandatory blending policy to facilitate the uptake and establishment of a biofuels sector in South Africa. Uncertainty exists, however, regarding the implications and effects of producing biofuels within the Western Cape province, as part of a strategy of the province to transition to a green economy. This investigation was carried out as an effort to simulate the biofuel production within the Western Cape under certain project and policy considerations. A system dynamics model was developed to identify key strategic intervention points that could strengthen the business case of biofuel production. The model showed a feasible business case for bioethanol production, with the best case showing an internal rate of return of 23% (without government subsidy), and an emissions reduction of 63% when compared with coal. It is recommended that special consideration be given to the location of bioethanol production facilities, as operational costs can be minimised by incorporating invasive alien land-clearing schemes as part of the bioethanol production. The model further showed that mediumto- large-scale biodiesel production in the province is not feasible under the given model assumptions, as the positive effects of local biodiesel production do not justify the required government subsidy of ZAR 4.30 per litre. It is recommended that a different approach be investigated, where multiple on-site small-scale biodiesel production facilities are used, thus utilising multiple feedstock options and minimising capital expenditure.

AB  - The use of non-edible, second-generation feedstocks for the production of biodiesel has been an active area of research, due to its potential in replacing fossil diesel as well as its environmentally friendly qualities. Despite this, more needs to be done to remove the technical barriers associated with biodiesel production and usage, to increase its quality as well as to widen the choice of available feedstocks; so as to avoid over-dependence on limited sources. This paper assesses the feasibility of using a local plant, Reutealis trisperma, whose seeds contain a high percentage of oil of up to 51%, as one of the possible feedstocks. The techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of biodiesel production from Reutealis trisperma oil as well as implementation aspects and environmental effects of the biodiesel plant are discussed. Analysis indicates that the 50 kt Reutealis trisperma biodiesel production plant has a life cycle cost of approximately 710 million, yielding a payback period of 4.34 years. The unit cost of the biodiesel is calculated to be 0.69/L with the feedstock cost accounting for the bulk of the cost. The most important finding from this study is that the biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil can compete with fossil diesel, provided that appropriate policies of tax exemptions and subsidies can be put in place. To conclude, further studies on biodiesel production and its limitations are necessary before the use of biodiesel from Reutealis trisperma oil may be used as a fuel source to replace fossil diesel. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Hydroesterification is innovation biodiesel production using low cost feedstock by two-step: hydrolysis of waste cooking oil to FFAs in subcritical water and chemical esterification of FFAs into FAME (biodiesel) with methanol. The purpose was to apply the experimental factorial design to evaluate the influence of reaction variables on the effectiveness of hydrolysis and determine the relationship of FFAs and FAMEs yields. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor under diverse reaction conditions to determine the optimal parameters for hydrolysis. This analyses indicated that high FFAs yields (95 wt%) are achieved using 250 °C; 120 min; 100:1 water-to-oil molar ratio and 700 rpm. Research results revealed a conversion the FFAs in 98.5 wt% of FAMEs with high quality by esterification in biodiesel production. This study shows that the biodiesel produced by subcritical/chemical hydroesterification process has similar qualities to the biodiesel obtained by traditional alkaline transesterification, which suggests a promising alternative for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A well-to-wheel life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to characterize the life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions profiles of a series of novel multistage torrefaction and pyrolysis systems for targeted thermochemical conversion of short rotation woody crops to bio-oil and in situ catalytic upgrading to hydrocarbon transportation fuels, and to benchmark the results against a base-case fast pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) platform. Multistage systems utilize a staged thermal gradient to fractionate bio-oil into product streams consisting of distinct functional groups, and multi-step chemical synthesis for downstream processing of bio-oil fractions to hydrocarbon fuels. Results at the process scale reveal that multistage systems have several advantages over the base-case including: (1) ∼40% reduction in process hydrogen consumption and (2) the product distribution for multistage systems are skewed towards longer carbon chain compounds that are fungible with diesel-range fuels. LCA reveals that the median Energy Return On Investment (EROI) and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for multistage systems range from 1.32 to 3.76 MJ-fuel/MJ-primary fossil energy and 17.1 to 52.8 gCO2e/MJ-fuel respectively, over the host of co-product scenarios and allocation schemes analyzed, with fossil-derived hydrogen constituting the principle GHG and primary energy burden across all systems. These results are compelling and indicate that multistage systems exhibit comparatively higher gasoline/diesel-range fuel yield relative to current technology, and produce a high quality infrastructure-compatible hydrocarbon transportation fuel capable of achieving over 80% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions relative to baseline petroleum diesel. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Fine roots play a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle because much of the C accumulating in soil is the result of fine root production and turnover. Here we explore the effect of plant community composition and diversity on fine root production in surface soils and plant biomass allocation to fine roots in six perennial cropping systems differing in composition and diversity planted as biofuel feedstocks. The six systems were established in 2008 at both a high and a moderate fertility site located in the upper Midwest, USA and included: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), hybrid poplar (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii ‘NM6), native grasses (a five-species assemblage of Andropogon gerardii, Elymus canadensis, P. virgatum, Schizachrium scoparium, and Sorghastrum nutans), an early successional system, and a restored prairie with 25 sown grass, legume, and forb species. For three years (2011–2013) at both sites ingrowth cores were deployed each spring; half were extracted at mid-season and the rest in late fall. Native grasses and restored prairie systems produced 31–77% more fine roots by mid-season compared to the other cropping systems at both sites. Miscanthus and hybrid poplars tended to have the lowest fine root production. The polyculture cropping systems allocated 39–94% more energy to the production of fine roots, with the exception of switchgrass at the low fertility site. Findings demonstrate a greater potential for diverse biofuel cropping systems to allocate C belowground to fine roots as compared to monocultures, with potential implications for soil C sequestration. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Assessing the potential effects of a world biofuel boom on a non-oil producing economy like Senegal and on its households is relevant when it comes for policymakers to make a trade-off between fossil energy and biofuel. In this paper, we run a simulation, based on a dynamic, general-equilibrium model for the period 2006-2020, to capture the effects of the boom of biofuel in the world market on growth and poverty in Senegal. Our results suggest that, due to decreasing prices, imports increase for crude oil, tradable services and non food industries. Valued-added of biodiesel and bioethanol decreases while it increases for most the sectors, in particular those which are more energy intensive. Poverty is quite constant for the first sub-period but it declines thereafter. The households living in urban areas experienced a more deep decrease in their poverty headcount than the one of rural areas.

AB  - This paper explores the environmental and economic aspects of fast pyrolytic conversion of lignin, obtained from 2G ethanol plants, to transport fuels for both the marine and automotive markets. Various scenarios are explored, pertaining to aggregation of lignin from several sites, alternative energy carries to replace lignin, transport modalities, and allocation methodology. The results highlight two critical factors that ultimately determine the economic and/or environmental fuel viability. The first factor, the logistics scheme, exhibited the disadvantage of the centralized approach, owing to prohibitively expensive transportation costs of the low energy-dense lignin. Life cycle analysis (LCA) displayed the second critical factor related to alternative energy carrier selection. Natural gas (NG) chosen over additional biomass boosts well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions (WTW GHG) to a level incompatible with the reduction targets set by the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS). Adversely, the process’ economics revealed higher profits vs. fossil energy carrier. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Forest-based biomass has a significant role to play in the development of a renewable U.S. energy portfolio, especially in the context of mandated cellulosic biofuel production requirements. Biorefinery development has the potential to create economic, environmental, and social benefits. In Maine, co-location opportunities for biorefineries and existing pulp and paper manufacturing facilities could strengthen industry and mill communities. Understanding general public and local perceptions of bioenergy industries and products may play a key role in their establishment, success, and sustainability. Our aim was to compare the general Maine public and mill towns in their support for forest-based biorefineries, and we surveyed: (1) Statewide residents, and (2) Mill Town residents from 10 communities with major pulp and paper facilities. We found differences between local and state support for biorefineries across all response categories. Mill Town respondents were significantly more supportive of biorefinery projects in their communities, and overall the potential positive impacts of biorefineries were rated higher than the potential negative impacts. Both groups preferred facility siting at pulp mills no longer in operation, and Mill Town respondents expressed less concern about potential negative impacts than Statewide respondents. Our findings provide important insight into forest-based biorefinery issues important to communities. We encourage policy makers, industry leaders, and researchers to use our results as a foundation to actively engage statewide and local communities future biorefinery policies and siting proposals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While biodiesel feedstock diversification is a main objective of the Brazilian National Program for the Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB in Portuguese), its achievement has remained elusive and biodiesel is predominantly produced from soybean (75%). This research uses the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) approach to evaluate the PNPB effects and compare the economic efficiency and the competitiveness of biodiesel from three oilseeds: soybean, rapeseed and sunflower. In contrast to papers that present results of experimental biodiesel production initiatives, this paper explores the case of “representative” production chains (best available technology and management practices). The findings indicate that biodiesel production is competitive from the three oilseeds, but the profitability of biodiesel from the soybean is notably higher. The tax breaks and subsidies provided by the PNPB have a positive impact on the profitability of biodiesel production chains (7.43% for soybean, 3.88% for rapeseed, 5.53% for sunflower). These results are encouraging and suggest two actions: i) to review the incentive policies (tax reduction) and payments to farmers of the different crops (pay for oil content instead of crop yield); and ii) to invest in organizational and managerial approaches in the alternative oilseed agricultural systems to improve their technical and economic efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy is crucial to economic progress, but the contemporary worldwide population increase that demands greater energy generated from conventional exhaustible resources, an energy price upsurge, and environmental concerns, imperils sustainable economic growth. Nevertheless, switching to renewable energy produced from naturally replenished resources promotes energy security, likewise addressing issues such as global warming and climate change. This paper aims at exploring the influence and causal relation between renewable energy, both overall and by type, and sustainable economic growth of European Union (EU)-28 countries for the period of 2003-2014. We notice that the mean share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption is 15%, while the mean share of renewable energy in transport fuel consumption is 3%, which are below the thresholds of 20% and 10%, respectively, as set by the EU Directive 2009/28/EC. By estimating panel data fixed-effects regression models, the results provide support for a positive influence of renewable energy overall, as well as by type, namely biomass, hydropower, geothermal energy, wind power, and solar energy on gross domestic product per capita. However, biomass energy shows the highest influence on economic growth among the rest of renewable energy types. In fact, a 1% increase of the primary production of solid biofuels increases GDP per capita by 0.16%. Besides, cointegrating regressions set on panel fully modified and dynamic ordinary least squares regressions confirm the positive influence related to the primary production of renewable energies on economic growth. A 1% increase in primary production of renewable energies increases GDP per capita by 0.05%-0.06%. However, the results of Granger causality based on panel vector error correction model indicate both in short-run and long-run a unidirectional causal relationship running from sustainable economic growth to the primary production of renewable energies, being supported the conservation hypothesis. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is an important non-edible oilseed crop and source of castor oil which has multiple applications ranging from cosmetics to biofuels industry. However, the extraction of castor oil generates large amounts of de-oiled castor cake containing ricin, a highly toxic glycoprotein that requires treatment prior to its valorization. In this study, biochar was produced by slow pyrolysis at 550 °C from castor stalks and de-oiled castor cake, both by-products of castor oil production, in view of sustainable valorisation of a potential large scale cultivation of castor beans in Greece. The produced biochars were highly alkaline and had significant differences in terms of surface area, morphology, nutrients content and ratios of atomic C:N and H:C. The biochars were added to potting mix at different rates (0, 1 and 5% mass fraction of the dry mix) for the cultivation of tomato and castor seedlings, and their growth was monitored over a period of two months without fertilization. Based on the results, castor biochars improved castor seed germination, achieving 90% success rate earlier when compared to control. On the contrary, biochar did not affect significantly the germination of tomato seedlings. However, in both species, the biochar treatments promoted lateral root initiation but increased the developmental rate only in castor. In addition, biochars affected soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), PO4, total N and P, K, Na, Ca, and Al levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents the techno-economic performance analysis of Jatropha biodiesel-fired power plants in comparison with natural gas- and diesel-fired plants. Jatropha biodiesel can be substituted for natural gas in industrial gas turbines at a slight loss in power output of ∼2% and plant efficiency of ∼1%. The exclusive use of the fuel in heavy duty industrial gas turbines is not economically viable at existing electricity generation prices in Nigeria, except fuels are restricted to combined cycle engines and considered as biomass power plants. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of the Jatropha biodiesel-fired plants varied from $0.203–0.252/kWh, values that are below the cost of self-generated electricity (SGE) in Nigeria —$0.45–0.70/kWh. To integrate Jatropha biodiesel into existing power plants, a minimum production-based incentive (PBI) of $0.052–0.082/kWh can be provided for up to nine years or maximum partial fuel substitution (PFS) of 33–40% can be mandated, depending on the mode of operation. A guaranteed fuel price of $0.18–5/gallon can be ensured, depending on electricity contract price. A carbon tax up to $100/tCO2 can also be imposed on natural gas-fired plants, but this does not ensure economic viability. The high cost of SGE in Nigeria uncovers an opportunity for embedded power generation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasingly, short rotation woody crops are being planted for biofuel/biomass production on unused lands or marginal agricultural lands. Many of these plantations occur near agriculture land which is intensively managed including yearly herbicide applications. Herbicide drift from these applications may cause tree stress and decreasing yields impacting potential biomass production. Quinclorac, a rice herbicide, is often cited as a potential source of tree damage and is the focal herbicide of this study. Five planting stocks, including three eastern cottonwood clones, a hybrid poplar clone, and American sycamore, were assessed for herbicide affects and deployed at three sites across south Arkansas. Stocks were exposed to a full rate labeled for rice (3.175 L ha-1), two rates simulating drift (1/100th and 1/10th the full rate), and a no-spray control. Survival of all Populus clones decreased drastically as quinclorac rate increased, while there was little observed effect on American sycamore. Some variability in treatment response among poplars occurred below the full herbicide rate; however, direct spraying a full herbicide rate on poplars resulted in survival rates below 65 percent and negative growth rates due to dieback. Conversely, photosynthetic rates of remaining leaves increased as quinclorac rate increased. Survival and damage scores of American sycamore, regardless of herbicide rate, remained nearly constant. © 2017, Editura Silvica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Production of biofuels from cellulosic sources, such as switchgrass, is being encouraged through mandates, incentives, and subsidies. However, uncertainty in future prices coupled with large establishment costs often inhibit their cultivation. Owing to their inability to incorporate uncertainty and dynamic decision-making, standard discounted cash flow techniques are ineffective for analyzing such investments. We formulate a discrete-time binomial framework to model output prices, allowing us to incorporate price uncertainty, stand age, and variable crop yields into the analytical framework. We analyze the feasibility of investments in switchgrass cultivation under varying price transition paths, evaluate the relationship between risk and profitability, and estimate the value of flexible decision-making options wherein the farmer can alter cultivation choices. We find that switchgrass cultivation is only 32% likely to be profitable in the base model and infer that on-farm management could play an important role in entry and exit decisions. We also find that subsidies are important for project viability and policymakers could consider incorporating payments for ecosystem services to encourage adoption. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land grab has been on for more than a decade now. Rural citizens have been reported to have been affected socioeconomically by this new phenomenon that involves European and Asian countries that move to African countries to acquire land for large scale agricultural production, for food, raw materials and biofuel. The study examined socioeconomic effects of land grab on farming household heads in Delta Central Agricultural Zone of Delta State, Nigeria. Ten percent (10%) of identified farming HH heads were involved in the study. Most (50.37%) of the respondents had farms of the sizes of between 0.10 and 1.99ha with a mean farm size of 2.4ha. Their mean farm income was N400, 000. Most (84.44%) of them were employed by the agricultural investors after their plots of land were grabbed; 52.59% had fair health status. Sizes of land grabbed from individual farmers ranged between 0.10 and 5.99ha. The lands grabbed were for plantation agricultural, and food crops production. Few of the land deals (24.44%) were sealed with the involvement of the farmers and the investors and the farmers were adequately compensated. Results showed that land grab had negative effects on farming HH heads' socio-economic variables of farm size, farm income, employment status, health status and social status. It was recommended that land deals should involve the investors, government, community leaders and the land holders.

AB  - Soil-woody biomass interactions are relevant for the productivity of bioenergy plantations and biomass quality. In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate and to quantify possible relationships between chemical variables of the soil and the produced biomass through a multivariate approach. This latter approach allows to overcome the complex issue of multi-collinearity among variables. Soil and woody biomass samples were collected from two poplar short rotation coppices in Santarém (Portugal) and in Lochristi (Belgium). The results from the analyses of those samples were integrated into three databases with soil, woody biomass and site plots as cases, and 23 physical and chemical properties as variables. The databases were subjected to a multivariate sequence of calculations, which included correlation, principal components, factorial and hierarchical clustering analyses. The calculations showed that the site plots and the woody biomass of genotypes in Lochristi were more homogeneous as compared to Santarém; they also confirmed the high interconnection between soil and woody biomass variables. The higher heating value of the woody biomass correlated well with the soil concentrations of P2O5, Mg, Ca, Na and organic C. Linear equations related the higher heating value to the most important soil and woody biomass variables. Finally, the results suggest that the annual monitoring of soil and biomass in SRC systems should be performed to optimize both productivity and woody biomass quality as a fuel. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Single-cell oils (SCOs) raise a growing interest due to their potential for the production of biofuels, bioplastics and more recently of food additives. The production of SCOs by exploitation of residual lignocellulosic biomass has become a realistic target, due to the recent advances in enzyme hydrolysis technology. The fermentation of yeasts offers a useful alternative to microalgae, due to their ability to use several agroforestry wastes as feedstock and their simple cultural requirements. In addition, the microbial oils obtained from yeasts have a composition quite similar to that of vegetable oils. This study is focused on the exploitation of Giant reed (Arundo donax), a widely diffused perennial crop, well known for its capability to grow in marginal lands ensuring high biomass productivity. Different types of biomass, from crops cultivated under different agronomic management were tested. The effect of two types of treated sewage sludges as organic matter sources and inorganic nitrogen fertigation was evaluated to increase soil fertility. These practices were tested in order to improve crop composition and productivity. The hydrolysates from A. donax biomass have been evaluated as a growth medium for oleaginous yeasts, for the production of microbial oils. The production kinetics and the yields in microbial oils have been analyzed taking into account the composition of the different biomasses used, in order to contribute to a complete optimization of the productive cycle. In general, the treatment acid hydrolysis with HCl followed by enzymatic hydrolysis led to the best results in order to obtain glucose production for the development of biofuels. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The production of liquid fuels from crude oil requires water. There has been limited focus on the assessment of life cycle water demand footprints for crude oil production and refining. The overall aim of this paper is address this gap. The objective of this research is to develop water demand coefficients over the life cycle of fuels produced from crude oil pathways. Five crude oil fields were selected in the three North American countries to reflect the impact of different spatial locations and technologies on water demand. These include the Alaska North Slope, California's Kern County heavy oil, and Mars in the U.S.; Maya in Mexico; and Bow River heavy oil in Alberta, Canada. A boundary for an assessment of the life cycle water footprint was set to cover the unit operations related to exploration, drilling, extraction, and refining. The recovery technology used to extract crude oil is one of the key determining factors for water demand. The amount of produced water that is re-injected to recover the oil is essential in determining the amount of fresh water that will be required. During the complete life cycle of one barrel of conventional crude oil, 1.71–8.25 barrels of fresh water are consumed and 2.4–9.51 barrels of fresh water are withdrawn. The lowest coefficients are for Bow River heavy oil and the highest coefficients are for Maya crude oil. Of all the unit operations, exploration and drilling require the least fresh water (less than 0.015 barrel of water per barrel of oil produced). A sensitivity analysis was conducted and uncertainty in the estimates was determined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forests are, and will remain for decades to come, a critical source of domestic energy for households in East Africa. Deforestation threatens to alter the supply of biomass available to households. We use remote sensing and longitudinal household data to understand the relationship between agriculture-led deforestation and household energy choices in Uganda. Our hypothesis is that rapid deforestation and associated biomass stock depletion affects the type, quantity, and quality of fuels used by households. We analyze land use changes characterizing deforestation and forest degradation at 500-m spatial resolution. Using two waves of survey data for 451 households, we describe changes in the type, quantity, and source of biomass fuels used. We estimate net losses of 4.51 billion kg or 26% of available air-dry biomass over an 8-year period in 5-km buffers surrounding the study villages. We estimate a series of panel mixed-effect regression models to test whether reduction in biomass availability affects fuel choice and find that lower biomass availability is associated with an increase in fuel sourced from non-forest areas, use of crop residues as a cooking fuel, and time to collect fuel. We find that households are transitioning from fuelwood sourced from forests to fuelwood sourced from areas with much less available and lower quality biomass. We find limited evidence that investment in tree planting is replacing natural forests as a source of high quality biomass fuel. Our findings have implications for both human and environmental health particularly in biomass dependent and population dense settings in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Insufficient available energy has limited the economic growth of Nigeria. The country suffers from frequent power outages, and inconvenient black–outs while residents and industries are forced to depend on self-generated electricity. Life-cycle assessment methodology was used to assess the environmental burdens associated with self-generated electricity (SGE) and proposed embedded power generation in Nigeria. The study shows that SGE from 5 kVA diesel generators contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 1625 kg CO2 eq./MWh, along with other environmental burdens. Based on a point estimate of diesel electric generators in Nigeria, SGE can contribute 389 million tonnes CO2 eq. to climate change every year. This can reposition Nigeria as one of the top 20 emitters of CO2 globally. A mandatory diesel fuel displacement with Jatropha biodiesel can reduce annual GHG emissions from SGE by 76% provided combined cycle power plants are adopted for embedded power generation. The magnitude of these benefits would depend on material inputs, seed yield as well as the environmental status of the reference fuel. Minimal use of fertilizers, chemicals and resources and fossil fuel substitution with renewable options can minimize adverse environmental burdens. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass harvested from invasive plant species has been proposed for use as lignocellulosic feedstock for the production of advanced biofuels as a way to mitigate the indirect land use issues associated with the production of dedicated energy crops. Encroachment of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) has reduced the forage productivity of North American Great Plains grasslands ranging from Texas in the South to Alberta in the North. The objective of this study is to develop and demonstrate a modeling system that can be used to determine the minimum selling price of biofuel. A fast pyrolysis process that exclusively uses eastern redcedar biomass to produce gasoline and diesel blend stock is assumed. A mixed integer mathematical programming model is constructed and applied to a 15 county case study region from which eastern redcedar may be collected. The modeling system considers the growth rate of unharvested trees to determine the optimal biorefinery location, the optimal harvest locations for each of 20 years, and the minimum selling biofuel price. To fulfill 2 Gg d−1 feedstock requirements for the expected life of the biorefinery, 73% of the trees growing in year zero in the case study region would be required. For a 313 dm3 Mg−1 conversion rate, and with biorefinery ownership, operating and maintenance cost of 630 $ m−3, the expected cost to deliver feedstock is estimated to be 61 $ Mg−1, and the estimated minimum selling biofuel price is 830 $ m−3. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is one of the key drivers of anthropogenic climate change. In addition to greenhouse gases such as CO2 or CH4, LULCC affects also the emission of other carbon trace gases such as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). We investigate the impact of changing LULCC on the emission of isoprene and monoterpenes during the 21st century using seven different land-use projections, applying the dynamic vegetation modelling framework LPJ-GUESS. Climate change, and atmospheric CO2-concentration are based on the RCP2.6 scenario. The different LULCC-scenarios explore the impact of different land-based climate change mitigation strategies (such as afforestation and avoided deforestation, or bioenergy). We show that the increase of land area under crops or grassland would lead to a significant decrease of BVOC emissions, with a strong negative correlation between the fraction of managed global land area and the emission of isoprene and monoterpenes. But the choice of crops is important, especially for the bioenergy scenarios in which increasing fractional cover leads to decreasing BVOC emissions in our simulations; use of woody bioenergy crops can reverse this decrease. The strong impact of LULCC on the global and regional emission of BVOCs implies the need to include the impact of these changes in projections of atmospheric composition and air quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) represent a dominant category of secondary organic aerosol precursors that are increasingly included in air quality models. In the present study, an experimental system was developed and applied to a light-duty diesel engine to determine the emission factors of particulate SVOCs (pSVOCs) and nonvolatile particulate matter (PM) components at dilution ratios representative of ambient conditions. The engine was tested under three steady-state operation modes, using ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), three types of pure biodiesels and their blends with ULSD. For ULSD, the contribution of pSVOCs to total particulate organic matter (POM) mass in the engine exhaust ranged between 21 and 85%. Evaporation of pSVOCs from the diesel particles during dilution led to decreases in the hydrogen to carbon ratio of POM and the PM number emission factor of the particles. Substituting biodiesels for ULSD could increase pSVOCs emissions but brought on large reductions in black carbon (BC) emissions. Among the biodiesels tested, tallow/used cooking oil (UCO) biodiesel showed advantages over soybean and canola biodiesels in terms of both pSVOCs and nonvolatile PM emissions. It is noteworthy that PM properties, such as particle size and BC mass fraction, differed substantially between emissions from conventional diesel and biodiesels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modern energy policy aims to ratchet up the manufacture and use of biofuels, i.e. any fuel produced from biological materials. Yet biofuels derived from agricultural crops and residues, wood, forest residues, or other kinds of plant-based biomass feedstocks can be as environmentally and socially devastating as the finite fossil fuel resources they seek to replace. Often overlooked are their globalization impacts on land grabs, food security, greenhouse gas emissions, drought, deforestation, interference with climate change adaption measures, population displacement, desertification, sea level rise, biodiversity, and scalability. These environmental and social consequences result in food shortages, violent conflicts, urban riots, rural protests, and rising food costs. There is, however, hope for biofuels. Certain other types of biofuels, known collectively as second generation biofuels, are a more suitable alternative for global and regional energy needs because of their availability as well as their significantly reduced public health, environmental, and climate change impacts on society. These new biofuels are derived from algae, seaweed, food waste, and other plant and animal residues. While these biofuels are a more appropriate replacement for fossil fuels than first generation biofuels, they too carry with them potentially significant impacts. Therefore, a cautionary analysis of regulatory and governance regimes for second generation biofuels is critical for improving innovation and investment for this energy resource. To that effect, I provide an inquiry into biofuel law and policy through the theoretical framework of science, technology, society, and the environment (STSE) to assess the hurried development of biofuels and how this biofuel gold rush has had adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences globally. This article concludes with two correlative policy interventions to counter the negative consequences of conventional forest- and agriculturally-based biofuels. First, I question the environmental efficacy of all biofuels as clean energy as defined by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), including those derived from natural resources that compete with food and timber supplies.). Second, I argue that the more stringent Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), as implemented in California and British Columbia, would provide better social and environmental outcomes as a part of the national energy policy plan. © 2017 Nadia B.

AB  - Nowadays many types of biomass are studied to satisfy the increased demand of renewable energy based on pellet combustion. However, only a few biomasses fulfil the high quality standard required for pellet used in domestic appliances. European and International standards in force define this quality of non-industrial use of pellets in term of the origin of biomass, physical, mechanical and chemical parameters. Vineyard residues are a worldwide potential source of energy but their compliance to be used in domestic pellet stoves has not been yet proven according to the new standards in force. In order to meet this need, this study makes an exhaustive characterisation of vineyard based pellets manufactured from residues of Prosecco (Glera variety) vineyards, assessing both the quality of biofuel and its behaviour during combustion in a domestic pellet stove. The quality of biofuel has been evaluated according to the in force standards for wood and non-woody pellets. The results show that vineyard pellets do not meet the type B quality standards required for non-industrial use of wood pellet mainly because of the high amount of ash content (&gt;2%) and the high amount of copper (&gt;10 ppm) but they fulfil the specifications of the type B non-woody pellets. Furthermore, during combustion test of vineyard-based pellet the high emission of CO indicates incomplete combustion; and vineyard- based pellet NOx emissions are more than double compared to those obtained during the control tests, confirming that the analysed vineyard-based pellets are unsuitable, as they are, for use in traditional pellet stoves. © M.

AB  - An integrated process involving cyanobacterium cultivation and three-stage fermentation was investigated to efficiently produce gaseous biofuels. The content and concentration of total carbohydrates in Arthrospira platensis biomass were remarkably enhanced through nutrient adjustments. Relative nitrogen starvation with continuous 15% (v/v) CO2 bubbling led to the accumulation of large-molecular-weight glycogen as an intracellular energy reserve, whereas 0.5 mol/L NaCl addition at 3rd day resulted in the synthesis of small-molecular-weight carbohydrates (e.g., trehalose) as osmoprotectants. The total carbohydrates in A. platensis cultivated under 15% (v/v) CO2 and 0.5 mol/L NaCl stress occupied 53.4 wt% of the dried biomass. The harvested wet A. platensis biomass was pretreated with dilute acid and steam heating to give the maximum reducing sugar yield of 0.460 g/g volatile solids (VS). Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that the A. platensis cells were fractured section by section and thoroughly disrupted into small debris and fragments after pretreatment. A three-stage process combining dark hydrogen, photo hydrogen, and dark methane fermentation was employed for hydrogen and methane co-production using the pretreated A. platensis biomass. The hydrogen yield was 96 mL/gVS after first-stage dark fermentation, whereas the concentration of soluble metabolic products (SMPs) reached 9.692 g/L. Through the combined dark and photo hydrogen fermentation, the hydrogen yield significantly increased to 429 mL/gVS, corresponding to an SMP removal efficiency of 95.96%. The overall energy yield was boosted to 10.51 kJ/gVS after third-stage dark methane fermentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - About three billion people worldwide use solid fuels for cooking and space heating. This fueling practice contributes to global forest depletion and disease prevalence. To abate the environmental and health threats caused by the inefficient burning of biomass fuels, large-scale initiatives were undertaken globally for the dissemination of fuel-saving and energy-efficient stoves, known as improved cookstoves (ICS). This paper examines the adoption of ICS in northwest Pakistan by using a logit analysis. The results show that the education of the respondent, number of working household members, and total income of the household had significant effects on the adoption of ICS. Conversely, the age of the respondent and possession of land did not exhibit any significant influence on adoption. The overall model was significant with p < 0.001 which reveals that the selected socioeconomic variables have a statistically significant relationship with the adoption of ICS. The paper concludes that the efforts to improve health and environmental conditions may be more successful if ICS programs take the socioeconomic, contextual, and market related factors into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explored two holistic approaches for co-digestion of activated sludge and food waste. In Approach 1, mixed activated sludge and food waste were first hydrolyzed with fungal mash, and produced hydrolysate without separation was directly subject to anaerobic digestion. In Approach 2, solid generated after hydrolysis of food waste by fungal mash was directly converted to biofertilizer, while separated liquid with high soluble COD concentration was further co-digested with activated sludge for biomethane production. Although the potential energy produced from Approach 1 was about 1.8-time higher than that from Approach 2, the total economic revenue generated from Approach 2 was about 1.9-fold of that from Approach 1 due to high market value of biofertilizer. It is expected that this study may lead to a paradigm shift in biosolid management towards environmental and economic sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To establish a green platform for biodiesel production, this study mainly investigates pseudo-catalytic (non-catalytic) transesterification of olive oil. To this end, biochar from agricultural waste (maize residue) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as an acyl acceptor were used for pseudo-catalytic transesterification reaction. Reaction parameters (temperature and molar ratio of DMC to olive oil) were also optimized. The biodiesel yield reached up to 95.4% under the optimal operational conditions (380 °C and molar ratio of DMC to olive oil (36:1)). The new sustainable environmentally benign biodiesel production introduced in this study is greener and faster than conventional transesterification reactions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental impacts resulting from the cradle-to-grave life cycles of Enteromorpha prolifera macroalgae and cattle manure biorefineries are assessed and compared. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the response of the impacts to changes in biogas application by using Simapro 7.3.3. Three scenarios are considered in the biorefineries. In the first and second scenarios, the biogas produced is considered to be used for electricity production and transportation, respectively. In the third scenario, the biogas is considered to be recycled back to the systems. Process energy requirements and transportation of inputs contribute the largest share of the overall impacts. The cattle manure biorefinery is slightly more eco-friendly than the macroalgae biorefinery in Scenarios 1 and 2 because it requires more eco-friendly inputs. However, the macroalgae biorefinery becomes more eco-friendly than the cattle manure biorefinery in Scenario 3 because macroalgae require less energy and water for biogas production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In temperate climatic conditions, plantations of poplar and willow species provide sustainable production of biomass. Short rotation coppice plantations on agricultural lands have a great potential to increase the amount of biomass available for the production of biofuels, bioenergy and bioproducts. We studied and measured the growth of poplar and willow clones in two experimental research sites in Batys and Astaninskiy in the steppe zone of Astana in northern Kazakhstan. We measured tree heights, stem diameters at breast height and crown diameter. The mean height of 6-years-old trees of the "Kazakhstanskiy" hybrid poplar was 4.03 m in the Batys site, which is 1.6 m less than the height of poplars from the Astaninskiy experimental site that were measured in autumn. The results of this study show different reactions of selected clones/cultivars of poplar and willow to climatic conditions of northern Kazakhstan as well as their usability for biomass production in plantations under limiting hydrological conditions. © 2017 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - This study aims to present a comprehensive decision model for design of the integrated bioethanol supply chain (IBSC). In achieving this goal, we developed a new optimization model using mixed integer linear programming. The model consists of the objective function to minimize the required cost to establish the IBSC along with practical constraints including the limit of biomass, the capacity of technologies, and the land availability. This model is capable of identifying a wide range of solutions for the economically viable IBSC: biomass as a feedstock, technical configuration of the biorefinery, and supply chain solutions. We then analyze the impact of the policies to the bioethanol production and supply strategies by implementing the different scenarios of the bioethanol-gasoline blending policy. To illustrate the capability of the proposed model, we applied the model to the biomass-derived liquid fuel supply system of Jeju Island, Korea. As a result, the total supply cost was estimated to range from 0.83 to 0.88 $/liter according the blending policies. We also analyzed the preferable options to build the IBSC of Jeju Island: woody biomass to agricultural residues, gasification to fermentation as the main conversion technology, and regions with high biomass availability to high-demand regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to study Golenkinia sp. and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for the treatment of anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste (ADE-KW) with different dilution factors. A dual-chamber MFC was fabricated for treating ADE-KW in the two chambers of the MFC and harvesting Golenkinia sp. All the anodic TN was removed more than 80%. COD removal efficiency increased from 48.2% to 76% when the dilution factor increased from 1 to 4. Maximum COD and TN removal rates were 3.56 and 3.71 mg·L−1·h−1 when ADE-KW was treated without dilution in the anodic chamber. All the cathodic TN and TP removal efficiencies were approximately 90%. The highest open circuit voltage (OCV) and power density were approximately 400 mV and 400 mW when ADE-KW was treated directly (undiluted) in the MFC, with the highest biomass and total lipid content production of Golenkinia sp. in the cathodic chamber. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel resources requires a greater emphasis on the development of renewable energy technologies. Ethanol produced via biochemical means is a renewable liquid fuel option that shows great promise. In this paper, the large scale production of ethanol via a method of converting lignocellulosic material without the need for enzyme hydrolysis, termed consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), is analyzed and compared to traditional separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) methods to determine the profitability of biochemical ethanol production. Optimal process topologies for both the CBP and SHF technologies are selected from superstructures considering multiple biomass feeds, chosen from those available across the United States, and multiple prospective pretreatment technologies. Steam cogeneration is also considered to produce the necessary hot utilities as well as electricity as a salable byproduct. Results show the optimal consolidated bioprocessing plant produces about 66 million gallons of ethanol to be sold at a breakeven price of $1.31 per gallon ($0.35 per liter) from a pure sugarcane bagasse feed and sodium hydroxide pretreatment method in addition to 67 MW of electricity per year. These results compare favorably to SHF production methods, showing a 20% decrease in the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) and 197.5% increase in electricity generation despite a 13.3% drop in ethanol production. A long term economic evaluation is performed to determine an attractively profitable selling price for the ethanol produced. Additional analysis is done on the effect of a mixed biomass feed on process profitability and impact on biomass harvesting radius. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article addresses the future of Brazil's bioethanol sector, focusing on its capabilities to innovate, its efforts toward producing cellulosic ethanol, and on recently implemented policies. Contrary to what has been argued in the literature, Brazil may not be prepared to face the technological and market challenges now emerging in the biofuels domain worldwide. Important productive investments were made by oil, energy, and chemical companies in bioethanol production in Brazil in the first decade of the 2000s; however, that sector has not shown levels of investment in innovation—either for first- or second-generation bioethanol—compatible with the challenges of making bioethanol a global commodity. Even considering recent policies in Brazil toward cellulosic bioethanol, the results achieved have been far from sustainable. This situation is partially due to uncertainties surrounding biofuels worldwide and partially due to contradictory policies toward liquid fuels in Brazil. The Brazilian government has simultaneously promoted both fossil fuels and renewables, thereby creating ambiguity among decision makers. These and other findings were drawn from an in-depth survey on innovation in the bioethanol sector in Brazil conducted in 2014 among 35 productive units affiliated to 58 industrial groups. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Even decades ago, Thailand has centered on the process of de-agrarianization like other Southeast Asia countries. However, the agriculture section is still crucial because over half of the population is living in rural areas and most of them spend their lives based on the agriculture. Moreover, the agriculture has more effects on the contemporary issues including food and energy security, environmental conservation and poverty alleviation. Therefore, the government has implemented policies of the agriculture development continuously. This article is to analyze the government policies implementation in the agroindustry extension, which is the cooperation between government agencies and a private company in a Northeastern province of Thailand. Ferguson (1994) theory on the de-politicization of development was adopted in this article. The theory suggests that the development projects for poverty alleviation in developing countries is dominated by development discourse which constructing knowledge and truth as navigation device of the projects. The discourse has diverted the development to the technical subject solely and diminished considerably the power relation between parties, the root cause of social problems. The article drew on the qualitative research during 2014-2016. The observation of government agencies and the private company working on the agroindustry extension was performed. The data was collected from villages nearby the factory by observation, in-depth interview and structured questionnaire on farmers' households. The article analyses the development discourse and agricultural extension in national level and the agricultural extension toward agroindustry in village level. It indicated that even the agricultural extension improves the productive performance of farmers. Yet, the extension has created the pattern and the structure of power which maintain the superior status of the state and capitalists over the farmers' life increasingly. This paper argues that the de-politicization of development is function of the "anti-politic machine" of all problems. Therefore, the development problem lies in the government's concept and developmental methods hiding the true cause of social problem. It is noted as long as the development is still moving towards this way, it strongly emphasize the socioeconomic and power disparities. The capitalists gain more benefits while the farmers still are exploited and disadvantage. © Serials Publications Pvt.Ltd.

AB  - From an environmental point of view, diesel substitution with biodiesel shows many advantages but often involves environmental issues that must be assessed case by case. The environmental impact of Linum usitatissimum and Camelina sativa oilseed crops for biodiesel production was assessed by Life Cycle Assessment approach considering a cradle-to-gate perspective. The study included three steps: cultivation, oil seed transportation from farm to pressing plant and biodiesel production from vegetable oil by transesterification. The cultivation was carried out in Mediterranean conditions, with low inputs (minimum use of fertilisers and pesticides) and no irrigation. Seed production is responsible for more than 85–90% of the environmental impact of biodiesel; seed pressing represents less than 2% of the biodiesel environmental impact for most of the evaluated impact categories and transesterification ranges between 2% and 10%. For seed production, diesel fuel and exhaust gases emissions from the tractors' engines are the main factors responsible for the environmental impact, while pesticide and fertiliser production accounts for a small environmental load. In general, the differences between the performances of the two biodiesel fuels arise almost completely from the difference in the environmental impact of seed production and, in particular, from seed yield, which is higher for flax. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The relationship between uncertainty and risk–taking behaviour towards innovations and Common Market protection are investigated in this article. Therefore, the aim of this article is to assess points of control over market regulation protecting innovative products. It was found that risk of creative destruction due to implementation of innovations is increased by regulators due to antimonopoly metric they use. EU fiscal policy implementation in renewable fuels in Czech Republic of both EU and CZ calculations is compared. Historical data has shown that regulators have collapsed market of high condensed biofuels. Pattern of fine calculation has explained a market collapse. Comparison of excise duty of favoured biofuels was compared with subsidies for photovoltaics. Substitution of former fossil fuels taking into account excise duty and subsidies of alternative or renewable energies is less market distorting than recent tariffs of excise duty and fines to first generation biofuels. © 2017, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The current scenario of greenhouse gasses emissions is witnessing major impetus as a result of the ever expanding transportation sector across the globe, of which the aviation sector has played a major role. The Malaysian transportation sector, specifically the aviation sector, has a poor record of high carbon emissions, inspite of its history of biofuel and sustainable fuel policy. However, researchers around the globe are now diverting their attention from the conventional fossil fuels to biofuels, because it is cheaper to produce, increases the efficiency of the aircrafts and also reduces the environmental threat fossil fuel emissions pose to the planet. Alternative fuels like bioethanol and biodiesels are increasingly used in aviation industry, as a direct consequence of the global targets set by the International Air Transport Association. In the present study, the possibility of increased biofuel by the aviation industry of Malaysia is analyzed with specific focus on the global initiatives taken for the same, as well as the past and current trends of Malaysia's general biofuel production and consumption. It has been estimated that the use of alternative fuels in aviation industry could reduce the flight related greenhouse gas emission by approximately 60 to 80 %. The recent trials that have been conducted on the importance of biofuels in aviation industry have indicated that these fuels are technically feasible. In this respect, the European community in conjunction with private airline companies and major biofuels producers in their area have played a very prominent role in commercializing the use of biofuels in air transport. But in Malaysia to see biofuels as anything other than their consumption in the food and healthcare industry is still a debatable topic. By addressing these research gaps, this paper focuses on the possibility of manufacturing biofuel products at a commercial scale in Malaysia to be used in the aviation industry to power jet engines in commercial aviation and for reduced carbon emission for increased sustainability of the environment.

AB  - Municipal organic waste (MOW) is a promising feedstock for biogas plants and separate collection will increase available quantities. To close nutrient circles digestates shall be redistributed to arable land. However, less is known about digestate properties and how they are influenced during digestion. Therefore, changes in nutrient and heavy metal concentration in the solid digestate were investigated during anaerobic treatment of MOW in a two-stage laboratory biogas plant. Results show that the solid digestate is exposed to element accumulation, except for N, P and Mg. The loss of initial N, P and Mg load accounts up to 45%, which must be redistributed elsewhere in the digester system. K load of feedstock was completely rediscovered in the solid digestate. Heavy metal concentration in the digestate increases by factor 1.6 at average. The results emphasize that element retention in the digester system has a decisive impact on nutrient content of digestates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol is one of the most important biotechnological products to mitigate the consumption of fossil fuels and to increase the use of renewable resources for fuels and chemicals. Short rotation woody crops (SRWC) have been proposed as the most promising raw material for cellulosic ethanol production, as a result of its several advantages over traditional crops. In order to analyze the potential as crops for lignocellulosic bioethanol production in Chile, SRWC were established with the following species: Acacia melanoxylon, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens. These crops were established in two contrasting environments and in three plantation densities. The average theoretical ethanol yield at 48 months reached 395.9 L.t-1 for A. melanoxylon, 348.7 L.t-1 for E. camaldulensis, and 363.9 L t-1 for E. nitens. It can be concluded that there are significant differences in polysaccharides yield between species and time. On the other hand, significant differences were found between environments. In conclusion, this study has shown that the choice of SRWC species used as a source of polysaccharides must take into account the percentage content in biomass and, crucially, the species, planting density, harvest cycle and site must be carefully selected to ensure a high biomass yield per unit area. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - A substantial interest is growing in the cultivation of microalgae as a source of biofuel production, considering their relatively high lipid content, fast growth rates, use of alternative water sources, and growth on non-arable land. This paper conducts an energy life cycle analysis for a novel hypothetical hybrid energy system where the electricity required for microalgae cultivation is generated from semi-transparent PV panels to energise paddle wheels and light emitting diodes installed on raceway ponds. The combined system configuration allows for a full utilisation of the solar spectrum, while enhancing the photosynthetic productivity of microalgae cultivation and reducing the evaporation from raceway ponds. The findings of study for a hypothetical system installed in Western Australia show that the amount of land use substantially decreases by 43%, the productivity of microalgae cultivation increases by 75%, while the net energy return of the system remains significantly higher than one, in comparison with a microalgae cultivation system energised by grid electricity. Among a range of variables affecting the energy performance of the proposed system, the primary energy demand for PV panels and conversion efficiency of LEDs exert the highest impact on energy life cycle of the system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor was employed to treat potato starch processing wastewater and the efficacy, kinetics, microbial diversity and morphology of sludge granules were investigated. When organic loading rate (OLR) ranging from 2.70 to 13.27 kg COD/m3.d was implemented with various hydraulic retention times (72 h, 48 h and 36 h), COD removal could reach 92.0–97.7%. Highest COD removal (97.7%) was noticed when OLR was 3.65 kg COD/m3.d, but had declined to 92.0% when OLR was elevated to 13.27 kg COD/m3.d. Methane and biogas production increased from 0.48 to 2.97 L/L.d and 0.90 to 4.28 L/L.d, respectively. Kinetics and predictions by modified-Gompertz model agreed better with experimental data as opposed to first-order kinetic model. Functional population with highest abundance was Chloroflexi (28.91%) followed by Euryarchaeota (22.13%), Firmicutes (16.7%), Proteobacteria (16.25%) and Bacteroidetes (7.73%). Compared with top sludge, tightly-bound extracellular polymeric substances was high within bottom and middle sludge. Morphology was predominantly Methanosaeta-like cells, Methanosarcina-like cells, rods and cocci colonies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The continued growth of U.S. first generation biofuels, mostly corn-grain ethanol, is facing increased pressure from the “food-vs.-fuel” and ethanol “blend wall” debates. Second generation (cellulosic) biofuels avoid the uncertainties about impact on food security and land competition, but have yet to become widely commercialized. No previous studies were found quantifying the relative importance of factors driving or constraining the commercialization of the U.S. cellulosic biofuels industry. Respondents to this study's online and paper-based surveys, administered between July and November, 2015, included 228 experts throughout the biorefinery supply chain from seven USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAPs) and two industrial conferences. Government policies were rated as the most important driver for the commercialization of cellulosic biofuels. The second most importance driver was added value from non-fuel co-products, followed by carbon emission reduction and volatile oil prices. High production costs, policy uncertainty, and competition vs. petro-fuels were identified as the top three barriers to the commercialization of cellulosic biofuels. This paper also identified significant differences in the rating of drivers and barriers among four self-described expert groups (Feedstock, Processing, Economic/Business, and Sustainability), thus underscoring the importance of examining issues from multiple perspectives and highlighting the value of the USDA NIFA CAPs. Finally, participants were significantly more optimistic about the success of the integrated production of both cellulosic biofuels and biochemicals by the year 2020 vs. cellulosic biofuels alone (at the p = 0.001 level), underscoring the perceived advantages of the integrated biorefinery model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels have been promoted worldwide under the assumption that they can support several strategic policy goals, while mitigating associated risks. Drawing on published evidence on performance, contributing papers to this Special Section question assumptions commonly attributed to biofuels: their carbon neutrality, their positive effect on rural livelihoods, and policymakers’ ability to effectively govern for sustainability. This paper takes these findings as its starting point and asks, “What next?” for countries wishing to advance biofuels as one option for the necessary divestment from fossil fuels. Deriving recommendations for national biofuel programs from past performance is no easy task. Context, complexity, power dynamics and scaling pose significant challenges to achieving policy aims. We are nevertheless able to distill a set of sine qua nons (indispensables) for sustainable biofuel governance from the evidence and change management literatures. They are put forward not as recipes for success, but minimum conditions and “best bet” approaches requiring testing, deliberation, and refinement. Perhaps the most fundamental sine qua non is to pursue options that downscale global demand – as current levels of global energy consumption, if only in the transport sector, cannot be met by biomass-derived agrofuels in a way that meets social and environmental sustainability goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been developed into a major herbaceous bioenergy crop for the production of cellulosic biofuels in North America and many counties in European. As cultivar selection has a major impact on the ultimate biomass productivity, we evaluated the adaptability and yield potential of 12 switchgrass cultivars including both upland and lowland ecotypes from 2010 to 2013 in the Beijing region, Northern China. Plant height was measured after anthesis, but phytomer number and tiller density were investigated at harvest. One single autumn harvest was carried out each year and biomass yields were determined. It was found that the lowland cultivars ‘Alamo’, ‘Kanlow’ and ‘NewYork’ produced the most biomass for their better performances in number of phytomers per tiller and mass per phytomer, though upland cultivars had higher tiller density. ‘Cave-in-rock’ and ‘Trailblazer’ had better biomass production among the upland cultivars and they were also recommended for planting together with lowland ones for their excellent cold tolerance in this region. © 2017

AB  - Sustainable design methods focus on reducing or minimizing the demand for ecosystem goods and services, quantified as natural resources and pollutant mitigation. However, the capacity of ecosystems to supply these demands is routinely ignored, leading to decisions that overburden ecological processes and cause environmental damage. This work develops a techno-ecological synergy (TES) design methodology that balances the ecosystem services that can be provided by nature with the ecosystem service demands created by human activities. The methodology includes the design of technological processes that require ecosystem services as well as the ecological processes that supply those services. The TES Design methodology is demonstrated by application to a renewable energy production system that includes both land use activities, such as agriculture and wind turbines, and biomass conversion activities such as corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel. Under TES Design, the system is optimized to balance the demand and supply of ecosystem services, within constraints imposed on energy production and system economics. The system is also optimized under a more conventional approach that reduces ecosystem service demand while neglecting ecosystem service supply and the relevant ecological processes. Results show that only the TES methodology produces system designs in which ecosystem service supply meets or exceeds the demand. TES system designs produce the same amount of energy as conventional designs, have similar system economics, and use land both for energy production and for ecosystem service supply. The additional supply enables the use of intensive agricultural practices with higher ecosystem service demands and higher biomass yields. These results encourage further efforts toward TES Design with additional ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) is considered to be one of the best feedstocks for second generation ethanol production. However, its use as a biofuel resource for the ethanol market is challenged by high investment costs and inconsistent production methodologies. This study explores the use of switchgrass as a potential feedstock for ethanol production, investigating the effects of different pretreatment chemicals – sodium hydroxide, methanol, sulphuric acid and ammonia – employed at various concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2 mol L−1 on conversion yields, while also minimising cost and assessing potential environmental impacts. Glucose and ethanol yields showed that methanol was the most effective pretreatment chemical at 1 mol L−1, producing 230 g of glucose and 340 cm3 of ethanol kg−1 of feedstock with a 97% conversion rate. Pretreatment employing sodium hydroxide was found to be the least effective, with cellulose to glucose conversion rates of 38% and 62% following simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). In general, SSF significantly increased cellulose conversion rates, up to 32% for some samples. At 0.55 € kg−1 glucose and 0.50 € L−1 ethanol methanol was also found to be the most cost effective pretreatment technique compared to sodium hydroxide at 1.96 € kg−1 glucose and 7.94 € L−1 ethanol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental degradation and the health hazards caused by the petroleum fuels needs a compelling research for the alternate energy source. This paper analysis the pongamia methyl ester (PME) as an alternate source of fuel for CI engines without making much changes in the existing engine technology and without causing much difficulties for the scientists and engineers. The study reveals the use of PME as either an alternate fuel or substitute for the diesel may definitely reduces the green house gases at the same time the employability in the agricultural field will be increased by retaining the migration of the farmer community towards cities or towns for search of employment. It was observed that the use of PME as fuel reduces carbon monoxide to an extent of 8.2% compared to diesel at the same time HC reduced by 8.9% also there is considerable reduction in oxides of nitrogen. There was increase in BSFC of 4.2% and the thermal efficiency reduced by 2.4%. But the environmental sustainability and the employability for local community and promotion of agriculture prefers the PME as an alternate fuel for the transport, agricultural and power sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is increasingly used to ensure environmental sustainability of emerging biofuels. However, LCA studies are usually not performed at the process design stage, when it would be more efficient to identify and control environmental aspects. Moreover, the long-term economic profitability of biofuels depends on future energy and climate policies, which are usually not considered in techno-economic feasibility studies. This paper combines the LCA method and a TIMES energy system model, to offer a simultaneous assessment of potential environmental impacts and market penetration under different energy and climate policy scenarios of emerging energy pathways. This combined approach is applied to butanol produced from pre-hydrolysate in a Canadian Kraft dissolving pulp mill. Indeed, the integration of biorefinery processes into existing pulp and paper mills has been identified as a promising avenue to maintain mills activities. It could increase and diversify revenues, keep the forestry-based communities alive, and potentially mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based fuels or products. Results show that (1) the energy efficiency of the butanol production process is a critical aspect to consider in future design and implementation steps in order to make butanol a competitive fuel among all other alternative fuels, (2) with a 50% internal heat recovery, butanol has a role to play in the transportation sector under climate policy scenarios, and may have a lower carbon footprint than gasoline as estimated by a 2010 US EPA study, and (3) higher supply costs for feedstock might undermine the competitiveness of butanol on the medium term (2030), but probably not on the long-term (2050). This combination of assessment methods is replicable to analyze any types of emerging energy pathways in Canada and in other countries, and to help designing more sustainable forest biorefinery processes in other countries with important forest sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates how risks are anticipated in national bioenergy policies and in which way related expectations that harms can be prevented or mitigated have actually been met. The paper draws on the national biofuel policies of ten countries and the EU, selected to represent a diverse sample of regions, producers and consumers, and pioneers and latecomers. It proceeds in two steps: firstly, it identifies three risk categories most frequently mentioned across the investigated national policies. Secondly, it conducts a systematic review of available empirical research about biofuels’ effects in these risk categories. Findings are discussed regarding the empirical conditions under which related expectations to do no harm have materialized or failed; and concerning the challenges of risks perception and management in actual policies. We observe issues of crop selection and inadequate sectoral governance of biofuels, but also challenges of large-scale modes of intensive production. Effective risk mitigation was often the result of risk adverse choices by contract farmers engaged in biofuels production. National policy documents have insufficiently conceptualized ‘do no harm’ concepts and strategies in place to address these performance issues; while remaining silent on the particular risk governance and accountability framework that keeps track of actual developments, commitments and responsibilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Grassland production systems offer feedstock for power production based on biogas in Germany. In the future, additional potential grassland will be made available due to further concentration of cattle production in areas that possess comparative advantages for milk and meat production. This study assesses grassland as a feedstock for biogas production in Germany from both an economic and ecological point of view by considering regional production conditions and plant-specific factors. Regional production costs and greenhouse gas emissions for grasslands are calculated within the federal states of Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, which represent hotspots for German biogas production. A linear model approach is used to optimize the feedstock mix of each biogas plant located in one of these exemplary regions. In a scenario-based analysis, the opportunity costs for energy crops cultivated on arable land are considered to depict a shortage of arable land as an economic advantage of grasslands. Similar to EU biofuel production, the linear model considers the greenhouse gas mitigation potential for power production based on biogas and differing costs of CO2 emission rights. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated both with and without iLUC factors to highlight the differences between arable land and grasslands with respect to limited availabilities and the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions. The results show that grasslands could be a reasonable feedstock for biogas production, especially in the northern part of Germany, if iLUC factors are considered and if a greenhouse gas mitigation potential is required that includes high prices for CO2 emission rights. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomethane produced from seaweed is a third generation renewable gaseous fuel. The advantage of seaweed for biofuel is that it does not compete directly or indirectly for land with food, feed or fibre production. Furthermore, the integration of seaweed and salmon farming can increase the yield of seaweed per hectare, while reducing the eutrophication from fish farming. So far, full comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of seaweed biofuel are scarce in the literature; current studies focus mainly on microalgal biofuels. The focus of this study is an assessment of the sustainability of seaweed biomethane, with seaweed sourced from an integrated seaweed and salmon farm in a north Atlantic island, namely Ireland. With this goal in mind, an attributional LCA principle was applied to analyse a seaweed biofuel system. The environmental impact categories assessed are: climate change, acidification, and marine, terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication. The seaweed Laminaria digitata is digested to produce biogas upgraded to natural gas standard, before being used as a transport biofuel. The baseline scenario shows high emissions in all impact categories. An optimal seaweed biomethane system can achieve 70% savings in GHG emissions as compared to gasoline with high yields per hectare, optimum seaweed composition and proper digestate management. Seaweed harvested in August proved to have higher methane yield. August seaweed biomethane delivers 22% lower impacts than biomethane from seaweed harvested in October. Seaweed characteristics are more significant for improvement of biomethane sustainability than an increase in seaweed yield per unit area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Marginal lands are recommended as a viable land resource for biofeedstocks production, but their suitability for biofeedstock crops growth are poorly understood. This study assessed the suitability of marginal lands in Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) for three promising biofeedstock crops, switchgrass, Miscanthus and hybrid poplar. The land suitability was categorized into 5 suitability classes (not-, poorly-, moderately-, good- and highly-suitable) based on a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation procedure. The results showed that 60% of marginal lands in UMRB were moderately to highly suitable for growth of the targeted biofeedstock crops. Predicted bioethanol production from marginal land in the UMRB with consideration of suitability level was two thirds of the production predicted without consideration of suitability level. Our results better constrain the potential of marginal land for biofuel production as well as the importance of land suitability evaluation for policy analysis targeting biofuel development on marginal lands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A microalgae-based energy system, which is a combination of different microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and an integrated cogasification combined cycle (ICGCC) system, is presented. To address the low environmental impacts, the electricity is generated from ICGCC to meet the load demand from the microalgae-to-biodiesel chains and the flue gas exits from ICGCC to meet the demand of growing algal culture. To achieve the microalgae-based energy system with minimum life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the first step is to develop the superstructure model based on GAMS, the second step is to use the optimal heat exchanger network to maximize the heat recovery of ICGCC, and the third step is to find the optimal combination of the microalgae-to-biodiesel chain and optimal operating conditions of ICGCC by solving the global optimization of nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. For the scope of well-to-tank (WTT), the optimal microalgae-based energy system reduces 16.80% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to the other reported microalgae-to-biodiesel chains. For the scope of well-to-wheel (WTW), the optimal microalgae-based energy system reduces 45.77% GHG emissions compared to the conventional diesel process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study uses a geographically-explicit cost optimization model to analyze the impact of and interrelation between four cost reduction strategies for biofuel production: economies of scale, intermodal transport, integration with existing industries, and distributed supply chain configurations (i.e. supply chains with an intermediate pre-treatment step to reduce biomass transport cost). The model assessed biofuel production levels ranging from 1 to 150 PJ a−1 in the context of the existing Swedish forest industry. Biofuel was produced from forestry biomass using hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. Simultaneous implementation of all cost reduction strategies yielded minimum biofuel production costs of 18.1–18.2 € GJ−1 at biofuel production levels between 10 and 75 PJ a−1. Limiting the economies of scale was shown to cause the largest cost increase (+0–12%, increasing with biofuel production level), followed by disabling integration benefits (+1–10%, decreasing with biofuel production level) and allowing unimodal truck transport only (+0–6%, increasing with biofuel production level). Distributed supply chain configurations were introduced once biomass supply became increasingly dispersed, but did not provide a significant cost benefit (&lt;1%). Disabling the benefits of integration favors large-scale centralized production, while intermodal transport networks positively affect the benefits of economies of scale. As biofuel production costs still exceeds the price of fossil transport fuels in Sweden after implementation of all cost reduction strategies, policy support and stimulation of further technological learning remains essential to achieve cost parity with fossil fuels for this feedstock/technology combination in this spatiotemporal context. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Bioaugmentation with anaerobic fungi (AF) is promising for improved biogas generation from lignocelluloses-rich substrates. However, before implementing AF into biogas processes it is necessary to investigate their natural occurrence, community structure and transcriptional activity in agricultural biogas plants. Thus, AF were detected with three specific PCR based methods: (i) Copies of their 18S genes were found in 7 of 10 biogas plants. (ii) Transcripts of a GH5 endoglucanase gene were present at low level in two digesters, indicating transcriptional cellulolytic activity of AF. (iii) Phylogeny of the AF-community was inferred with the 28S gene. A new Piromyces species was isolated from a PCR-positive digester. Evidence for AF was only found in biogas plants operated with high proportions of animal feces. Thus, AF were most likely transferred into digesters with animal derived substrates. Additionally, high process temperatures in combination with long retention times seemed to impede AF survival and activity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large-scale cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., miscanthus and switchgrass) offers unique opportunities to mitigate climate change through avoided fossil fuel use and associated greenhouse gas reduction. Although conversion of existing agriculturally intensive lands (e.g., maize and soy) to perennial bioenergy cropping systems has been shown to reduce near-surface temperatures, unintended consequences on natural water resources via depletion of soil moisture may offset these benefits. The hydroclimatic impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion over the contiguous United States are quantified using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model dynamically coupled to a land surface model (LSM). A suite of continuous (2000-09) medium-range resolution (20-km grid spacing) ensemble-based simulations is conducted using seasonally evolving biophysical representation of perennial bioenergy cropping systems within the LSM based on observational data. Deployment is carried out only over suitable abandoned and degraded farmlands to avoid competition with existing food cropping systems. Results show that near-surface cooling (locally, up to 5°C) is greatest during the growing season over portions of the central United States. For some regions, principal impacts are restricted to a reduction in near-surface temperature (e.g., eastern portions of the United States), whereas for other regions deployment leads to soil moisture reduction in excess of 0.15-0.2 m3 m-3 during the simulated 10-yr period (e.g., western Great Plains). This reduction (~25%-30% of available soil moisture) manifests as a progressively decreasing trend over time. The large-scale focus of this research demonstrates the long-term hydroclimatic sustainability of large-scale deployment of perennial bioenergy crops across the continental United States, revealing potential hot spots of suitable deployment and regions to avoid. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - Biofuel production is not cost competitive and thus requires governmental intervention. The effect of the institutional framework on the development of the biofuel sector is not yet well understood. This paper aims to analyze how biofuel production and production capacity could have evolved in Germany in the period 1992–2014. The effects of an agricultural policy intervention (liberalization of the agricultural market) and a bioenergy policy intervention (a tax on biodiesel after an initial exemption) are explored. Elements of the Modeling Agent systems based on Institutional Analysis (MAIA) framework, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory, and Neo Institutional Economics (NIE) theory were used to conceptualize and formalize the system in an agent-based model. It was found that an early liberalization of the agricultural market led to an under-production of biodiesel; a late liberalization led to the collapse of biodiesel production. An early introduction of the biodiesel tax led to stagnation in biodiesel production and production capacity; a late introduction led to an increase in sunk costs provided that the biofuel quota is binding. Also, a lack of agents’ adaptation mechanism to forecast prices led to a decrease in patterns of biodiesel production when an external shock was introduced in the system. In sum, we argue that system behavior is influenced by individual behavior which is shaped by institutions. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - The development of an economically viable biofuel industry rests on strong state subsidies for production and processing, creation of markets through government procurement, fuel-blending mandates, price controls, as well as foreign trade tariffs and quotas, and multiple interventions in agricultural, ecological, and other regulations. We use an approach grounded in agrarian political economy to critically analyze the literature on how biofuel policies interact with broader production, trade, and agro-ecological processes. We focus on policies involving the most prominent crops in the places where biofuel production has advanced the most (i.e. USA, Brazil, and the EU), but also extend analysis to their relations with broader transformations in production, commercial, and even governance practices around the world. We investigate the political and economic interests driving biofuel policies, and how these set the terms in which state interventions and policies are conceived and implemented. We find that these are not developed and implemented according to environmental or inclusive pro-poor development purposes, but according to state interests in energy security and its intersection with a tense alliance between corporate sectors, rendering many policy mechanisms ineffective or even outright counterproductive to effectively facilitate more socially and environmentally sustainable energy production and agricultural practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High value-added reutilization of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is essential in sustainable development in WWTPs. However, despite the advantage of high value reutilization, this process must be based on a detailed study of organics in sludge. We used the methods employed in life sciences to determine the profile of lipids (cellular lipids, free fatty acids (FFAs), and wax/gum) in five sludge samples obtained from three typical WWTPs in Beijing; these samples include one sludge sample from a primary sedimentation tank, two activated sludge samples from two Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2/O) tanks, and two activated sludge samples from two membrane bioreactor tanks. The percentage of total raw lipids varied from 2.90% to 12.3%. Sludge from the primary sedimentation tank showed the highest concentrations of lipid, FFA, and wax/gum and the second highest concentration of cellular lipids. All activated sludge contained an abundance of cellular lipids (>54%). Cells in sludge can from plants, animals, microbes and so on in wastewater. Approximately 14 species of cellular lipids were identified, including considerable high value-potential ceramide (9567–38774 mg/kg), coenzyme (937–3897 mg/kg), and some phosphatidylcholine (75–548 mg/kg). The presence of those lipid constituents would thus require a wider range of recovery methods for sludge. Both cellular lipids and FFAs contain an abundance of C16–C18 lipids at high saturation level, and they serve as good resources for biodiesel production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Chinese government has been issuing numerous incentive policies to promote non-grain bioethanol development to address the problem of excessive energy consumption and environmental pollution. In this study, we divide the incentive policies into five categories: subsidies on bioethanol production, non-grain feedstocks planting, marginal land reclamation and utilization, bioethanol consumption in more cities, and consumption tax on gasoline use. The objective of the paper is to evaluate and compare the economic, energy, and environmental effects of the incentive policies to help the government choose the optimal policies to promote bioethanol in China. The results show that subsidies on bioethanol production and consumption can boost GDP, and simultaneously, decrease crude oil and gasoline consumption, and reduce CO2 emissions. However, the increase in bioethanol consumption is combined with the rise in coal and electricity consumption. Subsidies on bioethanol production can promote GDP and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission but have less effect on bioethanol development than that under the scenario of subsides on bioethanol consumption. On the contrary, although subsidies on non-grain feedstocks planting and marginal land reclamation and utilization can improve macro-economy but have a negative effect on energy saving and CO2 emission reduction. Therefore, appropriate subsidies on bioethanol production and consumption can promote bioethanol consumption with economic, energy and environmental benefits. The Chinese government should further pay more attention to the coordination of different policy options by policy tools and intensities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decisions about the harvest timing for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) crops has important implications for economic and environmental objectives because there may be a significant trade-off between harvestable yield, bioenergy crop quality, and environmental cost or benefit. We investigated the effects of harvest timing and nitrogen (N) addition on switchgrass crops established in Wisconsin, USA to investigate the causes of biomass loss over time and to identify plant components that contribute to N loss or retention at each harvest date. We found that harvestable yield decreased over successive harvest dates, as a result of the physical loss of leaves and inflorescence biomass. Although N addition increased total aboveground biomass, it also increased the proportion of biomass occurring as leaves and infloresence. Leaf and infloresence biomass decreased over time and during harvest operations; however, this biomass became incorporated into the litter pool and increased on-site N retention. We conclude that although adding N to switchgrass is unlikely to increase harvestable yield when harvests are conducted after plant senescence, retention of high-N plant components will help maintain long-term site productivity and ecosystem function of bioenergy cropping systems, especially for sites targeted for low-input management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to carry out an updated energy Life-Cycle Assessment of soybean biodiesel produced in the Pampean region of Argentina and to analyze the influence of different tillage systems on the Energy Return on Investment (EROI). It aims to identify the processes, materials and methodological aspects that significantly affect biofuel EROI. The procedure considers the main processes and operations of both the agriculture and industrial stages of biofuel production system, but the main novelty of this study is linking EROI with farming and conservation practices and not in the chemical processing of the oil. The results obtained represent the current average energetic performance of soy-based biodiesel produced in the considered region. The EROI values are very encouraging, demonstrating that this biodiesel provides a net energy gain. The results also show that conservation agriculture and the implementation of practices that improve crop yield do not always determine better energetic performance. Sensitivity analysis confirms that EROI values of soybean biodiesel are more responsive to methodological choices such as the system's boundary definition and the choice of the allocation method rather than to the physical aspects of the productive system such as tillage and water management practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are gaining popularity as a source of biodiesel. Recycling fertilizer nutrients is critical to sustain large-scale biodiesel production because the global supply of surplus fertilizer is limited. This study demonstrates that anaerobic digestion of residual algal biomass from biodiesel production can provide additional nutrients and energy. Anaerobic digestion of Chlorella sorokiniana 1412 whole cell algae (WCA), sonicated algae (SA), and SA subjected to lipid extraction (LEA) in bench-scale batch reactors operated at 30 ± 2 °C for 42 days released a considerable amount of the nitrogen and phosphorus in the algal cells. Digestion of WCA, SA, LEA released 48.1, 77.4, and 61.5% of the total algal nitrogen as NH4 +-N, and 87.7, 99.4, and 93.6% of the total algal P as soluble P, respectively. The energy recovery from algae biomass was quantified through the methane yield. The biochemical methane potential of WCA, SA and LEA was 0.298, 0.388 and 0.253 L methane per gram algal volatile solids, respectively. The conversion of LEA and WCA biomass to methane was very similar (38 and 41% on a COD basis, respectively), indicating that the energy yield was not significantly lowered by extraction of the lipid fraction (which accounted for 9% of algal dry weight). Sonication improved the access of hydrolytic enzymes to algal biopolymers (compensating in part for the energy lost due to lipid extraction). The results taken as a whole indicate that anaerobic digestion of LEA can provide considerable yields of methane and soluble nutrients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The lack of management and economic value of forest ecosystems in Mediterranean areas, mainly dominated by pines (Pinus halepensis Mill. and Pinus pinaster Ait.), together with a continuous growing of forests on marginal agricultural land have leaded to an increased forest fire risk and devaluation of natural resources in less favoured rural regions. The use of residual forest-based biomass as value added biofuels like pellets can reverse this situation. Nevertheless, there is an industrial need of knowledge of the influence of raw material composition on pellet manufacturing quality for the main Mediterranean softwood species. In this research influencing pellet quality variables such as contents of moisture, ash, fine particles, chlorine and sulphate, but also mechanical durability, bulk density and net calorific value have been analysed following EN standards. The obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain high quality pellets from barked and debarked logs as well as from branches from P. halepensis and P. pinaster. This implies that the abundant forest biomass residues in the western Mediterranean region of Europe can be transformed into high added value solid biofuels, opening new opportunities for local industries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an important bridging biofuel for reducing greenhouse gases (GHG). In 2015, Germany introduced a new GHG based quota scheme for biofuels. However, the use of default GHG values for rapeseed cultivation could provide inaccurate for specific regions and locations. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to use RELCA (a REgional Life Cycle inventory Approach) to assess the regional and spatial variation of GHG emissions associated with biodiesel production in Central Germany and to compare these results with the default values of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), as well as to identify potential mitigation options for biodiesel production. The RELCA simulations indicated GHG emissions of 31.9–39.83 CO2eq./MJ, with emission magnitude changing between biodiesel configurations due to their locations within the CG region. In comparison with typical RED values for biodiesel, the CG simulations showed 13–31% greater mitigation potential. The results also indicated that the configuration of biomass and conversion plant needs to be assessed to develop the most appropriate mitigation strategies. Current GHG mitigation strategies are limited to the energy sector, allowing leakages within the agricultural sector. Therefore, for more spatially targeting GHG accounting to be implemented, sustainability certification should be expanded to other biomass markets. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Transportation biofuel production efficiencies and cruising ranges provided by one hectare of land are studied from a life cycle perspective in the boreal climate zone. Efficient biofuel production is essential in terms of sustainability – especially land use, biodiversity and GHG emissions. Grass methane produced by anaerobic digestion and synthetic natural gas (SNG) produced from willows by gasification provide the longest cruising ranges. However, electricity production by solar panels for electric vehicles is a significantly more efficient option than biofuels. Grass methane, straw ethanol and SNG require less primary energy per produced fuel energy than other options. Increasing biofuel production for passenger cars from cultivated biomass in the boreal climate zone should be very carefully considered because electricity for transportation is significantly more efficient. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because socioeconomic based approaches account for relevant limiting and motivating factors, they provide a more realistic measurement of forestland owners’ willingness to supply biomass for bioenergy production- information useful to policy makers in setting production targets and in designing relevant incentive programs. Although forestland owners can supply biomass using different means, including supplying biomass from existing stands and changing land use to establish feedstock plantation, among others, previous studies mostly focus only on a given way of supplying biomass at a time. This produces incomplete information that adversely affects its use. By presenting survey takers in Virginia and Texas three different ways of supplying biomass at the same time, we determine forestland owners’ willingness to consider multiple ways of supplying biomass simultaneously and identify the factors that predict such behavior, assess overlap in forestland owners across the different ways of supplying biomass, and assess if and how respondents’ forest management plans and sustainability concerns correspond with their supply decision. Our results show a higher and more articulated rate of willingness to supply biomass than reported in previous studies. The results also suggest that opportunities exist for synergizing programs that incentivize disparate ways of supplying biomass. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Farm scale pellet production is a promising opportunity for farmers and landowners interested in producing a renewable biomass fuel. However, the true costs and performance of these systems in a farm setting is not fully understood. A feasibility analysis was carried out on the farm-scale switchgrass production operation at Wood Crest Farm near Berwick, PA as a representative example of operations in the region. Farmer interviews and direct measurements of equipment performance, energy use, and labor requirements were recorded for all stages of the operation. Results indicate that the production of pellets at this facility costs $98 per tonne, excluding labor, equipment and land purchase costs. As such, this represents a “bare bones” operating cost. Including the cost of labor brings the cost to about $307 per tonne. Thus, production may only be economically feasible when land, equipment, and labor are available at marginal or reduced cost. Every joule of energy input into the operation yielded 7.8 J of energy in the pellet fuel. There appears to be potential to reduce operating costs by increasing pelletizer yield and/or automating pelletizer operations - two opportunities for engineered solutions in this sector that can render the operation financially viable even when labor costs are included. On-farm pelleting in the Northeast US appears to have potential to be cost competitive with commercial wood pellets in select scenarios, and has the potential to be more widely applicable if modest improvements are made to process efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of biofuel industry in Indonesia represents the emerging phase, because of the impetus of government commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission regulations which are decanted in President Decree No. 61 the year 2011. Indonesia has committed to reducing greenhouse gasses by 26% below 2005 levels, equivalent to 767 million tons of greenhouse gasses on their own. National Energy Policy set to blending bioethanol in premium 10% and 20% in 2020 and 2050 respectively. Potency that owned by Sumba Island, especially in east eastern Indonesia, encourages the growth of bioethanol industry regarding the availability of raw material resources and tropical climate for biofuel crop cultivation. Therefore it is necessary to analyze the feasibility of bioethanol production from potential raw materials in Sumba Island. It combines a Bayes method with financial analysis and a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework to propose the development strategy of sustainable bioethanol industry in the Sumba Island. Recommended feedstock for the development of the bioethanol industry in Sumba Island is sweet sorghum and cassava. Financial feasibility assessment of bioethanol industry is based on the assumption that at least 70% of the feedstock is supplied by the company's land and the rest comes from the farming communities. The proposed integration pattern is by integrating the ethanol industry with bio-farming and bio-manure to utilize the waste completely. The development of bioethanol industry in Sumba Island is still faced with many obstacles, including the sustainability of feedstock both for cassava and sweet sorghum, infrastructure constraints, and regulation enforcement. Alternative strategies for the development of an integrated bioethanol industry are (1) conducting intensification and extensification of agricultural land to meet the needs of raw materials, (2) promoting technological innovation and institutional innovation to accelerate the delivery and adoption bioethanol, and (3) developing bioethanol industry cluster that is supported by the infrastructure cluster.

AB  - Application of bioash from biofuel combustion to soil supports nutrient recycling, but may have unwanted and detrimental ecotoxicological side-effects, as the ash is a complex mixture of compounds that could affect soil invertebrates directly or through changes in their food or habitat conditions. To examine this, we performed laboratory toxicity studies of the effects of wood-ash added to an agricultural soil and the organic horizon of a coniferous plantation soil with the detrivore soil collembolans Folsomia candida and Onychiurus yodai, the gamasid predaceous mite Hypoaspis aculeifer, and the enchytraeid worm Enchytraeus crypticus. We used ash concentrations spanning 0–75 g kg−1 soil. As ash increases pH we compared bioash effects with effects of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, the main liming component of ash. Only high ash concentrations above 15 g kg−1 agricultural soil or 17 t ha−1 had significant effects on the collembolans. The wood ash neither affected H. aculeifer nor E. crypticus. The estimated osmolalities of Ca(OH)2 and the wood ash were similar at the LC50 concentration level. We conclude that short-term chronic effects of wood ash differ among different soil types, and osmotic stress is the likely cause of effects while high pH and heavy metals is of minor importance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Huge amount of aging biogas slurry is in urgent need to be treated properly. However, due to high NH3-N concentration and low C/N ratio, this aging biogas slurry is refractory for traditional methods. Its denitrification has become a big challenge. In this paper, photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) were employed to handle this problem. The results showed denitrification of aging biogas slurry by PSB treatment was promising. The highest removal efficiency of NH3-N reached 99.75%, much higher than all other treatments. The removal of NH3-N followed pseudo zero order reaction under dark-aerobic condition. The better inoculation rate for NH3-N removal was 30%; and aerobic condition was more beneficial for NH3-N removal than anaerobic condition because of different metabolic pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As the demand for biofuels for transportation is increasing, it is necessary to acquire technologies that will allow affordable production of biodiesel. Conventional biodiesel is mainly produced from vegetable oil by chemical transesterification, but this product has relatively low yield and is competing with agricultural land that can be used for food production. In the present study, 14 filamentous fungi were isolated from different types of soil from Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Nile red staining revealed that lipid bodies were present in 6 of the 14 fungal isolates. Lipid extraction showed that 3 fungi were able to accumulate lipid >20% (wt/wt) of their dry cell mass (0.59–2.40 g/L). The profile of fatty acids revealed a high content of oleic (C18:1, n9), palmitic (C16:0) and linoleic (C18:2) acids similar to conventional vegetable oils used for biodiesel production. Isolate RY4, with the highest lipid yield was identified as Mucor circinelloides based on morphological characteristics confirmed with 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Sequence data of nucleotides were obtained from DNA sequencing submitted to GenBank [GenBank: AB916546.1]. Certain oil compounds were determined by FTIR spectroscopy. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Biogas is a biofuel that can contribute to more renewable and local energy systems. From a feedstock perspective there is a great biogas potential in Sweden, but many biogas producers face challenges and are struggling with profitability. Among the many influencing factors, the choice of feedstocks (biomass) for producing biogas and biofertilizer is of strategic importance. Within the Biogas Research Center (BRC) research project has been ongoing for four years, involving researchers, biogas and biofertilizer producers, agricultural organizations and others. The main aim has been to develop a method to assess the suitability of feedstock for biogas and biofertilizer production, and to apply this method on a few selected feedstocks of different character. This project is presented in two companion articles, of which this is the second. While the first article is focused on the developed multi-criteria method, this article present assessment results for ley crops, straw, farmed blue mussels and food waste. These results clarify how the method can be applied and highlight barriers, drivers and opportunities for each feedstock. Comparisons are also made. The results indicate that biogas production from food waste and ley crops is the most straightforward, and for straw and farmed blue mussels there are more obstacles to overcome. For all of them, the dynamic and very uncertain policy landscape is a barrier. In the final section, some conclusions about the method and its application are drawn, combining the information form both articles (part I & II). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to high-value transportation petrol, jet and diesel fuels is of great importance to develop versatile renewable energy and boost the rural economy, thus it is receiving worldwide attention. However, the state-of-the-art processes still suffer from a low efficiency in yield and productivity, which hinders the progress of its commercialization. Thus, it is essential to explore the consolidated catalytic reaction and refinery process. Here we report an advanced approach/process that could continuously produce long-chain (C5-C15) ketones from lignocellulosic biomass in a cascade mode by integrating several bio- and chemical catalysis reactions/processes, which exhibits a high efficiency and stable conversion rate. This technology consolidated the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, palladium catalyzed alkylation and in situ product recovery, allowing the catalytic reaction to proceed consistently and smoothly. The remarkable conversion properties are mainly attributed to the excellent compatible linkage of chemical catalysis with biosynthesis and process design to stabilize the Pd catalytic reaction. This validated strategy for the rational process design and integration of chemical- and bio-catalysis offers great demonstration in producing high-value transportation biofuels derived from agricultural residues. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Cassava-based ethanol has been promoted in China and Southeast Asia as an effective means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote energy security. However, existing life cycle assessments of the environmental impacts of cassava ethanol have used highly-aggregated empirical methods to estimate ecosystem C stock changes, which do not capture finer-scale characteristics of different cassava growing regions within a country. We investigated carbon debts, GHG emissions, and payback periods for cassava-based ethanol in Vietnam using a life cycle assessment approach coupled with the widely-used ecosystem biogeochemical CENTURY model. The model simulated regionally-specific carbon stock changes associated with cassava cultivation for biofuel feedstock under different land use change, cassava yield and fertilization scenarios. We found that switching land use to cassava production for biofuel substantially reduced soil organic carbon in all major cassava growing regions in Vietnam. GHG emissions, carbon debts, and payback periods of Vietnam's cassava ethanol were strongly dependent on cassava yield. The mean carbon debt due to direct land use change to cassava production for ethanol ranged from 66 to 97 Mg of CO2 per hectare, and the net carbon dioxide equivalent emission of cassava-based ethanol ranged from 36 to 95 g MJ−1, depending on the range of cassava fresh weight yield (from 18 to 60 Mg ha−1). To repay a carbon debt from direct land use change within 25 years, the average fresh weight yield of cassava used as feedstock for ethanol production must be above 33 Mg ha−1. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Including food production in non-food systems, such as rubber plantations and biofuel or bioenergy crops, may contribute to household food security. We evaluated the potential for planting rice, mungbean, rice cultivar mixtures, and rice intercropped with mungbean in young rubber plantations in experiments in the Arakan Valley of Mindanao in the Philippines. Rice mixtures consisted of two- or three-row strips of cultivar Dinorado, a cultivar with higher value but lower yield, and high-yielding cultivar UPL Ri-5. Rice and mungbean intercropping treatments consisted of different combinations of two- or three-row strips of rice and mungbean. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the yield of each crop alone and in the mixture or intercropping treatments. We also evaluated a land equivalent ratio for yield, along with weed biomass (where Ageratum conyzoides was particularly abundant), the severity of disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and rice bug (Leptocorisa acuta) abundance. We analyzed the yield ranking of each cropping system across site-year combinations to determine mean relative performance and yield stability. When weighted by their relative economic value, UPL Ri-5 had the highest mean performance, but with decreasing performance in low-yielding environments. A rice and mungbean intercropping system had the second highest performance, tied with high-value Dinorado but without decreasing relative performance in low-yielding environments. Rice and mungbean intercropped with rubber have been adopted by farmers in the Arakan Valley. © 2017 Hondrade et al.

AB  - The optimal use of biomass from a global warming mitigation perspective depends upon numerous factors, including competition for land and other constraints. The goal of this study is identifying optimal uses of domestic biomass resources for the case of Denmark, with the objectives of minimizing global warming contribution and fossil energy resource consumption. For this purpose, consequential life cycle assessment of the different options for biomass was performed. Optimal solutions were identified, given specific national environmental targets, using linear programming. Results highlighted that utilizing the energy potential of manure and straw represents the primary opportunity for further global warming mitigation. For this purpose, co-digestion (for manure) and combustion with heat-and-power production (for straw) appear as the most promising technologies. The utilization of biomass (or biogas) for electricity/heat is generally preferred, as long as coal/oil is still used within the energy system. Yet, to fulfill environmental targets for renewable energy in the transport sector, the diversion of a significant share of biogas (and/or other biofuels) from these more beneficial uses is necessary. To completely phase out coal/oil, additional biomass (to current domestic resources) must be included, either through domestic energy crops cultivation or biomass/biofuel import; alternatively, natural gas could be used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a recombinant S. cerevisiae, Pichia stipistis and an adapted P. stipistis were compared in fermenting steam exploded corn stover (SECS) enzymatic hydrolysate, which contained glucose and xylose, among which S. cerevisiae was found to be the most efficient. The residual xylose in the fermentation broth of S. cerevisiae was concentrated during the distillation of ethanol and fermented by xylose-fermenting yeasts, among which the adapted P. stipistis was found to be the best. As a result, a novel and efficient bioprocess from SECS to ethanol was established, producing approximately 27.00 g ethanol from 111.51 g SECS with an ethanol production rate of 2.50 g/L/h and a yield of 0.24 g ethanol/g SECS, and 58.18 g ethanol from 341.45 g SECS with an ethanol production rate of 2.31 g/L/h and a yield of 0.17 g ethanol/g SECS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas upgrading is essential for the comprehensive utilization of biogas as substitute of natural gas. However, the methane in the biogas can be fully recovered during the upgrading process of biogas, and the exhaust gas produced during biogas upgrading may contain a very low concentration of methane. If the exhaust gas with low concentration methane releases to atmosphere, it will be harmful to environment. In addition, the utilization of large amounts of digestate produced from biogas plant is another important issue for the development of biogas industry. In this study, solid digestate was used to produce active carbon, which was subsequently used as immobilized material for methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in biofilter. Biofilter with MOB immobilized on active carbon was used to eliminate the methane in exhaust gas from biogas upgrading process. Results showed porous active carbon was successfully made from solid digestate. The final methane elimination capacity of immobilized MOB reached about 13 mol h−1m−3, which was more 4 times higher than that of MOB without immobilization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explored the effects of different mass ratios of swine manure relative to wheat straw (3:7, 5:5, and 7:3, i.e., control reactors C1, C2, and C3, respectively) on variations in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and the microbial community during anaerobic digestion (AD). The cumulative biogas production volumes were 1711, 3857, and 3226 mL in C1, C2, and C3, respectively. After AD, the total relative abundance of ARGs decreased by 4.23 logs in C3, whereas the reductions were only 1.03 and 1.37 logs in C1 and C2, respectively. Network analysis showed that the genera Solibacillus, Enterococcus, Facklamia, Corynebacterium_1, and Acinetobacter were potential hosts of ermB, sul1, and dfrA7. Redundancy analysis showed that the bacterial communities and environmental factors played important roles in the variation in ARGs. Thus, reductions in ARGs should be considered before reusing animal manure treated by AD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Both in-situ and space-borne observations reveal an extremely high loading of particulates over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), all year around. With a burgeoning population and combustion sources (fossil fuels (FFs) and biofuels (BFs)) in close proximity to each other, the IGP is widely regarded as a hotspot for anthropogenic aerosol emission in South Asia. The deteriorating air quality over this region, particularly during winters, is a cause of major concern, since the pollutants undergo long range transport from their source regions to the Indo-Himalayan Range (IHR), Bay of Bengal (BoB) and other remote areas, polluting their pristine atmospheric conditions. Seasonal reversal in winds over the Indian mainland leads to an outflow of continental pollutants into the BoB during winters and a net advection of desert dust aerosols into the IGP from southwest Asia (SW-Asia), northwest India (NW-India) and northern Africa (N-Africa) during summers. Through the course of this study, four observational campaigns were conducted for sampling the ambient PM2.5and PM10during winter and summer seasons of 2014–2015, at multiple locations (18 sites) in the IGP, IHR, and semi-arid/arid sites towards their south and west, in order to accurately determine the inter-seasonal and inter-annual changes in the aerosol loading at the sites. We have also utilized data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite for estimating the columnar Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD550) and data from EOS Terra and Aqua satellites for discovering openly burning fires in the vicinity of sampling sites. Determination of the major source regions and key transport pathways during both seasons have also been attempted, using back-trajectory cluster analyses, as well as receptor models such as PSCF and CWT. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study is aiming at exploring the genuine role of CO2in pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass by investigating the susceptibility of pyrolysis of monosaccharide (e.g., xylose and glucose), disaccharide (e.g., sucrose), and polysaccharide (e.g., woody biomass) to CO2. To do this, the thermal degradation of these four biomass samples was characterized in N2and CO2. The thermal characterization results reveal that the physical aspects of biomass decomposition (i.e., thermal degradation rate and residual mass difference) associated with CO2were nearly the same; however, the chemical aspects were significantly different. In other words, CO2enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated from thermal degradation of biomass. In addition, our experiment results show that xylose (a major constituent of hemicellulose) and lignin exhibited a high sensitivity to CO2in pyrolysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In September 2015, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a new directive (2015/1513) that amended two existing directives in order to bolster the production of advanced fuels, biofuels, and “CO2-fuels” in the transport sector. The combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (obtained by means of electrolysis with surpluses of renewable electricity) produces synthetic and renewable fuels that can easily be stored and transported in existing infrastructures. It is also possible to use CO2-enriched microalgae as a feedstock for biofuel. To the extent these advanced fuels can be substituted for fossil energy, they could be helpful in the context of climate mitigation and energy transition, provided the regulatory framework is geared towards such an ambitious purpose. Our comments address the relevance of legislative activity around such a strategy, mainly what kind of legal provisions are already taking shape at the European Union level. We discuss the ability of European directives to manage CO2-fuels and biofuels made from microalgae with CO2 enrichment. This subject is new, and the literature on related legal provisions is rare, thus the need to establish a reader’s guide to the existing regulatory framework. © 2017, Kluwer Law International.

AB  - Biomass is the most widely used renewable energy source in the world today. It is used mostly in solid form and, to a lesser extent, in the form of liquid fuels and gas. The utilization of biomass for energy production has increased at only a modest rate in modern times. Biomass is the major source of energy in rural Turkey. Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs, including generating electricity, heating homes, fueling vehicles and providing process heat for industrial facilities. Biomass potential includes wood, animal and plant wastes. Among the biomass energy sources, fuel wood seems to be the most interesting because its share of the total energy production of Turkey is high at 14%. The total biomass energy potential of Turkey is about 33 million tons of oil equivalents (Mtoe). The amount of usable biomass potential of Turkey is approximately 17 Mtoe. The electrical production potential from usable bioenergy sources are 73 MW in 2010 and corporate income and represent more than 280,000 jobs. This study shows that there is important biomass energy potential for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on investigating the optimized chemical composition of biochar used as porous material for biodiesel synthesis via pseudo-catalytic transesterification. To this end, six biochars from different sources were prepared and biodiesel yield obtained from pseudo-catalytic transesterification of waste cooking oil using six biochars were measured. Biodiesel yield and optimal reaction temperature for pseudo-catalytic transesterification were strongly dependent on the raw material of biochar. For example, biochar generated from maize residue exhibited the best performance, which yield was reached ∼90% at 300 °C; however, the maximum biodiesel yield with pine cone biochar was 43% at 380 °C. The maximum achievable yield of biodiesel was sensitive to the lignin content of biomass source of biochar but not sensitive to the cellulose and hemicellulose content. This study provides an insight for screening the most effective biochar as pseudo-catalytic porous material, thereby helping develop more sustainable and economically viable biodiesel synthesis process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the eco-efficiency of 15 agricultural biogas plants located in Northern Italy. For this, the combination of life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodologies was considered with the purpose of identifying efficient operational plants and proposing improvement measures for the inefficient ones. The environmental profile of both the original and the virtual plants (obtained after the improvement measures) were compared in order to identify the net environmental gains linked with the inputs reduction. As a result of improvement measures, the production of electricity from biogas in all plants would imply environmental benefits compared with the average electricity production in the Italian grid. In light of the results obtained, special attention should be paid to the feedstock selection since it has a key role in the overall eco-efficiency of the plant, due to their different origin and composition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanol demand depends on the crude oil price and domestic biofuel mandate, but the aggregate effect on consumer fuel choices and export demand is uncertain. The relationship between crude oil and ethanol price is complex, and the presence of policy driven domestic biofuel use (mandate) make the modeling of the world ethanol market challenging. A structural economic multi-market multi-region partial equilibrium model considering the complementary and substituting effects between gasoline and ethanol demand is developed. In this study, a kinked ethanol demand curve that reflects those relationships is used to depict ethanol demand. We further simulate two forward-looking alternative crude oil price scenarios to identify how the crude oil price interacts with ethanol use mandates and trace the consequences on the U.S. Renewable Identification Number (RIN) market. The study finds that, under high crude oil prices, the substitution effect might trigger a large increase in ethanol demand by the rest of the world and the U.S. and Brazil will be the key ethanol exporting countries. In the U.S., the overall biofuel mandate might become non-binding. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fungi and fungal enzymes play important roles in the new bioeconomy. Enzymes from filamentous fungi can unlock the potential of recalcitrant lignocellulose structures of plant cell walls as a new resource, and fungi such as yeast can produce bioethanol from the sugars released after enzyme treatment. Such processes reflect inherent characteristics of the fungal way of life, namely, that fungi as heterotrophic organisms must break down complex carbon structures of organic materials to satisfy their need for carbon and nitrogen for growth and reproduction. This chapter describes major steps in the conversion of plant biomass to value-added products. These products provide a basis for substituting fossil-derived fuels, chemicals, and materials, as well as unlocking the biomass potential of the agricultural harvest to yield more food and feed. This article focuses on the mycological basis for the fungal contribution to biorefinery processes, which are instrumental for improved resource efficiency and central to the new bioeconomy. Which types of processes, inherent to fungal physiology and activities in nature, are exploited in the new industrial processes? Which families of the fungal kingdom and which types of fungal habitats and ecological specializations are hot spots for fungal biomass conversion? How can the best fungal enzymes be found and optimized for industrial use? How can they be produced most efficiently-in fungal expression hosts? How have industrial biotechnology and biomass conversion research contributed to mycology and environmental research? Future perspectives and approaches are listed, highlighting the importance of fungi in development of the bioeconomy. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Availability of abiotic resources has been a topic of concern in recent years, resulting in several approaches being published to determine their availability on country and product level. However, the availability of biotic materials has not been analyzed to this extent yet. Therefore, an approach to determine possible limitations to availability of terrestrial biotic materials over the entire supply chain is introduced. The approach considers 24 categories overall as well as associated category indicators for the five dimensions: physical, socio-economic, abiotic, social and environmental constraints. This ensures a comprehensive availability assessment of bio-based product systems. The approach is applied to a case study comparing biodiesel produced from rapeseed and soy beans. The study shows that the determination of indicator values is feasible for most categories and their interpretation leads to meaningful conclusions. Thus, the approach leads to a more comprehensive assessment of availability aspects and supports better informed decision making in industry and policy. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Taking forest biomass, defined here as roundwood pulpwood, as feedstock, this study focused on locating bioethanol facilities and designing the bioethanol feedstock supply chain to minimize the total system cost. For this purpose an integrated approach combining Geographic Information System based analysis with optimization modeling method was developed. Nine candidate bioethanol facilities were preselected based on the GIS method and served as input for the optimization modeling followed. The total system cost and the delivered feedstock cost were calculated under demand and supply uncertainties. Both cost values increase significantly as the annual bioethanol demand grows or the biomass availability decreases. This is because more feedstocks are required to be hauled from longer distances to support a larger scale bioethanol facility or several smaller ones. It is also found that Gaylord shows up as one of the optimized candidate no matter what the demand or supply is. The optimization model and identified locations provides decision makers an integrated decision support system to determine optimized cost, energy use, and GHG emissions for candidate locations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed with potential for use as a raw material in second-generation biofuels. Camelina has a seed yield of up to 2380 kg·ha-1 and contains around 45% fatty acids. Selection of a suitable site is critical for production optimization. The objective of this study was to determine Chilean agro-climatic suitability for establishing camelina as a productive alternative. Climate and soil requirements and geographical restraints were evaluated for the species, considering the climatological characteristics of its regions of origin, as well as regions where camelina is successfully grown in the rest of the world. The variables considered included factors (maximum temperatures of the warmest month, water deficits, and degree days) and limitations (altitude, geomorphology, and current land use), which permitted the evaluation of the national territory for a certain level of suitability. It was determined that 1.3% of the national territory (960,664 ha) has some degree of suitability for camelina adoption. Between the Biobío and Los Lagos regions, 49.0% of the land (471,203 ha) is in the category of no thermic restrictions, with mild water restrictions, and mild soil restrictions or without information, which can be used for camelina production. The Los Ríos region has 21.4% surface area (321,176 ha) with some level of suitability for camelina, the most suitable region to establish this crop in Chile. This research has provided valuable information applicable to new species and geographic areas which facilitate the adaptation of agricultural and forestry production to global changes. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a spatially explicit method for making regional estimates of the potential for biogas production from crop residues and manure, accounting for key technical, biochemical, environmental and economic constraints. Methods for making such estimates are important as biofuels from agricultural residues are receiving increasing policy support from the EU and major biogas producers, such as Germany and Italy, in response to concerns over unintended negative environmental and social impacts of conventional biofuels. This analysis comprises a spatially explicit estimate of crop residue and manure production for the EU at 250 m resolution, and a biogas production model accounting for local constraints such as the sustainable removal of residues, transportation of substrates, and the substrates' biochemical suitability for anaerobic digestion. In our base scenario, the EU biogas production potential from crop residues and manure is about 0.7 EJ/year, nearly double the current EU production of biogas from agricultural substrates, most of which does not come from residues or manure. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the potential could easily be 50% higher or lower, depending on the stringency of economic, technical and biochemical constraints. We find that the potential is particularly sensitive to constraints on the substrate mixtures' carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and dry matter concentration. Hence, the potential to produce biogas from crop residues and manure in the EU depends to large extent on the possibility to overcome the challenges associated with these substrates, either by complementing them with suitable co-substrates (e.g. household waste and energy crops), or through further development of biogas technology (e.g. pretreatment of substrates and recirculation of effluent). © 2017 Einarsson, Persson.

AB  - As highly productive perennial grasses are evaluated as bioenergy feedstocks, a major consideration is biomass yield stability. Two experiments were conducted to examine some aspects of yield stability for two biofuel species: switchgrass (Panicum vigratum L.) and Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg). Biomass yields of these species were evaluated under various environmental conditions across the Southern Great Plains (SGP), including some sites with low soil fertility. In the first experiment, measured yields of four switchgrass ecotypes and Mxg varied among locations. Overall, plants showed optimal growth performance in study sites close to their geographical origins. Lowland switchgrass ecotypes and Mxg yields simulated by the ALMANAC model showed reasonable agreement with the measured yields across all study locations, while the simulated yields of upland switchgrass ecotypes were overestimated in northern locations. In the second experiment, examination of different N fertilizer rates revealed switchgrass yield increases over the range of 0, 80, or 160 kg N ha-1 year-1, while Mxg only showed yield increases between the low and medium N rates. This provides useful insights to crop management of two biofuel species and to enhance the predictive accuracy of process-based models, which are critical for developing bioenergy market systems in the SGP. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel expansion can lead to unintended effects that offset the direct GHG benefits of biofuels. Two documented unintended effects are the indirect land use change (ILUC) and indirect energy use change (IEUC). ILUC has been included in many lifecycle GHG studies of biofuels, but IEUC has remained relatively elusive. This paper presents an updated assessment of the lifecycle GHG emissions of palm biodiesel from Malaysia and, for the first time, incorporating the two estimated indirect effects simultaneously. Future GHG emissions of palm biodiesel are projected by taking into account of Malaysia's Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) that aims to reform the oil palm industry in order to achieve a high-income nation. Uncertainties associated with lifecycle GHG models were dealt with using Monte Carlo simulation in order to identify the breadth and likelihood of GHG reductions relative to petroleum-based fuels in the context of the European directives. This study has shown that the ETP, if successfully implemented, can significantly improve the direct GHG emissions of palm biodiesel, but the benefits are offset by the rise in global emissions due to ILUC and IEUC. Biofuel policies should also include IEUC, in addition to ILUC, to avoid GHG emissions leakages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Unreasonable use of chemical fertilizer (CF) on agricultural soil leads to massive losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in tropical and subtropical areas, where soil conditions are unfavorable for aggregate formation. This study evaluated the effects of combined application of biogas slurry (BS) plus CF on soil aggregation and aggregate - associated C/N concentration and storage in an Ultisol. Six treatments included: no fertilizer (T1), CF only (T2), partial (15% (T3), 30% (T4) and 45% (T5)) substitution of TN with BS and BS only (T6). Soil mechanical - stable aggregates (MSAs) formation and stability as well as MSAs - associated C/N concentration and storage were observed in different aggregate sizes (>5, 5-2, 2-1, 1.0-0.5, 0.50-0.25 and <0.25 mm). The proportion of MSAs >5 mm significantly increased with BS substitution (T5), while the proportions of MSAs 1.0-0.5 mm, MSAs 0.50-0.25 mm and MSAs <0.25 mm significantly decreased. Both mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter were highest in T5, which improved soil aggregation stability as well as resulted in significantly higher SOC and TN concentrations and storage in MSAs >0.5 mm that constituted 72-82% of MSAs. Stepwise regression analysis showed that MSAs >5 mm, SOC in MSAs >5 mm and TN in MSAs >5 mm were the dominant variables affecting aggregate stability. Meanwhile SOC in MSAs <0.25 mm and TN in MSAs 2-1 mm were independent variables affecting SOC and TN concentrations in bulk soils. Therefore, certain rate of combined application of BS plus CF is an effective, eco - friendly way to improve soil quality in an Ultisol. © 2017 Zheng et al.

AB  - Because of rising fuel prices and increasing energy demand, bioethanol has been recognized as an important future renewable energy source. The goals and mandates developed for renewable fuel production will require construction of several bioethanol plants throughout the U.S. Using high-resolution geospatial data from Geographic Information Systems-Multi Criteria Evaluation (GIS-MCE) a biorefinery suitability model has been developed for identifying feasible sites and appropriate biofuel production capacity in the U.S. The biomass feedstocks considered for analysis were switchgrass, miscanthus and corn stover. We conducted a spatial exclusion and preference GIS analysis subjected to environmental and infrastructure criteria combined with biomass yield estimates and identified 164 basic sites and 17 co-location scenarios. Biorefineries using miscanthus feedstock could produce biofuel satisfying a significant portion of the U.S. mandate. This national-scale assessment enhances strategic decision-making capabilities and understanding of spatial distribution of biorefineries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We have analysed the potential for biofuels from microalgae in the Italian biofuels context. This scenario analysis considers alternative pathways for the adoption of biofuels from microalgae by the year 2030. The scenarios were developed using a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian networks, through a structured process for elicitation of expert knowledge. We have identified the most and least favourable scenarios in terms of the expected likelihood for the development of the market of biofuels from microalgae, through which we have focussed on the contribution of economic and policy aspects in the development of the sector. A detailed analysis of the contribution of each variable in the context of the scenarios is also provided. These data represent a starting point for the evaluation of different policy options for the future biofuel market in Italy. The best scenario shows a 75% probability that biofuels from microalgae will exceed 20% of the biofuel market by 2030. This is conditional on the improvement and development of the technological changes and environmental policies, and of the markets for bioenergy and novel foods derived from microalgae. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study addresses the problem of causal price relationships of biofuels for an enhanced group of agricultural commodities to capture possible asymmetric causal effects. It investigates the long-run equilibrium and assumes that an adjustment process toward this equilibrium exists. The adjustment process can be non-linear, implying that we can identify critical thresholds that determine regions in the sample that once exceeded, price inter linkages may vary. The empirical results indicate that there are commodity prices that have strong causal (asymmetric) relationship with biofuel energy prices. © 2017, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel production using residual oil from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and crude lipase from oil palm fruit as the substrate and catalyst had a high biodiesel yield (92.07 ± 1.04%) under optimal conditions. POME is considered as an alternative source for oil because it contained high oil and grease content (5569.82 mg/L). Oil was extracted from POME by the soxhlet method using a mixture of hexane, methanol and acetone. Eighty percent of residual oil (4455 mg/L) was recovered from POME. Biodiesel production from crude lipase catalyst is an alternative method that is simple to perform and can be done at a low investment cost. In addition, biodiesel from residual oil using crude lipase catalyst was characterized according to ASTM standards. Most properties of biodiesel from crude lipase are acceptable, according to Thai biodiesel and ASTM standards. Low free fatty acid (0.07%) content was observed in enzymatic biodiesel. A high cloud point (10–13 °C) and cetane number (59.0–60.0) were also illustrated since a high cetane number is an important property used to qualify high quality biodiesel, POME biodiesel may possibly be used as a sole biofuel or blended with fossil fuels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assessed the economic viability of using Miscanthus x giganteus as a feedstock for the production of bioethanol based on plant designs and models by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In 2007 dollars, the total cost of installed equipment for a plant with an annual feedstock requirement of 701 million kg/year was $281 million, with the single largest component, cost of feedstock, contributing approximately 40% to the total. The total capital investment needed for the plant was $464 million, or $2.01 per annual liters of ethanol. The variable operating cost of the plant varied between $79 and $93 million per year, depending on the cost of feedstock. The minimum ethanol-selling price (MESP) was calculated from discount cash flow rate analysis. Changing the feedstock cost from $0.08/kg to $0.10/kg increased the MESP from $0.65/L to $0.71/L. The analysis estimated the sensitivity of the MESP to variations in the percentage of equity financing (from 0 to 100%), internal rate of return (from 10% to 20%) and federal corporate taxes (from 30% to 60%). The results of the study allow a direct comparison of the MESP for Miscanthus as opposed to corn-stover, grass straw and hybrid poplar, and provide a benchmark for future studies of economic feasibility of alternative lignocellulosic feedstocks against each other as well as against conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. © 2017

AB  - Straws of cereal grains represent the major fraction of lignocellulosic agricultural wastes generated worldwide. Cereal straws (CSs) hold great potential for implementation as candidate feedstocks for fermentative production of second generation (2G) biofuels. Among the different varieties of CSs, rice and wheat straw are clearly the best available options for development of a reliable feedstock base from all aspects. Feasible alternatives of costly, energy intensive and non-ecofriendly physical and chemical pretreatments are needed to facilitate full scale utilization of the CSs in the 2G biofuel platforms. Biochemical pretreatments of CSs using potential lignocellulolytic microorganisms can become the alternative technology upon proper exploration and exploitation. In the present review article, efficiency of the microorganism mediated biochemical processes has been assessed as promising pretreatment methods for CSs. Ligninolytic action of different fungi, bacteria and microbial consortia on different CSs (mostly wheat and rice straw) has been evaluated on the basis of extent of lignin degradation, selectivity of degradation and sugar recovery from pretreated CSs. Utilization of microbial consortia has been recommended as better pretreatment agents in comparison to their mono-culture counterparts. The review also attempts to predict the economic viability of biochemical pretreatments on the basis of associated cost factor correlation with the physical and chemical processes. Construction of synergistically operating lignocellulolytic microbial consortia for application in biochemical pretreatments of CSs has been demonstrated in the article and advocated as a promising process amelioration strategy. Overall, the review affirms the biochemical processes as the most suitable pretreatment technique from techno-economic and environmental aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores how sugarcane yield, gasoline prices and sales tax rates affect the production and consumption of ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil. The system dynamics model of the sugarcane and ethanol production chain explores the impact of these variables to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol production. Using the VENSIM software different arrangements for sugarcane yield, gasoline prices and sales tax were simulated (horizon of 20 years). Brazil's Federal Government policy of gasoline price below the international price and the diversity of state sales tax rates produce distortions in the ethanol market and impose considerable constraints on the development of the ethanol industry. The simulations show that to ensure the feasibility of ethanol production, the pump price of regular gasoline would need to be US$1.95 per liter, which is far higher than the US$1.26 per liter currently charged. Public policies involving the liberalization of gasoline prices and the homogenization of the sales taxes on ethanol among the Brazilian states could reduce the distortions caused by these policies. These policies could contribute to reduce uncertainty in the ethanol sector and encourage technological and productive investments. Future research could add and evaluate the impacts of the environmental benefits of ethanol production and consumption (Carbon Trade Market, Payment for Environmental Services and Bioelectricity production) and of sugarcane byproducts on its feasibility. The sensitivity analysis revealed the effectiveness of the model to support policies and managerial decisionmaking process in the sugarcane ethanol sector. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In light of possible future restrictions on the use of fossil fuel, due to climate change obligations and continuous depletion of global fossil fuel reserves, the search for alternative renewable energy sources is expected to be an issue of great concern for policy stakeholders. This study assessed the feasibility of bioenergy production under relatively low-intensity conservative, eco-agricultural settings (as opposed to those produced under high-intensity, fossil fuel based industrialized agriculture). Estimates of the net energy gain (NEG) and the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) obtained from a life cycle inventory of the energy inputs and outputs involved reveal that the energy efficiency of bioenergy produced in low-intensity eco-agricultural systems could be as much as much as 448.5-488.3 GJ·ha-1 of NEG and an EROEI of 5.4-5.9 for maize ethanol production systems, and as much as 155.0-283.9 GJ·ha-1 of NEG and an EROEI of 14.7-22.4 for maize biogas production systems. This is substantially higher than for industrialized agriculture with a NEG of 2.8-52.5 GJ·ha-1 and an EROEI of 1.2-1.7 for maize ethanol production systems, as well as a NEG of 59.3-188.7 GJ·ha-1 and an EROEI of 2.2-10.2 for maize biogas production systems. Bioenergy produced in low-intensity eco-agricultural systems could therefore be an important source of energy with immense net benefits for local and regional end-users, provided a more efficient use of the co-products is ensured.

AB  - Biofuel from fatty acids with chain lengths of 8–15 (C8–C15) have properties similar to those of conventional diesel and jet fuels, thus, can save time and reduce costs for the refurbishment of engines and maintenance of oiling facilities. Most oil-producing algae yield C16–C18 fatty acids; however, the manipulation of algae using genetic engineering is a promising approach to obtain C8–C15 fatty acids. The introduction of a medium-chain-specific thioesterase (TE) is expected to effectively alter algae to produce medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). TE is the main determinant of fatty acid chain length as it releases fatty acids from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) in the fatty acid elongation cycle. In a previous study, the introduction of heterologous C8–C12-specific TEs into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii did not increase the yield of MCFAs. This effect was attributed to a low affinity of the heterologous TEs to C. reinhardtii ACP. Therefore, we introduced both the C10–C14-specific TE gene and the ACP gene from the land plant Cuphea lanceolata into C. reinhardtii. We measured free fatty acids (FFAs) and triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the transformants using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The production of C12:0 and C14:0, chain length 12 and 14 without unsaturation, FFAs was not significantly increased in any of the tested strains. However, we found a slight but significant increase in TAG-containing MCFAs in both TE only and TE–ACP transformants. The increased production rate of C14:0-containing TAGs ranged from 1.25- to 1.58-fold, indicating the ability of medium-chain-specific TE to increase MCFAs. These results suggest that the selection of specific TEs is important when modifying eukaryotic algae to produce MCFAs. © 2017 Japanese Society of Phycology

AB  - The soil-plant transfer of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in different crops was determined with respect to the present-day amendment practice of using digestate from biogas fermenters. The studies were performed using large lysimeters filled with undisturbed luvisol monoliths. In contrast to the conservative tracer, Br−, neither of the studied radionuclides showed a significant vertical translocation nor effect of the applied digestate amendment compared to a non-amended control was found. Furthermore, no significant plant uptake was measured for both nuclides in wheat or oat as indicated by the low transfer factors between soil-shoot for Cs-137 (TF 0.001–0.010) and for Sr-90 (0.10–0.51). The transfer into nutritionally relevant plant parts was even lower with transfer factors for soil-grain for Cs-137 (TF 0.000–0.001) and for Sr-90 (0.01–0.06). Hence, the amendment with biogas digestate is unfortunately not an option to further reduce plant uptake of these radionuclides in agricultural crops, but it does not increase plant uptake either. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Power to gas (P2G) may be used to store curtailed electricity whilst converting the energy vector to gas. To be economically viable these systems require cheap electricity and a cheap concentrated source of CO2. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion typically comprises of 60% methane and 40% CO2. The P2G system substitutes for the conventional upgrading system by using hydrogen (derived from surplus wind electricity) to react with CO2and increases the methane output. The potential CO2production from biogas in Ireland associated with typical wet substrates is assessed as more than 4 times greater than that required by the potential level of H2from curtailed electricity. Wind energy curtailment in 2020 in Ireland is assessed conservatively at 2175GWeh/a. Thus P2G is limited by levels of curtailment of electricity rather than biogas systems. It is shown that 1 GWeh of electricity used to produce H2for upgrading biogas in a P2G system can affect a savings of 97 tonnes CO2. The cost of hydrogen is assessed at €0.96/m3renewable methane when the price of electricity is €c5/kWeh. This leads to a cost of compressed renewable gas from grass of €1.8/m3. This drops to €1.1/m3when electricity is purchased at €c0.2/kWeh. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Class III peroxidases (CIIIPRX) catalyze the oxidation of monolignols, generate radicals, and ultimately lead to the formation of lignin. In general, CIIIPRX genes encode a large number of isozymes with ranges of in vitro substrate specificities. In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a strategic plant for second-generation biofuels. The crystal structure, kinetic experiments, molecular docking, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the observed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of kinetics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed. In addition, proline-138 and gluntamine-140 at the137P-X-P-X140 motif, leucine-66, proline-67, and asparagine-176 may account for the broad substrate specificity of PviPRX9. Taken together, these observations shed new light on the function and catalysis of PviPRX9 and potentially benefit efforts to improve biomass conservation properties in bioenergy and forage crops. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Dumping of municipal solid waste into uncontrolled dumpsites is the most common method of waste disposal in most cities of India. These dumpsites are posing a serious challenge to environmental quality and sustainable development. Mumbai, which generates over 9000 t of municipal solid waste daily, also disposes of most of its waste in open dumps. It is important to analyse the impact of municipal solid waste disposal today and what would be the impact under integrated waste management schemes. In this study, life cycle assessment methodology was used to determine the impact of municipal solid waste management under different scenarios. Six different scenarios were developed as alternatives to the current practice of open dumping and partially bioreactor landfilling. The scenarios include landfill with biogas collection, incineration and different combinations of recycling, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. Global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity were assessed as environmental impact categories. The sensitivity analysis shows that if the recycling rate is increased from 10% to 90%, the environmental impacts as compared with present scenario would reduce from 998.43 kg CO2 eq t-1 of municipal solid waste, 0.124 kg SO2 eq t-1, 0.46 kg PO4-3 eq t-1, 0.44 kg 1,4-DB eq t-1 to 892.34 kg CO2 eq t-1, 0.121 kg SO2 eq t-1, 0.36 kg PO4-3 eq t-1, 0.40 kg 1,4-DB eq t-1, respectively. An integrated municipal solid waste management approach with a mix of recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion and landfill had the lowest overall environmental impact. The technologies, such as incineration, would reduce the global warming emission because of the highest avoided emissions, however, human toxicity would increase. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal trends obtained from decade long (Jan 2003–Dec 2014) satellite observational data of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) on carbon monoxide (CO) concentration over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region. The time sequence plots of columnar CO levels over the western, central and eastern IGP regions reveal marked seasonal behaviour, with lowest CO levels occurring during the monsoon months and the highest CO levels occurring during the pre-monsoon period. A negative correlation between CO levels and rainfall is observed. CO vertical profiles show relatively high values in the upper troposphere at ∼200 hPa level during the monsoon months, thus suggesting the role of convective transport and advection in addition to washout behind the decreased CO levels during this period. MOPITT and AIRS observations show a decreasing trend of 9.6 × 1015and 1.5 × 1016molecules cm−2yr−1, respectively, in columnar CO levels over the IGP region. The results show the existence of a spatial gradient in CO from the eastern (higher levels) to western IGP region (lower levels). Data from the Census of India on the number of households using various cooking fuels in the IGP region shows the prevalence of biomass-fuel (i.e. firewood, crop residue, cowdung etc.) use over the eastern and central IGP regions and that of liquefied petroleum gas over the western IGP region. CO emission estimates from cooking activity over the three IGP regions are found to be in the order east &gt; central &gt; west, which support the existence of the spatial gradient in CO from eastern to the western IGP region. Our results support the intervention of present Indian government on limiting the use of biomass-fuels in domestic cooking to achieve the benefits in terms of the better air quality, household health and regional/global climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Replacing fossil fuel with biofuel is environmentally viable from a climate change perspective only if the net greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of the system is reduced. The effects of replacing annual arable crops with perennial bioenergy feedstocks on net GHG production and soil carbon (C) stock are critical to the system-level balance. Here, we compared GHG flux, crop yield, root biomass, and soil C stock under two potential tropical, perennial grass biofuel feedstocks: conventional sugarcane and ratoon-harvested, zero-tillage napiergrass. Evaluations were conducted at two irrigation levels, 100% of plantation application and at a 50% deficit. Peaks and troughs of GHG emission followed agronomic events such as ratoon harvest of napiergrass and fertilization. Yet, net GHG flux was dominated by carbon dioxide (CO2), as methane was oxidized and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was very low even following fertilization. High N2O fluxes that frequently negate other greenhouse gas benefits that come from replacing fossil fuels with agronomic forms of bioenergy were mitigated by efficient water and fertilizer management, including direct injection of fertilizer into buried irrigation lines. From soil intensively cultivated for a century in sugarcane, soil C stock and root biomass increased rapidly following cultivation in grasses selected for robust root systems and drought tolerance. The net soil C increase over the two-year crop cycle was three-fold greater than the annualized soil surface CO2 flux. Deficit irrigation reduced yield, but increased soil C accumulation as proportionately more photosynthetic resources were allocated belowground. In the first two years of cultivation napiergrass did not increase net greenhouse warming potential (GWP) compared to sugarcane, and has the advantage of multiple ratoon harvests per year and less negative effects of deficit irrigation to yield.

AB  - Dedicated annual sorghum crops, such as sweet sorghum or energy sorghum, may provide an option for farmers to supply cellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production and help the industry meet government mandates. Kansas farmers are poised to be major producers of sweet sorghum for biofuels due to favorable agro-ecological conditions. The purpose of this paper is to assess Kansas farmers' willingness to grow sweet sorghum under contract as a feedstock for biofuel production. The paper examines farmers' willingness-to-pay for contract attributes and the impact of socio-economic factors on their willingness-to-pay for these attributes. A stated choice survey was administered to Kansas farmers to assess their willingness to grow sweet sorghum for biofuels under various contracting scenarios. Results show that farmers may be willing to grow biomass for bioenergy under contract, but may have varying preferences for the importance of contract attributes such as net returns, contract length, insurance availability, government incentives, and potential for biorefinery harvest options based on socio-economic characteristics of growers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nearly seven decades after ‘decolonization’, policymaking in India continues to be haunted by colonial categories. Focusing on the category ‘wastelands’, which has been central to recent debates on India's biofuel policies, we study how it was heterogeneously constituted during the Permanent Settlement of land revenue in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century colonial India. In particular, we trace how this category took on multiple meanings through its encounters with different human and nonhuman entities in disparate spatio-temporal settings. The entities encountered included not only ideas and moralities derived from theoretical notions such as Locke's ‘natural rights’, but also the soil and water on diverse lands, and the beings living or made to live on these lands. The multiple meanings of the category led to debates and controversies between colonial administrators regarding the ways in which the Permanent Settlement should be introduced and extended. By mapping these debates and controversies, we attempt to accomplish two things. First, we construct a narrative in which dominant colonial categories and associated rules do not possess unidirectional power to reformat colonized realities and practices. Second, we attempt to account for and recognize realities and practices that were marginalized or disregarded in the formulation of colonial administrative rules. Narratives such as ours, we hope, can help proliferate possibilities for enacting new decolonial and decolonizing practices of making, using and transforming meanings. © 2016

AB  - Vegetable oils became a very popular bioliquid for renewable power and transport applications. At local level, the short chain production of vegetable oils is currently important in terms of sustainability and use of rural area. This present work investigates the development of vegetable oils production chain in the Tuscany territory, focusing also to valorisation of the co-products (i.e., oil cake). The work is based on the study of the cultivation of rapeseed and sunflower, and the creation of an extraction plant based on cold-screw pressing technology, in order to obtain a raw vegetable oil suitable as biofuel. The German DIN 51623 standard was adopted to investigate the quality of vegetable oils obtained from different oil crops. Vegetable oils quality was evaluated by comparing the oil produced by a bench press at lab scale, comparing the results in terms of process yields and lipid fraction recovered. Due to the high phosphorous content of rapeseed oil, out of the DIN limits, an experimental procedure to remove P content and restore the oxidation stability of the oils was performed. The results showed a substantial P reduction by adding 2 wt% of P-removing additive. The oil cake properties were evaluated in view of its potential use for bioenergy production, in particular in terms of metals content. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Right after the enforcement of the Directive (EU) 2015/1513, amending the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union, the situation of the biodiesel sector in Spain is particularly uncertain. Although domestic biodiesel production has significantly increased since 2013, many plants are still idle, leading to an excess of capacity. This paper aims to provide an operational framework that combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with economic optimization to determine the feedstock combination for domestic biodiesel production in Spain in compliance with this Directive, and quantify the associated impacts. A multi-sector, mathematical programming model is proposed in a Partial Equilibrium setting, implementing an LCA module. The optimal oil mix for the sector is highly dependent on assumptions regarding land use change in crude vegetable oil exporting countries. Increasing greenhouse gas savings thresholds enhance the use of waste oils and domestic oilseeds, while preventing deforestation of carbon-rich ecosystems; the only exception is the Brazilian Cerrado savanna. A double-counting scheme for waste oil biodiesel is necessary to make plants with second-generation technology work at full capacity, delivering further environmental benefits. Although there is room for further improvement, the model can provide very good insights for biodiesel policy analysis in the context of Spain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study is to find potential utilization practice of rice straw in India from an environmental perspective. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted for four most realistic utilization practices of straw including: (1) incorporation into the field as fertilizer (2) animal fodder (3) electricity (4) biogas. The results show that processing of 1 ton straw to electricity and biogas resulted in net reduction of 1471 and 1023 kg CO2eq., 15.0 and 3.4 kg SO2eq. and 6.7 and 7.1 kg C2H6eq. emissions in global warming, acidification and photochemical oxidation creation potential respectively. Electricity production from straw replaces the coal based electricity and resulted in benefits in most of the environmental impacts whereas use as an animal fodder resulted in eutrophication benefits. The burning of straw is a harmful practice of managing straw in India which can be avoided by utilizing straw for bioenergy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cultivation of microalgae as a feedstock for renewable fuels is widely touted as a way to sequester CO2while negating food versus fuel competition for land. However, the widespread industrial use of microalgae for biofuels has yet to reach a critical stage based on lipid extraction alone. One alternative to the transesterification of microalgae for liquid fuel production is to use thermochemical conversion techniques. In the present work, we demonstrate that Dunaliella tertiolecta can be converted to biofuels via pyrolysis at temperatures significantly lower than terrestrial biomasses. The primary gaseous pyrolysis products were CO2, H2O, CH4, alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids and phenols. The iso-conversional distributed activation energy model was used to calculate the kinetic parameters, showing average activation energy of 243.3 kJ/mol, with a peak in activation energy at mass fraction conversions between 0.45 and 0.65. However, the substantial amount of pyrolysis gases evolved at low temperatures (between 280 and 320 °C), suggests that pyrolysis at higher temperatures, and especially to completion, might not be necessary to optimize pyrolytic production of biofuels from microalgae. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the thermal degradation of grass (Cymbopogon schoenanthus) under an inert environment at three heating rates, including 10, 30, and 50 °C min−1in order to evaluate its bioenergy potential. Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a simultaneous Thermogravimetry–Differential Scanning Calorimetry analyzer. Thermal data were used to analyze kinetic parameters through isoconversional models of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissenger-Akahira-Sunose (KSA) methods. The pre-exponential factors values have shown the reaction to follow first order kinetics. Activation energy values were shown to be 84–193 and 96–192 kJ mol−1as calculated by KSA and FWO methods, respectively. Differences between activation energy and enthalpy of reaction values (∼5 to 6 kJ mol−1) showed product formation is favorable. The Gibb's free energy (173–177 kJ mol−1) and High Heating Value (15.00 MJ kg−1) have shown the considerable bioenergy potential of this low-cost biomass. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the potential of bioethanol production and fossil fuel substitution using sugarcane feedstock in Indonesia. Current production practices, government biofuel policies (esp. mandatory blending targets), and sugar self-sufficiency are simulated to project the total potential of fuel ethanol and land requirements in the timeframe between 2015 and 2025. At present conditions, 450 million liters bioethanol can be annually produced in Indonesia using sugarcane molasses, a low-value co-product. This gives only a marginal contribution equivalent to 1% of the total gasoline consumption in 2015. The study examines the ethanol production potential after domestic sugar self-sufficiency is achieved by 2020. In 2015, 0.71 Mha land were required for sugarcane cultivation in order to meet a 2% blend mandate i.e. 0.68 billion liters (BL) ethanol using only cane-molasses. Juice ethanol is needed to meet the blending targets set for 2020 (i.e., 4.45 BL ethanol) and 2025 (i.e., 11.48 BL ethanol). This translates into sugarcane feedstock obtained from 1.60 Mha to 2.76 Mha land, respectively. The study also evaluates how improved resource efficiency can be achieved, exploring the bioelectricity production potential from sugarcane biomass, improvements in yields, and modernization of sugarcane mills. The results highlight how the use of established technologies and production methods can help develop agro-industries in the sugar ethanol segment of Indonesia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A key factor in the production of economically viable and environmentally sustainable biofuels is biorefinery site selection. Facility location analysis has traditionally been driven by access to feedstock, proximity to customers, and local incentives. While economic constraints will always be major factors in site selection, incorporating social metrics may further reduce the cost of constructing a biorefinery. A community's disposition toward a biorefinery project may significantly impact implementation success: grassroots support can lower implementation costs while opposition may increase the costs of permitting blockages and other scale-up delays. The proposed biorefinery siting tool improves upon previous research by incorporating site-specific biogeophysical measures and more complete and comprehensive social measures of community innovation and capacity for collective action. A refined biogeophysical analysis assesses pulp mills for their potential as repurposed biorefineries. The social asset components of site selection are greatly improved by enhancing and disaggregating key metrics through the use of multiple indicators of community collective action capacity and propensity for change. The refined measures are integrated into a biorefinery site-selection tool. Pulp mills that rank highly in both the biogeophysical and social asset measures may be considered more suitable candidates for repurpose into a biorefinery. This enriched methodology has been applied to biorefinery siting decisions in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region; however, it is suitable for applications to infrastructure development projects in any region of the U.S. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vinasse is a residue from bioethanol production that is produced in large quantities in Brazil and Europe and is applied to fields as a source of plant nutrients (fertirrigation). A side effect of this use is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during storage and transport in open channels to fields, and from fertirrigated soils. This study assessed GHG emissions in experiments simulating this vinasse management system, and the potential for reducing emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from vinasse via anaerobic digestion (AD) in biogas plants. During 21 days’ storage of untreated vinasse, 29% of dry matter (DM) and 40% of volatile solids (VS) were lost, which resulted in cumulative CH4emissions of up to 43.8 kg CO2eqkg−1C-vinasse. In contrast, there were no CH4emissions from AD-treated vinasse (digestate) during storage. GHG emission was related to the biochemical characteristics of the untreated and digested vinasse. The accumulation of oxidised nitrogen (N) compounds was up to four-fold higher in soil amended with untreated vinasse than from digestate-amended soil. The N2O emissions from soil amended with untreated vinasse were also higher than from soil amended with digestate, ranging from 0.173 to 0.193 kg CO2eqm−2in the former and from 0.045 to 0.100 kg CO2eqm−2in the latter. Extrapolation of the results to a Brazilian case indicated that AD treatment prior to storage/transport and field application could reduce GHG emissions from the vinasse management chain by at least 48%, with further reductions from the use of biogas in power production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper we analyze the economic impact of a decision to produce ethanol in Mexico, comparing the effect of a subsidy to initiate ethanol production with that of alternative public policies. Public support of biofuels has been a public policy goal since 2008, and the promotion of ethanol remains an active part of the government agenda. The evidence used to encourage or alter the policy is (by necessity) chiefly based on international experience. In this study we use a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) to estimate the impact of ethanol production on the Mexican economy. Using cost data from Brazil we introduce ethanol into a Mexican social accounting matrix, and insert a latent sector into the model to analyze ethanol promotion. Our results show that subsidies to ethanol would increase agriculture production but at the expense of aggregate welfare. By contrast, alternative “clean energy” policies appear to advance economic growth to a greater extent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In light of climate change and the increasingly limited availability of energy resources, any form of renewable raw materials that can be used for energy production should be accounted for. One of the most promising renewable sources is considered to be that of lignocellulosic feedstock. In urban forestry and greening, millions of tons of lignocellulosic waste is produced every year but that biomass mostly goes unused. The aim of this research project was to investigate the utilisation potential of this very form of waste biomass using a medium-sized town as a sample for the work (Tartu in Estonia, with a population circa 100,000). Woody and non-woody vegetation representing greening waste from different seasons was investigated: spring and autumn leaves, and mixed waste from urban greening which contained grass, twigs, and leaves. BMP assays were conducted to estimate the biogas production potential and the three step bio-ethanol production process was used to estimate the bio-ethanol production potential. In the bio-ethanol production process, an N2 explosion pre-treatment was used, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Map analysis was used to assess the area that was manageable by urban forestry and greening in the city of Tartu in order to estimate the amount of greening and forestry waste that was available for bioconversion and the volumes of biofuel that could be produced. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The use of biodiesel as a transportation fuel and its growing mandatory blending percentage in diesel increase the likelihood of contaminating groundwater with diesel/biodiesel blends. A 100L-field experiment with B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel, v/v) was conducted to assess the potential for the combined biostimulation of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria to enhance BTEX and PAH biodegradation in a diesel/biodiesel blend-contaminated groundwater. A B20 field experiment under monitored natural attenuation (MNA) was used as a baseline control. Ammonium acetate and a low-cost and sustainable product recovered from acid mine drainage treatment were used to stimulate iron and sulfate-reducing conditions. As a result, benzene and naphthalene concentrations (maximum concentrations were 28.1 μg L−1and 10.0 μg L−1, respectively) remained lower than the MNA experiment (maximum concentrations were 974.7 μg L−1and 121.3 μg L−1, respectively) over the whole experiment. Geochemical changes were chronologically consistent with the temporal change of the predominance of Geobacter and GOUTA19 which might be the key players responsible for the rapid attenuation of benzene and naphthalene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first field experiment to demonstrate the potential for the combined iron and sulfate biostimulation to enhance B20 source-zone biodegradation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a technical-economic assessment of biomethane production from vinasse in the Brazilian bioethanol industry, considering five technological routes of biogas upgrading. The technologies assessed were pressure water scrubbing, organic-physical scrubbing, amine scrubbing, membrane separation and pressure swing adsorption. The biomethane costs of the five technological routes overlapped in the range between R$30/GJHHV(US$13/GJHHV) and R$34/GJHHV(US$14/GJHHV), which indicates a certain equivalence of the options. Those costs were comparable to the prices of potential alternative fuels at 2014 prices, such as the Bolivian natural gas, priced at R$20/GJ (US$8/GJ); imported LNG, at R$31/GJ (US$13/GJ); and diesel, at R$42/GJ (US$18/GJ). The effects of scale on biomethane cost were also assessed and pointed out that the likely minimum scale for vinasse-to-biomethane projects aiming at diesel substitution would be at sugarcane mills with a minimum capacity of producing 87 million liters of ethanol per season, whereas if the aim were to target natural gas markets, 174 million liters of ethanol per season would likely be the minimum capacity for competitive prices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While sufficient biomass has been identified to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2)1targets by previous studies, availability does not equal access. Our objective was to quantify the potential accessible and stranded herbaceous biomass from different scenarios of predicted available biomass in both Texas and the US. The location and size of potential biorefineries and depots was determined using the geographic location of suitable lands for biomass, the transportation infrastructure and published economic constraints for minimum biomass supplied to a facility within a specified neighborhood. Our GIS-based heuristic addresses the capacitated facility location problem by distributing potential biomass along a county's suitable lands. Road and rail proximity optionally was included in the algorithm. The total stranded biomass in Texas was 28% of the total available biomass. Including the constraint of the transportation network accessibility (rail and appropriate roads) when determining facility location increased the total stranded biomass to 33%. Using county centroids as supply points and potential facilities led to an increase of 7% in total biomass captured by all facilities in Texas when compared to our raster-based heuristic. The nationwide accessible biomass is 90% of the available biomass, 78% of which is captured by biorefineries. In total, 77 biorefineries and 171 depots were identified in the US, which projects to 184 million Mg year−1delivered to biorefineries and depots, or 65.3 billion liters of advanced biofuels, more than the targeted 60 billion liters of advanced cellulosic biofuel in the RFS2. © 2016

AB  - The European Commission opened a discussion about limiting first generation food based biofuels in favour of advanced biofuels. The main reason was to limit the uncertainty in estimates of indirect land use change emissions (ILUC) of food based biofuels. Brown seaweeds represent a valuable solution. The lack of lignin makes them suitable for degradation processes such as anaerobic digestion (AD). The main output of AD is biogas which can be upgraded to biomethane and used as a transport fuel. The most common Irish brown seaweeds namely Laminaria sp. and Ascophyllum nodosum were subject to AD. The effects of beating pretreatment time (5–10–15 min) and changes in the seaweeds volatile solids (VS) concentration (1–2.5–4%) on methane production were investigated through a response surface methodology (RSM). Laminaria sp. showed the highest methane yield of 240 ml CH4g−1VS when the pretreatment time was set at 15 min and at VS concentration of 2.5%. In the case of Ascophyllum nodosum, the best yield of 169 mL CH4g−1VS was found at the longest pretreatment time tested and at the minimum concentration of VS. The RSM analysis revealed that the VS concentration had the strongest impact on the methane yield. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In Senegal, numerous initiatives exist to cultivate Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) trees as a multipurpose energy crop, including for fuel. Thus, research on this drought-resistant shrub has been predominately focused on biofuel production from its seeds, while its potential for carbon (C) sequestration, which could be valuable in sink projects (i.e., afforestation, reforestation) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto protocol, has been largely unstudied. This study was carried out in Senegal's Peanut basin to develop allometric equations for estimating biomass of individual JCL shrubs, JCL plantations, and determining their respective C storage potential. We discovered a three-stage evolution of JCL biomass accumulation. A slow build-up stage (1–3 years), followed by a fast production of biomass (3–4 years), and a relatively slower stage where certain fractions-root and leaf biomass-reach a plateau (4–5 years). The ratio between belowground and aboveground biomass varies from 53% (1 year after planting) and 26% (5 year after planting), with an average of 41%. We developed allometric models that provide a reliable estimation of the different biomass fractions of JCL and according to tree age. The models revealed that the stocks of biomass and C become relatively important from the fifth year with a storage capacity of 5.07 kg per tree. Most of the biomass and organic C are stored in the aboveground fractions of trees, suggesting that JCL plantations may be valuable for C sink and CDM projects. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The biomass of Urochloa mutica was subjected to thermal degradation analyses to understand its pyrolytic behavior for bioenergy production. Thermal degradation experiments were performed at three different heating rates, 10, 30 and 50 °C min−1 using simultaneous thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetric analyzer, under an inert environment. The kinetic analyses were performed using isoconversional models of Kissenger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO). The high heating value was calculated as 15.04 MJ mol−1. The activation energy (E) values were shown to be ranging from 103 through 233 kJ mol−1. Pre-exponential factors (A) indicated the reaction to follow first order kinetics. Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was measured to be ranging from 169 to 173 kJ mol−1 and 168 to 172 kJ mol−1, calculated by KAS and FWO methods, respectively. We have shown that Para grass biomass has considerable bioenergy potential comparable to established bioenergy crops such as switchgrass and miscanthus. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, a plug flow reactor was developed for continuous dry digestion processes and its efficiency was investigated using untreated manure bedded with straw at 22% total solids content. This newly developed reactor worked successfully for 230 days at increasing organic loading rates of 2.8, 4.2 and 6 gVS/L/d and retention times of 60, 40 and 28 days, respectively. Organic loading rates up to 4.2 gVS/L/d gave a better process stability, with methane yields up to 0.163 LCH4/gVSadded/d which is 56% of the theoretical yield. Further increase of organic loading rate to 6 gVS/L/d caused process instability with lower volatile solid removal efficiency and cellulose degradation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste management by anaerobic digestion generates a final byproduct, the digestate, which is usually separated into solid and liquid fractions to reduce the volume for transportation. The composition of the solid fraction has been recently studied to allow its valorization. However, full composition of liquid fraction of digestate and its size fractionation are less considered in the literature for efficient post treatment and valorization purposes. Therefore, here we characterized in detail liquid fraction of digestate obtained after solid-liquid separation from 11 full-scale co-digestion plants. The liquid fraction has a high concentration in organic matter with Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) from 9.2 to 78 g/L with 60–96% of COD in suspended particles (&gt;1.2 μm), 2–27% in colloids (1.2 μm to 1 kDa) and 2–18% in dissolved matter (&lt;1 kDa). Besides, it contained from 1.5 to 6.5 g/L total nitrogen and high ions concentrations (0.5–3.1 g/L NH4+, 1.05–5.48 g/L K+, 0–2.13 g/L PO43−). In addition, liquid fraction of digestate has poor biodegradability due to presence of humic substances making aerobic treatment inefficient. Only physico-chemical post treatment can be proposed for organic matter removal. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A thermocatalytic reforming (TCR®) unit patented by Fraunhofer UMSICHT was tested to convert lignocellulosic biomass and three organic wastes, digestate, paper sludge, and sewage sludge, into enhanced pyrolysis products. The TCR® reactor is an intermediate pyrolysis screw reactor connected to a reformer. hawse have explored the TCR® of four feedstocks in a 2 kg h−1 laboratory-scale plant. The aim of the work was to compare the product yields and qualities (biochar, bio-oil, and syngas) obtained by using TCR® under the same pyrolysis conditions (pyrolysis at 400 °C and postcatalytic reforming at 700 °C). Finally, paper sludge bio-oil was distilled at several temperatures to obtain the oil fractions. High-quality bio-oil and syngas from four different kinds of biomass were obtained and compared to that from traditional intermediate pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis. The bio-oil showed a high higher heating value (HHV) (35–38 MJ kg−1) independent of the kind of biomass used, and the total acid number was 1.8–5.4 mgKOH g−1. Fractional distillation led to a gasoline-like light fraction and an overall distillation rate of 74 %. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In many nations industrial scale AD of non-agricultural waste materials (such as MSW) has not yet reached its full potential, often constrained by the lack of secure, inexpensive, high quality AD feedstocks, and markets for the resulting digestate material. We tested the output material of a high throughput novel industrial process to define its potential as an AD feedstock (based on quality and consistency). This process, designed to circumvent the constraints of source segregation while still generating segregated waste streams, resulted in the production of a temporally homogenous fibrous material with: an average moisture content of 44.2 (±2.33)%; C:N ratio of ∼32.9:1 (±3.46:1), C:P ratio of ∼228:1 and gross calorific value of 17.4 (±0.29) MJ/kg(DM). This material provided a CH4 yield of between 201 and 297 m3 CH4/tonne(DM) (271–401 m3 CH4/tonne(vs)) comparable to commonly used AD feedstocks. Material contaminant levels were temporally consistent (P &gt; 0.05), (average values being Cd 0.63 (±0.19), Cu 56.3 (±7.45), Crtot 51.4 (±4.41), Hg &lt; 0.3, Ni 28.9 (±5.17), Pb 79.2 (±23.71), Zn 202 (±44.5), total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 2.2 (±0.3), and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (&lt;0.2) mg/kg(DM)). Calculated digestate contaminant levels were below the median contaminant threshold limits for anaerobic digestates of all countries within the European Union i.e. of Cd 3.35, Cu 535, Crtot 535, Hg 8.15, Ni 185, Pb 397.5, Zn 2100 mg/kg(DM). We suggest that novel high throughput processes that produce high quality AD feedstocks, may have a place in further diversion of waste from landfill. © 2016

AB  - The effect of a 10-day low-temperature treatment and subsequent recovery of 13 genotypes of switchgrass, including upland and lowland types, resulted in significant variations in a number of leaf-level photosynthetic parameters. Whilst the most resistant genotype (Blackwell) is an upland type, there was no clear separation of upland and lowland genotypes in terms of the resistance of leaf photosynthesis (Asat, ϕCO 2max, Vp and Vpmax), respiration (Rd) or fluorescence (Fv/Fm) parameters to low temperatures, with lowland types also achieving higher biomass yields than upland types. Examination of the reason for differences in the impact of low temperatures on leaf photosynthesis indicated that this could be due to both PEP carboxylase activity and/or PEP regeneration, but with some support for PEP regeneration being the more important. However, variations in leaf photosynthesis were not related to the final biomass yield in either control or low-temperature-exposed plants, and the best correlation was found with leaf area. Low temperatures were found to have a post-treatment impact on leaf area development through a reduction in the formation of new leaves. Overall, these results suggest that more attention should be directed at variations in the effect of low temperature on leaf initiation and emergence to exploit the wider use of switchgrass as a biomass–bioenergy crop. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract: Cellulosic biomass represents a huge reservoir of renewable carbon, but converting it into useful products is challenging. Attempts to transfer cellulose degradation capability to industrially useful micro-organisms have met with limited success, possibly due to poorly understood synergy between multiple cellulases. This is best studied by co-expression of many combinations of cellulases and associated proteins. Here, we describe the development of a test platform based on Citrobacter freundii, a cellobiose-assimilating organism closely related to Escherichia coli. Standard E. coli cloning vectors worked well in Cit. freundii. Expression of cellulases CenA and Cex of Cellulomonas fimi in Cit. freundii gave recombinant strains which were able to grow at the expense of cellulosic filter paper or microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) in a mineral medium supplemented with a small amount of yeast extract. Periodic physical agitation of the cultures was highly beneficial for growth at the expense of filter paper. This provides a test platform for the expression of combinations of genes encoding biomass-degrading enzymes to develop effective genetic cassettes for degradation of different biomass streams. Significance and Impact of the Study: Biofuels have been shown to be the best sustainable and alternative source of fuel to replace fossil fuels. Of the different types of feedstocks used for producing biofuels, lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant. Converting this biomass to useful products has met with little success. Different approaches are being used and microbial platforms are the most promising and sustainable method. This study shows that Citrobacter freundii is a better test platform than Escherichia coli for testing various combinations of cellulases for the development of microbial systems for biomass conversion. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Due to low degradability of dry solids, most of the digesters at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) operate at low loading rates resulting in poor biogas yields. In this study, co-digestion of sewage sludge (SS) with olive mill wastewater (OMW), cheese whey (CW) and crude glycerol (CG) was studied in an attempt to improve biogas production of existing digesters at WWTPs. The effect of agro-industrial by-products in biogas production was investigated using a 220 L pilot-scale (180 L working volume) digester under mesophilic conditions (35 °C) with a total feeding volume of 7.5 L daily and a 24-day hydraulic retention time. The initial feed was sewage sludge and the bioreactor was operated using this feed for 40 days. Each agro-industrial by-product was then added to the feed so that the reactor was fed continuously with 95% sewage sludge and 5% (v/v) of each examined agro-industrial by-product. The experiments showed that a 5% (v/v) addition of OMW, CG or CW to sewage sludge significantly increased biogas production by nearly 220%, 350% and 86% as values of 34.8 ± 3.2 L/d, 185.7 ± 15.3 L/d and 45.9 ± 3.6 L/d respectively, compared to that with sewage sludge alone (375 ml daily, 5% v/v in the feed). The average removal of dissolved chemical oxygen demand (d-COD) ranged between 72 and 99% for organic loading rates between 0.9 and 1.5 kg VS m−3 d−1. Reduction in the volatile solids ranged between 25 and 40%. This work suggests that methane can be produced very efficiently by adding a small concentration (5%) of agro-industrial by-products and especially CG in the inlet of digesters treating sewage sludge. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste from construction and demolition activities represents one of the highest volumes of waste in Europe. 500 million tonnes are produced throughout the whole EU every year. In some EU members like Spain, approximately 83 per cent of such waste is disposed in landfills. The remaining part is classified and processed in treatment facilities so that it can later be used as recycled aggregates in the construction sector (sand, gravel, aggregates, etc.) but without much commercial success. The aim of this study is to use recycled aggregates from inert wastes (IW) in the different phases of a landfill (construction, operation and closure) with the aid of a new computer tool called LABWASTE.14. This tool incorporates the mathematical relationship among the activities of the landfill and provides as a result the economic viability of using recycled aggregates compared to aggregates from quarries. Therefore, knowing the needs of aggregates in landfills (dams, drainage layers, covering layers, collection wells, etc.) may determine the amount of IW that could be recovered. These calculations can be obtained from some of the data that is introduced (population, land physiography, etc.). Furthermore, the use of LABWASTE.14 makes it possible to reduce the demand for aggregates from quarries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biodegradable fraction of municipal solid wastes generated from households in Ghana has favourable characteristics worth considering for bioenergy production. The suitability of this biodegradable portion for biogas and bioethanol production was assessed in this study. The assessment was performed on both untreated and hydrothermally treated unsorted and sorted fractions of the waste using standard methods for biomass conversion to bioenergy. Compositional analysis of the waste indicated that unsorted biodegradable municipal solid wastes (BMSW) consisted of 38.7 % dry matter (DM) glucan, 8.3 % DM hemicellulose, 10.1 % DM lignin and 7.6 % DM ash. The sorted fractions with the highest glucan but least lignin and hemicellulose were the pool of cassava, yam and plantain peeling wastes (CYPPW) with 84 % DM glucan much of which was starch, 5.6 % DM lignin and 0.5 % DM hemicellulose. The highest ethanol yield of 0.29 l/kg DM was measured from this same CYPPW while fruit wastes (FW) had the highest biomethane potential of 408 ml CH4/g VS. The BMSW had ethanol yield of 0.17 l/kg DM and biogas 369 ml CH4/g VS. The hydrothermally pretreated wastes had marginal increases in glucose and ethanol yield except the treated yard waste which significantly increased by 54 % in glucose over the untreated waste. The most promising waste fractions were FW, CYPPW and mixed paper wastes. Careful selection of these fractions in feedstock for biofuel production would reduce generation of the waste, improve the quality and effectively lead to higher yield of biofuel over the unsorted form. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study uses life cycle assessment to quantify and compare the greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel depletion impacts of a theoretical mallee jet fuel value chain, operating in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, with those of fossil-based jet fuel. Relative to fossil-based jet fuel, the mallee jet fuel was found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% and result in a net fossil fuel depletion benefit. Further greenhouse gas reductions could be achieved by optimizing the supply chain through measures such as capturing methane emissions for hydrogen production and utilizing co-produced biodiesel. The magnitudes of the environmental benefits are sensitive to a number of methodology assumptions, including the approach to potential food displacement and co-production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies in the transportation fuel portfolio is an effective strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector worldwide. However, as one of the most promising low-carbon fuels, cellulosic biofuel has not fully entered commercial production. Governments could provide guidance in developing cellulosic biofuel technologies, but no systematic approach has been proposed yet. We establish a dynamic programming framework for investigating time-dependent and adaptive decision-making processes to develop advanced fuel technologies. The learning-by-doing effect inherited in the technology development process is included in the framework. The proposed framework is applied in a case study to explore the most economical pathway for California to develop a solid cellulosic biofuel industry under its Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Our results show that cellulosic biofuel technology is playing a critical role in guaranteeing California's 10% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2020. Three to four billion gallons of cumulative production are needed to ensure that cellulosic biofuel is cost-competitive with petroleum-based fuels or conventional biofuels. Zero emission vehicle promoting policies will discourage the development of cellulosic biofuel. The proposed framework, with small adjustments, can also be applied to study new technology development in other energy sectors. © 2016

AB  - Emissions from sugarcane burning are known to impact on the respiratory health of sugar estate workers and local populations. Despite this, there have been few studies on occupational and ambient exposures and risks from airborne particulate matter (PM) associated with field burning and ash re-suspension. From workplace monitoring on sugarcane estates in two different South American countries in 2010 and 2011, median concentrations of airborne PM10 (particulate matter nominally &lt;10 μm in diameter) were found to be statistically much higher during pre-harvest sugarcane burning (1807 μg m−3) than during either sugarcane cutting after burning (∼123 μg m−3) or in the sugarcane processing factory (∼175 μg m−3). Median PM10 measurements in ambient scenarios, for example in the sugarcane fields before the burning or during 24 h measurements in neighboring villages (bordering the sugarcane plantation), were much lower, between 18 and 37 μg m−3. From the analysis of size-selective samples of airborne PM10, collected during sugarcane field burning, cutting and ambient periods, almost all (∼96 wt %) fell within the ‘respirable’ fraction (&lt;4 μm aerodynamic diameter), with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.1 μm. Residual ash from field and bagasse burning, characterised using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with X-ray elemental analysis, was found to contain carbonaceous and silicate-dominated particles in the PM0.5 and PM0.5-2.5 size ranges and fibres from &lt;10 to over 50 μm in length. Only a small proportion of the field burning ash (average 0.6 vol %) and bagasse ash (average 1.3 vol %) was in the respirable fraction. However, from grinding experiments, which simulate disaggregation as a result of disturbance during harvest or bagasse ash removal, the ash was fragile and easily broken down into thoracic particulate (&lt;10 μm aerodynamic diameter) and, in some instances, created respirable-sized PM. From exposure calculations, the 8 h time weighted average (TWA) concentrations of PM10, during the different measurement scenarios, were found to be below occupational exposure limits (OELs; 5000 μg m−3 for respirable PM). Ambient PM10 exposure of residents surrounding the sugarcane plantations was found to be below the WHO air quality guideline (50 μg m−3 as a 24 h mean). The relative risk calculated for ‘all cause’ mortality from exposure of nearby residents to PM10 generated by sugarcane burning was found to be 3%. The concentrations of PM10 produced during the processing of sugarcane were high (up to 21.5 mg m−3), which is concerning given that re-suspended particles of ash in the fields and processing plant have been previously shown to contain potentially toxic cristobalite. PM produced during sugarcane burning, and during extended periods of local exposure to the smoke and re-suspended ash, therefore, should be considered as both a potential acute and chronic respiratory health hazard. This issue will become increasingly important with the forecasted rise in sugarcane production for biofuels. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The economic performance of biofuels supply chains depends on the interaction of technical characteristics as technological pathways and logistics, and social structures as actor behavior, their interactions and institutions. Traditional approaches focus on the technical problems only. Little attention has been paid to the institutional analysis of biofuel supply chains. This paper aims to extend the analysis of the effect of institutions on the emergence of biofuel supply chains by developing a conceptual framework that combines elements of complex adaptive systems, (neo) institutional economics and socio-technical systems theory. These elements were formalized into an agent-based model. The proposed method is illustrated by a case study on a biodiesel supply chain in Germany. It was found that the patterns in production capacity result from investors basing their decisions on optimistic perceptions of the market development that increase with a favorable institutional framework. Conversely, patterns in biodiesel production cannot be completely explained by this mechanism. The proposed framework assisted the model conceptualization phase and allowed the incorporation of social structures into the agent-based model. This approach could be developed further to provide insights on the effect of different future deployment strategies on bioenergy systems emergence and development. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Three landfill gas (LFG) valorization technologies were compared using energy and exergy efficiency and a streamlined Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The technologies were (i) steam reforming and hydrogen utilization in an in situ cogeneration fuel cell (SR-IS-FCC), (ii) biogas utilization in an in situ gas engine cogeneration plant (IS-GEC), and (iii) amine scrubbing and biomethane utilization in an ex situ gas engine cogeneration plant (AS-ES-GEC). The SR-IS-FCC alternative recorded the highest exergy efficiency and savings in cumulative energy demand (CED), and the lowest global warming potential (GWP) when all the heat is utilized in situ; otherwise, the highest exergy efficiency and the lowest GWP and CED were associated with the AS-ES-GEC alternative. The results indicate that AS-ES-GEC is the preferential choice when heat cannot be utilized in situ. Otherwise, SR-IS-FCC records the best values for the three criteria, and the AS-ES-GEC technology is the least interesting alternative. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural production in the hot and arid low desert systems of southern California relies heavily on irrigation. A better understanding of how much and to what extent irrigated water is transpired by crops relative to being lost through evaporation would improve the management of increasingly limited water resources. In this study, we examined the partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) over a field of forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), which was under evaluation as a potential biofuel feedstock, based on isotope measurements of three irrigation cycles at the vegetative stage. This study employed customized transparent chambers coupled with a laser-based isotope analyzer to continuously measure near-surface variations in the stable isotopic composition of evaporation (E, δE), transpiration (T, δT) and ET (δET) to partition the total water flux. Due to the extreme heat and aridity, δE and δT were very similar, which makes this system highly unusual. Contrary to an expectation that the isotopic signatures of T, E, and ET would become increasingly enriched as soils became drier, our results showed an interesting pattern that δE, δT, and δET increased initially as soil water was depleted following irrigation, but decreased with further soil drying in mid to late irrigation cycle. These changes are likely caused by root water transport from deeper to shallower soil layers. Results indicate that about 46% of the irrigated water delivered to the crop was used as transpiration, with 54% lost as direct evaporation. This implies that 28 − 39% of the total source water was used by the crop, considering the typical 60 − 85% efficiency of flood irrigation. The stable isotope technique provided an effective means of determining surface partitioning of irrigation water in this unusually harsh production environment. The results suggest the potential to further minimize unproductive water losses in these production systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Swedish climate policy targets net zero greenhouse gases (GHG) by mid-century, with road transport independent of fossil fuels by 2030, requiring far-reaching changes in the way energy is used. Forest management is expected to support carbon sequestration and provide biomass for various uses, including energy. In this paper, we combine two energy scenarios with four forest scenarios and quantify GHG balances associated with energy-use for heat, electricity, and road transport, and with forest management and production, use, and end-of-life management of various forest products, including products for export. The aggregated GHG balances are evaluated in relation to the 2-degree target and an allocated Swedish CO2 budget. The production of biofuels in the agriculture sector is considered but not analyzed in detail. The results suggest that Swedish forestry can make an important contribution by supplying forest fuels and other products while maintaining or enhancing carbon storage in vegetation, soils, and forest products. The GHG neutrality goal is not met in any of the scenarios without factoring in carbon sequestration. Measures to enhance forest productivity can increase output of forest products (including biofuels for export) and also enhance carbon sequestration. The Swedish forest sector can let Sweden reach net negative emissions, and avoid “using up” its allocated CO2 budget, thereby increasing the associated emissions space for the rest of the world. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the USA, approximately 6 million tons of nitrogen and 1 million tons of phosphorus are being produced as a waste stream from the dairy operations. The main aim of this research was to estimate the potential of algal biofuel production, using waste nutrients present in the dairy waste, as well as performing a life cycle assessment to estimate the energy requirement of produced algal biofuel. Four different scenarios for algal biofuel production were simulated using different combinations of the following processes (i) algal-biodiesel-production, (ii) anaerobic-digestion (AD), (iii) pyrolysis and (iv) enzymatic-hydrolysis. Scenario 1 consists of AD and algal biodiesel production. Introduction of pyrolysis in the second scenario decreased biofuel production by ∼6% in the initial cycle and gradually increased to 25% in the later cycles. In the third scenario, biomass liquefaction through enzymatic hydrolysis was introduced to recover nutrients and sugars from the sludge generated from the AD process. Recovered nutrients and sugars were used for additional algal biodiesel production. Remaining sludge after the biomass liquefaction was applied on the agricultural land. As compared to the 1st scenario, further processing of the sludge through liquefaction increased the overall bioenergy production marginally. In the fourth scenario, biomass left after liquefaction was further processed through pyrolysis. In the fourth scenario, a 38% increase in the energy production was observed versus the 1st scenario. Additional energy production (compared to 1st scenario) through pyrolysis (Scenario 2) required additional 1.5 GJ of energy per GJ of energy produced and showed little variability. Additional energy production through the 3rd and the 4th scenario is not energetically favorable as compared to the 1st scenario. With respect to the 3rd scenario, energetically favorable additional energy can only be produced by the 4th scenario. Life-cycle energy-demand of the produced biofuel was varied from 0.35 to 0.68 GJ/GJ of energy produced. This study estimated that using dairy waste at a maximum of 3.14 billion GJ bioenergy could be produced. © 2016 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - While Stackelberg leader–follower games and bilevel programming have become increasingly prevalent in game-theoretic modeling and optimization of decentralized supply chains, existing models can only handle linear programming or quadratic programming followers’ problems. When discrete decisions are involved in the follower's problem, the resulting lower-level mixed-integer program prohibits direct transformation of the bilevel program into a single-level mathematical program using the KKT conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a mixed-integer bilevel programming (MIBP) modeling framework and solution algorithm for optimal supply chain design and operations, where the follower is allowed to have discrete decisions, e.g., facility location, technology selection, and opening/shutting-down of production lines. A reformulation-and-decomposition algorithm is developed for global optimization of the MIBP problems. A case study on an integrated forestry and biofuel supply chain is presented to demonstrate the application, along with comparisons to conventional centralized modeling and optimization methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The global community needs a sustainable and renewable sources of energy as alternatives to finite fossil fuels that are also associated with climate change. Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) is a fast-growing candidate for cultivation as a short-rotation woody crop for biofuel production and it is planted throughout Asia, Europe, and the Northern America. It is native to the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) of the South Central United States. The LMAV has climatic, edaphic, and infrastructural attributes conducive to biofuel production, but much of the most productive sites of the region are dedicated to agricultural production because it is the most economically prime use. To foster development of a biofuel industry of the region may require biomass production on sites suboptimal for agricultural production. In this study, cropping systems and genotypes for cottonwood production were tested at three retired agricultural sites in the LMAV, Archibald, Colt, and Rohwer. Cropping systems tested were monoculture and alley cropping systems with two different alley widths. Genotypes tested were clones from Mississippi (ST-66) and Texas (S7C20) and a mixture of clones from Louisiana (LAMIX). Several interactions among site, genotype, and cropping system treatments were detected in survival and growth parameters. By the end of the study period, survival ranged from 30 to 81%, while height and diameter at breast height (dbh) ranges were 3.12–5.78 m, and 2.09–4.39 cm, respectively. Overall, survival and growth performance in this study were low compared to previous studies, suggesting the difficulty of managing productive cottonwood plantations under the suboptimal site conditions tested. Pronounced droughts during half of the years in this study and poor soil conditions were likely the primary reasons behind such performance of the genotypes. The study found no effect of cropping systems on individual tree growth. Genotypes from Texas and Louisiana showed relatively better survival (P = 0.0029) and growth (P &lt; 0.001 to P = 0.0207) than the clone from Mississippi in the site conditions tested. Among sites, Rohwer, which had deep clay soil, had the highest biomass production (8299 kg ha−1). Survival and growth was limited at the Archibald site by ponding of water in winter and early spring in the establishment year and 2 years of pronounced drought in following years. A greater recurrence of competing vegetation at Archibald likely contributed to its lower survival (30%) and growth (biomass ranging from 1026 to 1511 kg ha−1 among the treatments) by the end of the study period. We suggest selecting drought-hardy genotypes along with site preparation and fertilization in such marginal sites. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study investigates the consumer responses toward fuel from second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose processing systems. Data was collected via in-person consumer surveys across in three major U.S. cities with two different information treatments. A dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is utilized to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for this product and analyze factors that affect consumer choice. The results suggest that the average respondent was willing to pay an 11% premium for second-generation nature-inspired bioethanol compared to conventional fuel. The willingness to pay was the highest in Portland, Oregon (17%), followed by Minneapolis (9%) and then Boston (8%). Driving distance was found to have a negative effect on consumer willingness to pay. Consumers who purchase more organic foods were more willing to pay a premium for the product. Risk attitude had heterogeneous effects in different locations. The effect of information regarding the second-generation, nature-inspired lignocellulose process was found to be significantly positive. © 2016

AB  - This paper evaluates low-carbon urban development strategies for the transport sector in São Paulo, one of the largest cities in the world. For each mobility policy selected, we build scenarios to evaluate the potential of mitigating GHG emissions, shedding light on institutional aspects, benefits and risks of implementing each measure. Selected policies analyzed in this paper focus on: (i) reduction of frequency and distance of motorized trips; (ii) improvement of public transport; and (ii) technological issues, from improvement of fuel efficiency of all transport modes to replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels. Results show that the measures that present the highest potential to reduce GHG emissions are those that promote the use of biofuels, particularly ethanol, followed by those that favor the use of public transport. Moreover, simulations of integrated policies evidence that their effectiveness depends upon the adoption of coordinated policies at Federal, State and Local levels. Lastly, we highlight the complementary nature of the proposed policies and the contribution of scenario building to the debate on the strategic planning of integrated urban public policies to promote sustainable development in São Paulo City. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A very limited number of field studies have addressed the suitability of Cynara cardunculus L. genotypes to local environmental conditions in terms of productive aptitude. Four genotypes of Cardoon, under low input conditions (reduced nitrogen fertilization and rainfed conditions) were compared in a marginal land of Central Italy during the 2012–2014 period: two cultivated (CDL07 and Gigante) and two wild cardoon genotypes (RCT10 and Tolfa). At the ripening stage of capitula, all plant components were weighed separately, yields were calculated, and biometric traits were measured. Genotypes showed different productive aptitudes and suitability to the pedo-climatic conditions of growth. The total aboveground dry biomass per plant ranged between 114.4 and 353.6 g with variable values within genotypes and years, whereas the partition of the aboveground biomass was strongly affected by genotypes only. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a general prevalent influence of the genotype factor on crop yields. Capitula components were of greatest importance in cultivated cardoons, but strongly affected by the annual climatic trends. The maximum achenes yield was in 2012 with 3.2 t ha−1 as a mean of the cultivated cardoons, whereas the wild genotype Tolfa reached a mean production of 2.1 t ha−1. In general the wild genotype RCT10 demonstrated a poor adaptability to the conditions of the experimental site. On the other hand, wild genotype Tolfa might be incorporated into the local cropping systems as an industrial or bioenergy crop, due the low management inputs required, its adaptability to the local conditions, and the fairy good aboveground biomass and achenes production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a renewed interest in transnational land deals in the developing land-abundant countries of Sub Sahara Africa (SSA), Asia and Latin America following the convergence of the global financial, food and energy crises in the mid 2000s. In much of SSA, these deals occur on customary lands which are managed by traditional authorities on behalf of and in trust for the entire local community and are thus occupied by indigenous farmers. The traditional authorities have, for diverse reasons, become much interested in alienating large tracts of customary lands to foreign investors for biofuel and food crop plantations. In this paper, we examine the effects of the current mode of communal land acquisition for Jatropha cultivation in Ghana on the security of indigenous farmers’ land rights and their decisions to invest in their farms. Empirical evidence is based on primary data collected from field surveys conducted in two districts in Ghana; Yeji and Ejura in the Brong Ahafo and Ashanti regions respectively. We observed that the increasing appropriation of communal lands for biofuel plantations without consultation, fair and adequate compensation to the indigenous land holders has resulted in uncertainty and tenure insecurity among farmers in affected communities. Consequently, such farmers have become relatively disinterested in farming, cultivating smaller farm sizes and thereby showing low investments in their farms. These findings provide a new perspective for considering the relationship between increasing biofuel cultivation and food security in developing Africa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a candidate for future renewable energy resources. Choice of optimum biomass types and biological conversion techniques requires well-founded assessment of the digestibility determining the conversion efficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the digestibility of miscanthus samples that were tested using three methods: 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay (DNS), anaerobic batch digestion test, and high-throughput pretreatment and hydrolysis method, including a grinding and hydrothermal pretreatment prior to the analysis (HTPH). The miscanthus samples were expected to have different digestibilities due to maturity stage, dry matter content and the implementation of extrusion as a mechanical pretreatment. The results of the DNS and the biogas batch test methods were highly correlated (R2 between 0.75 and 0.92), but not with the results of the HTPH method. The DNS and biogas batch test showed that digestibility differed between samples, probably due to the degree of lignification and content of soluble sugars. For the HTPH method, the digestibility for biorefining was the same irrespective of the variation in the other analyses. The HTPH method had higher biomass use efficiency, closely followed by the biogas batch test running for 91 days on the mechanically pretreated biomass. The HTPH method provided information on the overall quantity of carbohydrates that can be made available from a given biomass. Additionally, DNS and biogas batch test visualize the variation in digestibility between biomass types caused by lignification and particle. The study concludes that the choice of evaluation method for miscanthus will depend on the bioenergy conversion method used and that important information on the interaction between physio-chemical pretreatment and biological accessibility of the biomass can be obtained by comparing the methods. This information will enable sound decisions on the future choice of bioenergy conversion technologies. © 2016 The Authors. Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Phytoremediation is a cost-effective “green technology” that uses plants to improve the soil properties of polluted sites, preventing the dispersion of pollutants and reducing the mobility of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) through their adsorption and accumulation by roots or precipitation within the root zone. Being highly tolerant to pollutants and other abiotic stresses, giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a suitable biomass crop for phytoremediation of contaminated soils. We report the results of a two-year open-air lysimeter study aimed at assessing the adaptability of giant reed to grow on industrial substrates polluted by Pb and Zn and at testing commercial humic acids from leonardite as improvers of plant performance. We evaluated giant reed potential for: 1) biomass production for energy or biomaterial recovery; 2) PTE phytoextraction and 3) soil fertility restoration. Chemical fertility was monitored by measuring soil C while soil biological fertility was estimated by quantifying the abundance of bacterial functional genes regulating nitrogen fixation (nifH) and nitrification (amoA). Giant reed above-ground growth on the polluted soils was slightly lower (− 16%) than on a non-polluted soil, with a preferential storage of biomass in the rhizome acting as a survival strategy in limiting growing conditions. Humic acids improved plant stress tolerance and production levels. As aerial biomass (shoots) did not accumulate PTEs, the plant in question can be used for bioenergy or biopolymer production. In contrast, below-ground biomass (rhizomes) accumulated PTEs, and can thus be harvested and removed from soil to improve phytoremediation protocols and also used as industrial biofuel. Giant reed growth increased the abundance of N-cycling bacteria and soil C in the rhizospheric soil, as well as reduced soil Pb and Zn EDTA extractable fraction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrocarbons are the main components of diesel oil and are toxic for the majority of plants. A few plant species, known as phytoremediators, are tolerant of hydrocarbons and can survive the stressful conditions of soils contaminated with diesel oil. Canavalia ensiformis, a plant species that is well distributed throughout the tropics, possesses advantageous features for a potential resistance to soil contamination, such as fast growth and a deep root system. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the tolerance of C. ensiformis when it was exposed to soil contaminated with diesel oil. Seedlings were subjected to two treatments: contaminated soil (CS) (95 ml/kg of diesel oil) and non-contaminated soil (NCS) for a period of 30 days; its growth, morphology, anatomy, and physiology were analyzed. Despite the high level of toxicity, some individuals were able to survive in CS. These plants had root apical meristems with high levels of mitosis and were able to issue new roots with more developed aerenchyma tissue. Because the surviving plants presented no marks of cellular damage on the organs formed (root and leaves) during the experiment, the species capacity of growth on CS was confirmed. Although, long-term field experiments, applying different contaminant concentrations, should be considered to infer about the species resistance and use as phytoremediator. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Key message: Development of the first consensus genetic map of intermediate wheatgrass gives insight into the genome and tools for molecular breeding. Abstract: Intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) has been identified as a candidate for domestication and improvement as a perennial grain, forage, and biofuel crop and is actively being improved by several breeding programs. To accelerate this process using genomics-assisted breeding, efficient genotyping methods and genetic marker reference maps are needed. We present here the first consensus genetic map for intermediate wheatgrass (IWG), which confirms the species’ allohexaploid nature (2n = 6x = 42) and homology to Triticeae genomes. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify markers that fit expected segregation ratios and construct genetic maps for 13 heterogeneous parents of seven full-sib families. These maps were then integrated using a linear programming method to produce a consensus map with 21 linkage groups containing 10,029 markers, 3601 of which were present in at least two populations. Each of the 21 linkage groups contained between 237 and 683 markers, cumulatively covering 5061 cM (2891 cM––Kosambi) with an average distance of 0.5 cM between each pair of markers. Through mapping the sequence tags to the diploid (2n = 2x = 14) barley reference genome, we observed high colinearity and synteny between these genomes, with three homoeologous IWG chromosomes corresponding to each of the seven barley chromosomes, and mapped translocations that are known in the Triticeae. The consensus map is a valuable tool for wheat breeders to map important disease-resistance genes within intermediate wheatgrass. These genomic tools can help lead to rapid improvement of IWG and development of high-yielding cultivars of this perennial grain that would facilitate the sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change are issues that currently receive a great deal of attention, both from society and the scientific community. Combustion of fossil fuels is considered the main reason for the increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere and therefore, the main cause of climate change. In such context, biofuels are usually presented as an energy source that considerably reduces GHG emissions when compared to the use of fossil fuels. However, some issues of biofuel production such as the emissions associated with both change in land use and the use of nitrogen fertilizers are still under scrutiny. The focus of this study is related to N2O soil emissions associated with sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil. Signatory countries of the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to prepare and periodically update an inventory of GHG emissions and sinks. The International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), through the Agriculture, Forest and Other Land Use (AFOLU), establishes guidelines to calculate N2O soil emissions on three different levels, or tiers. The simplest Tier 1 uses few equations and default emissions factors. The most elaborated, Tier 3, uses computation modeling, field measurements and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This study proposes using the limited data available, procedures for Tier 3 estimates of N2O soil emissions in sugarcane crops in the state of São Paulo - Brazil. It also compares N2O sugarcane emissions calculated by Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods. Results show that in most cases the difference in results from Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods are beyond the error margin of the Brazilian Inventory. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) has been promoted due to its improved environmental performance, which is based on a number of life cycle assessments (LCA). However, the influence of site-specific conditions and practices on AD performance is rarely captured in LCA studies and the effects on C and N cycles are often overlooked. In this paper, a new model for AD (SIMSWASTE-AD) is described in full and tested against a selection of available measured data. Good agreement between modelled and measured values was obtained, reflecting the model capability to predict biogas production (r2 = 0.84) and N mineralization (r2 = 0.85) under a range of substrate mixtures and operational conditions. SIMSWASTE-AD was also used to simulate C and N flows and GHG emissions for a set of scenarios exploring different AD technology levels, feedstock mixtures and climate conditions. The importance of post-digestion emissions and its relationship with the AD performance have been stressed as crucial factors to reduce the net GHG emissions (− 75%) but also to enhance digestate fertilizer potential (15%). Gas tight digestate storage with residual biogas collection is highly recommended (especially in temperate to warm climates), as well as those operational conditions that can improve the process efficiency on degrading VS (e.g. thermophilic range, longer hydraulic retention time). Beyond the effects on the manure management stage, SIMSWASTE-AD also aims to help account for potential effects of AD on other stages by providing the C and nutrient flows. While primarily designed to be applied within the SIMSDAIRY modelling framework, it can also interact with other models implemented in integrated approaches. Such system scope assessments are essential for stakeholders and policy makers in order to develop effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions and environmental issues in the agriculture sector. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The labile organic C (LC) and C management index (CMI) may be useful indicators of alterations of soil organic matter (SOM) in areas undergoing land use change (LUC) for biofuels production. However, there is no consensus on which methodology is best suited for quantifying LC and CMI. The main goal of this study was to assess alterations on LC contents and CMI values in sites undergoing the LUC native vegetation (NV)-pasture (PA)-sugarcane (SC) in south-central Brazil, and evaluated the sensitivity of different methods commonly used to assess LC and CMI, in order to select a best-suited method to quantify these indicators in tropical regions. The conversion NV-PA decreased the LC and CMI, whilst the conversion of PA-SC tended to increase the CMI. Accordingly, cropping sugarcane in areas previously used as pastures, as currently has been observed in Brazil, enhance SOM quality. The methodology used to quantify the LC and the CMI is critical to infer about LUC effects. Both methods proposed by Blair et al. (1995) and Diekow et al. (2005) were highly sensitive to the conversions evaluated in this research. However, Diekow et al. (2005) is the most suitable method to estimate the LC and CMI in sites undergoing LUC in Brazil, since the approach of Blair et al. (1995) notably overestimates these SOM quality indicators. We reiterate that the SOM changes are well expressed by the total soil organic C in areas undergoing LUC and, integrated approaches, such as the CMI, are quite suitable to evaluate the effects of LUC on SOM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Five new scenarios, or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), have been developed, spanning a range of challenges to mitigation and challenges to adaptation. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 4 (SSP4), “Inequality” or “A Road Divided,” is one of these scenarios, characterized by low challenges to mitigation and high challenges to adaptation. We describe, in quantitative terms, the SSP4 as implemented by the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), the marker model for this scenario. We use demographic and economic assumptions, in combination with technology and non-climate policy assumptions to develop a quantitative representation of energy, land-use and land-cover, and emissions consistent with the SSP4 narrative. The scenario is one with stark differences within and across regions. High-income regions prosper, continuing to increase their demand for energy and food. Electrification increases in these regions, with the increased generation being met by nuclear and renewables. Low-income regions, however, stagnate due to limited economic growth. Growth in total consumption is dominated by increases in population, not increases in per capita consumption. Due to failures in energy access policies, these regions continue to depend on traditional biofuels, leading to high pollutant emissions. Declining dependence on fossil fuels in all regions means that total radiative forcing absent the inclusion of mitigation or impacts only reaches 6.4 W m−2 in 2100, making this a world with relatively low challenges to mitigation. We explore the effects of mitigation effort on the SSP4 world, finding that the imposition of a carbon price has a varied effect across regions. In particular, the SSP4 mitigation scenarios are characterized by afforestation in the high-income regions and deforestation in the low-income regions. Furthermore, we find that the SSP4 is a world with low challenges to mitigation, but only to a point due to incomplete mitigation of land-related emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae have a potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for synthesis of biodiesel, rich in saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and valuable biomolecules. Role of several parameters such as nutrient composition, light intensity, photoperiod and pH on growth and lipid productivity was investigated. A freshwater green microalga Scenedesmus abundans was selected as a potential candidate for production of biodiesel and its growth conditions were optimized for enhanced lipid accumulation. The lipid content of the strain has been increased up to about 48% when grown in modified Fogg's medium at pH 8 with light intensity of 40.5 μmol m−2 s−1 and photoperiod of 16 h light:8 h dark. Lipids were transesterified and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by GC–MS. They possess more than 80% of C16 to C18 fatty acids, which are major precursors for biodiesel production. The FAME consisted of saturated (47.83%), monounsaturated (26.38%) and polyunsaturated (25.20%) fatty acids. Several important biodiesel quality parameters were predicted and compared to the corresponding specifications in the American and European biodiesel standards. The study opens up new vistas for utilization of the microalga, S. abundans for efficient production of biodiesel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A typical biorefining supply chain exerts substantial impact on the regional water resources. Indeed, a complex relationship exists between the production of biomass, the processing of biomass into fuels and chemicals, the usage of fresh water, and the discharge of wastewater. This paper introduces an optimization framework for the design of a biorefining system while accounting for the interactions with the surrounding watershed. Special attention is paid in the use of fresh water and the discharge of wastewater to the surrounded watershed. The optimization approach also accounts for the selection of feedstocks, location of cultivation sites and biomass processing facilities, and conversion technologies. Economic and environmental objectives are used. A case study for the central-west part of Mexico is presented. The results show that economic gains may be achieved while optimizing water usage and discharge and satisfying watershed constraints. © 2016

AB  - Biofuels produced from renewable energy biomass are playing a more significant role because of the environmental problems resulting from the use of fossil fuels. However, a major problem with biofuel production is that despite the range of feedstock that can be used, raw material availability varies considerably. By combining a series of theories and methods, the research objective of this study is to determine the current developments and the future trends in biofuel feedstock. By combining technological paradigm theory with literature mining, it was found that biofuel feedstock production development followed a three-stage trajectory, which was in accordance with the traditional technological paradigm – the S-curve. This new curve can be divided into BFDP (biofuel feedstock development paradigm) competition, BFDP diffusion, and BFDP shift. The biofuel production diffusion velocity model showed that there has been constant growth from 2000, with the growth rate reaching a peak in 2008, after which time it began to drop. Biofuel production worldwide is expected to remain unchanged until 2030 when a paradigm shift is expected. This study also illustrates the results of our innovative procedure – a combination of the data analysis system and the technological paradigm theory – for the present biofuel feedstock soft path that will lead to this paradigm shift, with integrated biofuel production feedstock systems expected to be a significant new trend. © 2016

AB  - A wealth of data and information on the cultivation of perennial biomass crops has been collected, but direct comparisons between herbaceous and woody crops are rare. The main objective of this research was to compare the biomass yield, the energy balance and the biomass quality of six perennial bioenergy crops: Populus spp., Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix spp., Arundo donax, Miscanthus × giganteus, and Panicum virgatum, grown in two marginal environments. For giant reed and switchgrass, two levels of nitrogen fertilization were applied annually (0–100 kg ha−1). Nitrogen fertilization did not affect biomass or energy production of giant reed; thus, it significantly reduced the energy return on investment (EROI) (from 73 to 27). In switchgrass, nitrogen fertilization significantly increased biomass production and the capacity of this crop to respond to water availability, making it a favorable option when only biomass production is a target. Net energy gain (NEG) was higher for herbaceous crops than for woody crops. In Casale, EROI calculated for poplar and willow (7, on average) was significantly lower than that of the other crops (14, on average). In Gariga, the highest EROI was calculated for miscanthus (98), followed by nonfertilized giant reed and switchgrass (82 and 73, respectively). Growing degree days10 during the cropping season had no effect on biomass production in any of the studied species, although water availability from May to August was a major factor affecting biomass yield in herbaceous crops. Overall, herbaceous crops had the highest ranking for bioenergy production due to their high biomass yield, high net energy gain (NEG), and biomass quality that renders them suitable to both biochemical and thermochemical conversion. Miscanthus in particular had the highest EROI in both locations (16 and 98, in Casale and Gariga), while giant reed had the highest NEG on the silty-loam soil of Gariga. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - In this article, the belowground and aboveground biomass production in bioenergy buffers and biogeochemical N removal processes along the soil–groundwater continuum was assessed. In a sandy loam soil with shallow groundwater, bioenergy buffers of miscanthus and willow (5 and 10 m wide) were planted along a ditch of an agricultural field (AF) located in the Po valley (Italy). Mineral N forms and dissolved organic C (DOC) were monitored monthly over an 18-month period in groundwater before and after the bioenergy buffers. Soil samples were measured for inorganic N, DOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), and potential nitrate reductase activity (NRA). The results indicated that bioenergy buffers are able to efficiently remove from groundwater the incoming NO3-N (62% – 5 m and 80% – 10 m). NO3-N removal rate was higher when nitrate input from AF increased due to N fertilization. Willow performed better than miscanthus in terms of biomass production (17 Mg DM ha−1 yr−1), fine root biomass (5.3 Mg ha−1) and N removal via harvesting (73 kg N ha−1). The negative nonlinear relationship found between NO3-N and DOC along the soil–groundwater continuum from AF to bioenergy buffers indicates that DOC:NO3-N ratio is an important controlling factor for promoting denitrification in bioenergy buffers. Bioenergy buffers promoted soil microbial functioning as they stimulated plant–microbial linkages by increasing the easily available C sources for microorganisms (as DOC). First, willow and miscanthus promoted high rates of biological removal of nitrate (NRA) along the soil profile. Second, rhizosphere processes activated the soil microbial community leading to significant increases in MBC and microbial N immobilization. Herbaceous and woody bioenergy crops have been confirmed as providing good environmental performances when cultivated as bioenergy buffers by mitigating the disservices of agricultural activities such as groundwater N pollution. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We propose a causal analysis framework to increase understanding of land-use change (LUC) and the reliability of LUC models. This health-sciences-inspired framework can be applied to determine probable causes of LUC in the context of bioenergy. Calculations of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for LUC associated with biofuel production are critical in determining whether a fuel qualifies as a biofuel or advanced biofuel category under regional (EU), national (US, UK), and state (California) regulations. Biofuel policymakers and scientists continue to discuss to what extent presumed indirect land-use change (ILUC) estimates should be included in GHG accounting for biofuel pathways. Current estimates of ILUC for bioenergy rely largely on economic simulation models that focus on causal pathways involving global commodity trade and use coarse land-cover data with simple land classification systems. This paper challenges the application of such models to estimate global areas of LUC in the absence of causal analysis. The proposed causal analysis framework begins with a definition of the change that has occurred and proceeds to a strength-of-evidence approach that includes plausibility of relationship, completeness of causal pathway, spatial co-occurrence, time order, analogous agents, simulation model results, and quantitative agent–response relationships. We discuss how LUC may be allocated among probable causes for policy purposes and how the application of the framework has the potential to increase the validity of LUC models and resolve controversies about ILUC, such as deforestation, and biofuels. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Pyrolysis of forestry residues produces bio-oil compounds and potentially employed in H2 production. This research is aimed to perform a kinetic study and obtain optimum reaction conditions (ORC) for the pyrolysis of the Mexican Pinus cooperi (PC) and Quercus sideroxyla (QS) forest species to obtain the maximum amount of volatile matter (condensable and non-condensable). Samples of forest biomass were crushed and sieved to 300 ≥ dp ≥ 400 μm and 600 ≥ dp ≥ 700 μm and evaluated in a reactor under a N2 flowrate at 50, 100 and 150 ml/min, and heating rates (β) of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C/min from 25 to 700 °C. Results show that ORC were: 300 ≥ dp ≥ 400 μm, 150 ml/min and β = 25 °C/min, for both species. Kinetic study of the pyrolysis shown an Ea = 153.6 kJ/mol for PC and 200.51 kJ/mol for QS, respectively and n = 1 for both species. Preliminary thermodynamic analysis of steam reforming and CO2 absorption (Na2ZrO3) of bio-oil resulted in a maximum of 98.57% hydrogen production. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (PCR) were used to detect the archaeal community structure and the levels of four TRGs: tet(M), tet(Q), tet(W), and tet(C). The results showed that anaerobic co-digestion with OTC at concentrations of 60, 100, and 140 mg/kg (dry weight of pig manure) reduced the cumulative biogas production levels by 9.9%, 10.4%, and 14.1%, respectively, compared with that produced by the control, which lacked the antibiotic. The addition of OTC substantially modified the structure of the archaeal community. Two orders were identified by phylogenetic analysis, that is, Pseudomonadales and Methanomicrobiales, and the methanogen present during anaerobic co-digestion with OTC may have been resistant to OTC. The abundances of tet(Q) and tet(W) genes increased as the OTC concentration increased, whereas the abundances of tet(M) and tet(C) genes decreased as the OTC concentration increased. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to evaluate the bioenergy and bio-based material recovery from fruit scraps through an innovative process, e.g., supercritical water gasification, which presents several advantages in comparison to the traditional processes for energy and matter recovery. In particular, experimental tests of peach scraps were carried out using bench-scale plant plug flow reactor type, in which the selected liquid matter can be pumped until 300 bar and heated until 600°C to achieve the supercritical water condition of the water. The main results showed that, in the range of the feed flow rate of 5-30 mL/min and at fixed operative conditions of T and P (T = 550°C, and P = 250 bar), it is possible to obtain tar-free syngas with a higher heating value of 14-16 MJ/kgdry basis. The influence of the residence time was studied for the gaseous and liquid phases. For each one of them, it was possible to highlight a specific trend. In the liquid phase, the main components were acetic acid, hydroquinone, and syringaldehyde that are intermediates for the chemical synthesis of interesting bio-based chemicals and biochemicals. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biorefineries are increasingly important commercial facilities for the production of biofuels, biopower and various biomaterials from biomass with potentials to displace several existing industries currently based on polluting and finite fossil resources. Biorefinery systems consist of biorefinery facilities and their entire value chain. Integration of biorefinery systems aims at optimising the use of energies and materials in the total chain from biomass plantations to end product utilisation and is therefore capable of successfully improving economic viability and sustainability of biorefineries. Total Chain Integration can minimise capital and operating expenditures, maximise the quality, quantity and value of biorefinery bioproducts as well as minimise environmental impacts and maximise societal benefits. In order to efficiently perform Total Chain Integration advanced holistic software tools dedicated to biorefinery systems need to be developed. This review study systematically analyses Total Chain Integration of sustainable biorefinery systems. Existing knowledge is systematised by characterising system boundaries, principles, and integration methodologies. Further, approaches used in integration of biorefinery systems are defined and their implementation is briefly illustrated by case studies. Finally, state-of-the-art software tools for biorefinery integration are analysed and the requirements of a software tool for Total Chain Integration are provided. The review findings show that in order to develop truly economically viable and sustainable biorefinery systems tight integration is required. Essential integration approaches include integration of platforms, exchanging wastes and products with other industries, applying more efficient conversion routes, effective ways of enlarging feedstocks base, providing ecosystem and social services, and optimising biomass supply chain. Total Chain Integration requires software tools accounting for technical, economic, environmental and societal optimisation objectives within all system boundaries and the whole life cycle. The requirements of such software are proposed. Software enhanced Total Chain Integration has a potential to successfully achieve economic viability and sustainability of biorefinery systems in the business practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current assessments of the environmental performance of biofuel chains are fraught by a large degree of variability and uncertainty arising from differences in life cycle inventory data for the feedstock production stage, notably crop yields and emissions of reactive nitrogen. This study sets out to improve the accuracy of these data by combining agro-ecosystem modelling and agronomic survey data, in the context of biodiesel production from winter oilseed rape in France. Crop yields and environmental emissions related to crop farming were simulated over the 2010–2030 time period in 8 administrative regions accounting for most of winter oilseed rape production, and the results were fed into a life cycle assessment (LCA) of biodiesel. The effects of changes in climate scenarios and the improvement of fertilization practices were also examined. Compared to the widely used methodology based on fixed emissions factors, ecosystem modelling led to 29–41% lower estimates for direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, depending on climate scenarios, which emphasizes the importance of taking local factors into account. The life cycle GHG emissions of biodiesel from winter oilseed rape varied starkly across the studied regions, from 20.6 to 25.7 g CO2 eq MJ−1 and from 22.9 to 32.4 g CO2 eq MJ−1 depending on climate scenarios. Overall, biodiesel deployment would abate GHG emissions by 65–78% compared to fossil diesel, not accounting for land use changes effects. Improved fertilization practices mitigated the LCA impact indicators by 3–14%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

The advanced micro-bio-loop operates under sunlight to produce a continuous stream of biogas without requiring any additional external input or internal output to its surrounds. In comparison to conventional biogas production process, it achieves a net positive energy balance at remarkably different level of 0.0224 kWh MJ−1, with less than 33% of environmental impacts, less than 0.57% of water demand, only 7.35% arable land-use and 0.041% of labor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There has been sustained interest from both environmental regulators and livestock associations to expand the use of anaerobic digester (AD) technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, the generally profitable practice of codigesting off-farm organic waste could increase nitrogen and phosphorus content to the farm and exacerbate nutrient over-application concerns near large animal operations. We examine the economic feasibility of a broad set of dairy waste management systems composed of two technology groups that mitigate air and water pollution: an AD system that includes either animal waste input or combination animal/off-farm organic waste codigestion input and either compressed natural gas (CNG) or combined heat and power (CHP) output; and a filtration system that includes fiber separation, nutrient separation, and/or water recovery. We conclude that AD setups without codigestion are only economically feasible under limited conditions, but scenarios which use codigestion have the potential to contribute to nutrient over-application without nutrient separation technology. Trends for CNG and CHP match closely. Net present value (NPV) is greatest for AD with CNG scenarios. Estimated NPV for AD with CNG and environmental credits is $1.8 million and $39.7 million for dairies with 1600 and 15,000 wet cow equivalents, respectively. For these firm sizes, the addition of codigestion contributes $4.8 million and $47.3 million, respectively, to estimated NPV. Nutrient separation and water recovery both lead to decreases in scenario NPV with codigestion, but with the right policies, dairy owners may be willing to adopt AD with nutrient separation. © 2016

AB  - While Turkey is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of agricultural goods, it is also, at the same time a net importer of energy carriers. This dichotomy offers a strong incentive to generate energy from agricultural and farming waste; something which could provide energy security for rural areas. Combined with the enhanced energy security for farming areas, the production of energy in this manner could conceivably contribute to the overall national effort to reduce the Turkey's carbon footprint. This study explores the environmental benefits and burdens of one such option, that is, biogas production from a mixture of agricultural and animal waste through anaerobic digestion (AD), and its subsequent use for electricity and heat generation. A life-cycle assessment methodology was used, to measure the potential environmental impact of this option, in terms of global warming and total weighed impact, and to contrast it with the impact of producing the same amount of energy via an integrated gasification combined cycle process and a hard coal power plant. This study concentrates on an AD and cogeneration pilot plant, built in the Kocaeli province of Turkey and attempts to evaluate its potential environmental impacts. The study uses laboratory-scale studies, as well as literature and LCI databases to derive the operational parameters, yield and emissions of the plant. The potential impacts were calculated with EDIP 2003 methodology, using GaBi 5 LCA software. The results indicate that N2O emissions, resulting from the application of liquid and solid portions of digestate (a by-product of AD), as an organic fertilizer, are by far the largest contributors to global warming among all the life cycle stages. They constitute 68% of the total, whereas ammonia losses from the same process are the leading cause of terrestrial eutrophication. The photochemical ozone formation potential is significantly higher for the cogeneration phase, compared to other life cycle stages of the proposed scenario, due to NOx being emitted from the gas engine during combustion. Overall, the total environmental impact of the option was determined to be ten times lower than that of a hard coal option and 50% lower than the gasification option, since the latter does not generate digestate that is able to replace mineral fertilizer, thus mitigating the environmental footprint. Finally, the sustainability of energy production from agricultural and farm waste, via AD, was further enhanced by eliminating it from conventional waste management system practiced in the region, i.e. landfilling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assesses the environmental sustainability of electricity production through anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and organic wastes. The analysis relies on primary data from a biogas plant, supplemented with data from the literature. The climate impact assessment includes emissions of near-term climate forcers (NTCFs) like ozone precursors and aerosols, which are frequently overlooked in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and the application of a suite of different emission metrics, based on either the Global Warming Potential (GWP) or the Global Temperature change Potential (GTP) with a time horizon (TH) of 20 or 100 years. The environmental performances of the biogas system are benchmarked against a conventional fossil fuel system. We also investigate the sensitivity of the system to critical parameters and provide five different scenarios in a sensitivity analysis. Hotspots are the management of the digestate (mainly due to the open storage) and methane (CH4) losses during the anaerobic co-digestion. Results are sensitive to the type of climate metric used. The impacts range from 52 up to 116 g CO2-eq./MJ electricity when using GTP100 and GWP20, respectively. This difference is mostly due to the varying contribution from CH4 emissions. The influence of NTCFs is about 6% for GWP100 (worst case), and grows up to 31% for GWP20 (best case). The biogas system has a lower performance than the fossil reference system for the acidification and particulate matter formation potentials. We argue for an active consideration of NTCFs in LCA and a critical reflection over the climate metrics to be used, as these aspects can significantly affect the final outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brackish water is a good choice for algae cultivation in achieving simultaneous biological desalination and biodiesel production. Scenedesmus obliquus was cultured in BG-11 medium of varying salinities (1.2, 2.8, 4.8, 6.8 and 8.8 g L− 1 NaCl) for 16 days. The growth rate decreased as salinity increased. The sedimentation efficiency (60 min) was almost the same (77%–83%) in all treatments except for algae treated with 8.8 g L− 1 NaCl, the value of which was 54%. The highest lipid content of 21% was observed in the sample treated with 8.8 g L− 1 NaCl compared with 16% in the control. The desalinization rate and removal of NaCl increased significantly as salinity rose. The lipid content increased with increasing salinity but lipid production decreased with increasing NaCl addition because of growth inhibition caused by salt stress. The optimum initial NaCl concentration was not confirmed but an initial NaCl concentration of 4.8 g L− 1 is the acceptable concentration for the treatment. Under these conditions, lipid production was about 100 mg L− 1 and the removal of NaCl reached 1.0 g L− 1. Our results indicated that it is possible to achieve simultaneous biological desalination and lipid production using brackish water. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cultivation of seaweed as a feedstock for third generation biofuels is gathering interest in Europe, however, many questions remain unanswered in practise, notably regarding scales of operation, energy returns on investment (EROI) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, all of which are crucial to determine commercial viability. This study performed an energy and GHG emissions analysis, using EROI and GHG savings potential respectively, as indicators of commercial viability for two systems: the Swedish Seafarm project's seaweed cultivation (0.5 ha), biogas and fertilizer biorefinery, and an estimation of the same system scaled up and adjusted to a cultivation of 10 ha. Based on a conservative estimate of biogas yield, neither the 0.5 ha case nor the up-scaled 10 ha estimates met the (commercial viability) target EROI of 3, nor the European Union Renewable Energy Directive GHG savings target of 60% for biofuels, however the potential for commercial viability was substantially improved by scaling up operations: GHG emissions and energy demand, per unit of biogas, was almost halved by scaling operations up by a factor of twenty, thereby approaching the EROI and GHG savings targets set, under beneficial biogas production conditions. Further analysis identified processes whose optimisations would have a large impact on energy use and emissions (such as anaerobic digestion) as well as others embodying potential for further economies of scale (such as harvesting), both of which would be of interest for future developments of kelp to biogas and fertilizer biorefineries. © 2016

AB  - The degradation of conventional diesel (D), synthetic diesel (Syntroleum), and pure fish biodiesel (B100) by indigenous microbes was investigated in laboratory microcosms containing contaminated sand. The fate of volatiles and the influence of volatilization on degradation rates were examined by placing activated carbon (AC) in microcosm headspaces to sorb volatiles. Three AC regimes were compared: no activated carbon (NAC), regular weekly AC change (RAC), and frequent AC change (FAC), where the frequency of activated carbon exchange declined from daily to weekly. Generally, the alternative fuels were biodegraded faster than diesel fuel. Hydrocarbon mineralization percentages for the different fuel types over 28 days were between 23% (D) and 48% (B100) in the absence of activated carbon, decreased to 12% (D) – 37% (B100) with weekly AC exchange, and were further reduced to 9–22% for more frequent AC change. Sorption of volatiles to AC lowered their availability as a substrate for microbes, reducing respiration. Volatilization was negligible for the biodiesel. A mass balance for the carbon initially present as hydrocarbons in microcosms with activated carbon in the head space was on average 92% closed, with 45–70% remaining in the soil after 4 weeks, 9–37% mineralized and up to 12% volatilized. Based on nutrient consumption, up to 29% of the contaminants were likely converted into biomass. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study introduces a new approach to estimate biomethane market potential by analysing biogas markets and their relative environmental and economic advantages. This potential is then combined with greenhouse gas emission values for different feedstock shares (farm-fed and waste-fed systems) and different application share to determine the possible contribution of biomethane to national greenhouse gas emission saving goals. Markets that are considered are Germany and the UK being the biggest emitters of CO2eq in the European Union. The current use was compared with the scenarios (i) market projection, derived from literature study and (ii) reasonable potential, derived from environmental and economic calculations. The current market status is presented to show the past market development until the present date and associated greenhouse gas savings. Additionally the potential of biomethane to contribute to greenhouse gas emission savings is extensively described. Results indicate that the share of application in Germany is more environmental beneficial than the one in the UK achieving higher greenhouse gas savings at comparable feed-in level. In contrast, the UK has a higher share of waste-fed systems to produce biomethane. The use of biomethane in CHP plants achieves the highest GHG emission savings and if organic waste is used as feedstock the possible savings are even higher. With an increase of biomethane used in CHP plants and a decrease of biomethane used for direct heating the savings in the UK could increase up to 52%. Current savings of 2446 kt CO2eq (Germany) and 606 kt CO2eq (UK) can be extended to 4483 kt CO2eq (Germany) and 1443 kt CO2eq (UK) respectively. Scenario results were determined based on the environmental and economic advantageousness development of the existing biogas market. In this way positive future market development as well as improved shares of feedstock and application can contribute to further greenhouse gas emission savings of Germany and the UK. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment is an essential step in the formation of liquid biofuels. Switchgrass and miscanthus were pretreated using calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide at an equivalent hydroxyl concentration (0.46 g OH−/g dry biomass), at a solids content of 40%, and two temperatures (25 and 50 °C) for seven days. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin composition before and after pretreatment were quantified according to the standard procedures developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. After pretreatment, enzyme hydrolysis was performed at 50 °C in a shaking incubator with an enzyme loading of 60 FPU/g cellulose. Potassium and sodium hydroxide led to the largest reduction in lignin of between 30–47% with the two feedstocks and two temperature levels. Calcium hydroxide had a significantly lower amount of delignification of between 13–21%. Sodium and potassium hydroxide had a similar maximum reaction rate, except for switchgrass pretreated at 50 °C where the reaction rate was lower for potassium hydroxide. Cellulose conversion was the highest for sodium and potassium hydroxide and varied between 56.1 and 80.5% for both feedstocks at the two pretreatment temperatures investigated. Calcium hydroxide demonstrated a significantly lower cellulose conversion that varied between 23.0 and 44.9%. The results indicated that with an equivalent molar basis of OH−, potassium and sodium hydroxide had superior performance relative to calcium hydroxide in a high solids environment. © 2016

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel produced by transesterification of triacylglicerides (TAG) contained in vegetable oils and animal fats, to yield alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerin. Methanol is the main transesterification agent employed resulting in FAME (fatty acid methyl esters), which is primarily obtained from natural gas reforming (fossil source). Substitution of methanol by ethanol produces FAEE (fatty acid ethyl esters) and has the potential to render biodiesel a fully renewable fuel. Although renewability is a significant driving force for the proposed alcohol replacement, environmental performance of the alternative transesterification is questioned. The answer is herein sought through a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the two production chains. The study tracks CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, water and resources consumption, and environmental impacts (Acidification Potential – AP, Global Warming Potential – GWP, Eutrophication Potential – EP, and Human Toxicity Potential – TP). The boundaries of the biodiesel production chains extend from the extraction of raw-materials to its final use as transportation fuel in buses, applied to the Brazilian scenario. Results show that substitution of the methylic route with the ethylic route does not attribute significant environmental benefits. Furthermore, the ethylic route presents competitive advantages only in the category of GWP, and exhibits inferior performance in the remaining evaluated impact categories. Finally, a greater consumption of water and energy in the ethylic route in comparison with the methylic route is reported. Contrarily to a first judgement, the use of bioethanol as transesterification agent does not enforce sustainability of the biodiesel production chain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel generic sequential input–output framework is developed to model the economy-wide changes in resource consumption and environmental emissions as a result of combined applied energy policies, e.g. taxes for non-renewables and subsidies for renewables. Many input–output analyses are based on a single period analysis. However, in the case of analyzing the effects of multiple policy interventions over time, the input–output table reflecting the state of the economy before the energy policy was introduced cannot be used for analyzing the economic effects of another policy intervention in the next time period since the monetary and physical transaction of commodities have already been affected. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, a case study is developed that introduced a gasoline tax and earmarks the revenues to subsidize biofuel production in the subsequent time period in the United States. In order to assess the change of environmental indicators after sequential policy interventions, Ecologically-based Life Cycle Analysis (ECO-LCA) inventories which include data on resource consumption, emissions, ecosystem goods and services related to the U.S. economic sectors are adopted. The environmentally extended input–output framework is ideally suited to model the interlinkages between a range for environmental indicators and detailed structural economic information at the sector level for the analysis of energy policies. The proposed framework can be utilized as a tool for leveraging the energy and environmental policy trade-off decisions which consider the impacts to resource consumption and environmental emissions. Our results show that, if a share of the gasoline tax revenue is reinvested to subsidize biofuel production, economy wide resource consumptions and emissions from the fossil fuel related supply chains will decrease. However, ecosystem goods and services such as soil erosion, water consumption for agricultural and livestock, cropland, nitrogen deposition along with the emissions such as nitrous oxide and ammonia will increase in short term as a consequence of the price drop and the increased demand for biofuels. This emphasizes the importance of focusing on a wide range of environmental outcomes and unintended side effects when introducing a specific environmental policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research and development for biobased chemical production has become a strategic priority in many countries, due to the widespread availability of renewable feedstocks and the potential for reduced life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy use compared to petrochemicals. These environmental benefits are not assured, however, as a multiplicity of processing features (i.e., biofeedstock, conversion platform, and energy/solvent recovery) and life cycle modeling factors (i.e., coproducts, allocation scheme, study scope, and location) influence the overall GHG emissions and energy use of a biobased chemical production scheme. Consequently, there has been high variability in reported environmental impacts of biobased chemical production across prior life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. This meta-analysis considered 34 priority biobased chemicals across 86 discrete LCA case studies. Most biobased chemicals exhibited reduced GHG emissions and net energy use compared to petrochemical counterparts, with exceptions including p-xylene, acetic acid, and adipic acid. Seven priority biobased chemicals had no reported results, predominantly lignin-derived. GHG emissions reductions were compared against proposed thresholds from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), and those applied to U.S. biofuels under the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2) program. ANCOVA and ANOVA statistical tests were utilized to identify process and life cycle modeling factors that contribute significantly to environmental metrics. Conversion platform was found to be a statistically significant (α = 0.1) factor for GHG emissions, with thermochemical routes having the highest emissions results, while LCA coproduct allocation scheme was significant for nonrenewable energy use. Recommendations for harmonizing and prioritizing future work are discussed. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the 5 years since the 2010 Ajka red mud spill (Hungary), there have been 46 scientific studies assessing the key risks and impacts associated with the largest single release of bauxite-processing residue (red mud) to the environment. These studies have provided insight into the main environmental concerns, as well as the effectiveness of remedial efforts that can inform future management of red mud elsewhere. The key immediate risks after the spill were associated with the highly caustic nature of the red mud slurry and fine particle size, which once desiccated, could generate fugitive dust. Studies on affected populations showed no major hazards identified beyond caustic exposure, while red mud dust risks were considered equal to or lesser than those provided by urban dusts of similar particle size distribution. The longer-term environmental risks were related to the saline nature of the spill material (salinization of inundated soils) and the release and the potential cycling of oxyanion-forming metals and metalloids (e.g., Al, As, Cr, Mo, and V) in the soil–water environment. Of these, those that are soluble at high pH, inefficiently removed from solution during dilution and likely to be exchangeable at ambient pH are of chief concern (e.g., Mo and V). Various ecotoxicological studies have identified negative impacts of red mud-amended soils and sediments at high volumes (typically >5 %) on different test organisms, with some evidence of molecular-level impacts at high dose (e.g., genotoxic effects on plants and mice). These data provide a valuable database to inform future toxicological studies for red mud. However, extensive management efforts in the aftermath of the spill greatly limited these exposure risks through leachate neutralization and red mud recovery from the affected land. Monitoring of affected soils, stream sediments, waters and aquatic biota (fungi, invertebrates and fish) have all shown a very rapid recovery toward prespill conditions. The accident also prompted research that has also highlighted potential benefits of red mud use for critical raw material recovery (e.g., Ga, Co, V, rare earths, inform), carbon sequestration, biofuel crop production, and use as a soil ameliorant. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The field of energy policy is concerned with the promotion of energy production systems and consumption patterns that enhance socio-economic well-being, energy efficiency, environmental protection, and equitable access. It is increasingly recognized that the attainment of sustainable energy systems requires a transformation from the current system, characterized by the dominance of fossil fuels, toward an alternative system that accommodates renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, modern biomass, and small-scale hydropower. Renewable energy sources offer several advantages, including environmental friendliness, diversity, security, and opportunities for local community involvement through decentralized management. Yet the process of transition toward alternative energy supply sources has been slow. Using theoretical insights from research on resilience in social-ecological systems, this paper argues for an adaptive governance approach to enhancing the transition toward sustainable and resilient energy systems in sub-Saharan Africa in the face of the uncertainties and conflicts that characterize the energy transition process. © 2016, © 2016 Kamla-Raj.

AB  - Camelina sativa L., also known as Camelina or false flax, is an oil seed crop that has been introduced to South Dakota primarily for biofuel production. Camelina contains 30 to 40% oil by seed weight and performs well on marginal land (Moser 2010). The oil from camelina has been found to be of high combustible value that can be used as a jet fuel and the byproduct contains high protein for animal feedstuff (Moser 2010). The crop has potential as a rotational crop in central and western South Dakota. During the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons, Camelina plants (cultivar S0-40) exhibiting symptoms typical of aster yellows infection were observed in a 10-acre demonstration plot at the Dakota Lakes Research Farm in Hughes County, SD (44°17′35″ N, 100°00′24″ W) and in research plots at the South Dakota State University Felt Research Farm (44°18′37″ N, 96°40′25″ W) and Aurora Research Farm (44°22′09″ N, 96°47′19″ W). Symptoms included shoot proliferation, stunted growth, phyllody, proliferation of axillary shoots, and fewer or lack of pods. Plants with symptoms were less than 1% in the 10-acre field or plots. Two plants in 2015 from Dakota Lakes Research Farm, 11 plants from Felt Research Farm, and 13 plants from Aurora Research Farm in 2016 with severe symptoms were taken to the laboratory and DNA was extracted from each of the plants using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two asymptomatic plants (each from Felt and Aurora Research Farms) also had DNA extracted. DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using the primer pair R16F2n (GAAACGACTGCTAAGACTGG) and R16R2 (TGACGGGCGGTGTGTACAAACCCCG) (Lee et al. 1994) derived from phytoplasma rDNA sequences. PCR products of expected size (1,200 bp) were obtained from all symptomatic plants and were sequenced. No PCR products were obtained from the asymptomatic samples. A BLASTN search showed that the sequences obtained were 100% similar to the sequence of cabbage stunting phytoplasma strain Gr-C1 from Brassica oleracea (accession no. HE601634) and phyllody phytoplasma isolate RzMal3 from B. napus (JN193482). The sequences for the Dakota Lakes Research Farm sample were submitted to NCBI (KT878541). The iPhyClassifier software, which performs virtual random fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and generates a virtual gel for phytoplasma isolates (Zhao et al. 2009), was used to classify the isolate from the 10-acre field. The closest match of our isolate based on the results from iPhyClasssifier had a similarity coefficient of 0.53 to the reference Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris of subgroup D (AY265206), which was less than 0.85, the cutoff coefficient to belong to the same subgroup. This suggests that this isolate from Camelina may belong to a new subgroup. Aster yellows phytoplasma, in general, is transmitted by leaf hoppers (Macrosteles spp.) in several host plants including many broadleaf weeds, grains, and grasses (Frost et al. 2013). In South Dakota, aster yellows could be a concern for Camelina production in years of high leaf hopper activity and could produce negative effects on the crop which includes poor or no seed set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of aster yellows on Camelina in South Dakota. © 2016, American Phytopathological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - What are second-generation (2G) biofuel technologies worth to global society? A dynamic, economic model is used to assess the impact that introducing 2G biofuels technology has on crops, livestock, biofuels, forestry, and environmental services, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Under baseline conditions, this amounts to $64 billion and is $84 billion under the optimistic technology case, suggesting that investing in 2G technology could be appropriate. Under greenhouse gas regulation, global valuation more than doubles to $139 and $174 billion, respectively. A flat energy price scenario eliminates the value of2G technology to society. © 2015.

AB  - Long-term contracts are likely to be critical to induce the production of perennial energy crops as a feedstock for the emerging cellulosic biofuel industry. This paper develops a framework to analyze the determinants of landowner choice among a land-leasing contract, a fixed-price contract, and a revenue-sharing contract for energy crop production. We examine the effect of heterogeneous landowners' risk and time preferences and land quality on the optimal mix and equilibrium terms of these contracts, which jointly maximize the net benefits of the refinery and landowners in a region; this has implications for the extent to which energy crop production is likely to be vertically integrated or independently contracted by a biorefinery. We find that the refinery can potentially earn a higher profit by offering a choice of these three types of contracts rather than a single type of con-tract only; by allowing self-selection of contract type based on landowner risk and time preferences, the contractual terms needed to induce production of energy crops are reduced. Although it is optimal for vertically-integrated and contracted production to co-exist, we find that the share of the former is predominant across a range of assumptions about the distribution of risk preferences, time preferences, and relative riskiness of conventional and energy crop production. We also find that the impact of having multiple contract types to choose from on landowners' welfare is ambiguous. © 2015. Oxford University Agricultural and Applied Economics Association.

AB  - Key message: Multivariate mixed models can be used to combine complex data into a single-step analysis to improve prediction accuracy of open-pollinated seed lots for all attributes and candidates, and identify elite seed lots. Context: Data available for genetic selection may be complex and unbalanced; however, utilisation of all available information for prediction of genetic value may improve prediction accuracy to better identify elite candidates for selection. Aims: This study aimed to develop, implement and evaluate a single-step multivariate mixed model for complex and unbalanced data and use the results to identify elite candidates. Methods: Multivariate mixed models were developed and applied to a case study of seed-orchard open-pollinated Eucalyptus dunnii families grown in progeny trials in Australia and Uruguay to identify elite seed lots for biofuel utilisation. This approach combined all available data across trials and ages and included models of spatial variation to predict OP seed lot values for growth and wood quality attributes. Predictions were used to estimate response to selection and correlations between breeding values of parents predicted from their own performance and seed lot values predicted from the progeny trials. Results: Prediction accuracy was highest for a single-step multivariate model. Prediction of seed lot values using this model indicated that selection of the best 12.5 % resulted in a gain of 30 % in cellulose content, and breeding value of parents predicted from own performance was only weakly correlated with seed lot performance in progeny trials. Conclusion: Single-step multivariate approaches provide the most accurate prediction of genetic value for all attributes, for all candidates, and hence leads to greater selection response. In eucalypts, gain from selection using seed lot values predicted from progeny trials will be greater than from selection using breeding values of parents predicted from their own performance. © 2016, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Hemicelluloses are the earth's second most abundant structural polymers, found in lignocellulosic biomass. Efficient enzymatic depolymerization of xylans by cleaving their β-(1 → 4)-glycosidic bonds to produce soluble sugars is instrumental to the cost-effective production of liquid biofuels. Here we show that the multi-scale two-phase process of enzymatic hydrolysis of amorphous hemicelluloses is dominated by its smallest scale-the pores. In the crucial first five hours, two to fourfold swelling of the xylan particles allow the enzymes to enter the pores and undergo rapid non-equilibrium adsorption on the pore surface before they hydrolyze the solid polymers, albeit non-competitively inhibited by the products xylose and xylobiose. Rapid pore-scale reactive dissolution increases the solid carbohydrate's porosity to 80-90%. This tightly coupled experimental and theoretical study quantifies the complex temporal dynamics of the transport and reaction processes coupled across scales and phases to show that this unique pore-scale phenomenon can be exploited to accelerate the depolymerization of hemicelluloses to monomeric sugars in the first 5-6 h. We find that an 'optimal substrate loading' of 5 mg/ml (above which substrate inhibition sets in) accelerates non-equilibrium enzyme adsorption and solid hemicellulose depolymerization at the pore-scale, which contributes three-quarters of the soluble sugars produced for bio-alcohol fermentation. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The extraction of natural resources often involves housing workers in remote work camps far from population centres. These camps are prevalent in northern Alberta where they house approximately 40,000 workers involved in oil sands processing. The central, full-service cafeterias at these camps produce a significant quantity of food and cardboard waste. Due to their remote nature, these camps face high waste disposal costs associated with trucking waste long distances to the landfill. In this study, we investigated the techno-economic feasibility of on-site treatment of food and cardboard waste in a tandem dry batch, garage-style anaerobic digestion-compost process in which the waste material is converted into renewable energy used to heat the camp water supply and a nutrient-rich soil amendment for local land reclamation projects. Dry batch digestion and windrow composting pilot trials were performed on a simulated work camp waste in order to assess technical performance. The quality of the final compost was found to meet regulatory standards. A complete mass balance was then developed for a facility treating 3000 tonnes food waste and 435 tonnes waste cardboard annually. An economic assessment of such a facility was performed and, depending on the level of capital support and recognition of carbon credits for landfill methane mitigation, would require waste disposal costs to be between $115 and $195 CAD per tonne to meet financial criteria for project selection in Alberta's oil and gas industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater treatment using microalgae is an eco-friendly process without secondary pollution. During the process, the wastewater produced is reused, which allows efficient nutrient recycling. This review provides constructive information to enable progress of competent technology for microalgae based productions in palm oil mill effluent (POME). The characteristics of POME that will be described in this paper would be a source of pollution in water if discharged directly. Since microalgae have great potential to be isolated and cultivated in POME, previous studies to improve POME based culture media are still limited. Microalgae are highly competent in diminishing CO2 emissions and reducing the organic components in POME. In conclusion, biological treatments by using microalgae discussed in this paper and the lipid production from microalgae biomass can be used as an alternative for energy production. The POME treatment with microalgae may meet the standards or limits before being discharged into the water body. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Proponents of Jatropha curcas portrayed the crop as a ‘sustainable biofuel’ that was less threatening to food security and forests than other energy crops, creating a reputation that helped jatropha projects to multiply quickly throughout the global South. However, many jatropha initiatives failed to thrive and ultimately collapsed. This paper investigates how actors involved with jatropha in Kenya explained their visions of bioenergy at two points in time. In 2009, when many activities were beginning, I interviewed small-scale farmers, NGO staff, researchers, donors, government officials and members of the private sector about their expectations of jatropha as an energy crop. In late 2013, after jatropha activities in the country had dwindled, I re-interviewed many of the same individuals about their current views and their explanations of the events that had transpired since the initial fieldwork. Synthesizing these two sets of representations provides insight into how biofuel projects have been constructed, negotiated and renegotiated. Early hopes for jatropha rested on the belief that it could achieve many goals simultaneously, but when it failed to meet expectations proponents chose between two strategies: (1) ‘unbundling’ these goals to pursue separately the various aspirations they had initially attached to jatropha; and (2) seeking a new means of achieving the same bundle of goals. Understanding the choices made by jatropha actors in Kenya contributes to knowledge on the political ecology of biofuels and responsible innovation, and may signal patterns to come as even greater expectations are attached to multi-use feedstocks in pursuit of the bioeconomy. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - This study presents a technoeconomic analysis of commercial extraction of camelina oil as an aviation fuel feedstock. An engineering economic model was designed in Superpro Designer® to quantify capital investment, scale, production cost, and profitability for a 120,000–1,500,000 tonnes annum−1 solvent extraction plant. The corresponding estimated capital investment was $24.7 - $155 million. Feedstock cost ($0.29–0.40 kg−1), seed yield (1400–2100 kg ha−1), oil content (38–47%), scale, and camelina meal revenue are key factors in the break-even selling price (BESP) and competitiveness of camelina oil as a feedstock. Feedstock represented 81–90% of operating cost. The BESP ranges from $0.43 -$1.22 L-1. Larger plants have lower BESP compared to smaller plants which require higher breakeven prices. This suggests better economies of scale associated with higher plant scale. Camelina can be introduced into underutilized summerfallow land of semiarid Canadian Prairies of Saskatchewan. Swift Current is an ideal extraction plant location. These results can guide R&amp;D and investment decisions for advancing camelina as an industrial feedstock within the innovation value chain. © 2016

AB  - Intensively-managed pine (Pinus spp.) have been shown to support diverse vertebrate communities, but their ability to support invertebrate communities, such as wild bees, has not been well-studied. Recently, researchers have examined intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a native perennial, within intensively managed loblolly pine (P. taeda) plantations as a potential source for cellulosic biofuels. To better understand potential effects of intercropping on bee communities, we investigated visitation of bees within three replicates of four treatments of loblolly pine in Mississippi, U.S.A.: 3-4 year old pine plantations and 9-10 year old pine plantations with and without intercropped switchgrass. We used colored pan traps to capture bees during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. We captured 2507 bees comprised of 18 different genera during the two-year study, with Lasioglossum and Ceratina being the most common genera captured. Overall, bee abundances were dependent on plantation age and not presence of intercropping. Our data suggests that switchgrass does not negatively impact or promote bee communities within intensively-managed loblolly pine plantations. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Study region The proposed assessment framework is aimed at application in Sub-Saharan Africa, but could also be applied in other hydrologically data scarce regions. The test study site was the Rokel-Seli River catchment, Sierra Leone, West Africa. Study focus We propose a simple, transferable water assessment framework that allows the use of global climate datasets in the assessment of water availability and crop demand in data scarce catchments. In this study, we apply the assessment framework to the catchment of the Rokel-Seli River in Sierra Leone to investigate the capabilities of global datasets complemented with limited historical data in estimating water resources of a river basin facing rising demands from large scale agricultural water withdrawals. We demonstrate how short term river flow records can be extended using a lumped hydrological model, and then use a crop water demand model to generate irrigation water demands for a large irrigated biofuels scheme abstracting from the river. The results of using several different global datasets to drive the assessment framework are compared and the performance evaluated against observed rain and flow gauge records. New hydrological insights We find that the hydrological model capably simulates both low and high flows satisfactorily, and that all the input datasets consistently produce similar results for water withdrawal scenarios. The proposed framework is successfully applied to assess the variability of flows available for abstraction against agricultural demand. The assessment framework conclusions are robust despite the different input datasets and calibration scenarios tested, and can be extended to include other global input datasets. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - After a ban on the depositing of untreated sludge in landfills, the sludge from municipal and industrial water-treatment plants can be regarded as a problem. Waste products of the water treatment process can be a problem or an opportunity - a source for obtaining raw materials. In the European Union, raw sludge and fats, oil and grease (FOG) from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) cannot be deposited in any natural or controlled environment. For this reason, it must be processed (stabilized, dried) to be used later as a fertilizer, building material, or alternative fuel source suitable for co-incineration in high temperature furnaces (power plants or concrete plants). The processes of drying sludge, where heat and electricity are used, are energy consuming and economically unattractive. Beside energy efficiency, the main problem of sludge drying is in its variability of quality as a raw material. In addition to this, sludge can be contaminated by a number of organic and inorganic pollutants and organisms. Due to the presence or absence of pollutants, different end products can be economically interesting. For example, if the dried sludge contains coliform bacteria, viruses, helminths eggs or smaller quantities of heavy metals, it cannot be used as a fertilizer but can still be used as a fuel. The objectives of the current article is to present a batch-processing pilot device of sludge or digestate that allows the following: (1) low pressure and low temperature energy effective drying of from 10 to 40% remaining water content, (2) disinfection of pathogen (micro)organisms, (3) heavy metal reduction, (4) production of products of predetermined quality (e.g. containing different quantities of water; it can be used as a fertilizer, or if the percentage of water in the dry sludge is decreased to 10%, then the dried sludge can be used as a fuel with a calorific value similar to coal). An important feature is also the utilization of low-pressure technology to prevent odorous gasses from spreading into the environment. There are presented two new technologies: a) Sewage sludge or digestate drying in the vacuum chamber consumes approx. 1 kWh/dm3 of evaporated water and, therefore, reaches a price of 180–240 Euros/t Dry Matter (DM), and b) Heavy metals' reduction using adsorbing reaction with magnetite nanostructures can decrease the level of heavy metals in the sewage sludge or digestate up to 20% in one cycle, which can be repeated several times on the same sludge. The aim of the paper is to present a newly developed technology which can provide economic and safe use of moderate heavy metals polluted sewage sludge on agricultural lands as organic fertilizer and, therefore, returning the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) back to the human food chain, instead of being incinerated or landfilled. The proposed drying technology is economically sustainable due to the low vacuum and temperature (35 °C–40 °C), that increases the efficiency of the heat pump (coefficient of performance 5–7,2) of the energy produced by the anaerobic digestion. Hence, the main emphasis is given to the development of: an efficient method for heavy metals' reduction in the sludge treatment chain by using chitosan covered magnetite nanoparticles, an efficient drying method in a vacuum with low temperature energy which can be exploited from sludge digestion to reduce organic matter, and an energy sustainable concept of sludge treatment, with the addition of fats, oil and grease (FOG) to produce enough biogas for sludge drying to produce fertilizer. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metatranscriptomics provides an opportunity to identify active microbes and expressed genes in complex soil communities in response to particular conditions. Currently, there are a limited number of soil metatranscriptome studies to provide guidance for using this approach in this challenging matrix. Hence, we evaluated the technical challenges of applying soil metatranscriptomics to a highly diverse, low activity natural system. We used a non-targeted rRNA removal approach, duplex nuclease specific (DSN) normalization, to generate a metatranscriptomic library from field collected soil supporting a perennial grass, Miscanthus x giganteus (a biofuel crop), and evaluated its ability to provide insight into its active community members and their expressed protein-coding genes. We also evaluated various bioinformatics approaches for analyzing our soil metatranscriptome, including annotation of unassembled transcripts, de novo assembly, and aligning reads to known genomes. Further, we evaluated various databases for their ability to provide annotations for our metatranscriptome. Overall, our results emphasize that low activity, highly genetically diverse and relatively stable microbiomes, like soil, requires very deep sequencing to sample the transcriptome beyond the common core functions. We identified several key areas that metatranscriptomic analyses will benefit from including increased rRNA removal, assembly of short read transcripts, and more relevant reference bases while providing a priority set of expressed genes for functional assessment. © 2016

AB  - A tubular batch micro-reactor system was used for hydrothermal gasification (HTG) of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) as green macroalgae found in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, Iran. Non-catalytic tests were performed to determine the optimum condition for hydrogen production. Hydrochar, as a solid residue of non-catalytic HTG was characterized by BET, FESEM, and ICP-OES methods to determine its physiochemical properties. Surface area and pore volume of C. glomerata increased drastically after HTG. Also, the aqueous products were identified and quantified by GC–MS and GC-FID methods. Hydrochar was loaded to the reactor to determine its catalytic effect on HTG. HTG was promoted by inorganic compounds in the hydrochar and its porosity. The maximum hydrogen yield of 9.63 mmol/g was observed in the presence of algal hydrochar with the weight ratio of 0.4 to feedstock. Also, acids production was inhibited while phenol production was promoted in the presence of hydrochar. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Testing the quality of heavy-metal (HM) excluder plants from non-remediable metalliferous soils could help to meet the growing demands for food, forage, and industrial crops. Field cultures of the winter wheat cv. JB Asano were therefore established on re-cultivated uranium mine soil (A) and the adjacent non-contaminated soil (C). Twenty elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) from soils and plant sections of post-winter seedlings, anthesis-state, and mature plants to record within-plant levels of essential and toxic minerals during ripening and to estimate the (re)use of the soil-A herbage in husbandry and in HM-sensitive fermentations. Non-permissible HM loads (mg·kg-1·DW) of soil A in Cd, Cu, and Zn of 40.4, 261, and 2890, respectively, initiated the corresponding phytotoxic concentrations in roots and of Zn in shoots from the seedling state to maturity as well as of Cd in the foliage of seedlings. At anthesis, shoot concentrations in Ca, Cd, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn and in As, Cr, Pb, and U had fallen to a mean of 20% to increase to 46% during maturation. The respective shoot concentrations in C-grown plants diminished from anthesis (50%) to maturity (27%). They were drastically up/down-regulated at the rachis-grain interface to compose the genetically determined metallome of the grain during mineral relocations from adjacent sink tissues. Soil A caused yield losses of straw and grain down to 47.7% and 39.5%, respectively. Nevertheless, pronounced HM excluder properties made Cd concentrations of 1.6–3.08 in straw and 1.2 in grains the only factors that violated hygiene guidelines of forage (1). It is estimated that grains and the less-contaminated green herbage from soil A may serve as forage supplement. Applying soil A grains up to 3 and 12 in Cd and Cu, respectively, and the mature straw as bioenergy feedstock could impair the efficacy of ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Bio-crude from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignocellulosic biomass is a potential alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Continuous HTL of lignocellulosic biomass requires feedstock pretreatment to obtain pumpable slurries. This work extends upon previous evaluations of pretreatment methods for obtaining stable slurries of Miscanthus х giganteus. In the current study, extensive characterization of the bio-crude and aqueous phase from HTL of thermally and chemically pretreated M. х giganteus is reported and molecular differences of these samples are evaluated. The bio-crude and aqueous phase is characterized with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using pre-derivatization with silylating reagent and methyl chloroformate, respectively. Principal component analysis shows that bio-crudes of untreated and slurry stabilized samples have higher concentrations of small organic acids and fatty acids, samples pretreated at mild alkali conditions have higher concentrations of alcohols, polyaromatics, and methylated phenolics, and samples pretreated with strong alkali conditions have higher concentrations of cyclic oxygenates and ketonized aromatics. Aqueous phases are separated based on the addition of slurry stabilizer which has higher concentrations of dicarboxylic acids and phenol. The detailed exploration of both bio-crude and aqueous phase will be of interest for other investigations of the pretreatment effects on biomass for hydrothermal liquefaction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study evaluated the growth of Desmodesmus communis on column photobioreactor and its thermochemical treatment by catalytic pyrolysis using HZSM-5 zeolite. D. communis showed good results in terms of growth (0.05g L−1 d−1). Analytical pyrolysis of original algae and derived bio-oil mixed with zeolite was used as a screening method in order to gather information on the cracking process. Preparative pyrolysis on bench scale reactor was performed on algae biomass over a zeolite bed at 1:10 ratio (wt/wt). Py-GC–MS of biomass/catalyst mixture showed that the denitrogenation/deoxygenation increased with increasing zeolite load from 1:5 to 1:20 ratio and became significant at 1:10 ratio. The composition observed by analytical pyrolysis was featured by the predominance of alkylated monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The scaling-up to bench scale confirmed the results obtained with analytical pyrolysis in terms of monoaromatic hydrocarbons. However, low yield of catalytic oil (8% by weight) was observed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Industrial hemp shows exceptional potential for cellulosic ethanol production, especially regarding yields per hectare, costs and environmental impact. Additionally, co-products, such as high-value food-grade oil, increase the value of this plant. In this work, hemp straw was steam-exploded for 45 min at 155 °C and hydrolysed with a cellulase/xylanase mixture. Up to 0.79 g g−1 of cellulose was degraded and subsequent simultaneous-saccharification-and-fermentation with added triticale grist resulted in &gt;0.90 g g−1 fermentation of cellulose. Hemp straw is very suitable, as it contains 0.63 g g−1 of cellulose and only 0.142 g g−1 of hemicellulose. A 2000 m3 a−1 ethanol biorefinery requires a land use of 3 km2 each for hemp and for triticale. A total of 2630 kg ethanol and 150 kg hemp oil can be gained from 1 ha. Slurry and triticale straw serve as raw material for the biogas fermenter or as animal feed. Biogas supplies thermal and electric energy in combined heat and power. Ethanol will remain at 0.66 € dm−3 based on market prices. In addition, data have been calculated for market prices plus and minus 30% market prices (0.51–0.81 € dm−3). Carbon dioxide (CO2) abatement for ethanol achieves 121 g MJ−1 CO2eq for a combined ethanol/biogas plant. The CO2 abatement costs vary from 38 € to 262 € t−1 CO2eq. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim: Determination of the diversities and antibiotic resistances of the most abundant aerobic culturable bacteria and their survival in 15 German biogas plants (BGPs). Methods and Results: Microbiological standard media (complex and selective media) were applied to enumerate mesophilic and oligotrophic bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella, staphylococci and enterococci) in input and output samples of BGPs. Concentrations of aerobic culturable bacteria in outputs were mostly one to two orders of magnitude lower than in input samples. In total, 852 isolates from input and 902 from output samples were identified either by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing or Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. Antibiotic resistance screening of target families against veterinary relevant antibiotics resulted in similar resistance pattern in input and output samples. Conclusions: Potentially pathogenic bacteria were detected in output samples of BGPs, but in decreased abundance. The selectivity of the most applied clinical standard media was insufficient. Significance and Impact of the Study: Only little is known about the release of antibiotic resistant and potentially pathogenic bacteria from BGPs. However, this study indicates the detection of several potentially pathogenic bacteria in output samples, which showed several antibiotic resistances. © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Biogas production often competes with food and feed production for the raw materials and cropland required for cultivation. Common reed offers an alternative source of biomass for biogas production, alleviating this conflict. Effective microbiological conversion of this type of lignocellulosic biomass requires a pretreatment process. This study aims to determine the specific methane yields of steam-exploded reed as well as to identify how pretreatment conditions influence its physico-chemical characteristics. For this purpose, reed was pretreated with steam explosion at severity factors ranging from 2.47 to 4.83. The effects on methane yields were analyzed in batch experiments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured and detailed chemical analyses of the substrates carried out. Results show that the digestibility of reed biomass improved remarkably after pretreatment. Compared to the untreated sample, steam explosion increased the specific methane yield up to 89% after pretreatment at 200 °C for 15 min. However, methane yield decreased under harsher conditions, which may be due to the formation of degradation compounds during the pretreatment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The microalgae biofuels life cycle assessments (LCA) present in the literature have excluded the effects of direct land use change (DLUC) from facility construction under the assumption that DLUC effects are negligible. This study seeks to model the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of microalgae biofuels including DLUC by quantifying the CO2 equivalence of carbon released to the atmosphere through the construction of microalgae facilities. The locations and types of biomass and Soil Organic Carbon that are disturbed through microalgae cultivation facility construction are quantified using geographical models of microalgae productivity potential including consideration of land availability. The results of this study demonstrate that previous LCA of microalgae to biofuel processes have overestimated GHG benefits of microalgae-based biofuels production by failing to include the effect of DLUC. Previous estimations of microalgae biofuel production potential have correspondingly overestimated the volume of biofuels that can be produced in compliance with U.S. environmental goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jerusalem artichoke (JA) is a potential energy crop for biorefinery due to its unique agronomic traits such as resistance to environmental stresses and high biomass yield in marginal lands. Although JA tubers have been explored for inulin extraction and biofuels production, there is little concern on its stalk (JAS). In this article, the pretreatment of JAS by alkaline hydrogen peroxide was optimized using the response surface methodology to improve sugars yield and reduce chemicals usage. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were applied to characterize the structures of the pretreated JAS to evaluate the effectiveness of the pretreatment. Furthermore, the feeding of the pretreated JAS and cellulase was performed for high solid uploading (up to 30%) to increase ethanol titer, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with 55.6 g/L ethanol produced, 36.5% more than that produced through separate hydrolysis and fermentation, was validated to be more efficient. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assesses the environmental performance of biomass feedstocks, rice husk, wheat stalk, cotton stalk, sorghum stalk, and sugarcane bagasse, for ethanol production in India. The analysis calculates emergy indicators and demonstrates the dilemma in selection of biomass feedstocks for meeting the ethanol blending target decided by the biofuel policy of the Government of India. It considers spatial variability, and computes the production potential of each lignocellulosic feedstock considered in the study. Achieving high return on energy invested, high renewability, and large production rates simultaneously seems difficult for the considered feedstocks. Among these cellulosic feedstocks, rice husk shows highest renewability and ethanol production potential. Although sorghum stalk has a high return on investment, it has lowest renewability among the feedstocks considered in the study. Rice husk and cotton stalk should be targeted first to fulfil the blending demand of gasoline as they show highest renewability and quality corrected emergy return on investment, along with a high production potential. Emergy analysis of cellulosic biofuels can provide a holistic platform for decision makers for designing the biofuel policy and selection of feedstock in the Indian context. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sugarcane is a tropical crop used for sugar and biofuel production in tropical and equatorial regions of the globe. Sugarcane flowering is intrinsically induced in equatorial regions due to long-day conditions. Flower development is problematic for this crop because it halts vegetative growth, leading to a reduction of the sugar accumulated in the stalks, and significant yield loss. Notwithstanding, the identification of genes differentially expressed in contrasting cultivars can potentially reveal markers and tools to generate genotypes more suitable for expanding the geographical limits of this crop. Thus, dissecting the flowering gene expression network under field conditions is highly relevant for breeding. We report the analysis of subtractive cDNA libraries produced from shoot apical meristem of cultivars contrasting for flowering time growing in production fields under equatorial conditions. Transcripts with homology to POLYPHENOL OXIDASE (PPO), CALMODULIN (CAM), PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE/PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-TRANSFER PROTEIN (SEC14), OBTUSIFOLIOL-14-Α-DEMETHYLASE (CYP51), 14–3-3, and the phosphotransferases SHAGGY KINASE (GSK), PROTEIN KINASE C INHIBITOR (PKCI), and SERINE/THREONINE PHOSPHATASE (PP1) were identified as differentially expressed in the subtractive libraries and further chosen for RT-qPCR validation and in silico interactome analyses. Our results suggest that ScPPO, ScSEC14 and Sc14–3-3 may act as flowering inhibitors. RT-qPCR data also revealed two 14–3-3 isoforms as potential flowering markers. Sc14–3-3 was structurally and phylogenetically characterized and its genomic architecture was analysed in two BAC clones, showing that they probably correspond to two different loci with confirmed synteny to other grass genomes. This work reveals potential novel mechanisms of flowering in grasses with implications to crop breeding. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In the present study, the influence of the recently synthesized styrylquinolinium dye 4-{(E)-2-[4-(dimethylamino)naphthalen-1-yl]ethenyl}-1-methylquinolinium iodide (DANSQI) on the intracellular processes as well as the electrical outputs of Candida melibiosica 2491 yeast-based biofuel cell was investigated. The addition of nanomolar quantities of DANSQI to the yeast suspension results in an increase of the current outputs right after the startup of the biofuel cells, associated with an electrooxidation of the dye on the anode. After that, the formed cation radical of the dye penetrates the yeast cells, provoking a set of intracellular changes. Studies of the subcellular anolyte fractions show that 1 μM dye increased the peroxisomal catalase activity 30-times (1.15 ± 0.06 Unit/mg protein) and over twice the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity (92 ± 5 Unit/mg protein). The results obtained by electrochemical and spectrophotometric analyses let to the supposition that the dye acts as subcellular shuttle, on account of its specific intramolecular charge transfer properties. The transition between its benzoid, quinolyl radical and ion forms and their putative role for the extracellular and intracellular charge transfer mechanisms are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Appropriate canopy management, including planting density and pruning, and application of fertilizer may increase flowering success and seed and oil yields of Jatropha curcas L. Two field experiments were performed from 2009 to 2011 in Balaka, Malawi, to assess the effect of planting density and pruning regime and single fertilizer application (N, P, and K) on male and female flower number and seed and oil yields of J. curcas. Planting density influenced flower sex ratio and female flower number. Branch pruning treatments did not influence the flower sex ratio but reduced seed and final oil yield by 55 % in the following year. It is claimed that J. curcas can be grown on soils with low nutrient content, but this study revealed that yield was low for non-fertilized trees. We observed higher seed and oil yields at higher N application rates (up to 203 ± 42 % seed and 204 ± 45 % oil yield increase) compared with the non-fertilized control. The study suggests thatcurrently used heavy pruning practice is not recommended for J. curcas cultivation, although it needs further longer term investigation. Applying nitrogen fertilizer is effective in increasing yield. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Whilst life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries are expanded to account for negative indirect consequences of bioenergy such as indirect land use change (ILUC), ecosystem services such as water purification sometimes delivered by perennial bioenergy crops are typically neglected in LCA studies. Consequential LCA was applied to evaluate the significance of nutrient interception and retention on the environmental balance of unfertilised energy willow planted on 50-m riparian buffer strips and drainage filtration zones in the Skåne region of Sweden. Excluding possible ILUC effects and considering oil heat substitution, strategically planted filter willow can achieve net global warming potential (GWP) and eutrophication potential (EP) savings of up to 11.9 Mg CO2e and 47 kg PO4e ha−1 year−1, respectively, compared with a GWP saving of 14.8 Mg CO2e ha−1 year−1 and an EP increase of 7 kg PO4e ha−1 year−1 for fertilised willow. Planting willow on appropriate buffer and filter zones throughout Skåne could avoid 626 Mg year−1 PO4e nutrient loading to waters. © 2016, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Bioenergy crop production has the potential to protect marginal crop lands that generate high surface runoff and produce poor crop yields. Long-term evaluation of the impacts of such land use change on hydrologic fluxes and biofuel production potential is necessary before adopting such strategies on a large scale. In this study, the hydrologic impacts of replacing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) on marginal lands in an intensive agricultural watershed in the Texas High Plains with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a bioenergy crop were evaluated using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. The surface runoff to cotton yield ratio was used as a criterion to identify marginal cotton subareas (homogenous spatial units delineated by APEX) in the study watershed, and three replacement scenarios (low (9 %), medium (33 %), and high (57 %) extents of cotton acreage replaced by switchgrass) were implemented in the scenario analysis. The average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff decreased by about 84 and 66 %, and the percolation increased by 106 and 57 % in the irrigated and dryland subareas, respectively, when cotton was replaced by switchgrass under the high replacement scenario. Spatial analysis showed that switchgrass was a feasible bioenergy crop for replacing cotton, especially in the western part of the study watershed, due to its higher water use efficiency and better water conservation effects compared to cotton. It is estimated that 193 and 381 million liters of ethanol could be produced from the dryland and irrigated subareas of the study watershed, respectively, under the high replacement scenario. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: We bibliometrically evaluated the scientific literature outlined around Brazilian life cycle assessment (LCA). Our aim is twofold: (1) Analyze the Brazilian scientific literature on LCA, forming a current view of how the LCA methodology is applied in the country; (2) within this view, trace the evolution of themes, characterize institution collaboration, and indicate major influences in Brazilian LCA community. Methods: Data were outlined around academic production and publications, from 1993 to 2015, indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI- SCIE and SSCI) through a specific group of keywords. Initially, a temporal evolution and projection of papers, PhD and Master Theses, were performed. In sequence, indexed papers were analyzed through performance indicators (i.e., number of authors, impact factor, among others) and content evaluation (for instance, major addressed themes). Finally, a mapping of science was performed, with the aid of Cite Space software application, where coword (and evolution), cocollaboration (and evolution), and cocitation maps were created. Results and discussion: The survey identified 429 documents divided among international and national papers, PhD and Master Theses. From those documents, 165 were indexed. In terms of production and performance, the results indicate an undeniable evolution of the Brazilian LCA research, as affirmed by relations solidified through time. The main research field is “LCA application” with 84 % of papers, whereas “LCA methodology” completes the framework. In LCA applications, 25 % of publications are related to Biofuels—divided into bioethanol and biodiesel—which makes it the current dominant LCA research area in Brazil. The collaboration network demonstrates three main institution groups, whereas evolution through the years indicates that this situation may further improve. Influential authors are linked to LCA of biofuels, general LCA guidelines, and methodological LCA developments. Conclusions: Brazilian LCA research has been growing and more complex relations between themes and institutions denote that further developments can be expected. Cocollaboration indicates three main clusters, led by USP, Unicamp, and UFRJ. “Biofuels” is the main research area where sugarcane ethanol and biodiesel from different sources are the domain product systems. Cocitation analysis solidifies this statement, pointing to Isaias Macedo (and other biofuel researchers) as the main author in Brazilian LCA after ISO and Mark Goedkoop. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: Understanding the response of nitrogen fluxes to changes in land use and agricultural practices is crucial for improving the instream water quality prediction. In central Germany, the expansion of bioenergy crops during the last decade led to an increase in fertiliser application rates. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of agricultural management changes on the stream nitrogen load of a drinking water reservoir catchment (Weida, 99.5 km2) using a hydrological water quality model. Methods: The semi-distributed hydrological water quality model—the HYdrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE)—was calibrated and validated successfully for discharge and nitrate-N concentrations during the period 1997–2003 (the lowest discharge Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) was 0.78). Subsequently, stream nitrogen load of six different land use scenarios and their associated agricultural practice changes were compared to the baseline simulations of the period 2006–2009. Some of these scenarios were designed considering the increased cultivation of bioenergy crops. Results: Results revealed that an increase in mineral fertiliser by 20 % for all crops augmented an increase of monthly stream nitrogen loads in the range of 2–6 % compared to the baseline simulations. Also, it was found that stream nitrogen load increased in scenarios where all or some crop areas were converted to maize and rape, which are the established bioenergy crops in Germany. The increase of nitrogen load resulting from these scenarios differed in terms of magnitude and their temporal patterns, reflecting the importance of timing, the amount of fertiliser applications, and harvesting periods. However, results showed that nitrogen load was reduced in situations when only organic farming or summer barley was used and when rape and maize cropping areas were converted to winter wheat. Conclusions: In this intensively used agricultural catchment, the simulated stream nitrate-N loads quickly responded to fertiliser application changes (increase/decrease). This rapid response could be explained by short residence time of the interflow and baseflow runoff components because of the hardrock geological properties of the catchment. © 2016, Jomaa et al.

AB  - The growing world population demands an increase in animal protein production. Seaweed may be a valuable source of protein for animal feed. However, a biorefinery approach aimed at cascading valorisation of both protein and non-protein seaweed constituents is required to realise an economically feasible value chain. In this study, such a biorefinery approach is presented for the green seaweed Ulva lactuca containing 225 g protein (N × 4.6) kg−1 dry matter (DM). The sugars in the biomass were solubilised by hot water treatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and centrifugation resulting in a sugar-rich hydrolysate (38.8 g L−1 sugars) containing glucose, rhamnose and xylose, and a protein-enriched (343 g kg−1 in DM) extracted fraction. This extracted fraction was characterised for use in animal feed, as compared to U. lactuca biomass. Based on the content of essential amino acids and the in vitro N (85 %) and organic matter (90 %) digestibility, the extracted fraction seems a promising protein source in diets for monogastric animals with improved characteristics as compared to the intact U. lactuca. The gas production test indicated a moderate rumen fermentation of U. lactuca and the extracted fraction, about similar to that of alfalfa. Reduction of the high content of minerals and trace elements may be required to allow a high inclusion level of U. lactuca products in animal diets. The hydrolysate was used successfully for the production of acetone, butanol, ethanol and 1,2-propanediol by clostridial fermentation, and the rhamnose fermentation pattern was studied. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Responsible Innovation (RI) is often heralded in EU policy circles as a means to achieve ethically acceptable, sustainable innovations. Yet, conceptual questions on the specific notion of ‘responsibility’ and to what extent an innovation can be ‘responsible’ are only partly addressed. In this chapter the question of responsibility for the indirect negative effects of biofuel innovations is explored. While initially hailed as one of the much needed solutions in the global struggle against climate change, the use of biofuels has become increasingly criticised. It is argued that the increased production of biofuels has put smallholder farmers out of business, has given rise to increased food prices, sparking food riots in several countries, while also contributing to further environmental degradation as the demand for new biofuels requires the development of new croplands at the cost of forests and peat lands. In the current market-based system it is customary to disburden researchers and business companies from any responsibility for the more remote consequences of their actions. When harmful consequences are brought about through the mediation of (perhaps a long series of) market transactions, they are often considered inevitable and excusable and not an appropriate occasion for invoking anybody’s responsibility. But how broad is the scope of responsibility when it comes to the above mentioned social and ecological problems? By invoking the sacred duty to “innovate”, the business company could perhaps be exculpated. In our age, innovation is often so much celebrated that many negative impacts are duly accepted as the inevitable price of progress. By approaching responsibility from a perspective that takes into account the economic and ecological interconnectedness of the world, we show how the debate on Responsible Innovation in biofuels becomes tied in with global debates on economic justice and bioscarcity. In conclusion we argue that if we—assuming this interconnectedness—take the current requirements of “Responsible” Innovation seriously, it would result in a demanding practice that calls for a substantial departure from business as usual, which prompts the question to what extent it is reasonable to incorporate what are actually demands for global justice in programs for innovation. © 2016, Tempels and Van den Belt.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to present the contribution of the sugar cane industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector. Mauritius is taken as a case study. Sugar cane was introduced in Mauritius during the seventeenth century and production of sugar started around 60 years later. Since then, the cane industry has been one of the economic pillars of the country. Bagasse, a by-product of sugar cane, is used as fuel in cogeneration power plants to produce process heat and electricity. This process heat and the generated electricity are used by an annexed sugar mills for the production of sugar, while the remaining electricity is exported to the national grid. In fact, Mauritius is a pioneer in the field of bagasse-based cogeneration power plant; the first bagasse-based cogeneration power plant that was commissioned in the world was in Mauritius in 1957. The contribution of the cane industry in the electricity sector has been vital for the economic development of Mauritius and also in terms of mitigating carbon dioxide emissions by displacing fossil fuels in electricity generation, as bagasse is classified as a renewable source. Data obtained from Statistics Mauritius on electricity production for the past 45 years were analysed, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on international norms. It is estimated that savings on heavy fuel oil importation were by 1.5 million tons of oil—representing a value of 2.9 billion dollars—thus avoiding 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. This figure can be further increased if molasses, a by-product of sugar cane juice, is used to produce bio-ethanol to be used as fuel in vehicles. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Public policies are promoting biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuel consumption in order to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the mitigation benefit can be at least partially compromised by emissions occurring during feedstock production. One of the key sources of GHG emissions from biofuel feedstock production, as well as conventional crops, is soil nitrous oxide (N2O), which is largely driven by nitrogen (N) management. Our objective was to determine how much GHG emissions could be reduced by encouraging alternative N management practices through application of nitrification inhibitors and a cap on N fertilization. We used the US Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS2) as the basis for a case study to evaluate technical and economic drivers influencing the N management mitigation strategies. We estimated soil N2O emissions using the DayCent ecosystem model and applied the US Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) to project GHG emissions for the agricultural sector, as influenced by biofuel scenarios and N management options. Relative to the current RSF2 policy with no N management interventions, results show decreases in N2O emissions ranging from 3 to 4 % for the agricultural sector (5.5–6.5 million metric tonnes CO2 eq. year−1; 1 million metric tonnes is equivalent to a Teragram) in response to a cap that reduces N fertilizer application and even larger reductions with application of nitrification inhibitors, ranging from 9 to 10 % (15.5–16.6 million tonnes CO2 eq. year−1). The results demonstrate that climate and energy policies promoting biofuel production could consider options to manage the N cycle with alternative fertilization practices for the agricultural sector and likely enhance the mitigation of GHG emissions associated with biofuels. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Sustainable production of high value chemicals, biofuels and bioenergy relies on the replacement of fossil oil with low production cost feedstock and low environmental impact technologies. The present study evaluated the dry matter yield and feedstock properties of three different Arundo donax L. clones (Fontane Bianche, Piazza Armerina and Capo d'Orlando), two Miscanthus species (M. × giganteus and M. sinensis “Goliath”) and Saccharum spontaneum L. spp. aegyptiacum (Willd.) Hack., all grown side-by-side in rainfed conditions for three consecutive years in semi-arid Mediterranean environment. Significant differences were observed among species, as well as among giant reed clones. F. Bianche and Saccharum were the highest yielding species in all growing seasons, followed by P. Armerina and C. Orlando, which did not differ. Out of Miscanthus, Giganteus overyielded Goliath. All species exhibited the highest dry matter yields in the wettest growing season. Saccharum and giant reed clones showed higher biomass water content than both Miscanthus. Ash content was the lowest in Giganteus and the highest in F. Bianche. Low heating value was the highest in Saccharum, both Miscanthus and giant reed P. Armerina. Generally, the bulk density was greater in giant reed and Saccharum than Miscanthus. Cellulose was the highest in both Miscanthus and hemicellulose in Saccharum. Lignin content was the lowest in giant reed clones. Several significant correlations occurred between biomass yield and raw material characteristics, as well as within feedstock properties. To support the development of a suitable bioenergy chain based on perennial grasses, besides biomass yield, feedstock properties should be rigorously considered. Further research is still required in crop management practices, logistic and technology front in order to tackle bottlenecks for improved quality of herbaceous biomass. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane ethanol systems can deliver large greenhouse gas emissions savings if emissions associated with land-use change are kept low. This qualitative study documents and analyzes actions and opinions among Brazilian farmers who shift to sugarcane production. Semi-structured interviews were held with 28 actors associated with sugarcane production in three different regions: one traditional sugarcane region and two regions where sugarcane is currently expanding. Most farmers considered sugarcane a land diversification option with relatively low economic risk, although higher risk than their previous land use. Beef production was considered a low-risk option, but less profitable than sugarcane. In conjunction with converting part of their land to sugarcane, most farmers maintained and further intensified their previous agricultural activity, often beef production. Several farmers invested in expanded production in other regions with relatively low land prices. Very few farmers in the expansion regions shifted all their land from the former, less profitable, use to sugarcane. Very few farmers in this study had deforested any land in connection with changes made when shifting to sugarcane. The respondents understand "environmental friendliness" as compliance with the relevant legislation, especially the Brazilian Forest Act, which is also a requirement for delivering sugarcane to the mills. Indirect land-use change is not a concern for the interviewed farmers, and conversion of forests and other native vegetation into sugarcane plantations is uncontroversial if legal. We derive hypotheses regarding farmers' actions and opinions from our results. These hypotheses aim to contribute to better understanding of what takes place in conjunction with expansion of sugarcane and can, when tested further, be of use in developing, e.g., policies for iLUC-free biofuel production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass production for bioenergy use may contribute to rural development by increasing household incomes, local employment and energy supply, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a value-chain approach to evaluating the profitability and competitiveness of producing biodiesel or ethanol. We apply a 'rapid appraisal' accounting framework to the case of Tanzania, which is a data scarce setting and therefore well-suited to the proposed approach. The framework also estimates the number of jobs created in the biofuel sector under different production arrangements and related demand for land resource. We evaluate the potential trade-offs between different scales of biofuel production (both the scale of feedstock production and biofuel processing). We find that only sunflower-biodiesel is profitable, especially if produced in large-scale estate farming systems. Estate farming is the best option for profits and competitiveness, even if domestic biofuel production is never competitive on the international market for energy. We also find that the number of jobs depends crucially on the involvement of smallholders. Establishing out-grower schemes (or similar arrangements), rather than estate farms, should be a key policy objective if biofuels production is going to improve rural economy. However social benefits may be gained at a cost of reduced international competitiveness and increased land exploitation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Interventions to mitigate household air pollution (HAP) from cooking with solid fuels often fail to take into account the role of access to freely available woodfuels in determining fuel choice and willingness to adopt clean cooking technologies, key factors in mitigating the burden of HAP. We use national-scale remote sensing data on land use land cover change, and population representative data from two waves of the Malawi Living Standards Measurement Survey to explore the relationship between land use change and the type of fuel households use, time spent collecting fuel, and expenditures on fuel, hypothesizing that land use dynamics influence household-level choice of primary cooking fuel. We find considerable heterogeneity with respect to regeneration and deforestation/degradation dynamics and evidence of spatial clustering. We find that regeneration of forests and woodlands increases the share of households that collect fuelwood, whereas deforestation and degradation lead households to purchase fuelwood. We also find that a relatively large share of land under woody savannah or degraded forest (versus fully stocked forest) increases fuel collection time. Areas with regeneration happening at broader scale experience increases in fuel expenditures. Our findings have implications for the spatial targeting of interventions designed to mitigate HAP. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - To ensure the sustainable production and consumption of biofuels, an increasing body of scientific literature has become available in recent years focusing on the environmental impacts of biofuels. Whilst the climate change mitigation is perhaps the primary driver behind the promotion of biofuels, climate change is not the only crucial impact associated with biofuel production and consumption systems. This study aims at analysing the extent of the dominant focus on climate impacts in Swedish research applying environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools to investigate the environmental impacts of biofuels, and why this may exist. A systematic literature review of Swedish research applying ESA tools in the study of transportation biofuels between 2000 and 2015 was conducted; identifying 64 studies. The results indicate that studies using life cycle assessment include a range of impact categories in addition to climate impacts, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. However, when also considering environmental footprints (i.e., carbon and water footprints) and material flow analyses, the dominance of carbon footprints leads to an overly dominant focus on climate impacts at the expense of other impact categories. The consideration of environmental impacts other than those related to climate impacts is discussed in terms of the influence of the dominant science-policy framework in Sweden and study dependent variables, such as data uncertainty and methodological limitations. Whilst biofuel production is inextricably linked to climate policy, the environmental impacts of Swedish biofuel production and consumption should also consider the broader context of the Swedish National Environmental Objectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Both biofuels and bioplastics are often regarded as sustainable solutions to current environmental problems such as climate change, fossil depletion and acidification. However, both have been criticized for being economically costly, competing with other societally beneficial goods such as food, and offering limited environmental benefits compared to their fossil counterparts. This study provides a comparative environmental Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for 100% bio-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, versus fully fossil-based and partially bio-based PET bottles. An attributional life cycle assessment (aLCA) and sensitivity analysis of key assumptions is carried out to compare cradle-to-factory-gate impacts (i.e. feedstock extraction, component production and product manufacturing) of twelve PET bottle production scenarios. Results indicate that woody-biomass based PET bottles have 21% less global warming potential and require 22% less fossil fuel than their fossil based counterparts, but perform worse in other categories such as ecotoxicity and ozone depletion impacts. Results are sensitive to impact allocation assumptions as well as parameter input assumptions related to isobutanol production. In most categories, with avoided impact credits considered, forest residue feedstocks result in overall better environmental performance than corn stover feedstocks for bio-PET bottle production. The variability in avoided burdens could alter the relative environmental rankings for fossil and bio-PET bottles. Depending on the biomass feedstock, extraction and pre-processing are likely more emission-intensive than the corresponding fossil refinery processes due to the significant upstream emissions embodied in the application of fertilizers, and the significant chemical and energy inputs required to break recalcitrant lignocellulosic bonds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed at the evaluation of industrial residues/wastes such as pinewood sawdust, swine manure, and paper sludge to produce liquefied products that can be used as potential biofuels. The afforded products, liquefied pinewood sawdust, liquefied paper sludge and liquefied swine manure were obtained in good yield and subject to chemical analysis. The bio-oils have presented higher carbon and hydrogen content when compared to their precursors while a significant decreased in moisture was observed. Plotting van Krevelen diagram demonstrated that the bio-oils are more closely related to hydrocarbon than to its primitive, raw material. This study also showed a strong potential of LPS to be used as a bio-oil, since it fulfilled two out of the three criteria needed to be considered as a bio-petroleum product. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We formulate an agent-based simulation model to analyze farmers' decision-making in bioenergy crops adoption and predict related farmers' group behavior. Agents include farmers and biofuel producers, and each is represented with their own decision-making mechanism. We quantitatively model the decision-making of farmers in Iowa, USA as an optimization model based on values derived from published literature and social survey data; results were further validated with social survey data. Economic and environmental impacts of growing conventional row crops versus dedicated energy crops are considered and evaluated under a series of operational constraints including neighborhood influence. We apply the model to forecast biomass supply in the next three decades and reveal that Iowa has the potential to produce 2.27 billion gallons (8.59 billion liters) of cellulosic biofuel by 2022, which constitutes 14.2% of RFS2 cellulosic ethanol mandate. We also find improved publicity to be more efficient in promoting biomass production than raising the contract price. This paper provides a new approach to study farmers' behavior, and insights we derive on managerial operations may be of interest to bioenergy investors, producers, and government policy makers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study analyzed the algal biodiesel production system via dry-route, based on Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in raceways, by comparing the Net Energy Balance (NEB) and the Fossil Energy Ratio (FER) of five scenarios: C0 (single system of biomass production); C1 (C0 + pyrolysis of the microalgae press cake); C2 (C0 + anaerobic co-digestion of the microalgae press cake); C3 and C4 (same conditions of C1 and C2, but integrating both scenarios into an autonomous ethanol distillery). Each scenario was analyzed under de perspective of energy allocation (a) and system expansion with avoided product (b). The results showed that with the energy allocation, only C3a and C4a improved the values of baseline scenario (C0a) for NEB, in 120% and 72% respectively. When the system expansion is considered, none of the scenarios was better than the respective baseline scenario (C0b), in relation to the NEB. Considering the FER, C3a increased in 3.4% the values of C0a, while C3b and C4b increased the values of C0b in 54.1% and 28.8%, respectively. In general, system expansion showed the best scenarios: for the NEB C0b showed the highest average values while C3b showed the highest average values for the FER. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated costs and profitability associated with small scale camelina oil extraction plant in the Canadian Prairies for the purpose of selling camelina oil for further biodiesel production. In this case, Camelina sativa is targeted for production on underutilized summerfallow land to avoid displacement of crop lands. Saskatchewan soil zone 7A has the capacity to provide camelina for oil extraction based on small scale capacities of 30,000-120,000 t annum-1 and capital investment of $10-24 million. Oil production price is reduced with increased camelina oil content, field yield, plant scale, and camelina meal price. Oil production costs range from $0.39 to $1.88 L-1 when camelina meal has a market value of $0.30 kg-1. These results provide an informative basis for investment decisions by farmers and investors vis-à-vis the advancement of farm-adoption of camelina as a dedicated industrial crop, as well as the development of an integrated camelina-to-processing oilseed value-chain. © 2016.

AB  - Background: Interannual variability in precipitation, particularly drought, can affect lignocellulosic crop biomass yields and composition, and is expected to increase biofuel yield variability. However, the effect of precipitation on downstream fermentation processes has never been directly characterized. In order to investigate the impact of interannual climate variability on biofuel production, corn stover and switchgrass were collected during 3 years with significantly different precipitation profiles, representing a major drought year (2012) and 2 years with average precipitation for the entire season (2010 and 2013). All feedstocks were AFEX (ammonia fiber expansion)-pretreated, enzymatically hydrolyzed, and the hydrolysates separately fermented using xylose-utilizing strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis. A chemical genomics approach was also used to evaluate the growth of yeast mutants in the hydrolysates. Results: While most corn stover and switchgrass hydrolysates were readily fermented, growth of S. cerevisiae was completely inhibited in hydrolysate generated from drought-stressed switchgrass. Based on chemical genomics analysis, yeast strains deficient in genes related to protein trafficking within the cell were significantly more resistant to the drought-year switchgrass hydrolysate. Detailed biomass and hydrolysate characterization revealed that switchgrass accumulated greater concentrations of soluble sugars in response to the drought and these sugars were subsequently degraded to pyrazines and imidazoles during ammonia-based pretreatment. When added ex situ to normal switchgrass hydrolysate, imidazoles and pyrazines caused anaerobic growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae. Conclusions: In response to the osmotic pressures experienced during drought stress, plants accumulate soluble sugars that are susceptible to degradation during chemical pretreatments. For ammonia-based pretreatment, these sugars degrade to imidazoles and pyrazines. These compounds contribute to S. cerevisiae growth inhibition in drought-year switchgrass hydrolysate. This work discovered that variation in environmental conditions during the growth of bioenergy crops could have significant detrimental effects on fermentation organisms during biofuel production. These findings are relevant to regions where climate change is predicted to cause an increased incidence of drought and to marginal lands with poor water-holding capacity, where fluctuations in soil moisture may trigger frequent drought stress response in lignocellulosic feedstocks. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of components in municipal solid waste (MSW) as feedstock for liquid transportation biofuels and chemicals can be a sustainable solution for energy needs while minimizing impacts of landfills on the environment. This study conducts a resource assessment for available MSW in Mexico and concludes that when the organic and polyolefin plastic components are converted to liquid hydrocarbon transportation biofuels through a pyrolysis-based pathway, up to 7% of Mexico's transportation-fuel consumption needs could be met. A preliminary carbon footprint analysis (CFA) using stage-specific emission factors from the literature shows that liquid transportation biofuels from the organic portion of MSW (paper, packaging, wood, yard trimmings) sequesters 9.5 g CO2 eq per MJ biofuel, with significant pathway credits due to avoiding landfill CH4 emissions. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the conversion of the polyolefin plastic in the MSW are positive (88 g CO2 eq per MJ), though still lower than current fossil transportation fuels in Mexico (95.5 g CO2 eq per MJ). Based on these resource assessments and preliminary carbon footprint results, MSW in Mexico should be considered a promising feedstock for biofuel production through conversion research and updated carbon footprint analyses. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Diatoms have attracted interest as biofuel producers. Here, the contents of lipids and photosynthetic pigments were analyzed in a marine centric diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis. This diatom can be genetically engineered using our previously reported transformation technique and has a potential to produce valuable materials photosynthetically. Sustainable culture conditions for cost-effective production of biological materials under autotrophic conditions with atmospheric carbon dioxide were investigated in the laboratory. A large-scale, open-air culture was also performed. Results: Cell population doubling time was ~10 h under continuous illumination without CO2 enrichment, and large amounts of triacylglycerols (TAG) and fucoxanthin accumulated under a wide range of salinity and nutrient conditions, reaching ~200 and 18.5 mg/L, respectively. It was also shown that C. gracilis produced high amounts of TAG without the need for nitrogen or silica deprivation, which is frequently imposed to induce lipid production in many other microalgae. Furthermore, C. gracilis was confirmed to be highly tolerant to changes in environmental conditions, such as salinity. The diatom grew well and produced abundant lipids when using sewage water or liquid fertilizer derived from cattle feces without augmented carbon dioxide. High growth rates (doubling time <20 h) were obtained in a large-scale, open-air culture, in which light irradiance and temperature fluctuated and were largely different from laboratory conditions. Conclusions: The ability of this microalga to accumulate TAG without nutrient deprivation, which incurs added labor, high costs, and complicates scalability, is important for low-cost industrial applications. Furthermore, its high tolerance to changes in environmental conditions and high growth rates observed in large-scale, open-air culture implied scalability of this diatom for industrial applications. Therefore, C. gracilis would have great potential as a biofactory. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment is a promising approach for the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels. The toxicity of residual IL, however, negatively impacts the performance of industrial enzymes and microorganisms in hydrolysis and fermentation. In this study, a thermophilic microbial community was cultured on switchgrass amended with various levels of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Changes in the microbial community composition and transcription of genes relevant to IL tolerance and lignocellulose hydrolysis were quantified. Increasing the level of IL to 0.1% (wt) led to increased levels of relative abundance and transcription in organisms of the phylum Firmicutes. Interestingly, IL concentrations of up to 1% (wt) also resulted in greater xylanase transcription and enzyme activity as well as increased transcription of endoglucanase, betaglucosidase, and IL tolerance genes compared to communities without IL. IL levels above 1% (wt) resulted in decreased enzyme activity and transcription of genes involved in lignocellulose hydrolysis. The results indicate that moderate levels of IL select for thermophilic microorganisms that not only tolerate IL but also effectively hydrolyze lignocellulose from switchgrass. Discovery of IL-tolerant organisms and enzymes is critical for the development of biological processes that convert ILpretreated biomass to biofuels and chemicals. Employing metatranscriptomic analysis of enrichment cultures can facilitate the discovery of microorganisms and enzymes that may be active in the presence of toxic compounds such as ionic liquids.

AB  - The cultivation of the biofuel crop Jatropha curcas L. in Burkina Faso may contribute to ameliorating the soil fertility of severely declining cropland through increased organic matter input and erosion control. This study addresses the potential for the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in traditional and newly introduced J. curcas production systems. Five prevailing systems included interplanting with annual crops, intensely managed monoculture plantations, afforestation of abandoned cropland, plantings along contour stone walls, and traditional living fences. The SOC was analyzed in 20 paired sites of 1- to 4-year-old J. curcas plantings and adjacent cropland. Paired sites with living fences involved a longer chronosequence with 15- and 20-year-old plantings. Additionally, the contribution of J. curcas to SOC sequestration was investigated by comparing the 13C signature of the C inputs in four J. curcas sites with that of sorghum cropping. Linear regression analysis did not reveal a clear trend of SOC dynamics over time for the short-term chronosequences, nor could the isotopic tracer technique prove a contribution of 4-year-old J. curcas trees to the SOC stock. The 20-year chronosequence of J. curcas living fences exhibited a significant SOC increase of 62 ± 23 g m−2 y−1. Considering soil coverage of 1,200 m2 ha−1 by living fences (400-m hedge with a width of 3 m), 1.5 Mg SOC was sequestered. Also, changes in δ13C values indicated a contribution of C3-derived C to the SOC stock. These findings on traditional J. curcas systems indicate the potential of this biofuel crop for improving cropland soil fertility in the long run. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the importance of biofuel policies on the price levels of grains that compete for the use of limited resources, as well as to the use of alternative inputs in grains production in the United States. A theoretical 2-inputs, 2-outputs model is developed to provide foundation of the relationship between ethanol policy and grains prices and agricultural inputs use. Simulations are run using the theoretical model results and empirical values of the demand and supply elasticities for given crops and inputs, and input and output shares in production, to determine the indirect and direct effects of ethanol policy on grain prices and input use. Results suggest that corn prices increase leading to an increase in wheat prices. Both land and energy use in corn production increases disproportionally more than what they decrease in wheat production. The relative increase of energy used in agriculture following the adoption of ethanol policies is especially interesting since it stands in contrast to the proclaimed goals of the policy. The results of this study may give greater knowledge to policy makers, who can be better informed with respect to the secondary effects of ethanol legislation. © 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling

AB  - An eight year-long study has been conducted by the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) and funded by the Water Research Commission (WRC) to explore biofuels will drive an energy-scarce future and whether there are enough water resources to grow biofuel. The project has ensured that more precise knowledge is available on water use and what biofuel crops can be considered the geographic location of suitable production areas for each crop and potential impact on streamflow reduction. Producing crops for biofuels is definitely still an option, with crops for bioethanol being more water use efficient. The study has also concluded that water availability (and not land availability) will determine limits for biofuel production potential in rain-fed areas of South Africa.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to understand the effects of a diesel–rapeseed oil–n-butanol (70–20–10% in vol, DRSOnB) blend on engine performance characteristics and exhaust gas emissions for a four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged, direct injection diesel engine as a function of engine speed, and to compare the results to those of rapeseed oil methyl ester (B100), rapeseed oil methyl ester–diesel blend (20–80% in vol, B20) and diesel fuel.

The engine performance and exhaust emission tests were conducted employing each of DRSOnB, B100, B20 and diesel fuel, with the engine operating at full load and eight different engine speeds between 1800 and 4400 rpm. As compared to diesel fuel, the test fuels decreased torque, brake power and exhaust gas temperature and increased brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). While B20 and DRSOnB blends increased carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, B100 decreased it compared to diesel fuel. All the test fuels reduced hydrocarbon (HC) emissions while increasing nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation. © 2015 Energy Institute

AB  - Privately owned grazing lands comprise 52% of all grazing lands in the United States. Livestock production is the primary economic source of income from these lands; however, improved management strategies can be implemented to not only sustain this agroecosystem, but enhance the natural resource to provide new and innovated ecosystem services and goods. To sustain this resource, grazing strategies should be designed to implement five basic principles: 1) provide diverse plant communities, 2) protect the soil surface, 3) eliminate overgrazing, 4) incorporate grazing management that enhances the forage harvest efficiency, and 5) create best managed ecosystems that accomplish reestablishment of historical disturbance regimes for a given region. By obtaining these principles, land owners will have the opportunity to create or enhance ecosystem services and goods that provide commodity, amenity, environmental and spiritual values essential to ranching life, the communities they live in, and the nation as a whole. Sustained ecosystems can provide food, fiber, biofuels, fish and wildlife habitat, water, improved air quality, ornamental resources, and ceremonial items to name a few. Livestock grazing is essential to sustain the ecosystems associated with rangeland, grassland and other perennial pastures. Ranchers and land managers should incorporate new grazing strategies to sustain the agroecosystem while developing potential enterprises to increase income through secondary goods and service. The ultimate goal is to provide a sustainable ecosystem that can be shared by future generations with a history that ties the land to the family and community. © 2016 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Given that sustainable energy production and advanced wastewater treatment for producing clean water are two major challenges faced by modern society, microalgae make a desirable treatment alternative by providing a renewable biomass feedstock for biofuel production, while treating wastewater as a growth medium. Microalgae have been known to be resilient to the toxic contaminants of highly concentrated organic wastewater (e.g., organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity) and are excellent at sorbing heavy metals and emerging contaminants. Economic and environmental advantages associated with massive algae culturing in wastewater constitute a driving force to promote its utilization as a feedstock for biofuels. However, there are still many challenges to be resolved which have impeded the development of algal biofuel technology at a commercial scale. This review provides an overview of an integrated approach using microalgae for wastewater treatment, CO2 utilization, and biofuel production. The main goal of this article is to promote research in algae technologies by outlining critical needs along the integrated process train, including cultivation, harvesting, and biofuel production. Various aspects associated with design challenges of microalgae production are described and current developments in algae cultivation and pretreatment of algal biomass for biofuel production are also discussed. Furthermore, synergistic coupling of the use of microalgae for advanced wastewater treatment and biofuel production is highlighted in a sustainability context using life cycle analysis. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

AB  - Fossil fuels as the main energy source of every country now predicted will be ended no more than 40 years. Therefore, alternative fuel such as biofuel has been developed by many countries including Indonesia. Indonesia as one of the highest populated country and has wide areas of agriculture, forest and crop field is potential to be the highest biofuel production in the world. However, after one decade since the Government of Indonesia launched the energy Policy in 2006, appears to be interesting that the biofuels progress in Indonesia seen not well developed. One of the basic weaknesses is the program only applied to the specific area with a high biofuel resource by central government without support by local government. Furthermore, the target of biofuel programs seems to be very high or too ambitious, while the condition of the people still very traditional which can be seen from the lifestyle and their energy consumption. This paper provides in detail a review of several topics related to resource, energy consumption, policy and the research and development activities of biofuel in Indonesia. As a discussion, some recommendation provided to encourage the biofuel development in the near future. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Algae grown in wastewater treatment lagoons are a potentially important substrate for biofuel production. The feasibility of using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors in anaerobic digestion of algae to produce methane was investigated. A favorable carbon to nitrogen (C/N) weight ratio of 21/1 was determined in batch reactor experiments in which the ratio was adjusted by blending algal biomass with sodium acetate as a carbon source. This blend of algae and acetate was used in the feedstock applied to the UASB reactors. Duplicate, 34-L, UASB reactors initially received an organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.9 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L. d at a 7.2-day hydraulic retention time (HRT). The OLR was gradually increased to 5.4 g/L. d and the HRT was decreased to 5.5 days resulting in a methane production increase from 247 to 298 mL/g COD biodegraded. The COD removal efficiency was 80% with a biogas methane composition of 90%. © 2016, Water Environment Federation. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, biogas from biomasses has increasingly been considered a feasible alternative to energy from fossil fuel. The utilization of biomasses obtained from citrus processing for juice extraction is being investigated for energy purposes, as a biofuel or organic matrix for bioethanol or biogas extraction, besides for the extraction of high added-value by-products and animal feed. In citrus producing areas, uncertainty often exists as to the amount of processed product and, therefore, correct planning of the use of ‘citrus pulp’ for energy purposes has not yet been carried out. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of the citrus fruit production area and the amount of processed citrus in order to quantify the citrus pulp available for biogas production. It could contribute to build an information base suitable for multi-criteria analysis aimed at finding optimal locations for biogas plants and increasing their number in a territory. The GIS-based methodology, which was applied to the case study of citrus pulp production in Sicily, included official statistics data and information derived from specific surveys and the computation of indicators regarding citrus-producing areas, citrus production, processed production, and the amount of citrus pulp obtained. The results showed that the index that describes the level of availability of citrus pulp for biogas production is suitable to provide information on the potential production of citrus pulp in the different areas of the whole territory analyzed. Furthermore, the total amount of available citrus pulp corresponded theoretically to 15,204,775.8 Nm3 biogas. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Demand for woody biomass from the southern United States (US) is increasing because of its reliability in supply, recent developments in co-firing and biofuel conversion technologies, overseas pellet demand, and the expected economic impacts from reorienting the forestry sector towards energy feedstock production. This research examines the interaction between a set of woody biomass harvesting sources (logging residue, non-merchantable, and merchantable roundwood) and wood types (hardwood, planted softwood, and natural softwood), and the impacts harvest costs have on the extraction of these materials in the southern US. The expected woody biomass availability and its geographic distribution are determined with a cost minimizing linear programming model. The marginal cost of woody biomass supply is determined for different energy production targets, subject to satisfying conventional wood demand. Given derived industry supply curves, the economic impacts of the sector are analyzed using the IMpact analysis for PLANning model (IMPLAN) at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) level. The results suggest that forest biomass for energy production is projected to be available over a much wider price range with logging, residue, and non-merchantable and merchantable roundwood in these regions. Supply of hardwood and softwood biomass from merchantable roundwood is expected to increase if these materials can be harvested for non-conventional uses. Development of harvesting woody biomass from logging residue, non-merchantable, and merchantable timber has positive effects on local economies, bringing with it employment opportunities to some BEA regions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha Curcas is a promising feedstock for biofuel production, which can be grown in tropical and subtropical regions globally. Utilization of oil produced from the Jatropha seed can reduce the use of common cooking fuels in developing countries such as firewood, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Thus, many developing countries including Nepal are promoting Jatropha-based biofuel production plants. However, before the commercial establishment of such a facility, a thorough techno-economic analysis is required. Thus, this study conducted a techno-economic analysis of a commercial-scale Jatropha oil production facility with a nameplate capacity of 23.87 million liter/year. Jatropha seeds collected from different regions of Nepal were used to determine the oil yield and other required input materials for the oil extraction process. Thermal efficiency of a conventional kerosene stove blending with Jatropha oil was also determined. These experimental data and other data associated with process equipment collected from the literature were used to conduct the techno-economic analysis. The estimated Jatropha oil costs ($/L) with and without oil cake revenue were 0.64 and 0.76, respectively. Additionally, Jatropha oil production cost ($/L) including oil cake revenue at 90% confidence interval was 0.38–1.02. Feedstock cost, oil yield, oil cake revenue, and plant size were the most sensitive parameters to oil production cost. Further, thermal efficiency of 38.8 ± 0.18% was obtained when 20% (v/v) Jatropha oil was blended with kerosene and the efficiency was inversely proportional to blending ratio. Overall, 20% (v/v) Jatropha oil-kerosene blend could be a viable cooking fuel for developing countries. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Tobacco stalks are an abundant biomass resource which are otherwise treated as waste. In this work, the effect of hydrothermal carbonization temperature and time on the structures, chemical compositions and combustion characteristics of hydrochars obtained from tobacco stalks were evaluated. The carbon content, higher heating value, and energy yield increased with accompanying decrease in hydrogen and oxygen contents with the increase of treatment temperature and time. The evolution of the H/C and O/C atomic ratios indicated dehydration and devolatilization processes occurred during hydrothermal carbonization. The weight loss, combustion range and characteristic temperatures of tobacco stalks were significantly modified after hydrothermal carbonization, resulting in higher ignition temperatures and higher energy density. The kinetics model, Coats–Redfern method revealed the activation energy of hydrochars in zone 2 and 3 were among 43.7–74.8 kJ/mol and 46.7–85.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Our results show that hydrothermal carbonization reaction can facilitate transforming tobacco stalks into energy-rich solid fuel. © 2016

AB  - Ground level ozone poses a significant threat to human health from air pollution in the European Union. While anthropogenic emissions of precursor substances (NOx, NMVOC, CH4) are regulated by EU air quality legislation and will decrease further in the future, the emissions of biogenic NMVOC (mainly isoprene) may increase significantly in the coming decades if short-rotation coppice plantations are expanded strongly to meet the increased biofuel demand resulting from the EU decarbonisation targets. This study investigates the competing effects of anticipated trends in land use change, anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions and climate change on European ground level ozone concentrations and related health and environmental impacts until 2050. The work is based on a consistent set of energy consumption scenarios that underlie current EU climate and air quality policy proposals: a current legislation case, and an ambitious decarbonisation case. The Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model was used to calculate air pollutant emissions for these scenarios, while land use change because of bioenergy demand was calculated by the Global Biosphere Model (GLOBIOM). These datasets were fed into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to calculate the impact on ground level ozone concentrations. Health damage because of high ground level ozone concentrations is projected to decline significantly towards 2030 and 2050 under current climate conditions for both energy scenarios. Damage to plants is also expected to decrease but to a smaller extent. The projected change in anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions is found to have a larger impact on ozone damage than land use change. The increasing effect of a warming climate (+2–5 °C across Europe in summer) on ozone concentrations and associated health damage, however, might be higher than the reduction achieved by cutting back European ozone precursor emissions. Global action to reduce air pollutant emissions is needed to make sure that ozone damage in Europe decreases towards the middle of this century. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An extracellular halophilic alpha-amylase (AmyA) was produced by the haloarchaeon Haloterrigena turkmenica grown in medium enriched with 0.2% (w/v) starch. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses showed a major band at 66.0 kDa and a peak of 54.0 kDa, respectively. Analysis of tryptic fragments of the protein present in the major SDS-PAGE band by nano-LC-ESI–MS/MS led to identification of the alpha-amylase catalytic region, encoded by the htur2110 gene, as the protein possessing the described activity. Optimal values for activity were 55 °C, pH 8.5 and 2 M NaCl, and high thermostability was showed at 55 °C and 3 M NaCl. AmyA activity was enhanced by Triton X-100 and was not influenced by n-hexane and chloroform. Starch hydrolysis produced different oligomers with maltose as the smallest end-product. The efficiency of AmyA in degrading starch contained in agronomic residues was tested in grape cane chosen as model substrate. Preliminary results showed that starch was degraded making the enzyme a potential candidate for utilization of agro-industrial waste in fuel and chemicals production. AmyA is one of the few investigated amylases produced by haloarchaea, and the first alpha-amylase described among microorganisms belonging to the genus Haloterrigena. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methane from biomass is a well suited renewable energy carrier with a wide range of applications. The main technologies for its production out of biomass are biochemical conversion from the upgrading of biogas and thermochemical conversion by gasification and methanation. Presently there exists no methodology to compare the process alternatives for methane production from biomass. This paper investigates a comprehensive evaluation method based on a multi-criteria analysis. Due to the comparable well developed biomethane market in Europe, compared to other regions in the world, the study area was restricted to Europe. The weighting of the different criteria is carried out in two rounds as a pair-to-pair comparison of the criteria by experts from different technology fields in a Delphi-Survey. As a result, the prioritisation can be used to classify the biomass conversion technologies to convert biomass to biomethane. According to the weightings given by experts, the two criteria energy efficiency and production costs are of great importance compared to the other criteria. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Several studies have highlighted that one of the largest risks with cellulosic biorefinery investments are year-to-year variability in cellulosic biomass quantity available. Yet, strategies to mitigate these risks in biofuel development are less understood. In the absence of strategies to minimize the impact due to these variations, both biorefineries and farmers venturing into the cellulosic biofuel arena will be significantly exposed. Studies have been done on using engineering approaches, such as biomass pre-treatment and storage to address biomass supply variations. Recent studies have provided market structure and contracting strategies to manage biomass supply risks. However, storage, pre-treatment and similar engineering approaches lead to higher costs and has other limitations such as additional infrastructural requirements. There is a gap in understanding the use of feedstock (biomass) diversification and portfolio strategies to mitigate such risks. In this study a portfolio approach is developed and applied to the case of the US Corn Belt, considering various types of cellulosic biomass including corn stover, wheat straw, and switchgrass. It is found that feedstock diversification mitigates up to 40% of feedstock supply variations, while biorefinery diversification can mitigate up to 70% of feedstock supply variations although it is constrained by current cropland use patterns in the region. Overall, diversification and portfolio strategies present an effective way for mitigating risks associated with feedstock supply variations. © 2016

AB  - Planting bioenergy crops on land previously used for citrus production may offer an alternative source of revenue for growers looking for alternative-to-citrus crops. However, residual herbicides used in citrus production may adversely affect alternative crops. This study evaluated effects of three herbicides (bromacil, norflurazon, and simazine) commonly used in citrus production on the bioenergy crop Sorghum bicolor ‘Topper 76-6’. Plants were exposed to herbicides in soil for 1–5 weeks and observations of effects on photosynthetic quantum yield, leaf greenness, height, and biomass were made. Results indicate that concentrations of bromacil and norflurazon greater than 0.09 and 0.07 mg/kg and simazine >0.46 mg/kg will impair growth and development in similar soils. Concentrations below these may also be toxic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Microalgal biotechnology has emerged due to the health-promoting properties of microalgae related to their bioactive compounds and the great diversity of products that can be developed from algal biomass. Microalgal biomasses have been produced industrially for applications in different fields such as food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and animal feed industries. They can be cultivated either in open systems or in closed systems (photobioreactors). Another important area is the use of microalgal biomass for energy production. It has become obvious that petroleum-derived fuels are unsustainable, due to depleting world reserves and greenhouse gas emissions. Microalgae can provide several different types of renewable biofuels. These include methane produced by anaerobic digestion of the algal biomass, biodiesel derived from trans-esterification of microalgal lipids, bioethanol produced from carbohydrate fermentations, and photobiologically produced biohydrogen. The idea of using microalgae as a source of fuel is not new. However, it is now being taken seriously because of increases in petroleum prices and, more significantly, the increasing concern about global warming as associated with burning fossil fuels. This review offers an update on information about microalgae, specifically emphasizing their biotechnological importance. © 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®

AB  - Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is a promising direction for the sustainable development of aquaculture. Microalgae have good potential to be integrated with recirculating aquaculture systems because they can use the nitrogen excreted from fish and share the same optimal pH value as in aquaculture. As a byproduct, the microalgae biomass can be used for fish feed or biofuel. However, the recirculating fish-microalgae IMTA system is under constant threat from fish pathogens and phytoplankton-lytic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to apply proper disinfectants as prophylaxis or treatment which are effective against these threats, but safe to fish and microalgae. For this purpose, peracetic acid (PAA) is a valid option because it is highly effective against fish pathogens and bacteria at low concentrations and degrades spontaneously to harmless residues. In the present study, we exposed the culture of a marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii once per day for four days to four PAA products with differing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/PAA proportions at two concentrations (1 and 2 mg L−1 PAA). The H2O2 solutions at equivalent total peroxide (H2O2 + PAA) concentrations were tested in parallel. The results show that the growth and photosynthesis of T. chuii were not affected by three of the PAA products (Wofasteril® E400, Wofasteril® E250 and Applichem® 150) and equivalent H2O2 solutions at both concentrations. In contrast, Wofasteril® Lspez and an equivalent H2O2 solution at both concentrations caused irreversible culture collapse, photosynthesis dysfunction and irreversible cell damage. In conclusion, PAA products with low proportions of H2O2 are optimal disinfectants for fish-microalgae IMTA systems. © 2016

AB  - An economically viable transition to a renewable, sustainable energy future hinges on the ability to simultaneously produce multiple high value products from biomass precursors. Though there is considerable literature on the thermochemical conversion of biomass to biofuels and biochars, there are few holistic examinations that seek to understand trade-offs between biofuel quality and the associated pyrolysis conditions on activated carbons made from the resulting biochars. Using an Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis, this study probes the impact of pyrolysis and activation temperature on surface areas and pore volumes for 28 carbon dioxide-activated carbons. Activation temperature has the largest single impact of any other variable; increasing the temperature from 800 to 900 °C leads to an increase in surface area of more than 300 m2/g. Contrary to some prior results, pyrolysis temperature has minimal effect on the resulting surface area and pore volume, suggesting that optimizing the temperature at which biofuels are extracted will have little impact on carbon dioxide-activated carbons. Increasing pyrolysis temperature increases methane formation but decreases gaseous hydrocarbons. Bio-oil obtained at lower pyrolysis temperatures shows fewer oxygenated compounds, indicating a greater stability, but higher pyrolysis temperatures maximize production of key biorefinery intermediaries such as furans. By analyzing data in such a holistic manner, it may be possible to optimize the production of biofuels and activated carbons from biomass by minimizing the amount of raw materials and energy necessary to maximize fuel quality, surface areas and pore volumes, thereby increasing the economic incentives for thermochemical conversion of biomass. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Operational and economic trade-offs in the design of second-generation biomass (SGB) supply chains guide the decisions about plant scale and location as well as biomass collection routes. This paper compares different SGB supply chain designs with a focus on mobile pyrolysis plants and centralized versus decentralized collection of biomass in terms of economic and environmental sustainability. Pyrolysis scenarios are also compared to fuel-upgrading and electricity production scenarios. The empirical context of this paper is based on a scenario analysis for processing lignocellulosic biomass, particularly landscape wood, reed and roadside grass available in the Overijssel region (Eastern Netherlands). Four scenarios are compared: (1) mobile pyrolysis plant processes the locally available biomass on-site into pyrolysis oil which is sent to a regional biofuel production unit for upgrading to marketable biofuel; (2) local biomass is collected and transported to a regional pyrolysis-based biofuel production unit for upgrading to a marketable biofuel; (3) mobile pyrolysis plant performs the on-site conversion to pyrolysis oil which is transported to an oil refinery outside the region (Rotterdam); and (4) collected biomass is sent to the nearest electricity production unit to generate electricity. The results show that processing SGB is costly and upgraded oil and refined oil are at least 65% more expensive compared to their fossil counterparts. In terms of economic and environmental performance, the mobile plant performs slightly better than a fixed plant. The energy output/input ratio range is between 6.99 and 7.54 and CO2 emissions range is between 96 and 138 kg CO2/t upgraded oil. © 2016

AB  - Despite its potential to mitigate many environmental impacts of agriculture, organic farming does contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A full accounting and understanding of the GHG emissions associated with specific activities, materials, and energy used in organic operations are needed to support decision-making for GHG mitigation. A small-scale organic vegetable farm in Washington State, USA, was used as a case study to determine the carbon footprint (CF) and GHG hotspots. A partial life cycle assessment was conducted to identify primary and secondary GHG fluxes associated with activities and materials used in production of potatoes, cauliflower, dry bush beans, winter squash, summer squash, chard, peppers, and onions grown in a crop rotation. The CF associated with each crop ranged from a low of 1.68 t CO2-eq ha− 1 yr− 1 for chard to a high of 2.67 t CO2-eq ha− 1 yr− 1 for cauliflower. Cauliflower had the highest CF per ha followed by potatoes and pepper. Across the farm as a whole, the major CF hotspots were fuel use for both on-farm and off-farm operations (38%), fertilization (18%), soil emission (12%), and irrigation (11%). Simulation of a switch to biodiesel instead of petroleum gasoline and diesel resulted in a 32% reduction in the total farm CF. By identifying the CF hotspots of a whole farm and individual crops, particular inputs and activities can be targeted for modification in order to effectively reduce the farm's CF. © 2016

AB  - This paper presents a spreadsheet calculator to estimate biogas production and the operational revenue and costs for UK-based farm-fed anaerobic digesters. There exist sophisticated biogas production models in published literature, but the application of these in farm-fed anaerobic digesters is often impractical. This is due to the limited measuring devices, financial constraints, and the operators being non-experts in anaerobic digestion. The proposed biogas production model is designed to use the measured process variables typically available at farm-fed digesters, accounting for the effects of retention time, temperature and imperfect mixing. The estimation of the operational revenue and costs allow the owners to assess the most profitable approach to run the process. This would support the sustained use of the technology. The calculator is first compared with literature reported data, and then applied to the digester unit on a UK Farm to demonstrate its use in a practical setting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ production of fatty acid methyl esters from swine fat via thermally induced pseudo-catalytic transesterification on silica was investigated in this study. Instead of methanol, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as acyl acceptor to achieve environmental benefits and economic viability. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of swine fat reveals that swine fat contains 19.57 wt.% of water and impurities. Moreover, the fatty acid profiles obtained under various conditions (extracted swine oil + methanol + NaOH, extracted swine oil + DMC + pseudo-catalytic, and swine fat + DMC + pseudo-catalytic) were compared. These profiles were identical, showing that the introduced in-situ transesterification is technically feasible. This also suggests that in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification has a high tolerance against impurities. This study also shows that FAME yield via in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification of swine fat reached up to 97.2% at 380 °C. Therefore, in-situ pseudo-catalytic transesterification can be applicable to biodiesel production of other oil-bearing biomass feedstocks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent European Directives promoted the development of biofuels, requesting mandatory limits to their emissions ot greenhouse gases (GHG). Second-generation biofuels based on lignocellulosic biomass are prime candidates but their GHG emissions are variable and uncertain. Agro-ecosystem modeling can capture them and the performance of biofuel feedstocks. This study aimed at optimizing feedstock supply for a bioethanol unit in France, from agricultural residues, annual and perennial crops. Their productivity and environmental impacts were modelled on a regional scale using geo-referenced data on soil properties, crop management, land-use and future weather data. Several supply scenarios were tested. Cereal straw was the most efficient feedstock but had a low availability, and only miscanthus could meet the bioethanol plant's demand. Sorghum combined poor yields and high GHG emissions compared by miscanthus and triticale. A mix of three biomass sources used less than 3% of the regional agricultural land while abating GHG emissions by 60%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We use biofuel patents as a proxy for biofuel innovation. Through use of natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms, we expand patent classification capabilities to better explain the history of biofuels innovation. Results indicate that after the initial establishment of the U.S. biofuel industry, there were two surges in biofuel innovation: 1995–2000, characterized by heavy patenting by 1st generation (food-based) biofuel firms; and 2005–2010, characterized by a second surge of innovation by those same large firms, complemented by a large number of biotechnology firms producing a relatively small number of 2nd generation biofuel patents. Our analysis corroborates the widespread understanding that the first surge in biofuel innovation was linked to innovations in agriculture, and that the second surge of biofuel innovation was driven by demand-pull policies mandating and incentivizing biofuels. But the slow emergence of a 2nd generation cellulose-based biofuels industry, far slower than called for by policy, suggests that technology-push policies more focused on R&D and investment may be needed to accelerate the commercialization of 2nd generation biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conversion of Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) as a Caspian Sea's green macroalgae into gaseous, liquid and solid products was carried out via pyrolysis at different temperatures to determine its potential for bio-oil and hydrogen-rich gas production for further industrial utilization. Non-catalytic tests were performed to determine the optimum condition for bio-oil production. The highest portion of bio-oil was retrieved at 500 °C. The catalytic test was performed using the bio-char derived at 500 °C as a catalyst. Effect of the addition of the algal bio-char on the composition of the bio-oil and also gaseous products was investigated. Pyrolysis derived bio-char was characterized by BET, FESEM and ICP method to show its surface area, porosity, and presence of inorganic metals on its surface, respectively. Phenols were increased from 8.5 to 20.76 area% by the addition of bio-char. Moreover, the hydrogen concentration and hydrogen selectivity were also enhanced by the factors of 1.37, 1.59 respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainability has been considered essential for the future consumption of biofuels in large scale and, thus, assessing the impacts on water resources is one of the priorities. The aim of this study is to assess the potential impacts of sugarcane expansion both on the quality and on the quantity of water resources, but using a publicly available database and well-established statistic procedures. The case studies were defined in São Paulo state, where the bulk of sugarcane production in Brazil is, and more specifically three regions where significant expansion recently occurred: Palmares Paulista, Pontal, and Ribeirão Preto. Time series of streamflows and precipitations (1974–2011) and water quality parameters (1989–2011) were evaluated using non-parametric tests for detecting trends and abrupt changes. Quality parameters analyzed were concentrations of potassium, total phosphorus, nitrite, nitrate, ammoniacal nitrogen, total solids, dissolved oxygen, and biochemical oxygen demand. Sugarcane cropping data were correlated with streamflows and water quality parameters. Water quality parameters were analyzed vis-à-vis sugarcane production and population growth. Significant impacts due to sugarcane cropping were detected only in the case of the smallest basin. In the three studied regions a significant increasing trend of nitrogen and biochemical oxygen demand was observed, but these results can be explained either by sugarcane–ethanol production or by the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents without appropriate treatment. Based on data availability it was not possible to rigorously determine the contribution of large-scale production of sugarcane cropping to both the quantity and the quality of water resources. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Landscape design has been embraced as a promising approach to holistically balance multiple goals related to environmental and resource management processes to meet future provisioning and regulating ecosystem services needs. In the agricultural context, growing bioenergy crops in specific landscape positions instead of dedicated fields has the potential to improve their sustainability, provide ecosystem services, and minimize competition with other land uses. However, growing bioenergy crops in sub-productive or environmentally vulnerable parts of a field implies more complex logistics as small amounts of biomass are generated in a distributed way across the landscape. We present a novel assessment of the differences in production and logistic costs between business as usual (BAU, dedicated fields), and distributed landscape production of shrub, or short-rotation willow for bioenergy within a US Midwestern landscape. Our findings show that regardless of the mode of cropping, BAU or landscape design, growing shrub willows is unlikely to provide positive revenues (−$67 to –$303 ha−1 yr−1 at a biomass price of $46.30 Mgwet −1) because of high land rental costs in this agricultural region. However, when translated into a practice cost per unit of N removed at the watershed scale (range: $1.8–37.0 kg N−1 yr−1), the net costs are comparable to other conservation practices. The projected opportunity cost of growing willows instead of corn on underproductive areas varied between –$14 and $49 Mgwet −1. This highlights the potential for willows to be a cost effective choice depending on the intra-field grain productivity, biomass price and desirable concurrent ecosystem services. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Agricultural expansion driven by growing demand has been a key driver for carbon stock change as a consequence of land-use change (CSC-LUC). However, its relative role compared to non-agricultural and non-productive drivers, as well as propagating effects were not clearly addressed. This study contributed to this subject by providing alternative perspectives in addressing these missing links. A method was developed to allocate historical CSC-LUC to agricultural expansions by land classes (products), trade, and end use. The analysis for 1995–2010 leads to three key trends: (i) agricultural land degradation and abandonment is found to be a major (albeit indirect) driver for CSC-LUC, (ii) CSC-LUC is spurred by the growth of cross-border trade, (iii) non-food use (excluding liquid biofuels) has emerged as a significant contributor of CSC-LUC in the 2000's. In addition, the study demonstrated that exact values of CSC-LUC at a single spatio-temporal point may change significantly with different methodological settings. For example, CSC-LUC allocated to ‘permanent oil crops’ changed from 0.53 Pg C (billion tonne C) of carbon stock gain to 0.11 Pg C of carbon stock loss when spatial boundaries were changed from global to regional. Instead of comparing exact values for accounting purpose, key messages for policymaking were drawn from the main trends. Firstly, climate change mitigation efforts pursued through a territorial perspective may ignore indirect effects elsewhere triggered through trade linkages. Policies targeting specific commodities or types of consumption are also unable to quantitatively address indirect CSC-LUC effects because the quantification changes with different arbitrary methodological settings. Instead, it is recommended that mobilising non-productive or under-utilised lands for productive use should be targeted as a key solution to avoid direct and indirect CSC-LUC. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of bioethanol (EtOH) from perennial Arundo donax L. feedstock. A “cradle-to-wheel” approach was applied considering primary data for the cultivation of dedicated crops on hilly marginal lands and innovative “second generation technologies” for feedstock conversion into EtOH. The goals of the study were to: (i) quantify impacts of lignocellulosic EtOH production/use chain, (ii) identify hotspots and (iii) compare the environmental performance of different bioethanol-gasoline vehicles, E10 (10% EtOH and 90% gasoline) and E85 (85% EtOH and 15% gasoline), with a conventional gasoline passenger car. Results for E85 underlined that the feedstock production and the use phase were the prevailing contributors, whilst for E10 the gasoline production phase shared the largest part of impacts. The comparison showed that vehicles using lignocellulosic bioethanol have potentially significant benefits on global warming, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant formation and fossil depletion in respect to conventional passenger car. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Negative emissions technologies have garnered increasing attention in the wake of the Paris target to curb global warming to 1.5 °C. However, much of the literature on carbon dioxide removal focuses on technical feasibility, and several significant social barriers to scale-up of these technologies have been glossed over. This paper reviews the existing literature on the social implications of rapidly ramping up carbon dioxide removal. It also explores the applicability of previous empirical social science research on intersecting topics, with examples drawn from research on first- and second-generation biofuels and forest carbon projects. Social science fieldwork and case studies of land use change, agricultural and energy system change, and technology adoption and diffusion can help in both anticipating the social implications of emerging negative emissions technologies and understanding the factors that shape trajectories of technological development. By integrating empirical research on public and producer perceptions, barriers to adoption, conditions driving new technologies, and social impacts, projections about negative emissions technologies can become more realistic and more useful to climate change policymaking. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Proof of principle of biohythane and potential energy production from garden waste (GW) is demonstrated in this study in a two-step process coupling dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. The synergistic effect of using co-cultures of extreme thermophiles to intensify biohydrogen dark fermentation is demonstrated using xylose, cellobiose and GW. Co-culture of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and Thermotoga maritima showed higher hydrogen production yields from xylose (2.7 ± 0.1 mol mol−1 total sugar) and cellobiose (4.8 ± 0.3 mol mol−1 total sugar) compared to individual cultures. Co-culture of extreme thermophiles C. saccharolyticus and Caldicellulosiruptor bescii increased synergistically the hydrogen production yield from GW (98.3 ± 6.9 L kg−1 (VS)) compared to individual cultures and co-culture of T. maritima and C. saccharolyticus. The biochemical methane potential of the fermentation end-products was 322 ± 10 L kg−1 (CODt). Biohythane, a biogas enriched with 15% hydrogen could be obtained from GW, yielding a potential energy generation of 22.2 MJ kg−1 (VS). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae represent a promising feedstock for the sustainable production of biofuels and many other bio-commodities. However, the optimization of their productivity by assessing the impact that several environmental factors have on microalgae growth still requires intense investigation, as well as numerous and time consuming experiments. In this scenario, microscale technologies are emerging as a valuable tool to improve data production and accordingly to speed up the optimization process, while maintaining a high experimental reliability. Using these approaches for microalgae present additional challenges because of the necessity of dealing with light as a source of energy to support cell metabolism. Currently developed microscale platforms are complex, often requiring a deep experience in the microfluidic field to monitor the device functionality. To overcome this drawback while keeping microscale benefits, here we describe the use of a simple and flexible micro-photobioreactor (micro-PBR) coupled with a quick and reliable growth evaluation method. The system is demonstrated to sustain optimal growth of Nannochloropsis gaditana cells, allowing to assess the impact of different light intensities and to monitor the cells photosynthetic functionality by measuring chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence in vivo, while providing for a significant time reduction when compared to traditional experimental approaches. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New research is currently underway to explore the potential of macroalgae for the production of biofuels. Marine biofuels in general and macroalgae in particular, offer a number of advantages over terrestrial biofuels including reduced competition for freshwater resources and for land use. Sugars can be extracted from macroalgae and processed into biofuels by anaerobic digestion and fermentation. This process generates significant waste biomass, which, if used, could improve the economic sustainability of the biorefinery sector. Bivalves' aquaculture relies heavily on the production of unicellular algae to feed juvenile individuals and this can represent a bottleneck for the bivalve industry especially in locations where sunlight is limited. Previous research explored the use of macroalgae derived digestate as alternative or integrative feed for juvenile bivalves, exploiting the notion that organic particulate matter (detritus) is an integral part of this animal class natural diet. The prospect of using waste products from the emerging biorefinery industry to solve a bottleneck for aquaculture businesses and, by so doing, improving profitability of both, is an exciting one. In this paper we describe the main nutritional profiles (Protein, Lipid, Carbohydrates and Fatty acids) of the tested diets and investigate the potential for the use of a biorefinery a by-product as replacement option for bivalves' production, by benchmarking it against aquaculture industry standards (live microalgae and commercially available algae paste) and natural detritus constituted by farmed sea urchin digesta. Both the digestate and the natural detritus supported the survival and growth of bivalve spat, especially when used at 50% inclusion rate, over the course of 4-week preliminary trials. Data suggest that a synergistic effect of the nutritional profiles of the diets employed may underpin the observed results. Statement of relevance With this study we compare the biochemical composition and suitability as oyster feed of the Single Cell Detritus produced by S. latissima enzymatic saccharification and natural detritus produced by sea urchin digestive action, with live microalgae as well as commercial algae paste. A comparison between biochemical composition and suitability as aquaculture feed between biorefinery by-products and natural detritus was, to our knowledge, lacking. Results indicate that both the digestate and the natural detritus supported the survival and growth of oyster spat, especially when used at 50% inclusion rate, over the course of 4-weeks trial. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We studied the possible roles of flavonoids in the antioxidant and antiherbivore chemistry in Jatropha curcas (L.), a Latin American shrub that holds great potential as a source of biofuel. Changes in flavonoid concentrations in the leaves of J. curcas seedlings exposed to artificial damage and to different rainfall patterns were assessed by applying a 32-factorial experiment in a greenhouse. The concentrations of different flavonoids in the leaves of seedlings were significantly affected by interaction effects of artificial damage, drought stress and age of the seedling. The highest flavonoid concentrations were obtained in seedlings imposed to the highest percentage of artificial damage (50 %) and grown under extreme drought stress (200 mm year−1). In this treatment combination, flavonoid concentrations were three-fold as compared to seedlings exposed to the same level of artificial damage but grown in 1900 mm year−1 rainfall application. Without artificial damage, the concentration of flavonoids in the seedlings grown in 200 mm year−1 rainfall application was still two-fold compared to seedlings grown in higher (&gt;800 mm year−1) rainfall applications. Thus, the observed flavonoid concentration patterns in the leaves of J. curcas seedlings were primarily triggered by drought stress and light rather than by artificial damage, suggesting that drought causes oxidative stress in J. curcas. © 2016, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.

AB  - In recognition of the opportunities associated with climate change, the finance sector have engaged in market based activities via the acquisition of land for ecosystem services, such as biofuel production or forestry for carbon sequestration. Many of these investments are global in scope; with finance capital from the Global North directed into the acquisition of land in the global South. We take the case study of the self-proclaimed largest plantation forestry operator on the African continent, the Norwegian company, Green Resources and their Ugandan land acquisition, to explore, firstly, the claims-making associated with the expanding financialisation of land and natural resources and secondly, the new corporate enclosures engendered via such companies' participation in the expanding carbon economy. Our findings show that investor claims regarding the economic development and environmental sustainability at the site level do not match with the lived reality of Ugandan villagers at the investment site. Whilst carbon capture is possible, it is outweighed by a suite of social and environment ills, including forced dispossession, biodiversity loss and chemical pollution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To achieve the goals of energy security and climate change mitigation in Denmark and the EU, an expansion of national production of bioenergy crops is needed. Temporal and spatial variation of yields of willow and Miscanthus is not known for Denmark because of a limited number of field trial data. The semi-mechanistic crop model BioCro was used to simulate the production of both short-rotation coppice (SRC) willow and Miscanthus across Denmark. Predictions were made from high spatial resolution soil data and weather records across this area for 1990–2010. The potential average, rain-fed mean yield was 12.1 Mg DM ha−1 yr−1 for willow and 10.2 Mg DM ha−1 yr−1 for Miscanthus. Coefficient of variation as a measure for yield stability was poorest on the sandy soils of northern and western Jutland, and the year-to-year variation in yield was greatest on these soils. Willow was predicted to outyield Miscanthus on poor, sandy soils, whereas Miscanthus was higher yielding on clay-rich soils. The major driver of yield in both crops was variation in soil moisture, with radiation and precipitation exerting less influence. This is the first time these two major feedstocks for northern Europe have been compared within a single modeling framework and providing an important new tool for decision-making in selection of feedstocks for emerging bioenergy systems. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - In less than a decade, biofuels transitioned from being a socially and politically acceptable alternative to conventional transport fuels to a deeply contested solution. Claims of land grabs, forest loss and food riots emerged to undermine the sustainability rationale that originally motivated their adoption. One of the early controversies to hit biofuels was that of food versus fuel. This framing drew attention not only to the competing uses of land i.e. for food or for fuel, but also to the impacts of consumption on marginalised people, particularly in the global South. While the debate has provided a useful hook on which to hang criticisms of increased demand for biofuels, it also masks a more complex reality. In particular, the multifaceted and global linkages between the stewardship of land, the food sector, and global energy policies. In this paper, we use the debate on food versus fuel as a lens to examine the interdependencies between the multiple end-uses of feedstocks and the multifunctionality of land. Revealing a more nuanced understanding of the realities of agricultural networks, land use conflicts and the values of the people managing land, we argue that the simplification achieved by food versus fuel, although effective in generating public resonance that has filtered into political response, has failed to capture much that is at the heart of the issue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Temperate grasslands have suffered disproportionally from conversion to cropland, degradation and fragmentation. A large proportion of the world’s remaining near-natural grassland is situated in Kazakhstan. We aimed to assess current and emerging threats to steppe and semi-desert biodiversity in Kazakhstan and evaluate conservation research priorities. We conducted a horizon-scanning exercise among conservationists from academia and practice. We first compiled a list of 45 potential threats. These were then ranked by the survey participants according to their perceived severity, the need for research on them, and their novelty. The highest-ranked threats were related to changes in land use (leading to habitat loss and deterioration), direct persecution of wildlife, and rapid infrastructure development due to economic and population growth. Research needs were identified largely in the same areas, and the mean scores of threat severity and research need were highly correlated. Novel threats comprised habitat loss by photovoltaic and wind power stations, climate change and changes in agriculture such as the introduction of biofuels. However, novelty was not correlated with threat severity or research priority, suggesting that the most severe threats are the established ones. Important goals towards more effective steppe and semi-desert conservation in Kazakhstan include more cross-sector collaboration (e.g. by involving stakeholders in conservation and agriculture), greater allocation of funds to under-staffed areas (e.g. protected area management), better representativeness and complementarity in the protected area system and enhanced data collection for wildlife monitoring and threat assessments (including the use of citizen-science databases). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Converting land to biofuel feedstock production incurs changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) that can influence biofuel life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Estimates of these land use change (LUC) and life-cycle GHG emissions affect biofuels' attractiveness and eligibility under a number of renewable fuel policies in the USA and abroad. Modeling was used to refine the spatial resolution and depth extent of domestic estimates of SOC change for land (cropland, cropland pasture, grassland, and forest) conversion scenarios to biofuel crops (corn, corn stover, switchgrass, Miscanthus, poplar, and willow) at the county level in the USA. Results show that in most regions, conversions from cropland and cropland pasture to biofuel crops led to neutral or small levels of SOC sequestration, while conversion of grassland and forest generally caused net SOC loss. SOC change results were incorporated into the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model to assess their influence on life-cycle GHG emissions of corn and cellulosic ethanol. Total LUC GHG emissions (g CO2eq MJ−1) were 2.1–9.3 for corn-, −0.7 for corn stover-, −3.4 to 12.9 for switchgrass-, and −20.1 to −6.2 for Miscanthus ethanol; these varied with SOC modeling assumptions applied. Extending the soil depth from 30 to 100 cm affected spatially explicit SOC change and overall LUC GHG emissions; however, the influence on LUC GHG emission estimates was less significant in corn and corn stover than cellulosic feedstocks. Total life-cycle GHG emissions (g CO2eq MJ−1, 100 cm) were estimated to be 59–66 for corn ethanol, 14 for stover ethanol, 18–26 for switchgrass ethanol, and −7 to −0.6 for Miscanthus ethanol. The LUC GHG emissions associated with poplar- and willow-derived ethanol may be higher than that for switchgrass ethanol due to lower biomass yield. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Perennial, cellulosic bioenergy crops represent a risky investment. The potential for adoption of these crops depends not only on mean net returns, but also on the associated probability distributions and on the risk preferences of farmers. Using 6-year observed crop yield data from highly productive and marginally productive sites in the southern Great Lakes region and assuming risk neutrality, we calculate expected breakeven biomass yields and prices compared to corn (Zea mays L.) as a benchmark. Next we develop Monte Carlo budget simulations based on stochastic crop prices and yields. The crop yield simulations decompose yield risk into three components: crop establishment survival, time to maturity, and mature yield variability. Results reveal that corn with harvest of grain and 38% of stover (as cellulosic bioenergy feedstock) is both the most profitable and the least risky investment option. It dominates all perennial systems considered across a wide range of farmer risk preferences. Although not currently attractive for profit-oriented farmers who are risk neutral or risk averse, perennial bioenergy crops have a higher potential to successfully compete with corn under marginal crop production conditions. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Spatially accurate and reliable estimates from fast-growing plantations are a key factor for planning energy supply. This study aimed to estimate the yield of biomass from short rotation willow plantations in northern Europe. The data were based on harvesting records from 1790 commercial plantations in Sweden, grouped into three ad hoc categories: low, middle and high performance. The predictors included climatic variables, allowing the spatial extrapolation to nearby countries. The modeling and spatialization of the estimates used boosted regression trees, a method based on machine learning. The average RMSE for the final models selected was 0.33, 0.39 and 1.91 (corresponding to R2= 0.77, 0.88 and 0.45), for the low, medium and high performance categories, respectively. The models were then applied to obtain 1×1 km yield estimates in the rest of Sweden, as well as for Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland. The results demonstrated a large regional variation. For the first rotation under high performance conditions, the country averages were as follows: &gt;7 odt ha−1 yr−1 in the Baltic coast of Germany, &gt;6 odt ha−1 yr−1 in Denmark, &gt;5 odt ha−1 yr−1 in the Baltic coast of Poland and between 4–5 odt ha−1 yr−1 in the rest. The results of this approach indicate that they can provide faster and more accurate predictions than previous modeling approaches and can offer interesting possibilities in the field of yield modeling. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - In the UK and other temperate regions, short rotation coppice (SRC) and Miscanthus x giganteus (Miscanthus) are two of the leading ‘second-generation’ bioenergy crops. Grown specifically as a low-carbon (C) fossil fuel replacement, calculations of the climate mitigation provided by these bioenergy crops rely on accurate data. There are concerns that uncertainty about impacts on soil C stocks of transitions from current agricultural land use to these bioenergy crops could lead to either an under- or overestimate of their climate mitigation potential. Here, for locations across mainland Great Britain (GB), a paired-site approach and a combination of 30-cm- and 1-m-deep soil sampling were used to quantify impacts of bioenergy land-use transitions on soil C stocks in 41 commercial land-use transitions; 12 arable to SRC, 9 grasslands to SRC, 11 arable to Miscanthus and 9 grasslands to Miscanthus. Mean soil C stocks were lower under both bioenergy crops than under the grassland controls but only significant at 0–30 cm. Mean soil C stocks at 0–30 cm were 33.55 ± 7.52 Mg C ha−1 and 26.83 ± 8.08 Mg C ha−1 lower under SRC (P = 0.004) and Miscanthus plantations (P = 0.001), respectively. Differences between bioenergy crops and arable controls were not significant in either the 30-cm or 1-m soil cores and smaller than for transitions from grassland. No correlation was detected between change in soil C stock and bioenergy crop age (time since establishment) or soil texture. Change in soil C stock was, however, negatively correlated with the soil C stock in the original land use. We suggest, therefore, that selection of sites for bioenergy crop establishment with lower soil C stocks, most often under arable land use, is the most likely to result in increased soil C stocks. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Renewable fuel standards in the US and elsewhere mandate the production of large quantities of cellulosic biofuels with low greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints, a requirement which will likely entail extensive cultivation of dedicated bioenergy feedstock crops on marginal agricultural lands. Performance data for such systems is sparse, and non-linear interactions between the feedstock species, agronomic management intensity, and underlying soil and land characteristics complicate the development of sustainable landscape design strategies for low-impact commercial-scale feedstock production. Process-based ecosystem models are valuable for extrapolating field trial results and making predictions of productivity and associated environmental impacts that integrate the effects of spatially variable environmental factors across diverse production landscapes. However, there are few examples of ecosystem model parameterization against field trials on both prime and marginal lands or of conducting landscape-scale analyses at sufficient resolution to capture interactions between soil type, land use, and management intensity. In this work we used a data-diverse, multi-criteria approach to parameterize and validate the DayCent biogeochemistry model for upland and lowland switchgrass using data on yields, soil carbon changes, and soil nitrous oxide emissions from US field trials spanning a range of climates, soil types, and management conditions. We then conducted a high-resolution case study analysis of a real-world cellulosic biofuel landscape in Kansas in order to estimate feedstock production potential and associated direct biogenic GHG emissions footprint. Our results suggest that switchgrass yields and emissions balance can vary greatly across a landscape large enough to supply a biorefinery in response to variations in soil type and land-use history, but that within a given land base both of these performance factors can be widely modulated by changing management intensity. This in turn implies a large sustainable cellulosic biofuel landscape design space within which a system can be optimized to meet economic or environmental objectives. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Suggestions that novel, non-food, dedicated biomass crops used to produce bioenergy may provide opportunities to diversify and reinstate biodiversity in intensively managed farmland have not yet been fully tested at the landscape scale. Using two of the largest, currently available landscape-scale biodiversity data sets from arable and biomass bioenergy crops, we take a taxonomic and functional trait approach to quantify and contrast the consequences for biodiversity indicators of adopting dedicated biomass crops on land previously cultivated under annual, rotational arable cropping. The abundance and community compositions of biodiversity indicators in fields of break and cereal crops changed when planted with the dedicated biomass crops, miscanthus and short rotation coppiced (SRC) willow. Weed biomass was consistently greater in the two dedicated biomass crops than in cereals, and invertebrate abundance was similarly consistently higher than in break crops. Using canonical variates analysis, we identified distinct plant and invertebrate taxa and trait-based communities in miscanthus and SRC willows, whereas break and cereal crops tended to form a single, composite community. Seedbanks were shown to reflect the longer term effects of crop management. Our study suggests that miscanthus and SRC willows, and the management associated with perennial cropping, would support significant amounts of biodiversity when compared with annual arable crops. We recommend the strategic planting of these perennial, dedicated biomass crops in arable farmland to increase landscape heterogeneity and enhance ecosystem function, and simultaneously work towards striking a balance between energy and food security. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - In the context of environmental sustainability there has been an increasing interest in bioenergy production from renewable resources, and is expected that European biofuel production from energy crops will increase as a consequence of the achievement of policy targets. The aim of this paper is to assess the agronomic feasibility of biomass crop cultivation to provide profitable renewable feedstocks in a marginal and heavy-metal polluted area located in the Sulcis district, Sardinia (Italy). Results from literature review and unpublished data from field trials carried out in Sardinia were analysed to establish the main agronomic traits of crops (e.g., yield potential and input requirements). A Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure with remotely sensed data is also used to evaluate the land suitability and the actual land use/cover, considering a future scenario of expansion of energy crops on these marginal areas avoiding potential conflicts with food production. The results of the review suggests that giant reed, native perennial grasses and milk thistle are the most suitable energy crops for this area. The land suitability analysis shows that about 5700 ha and 1000 ha could be available for feedstock cultivation in the study area and in the most polluted area, respectively. The results obtained from land suitability process and agronomic evaluation will serve as a base to support technical and economical feasibility studies, as well as for the evaluation of environmental sustainability of the cultivation in the study area. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The desert-adapted crops vernonia (Centrapalus pauciflorus), lesquerella (Physaria fendleri), and camelina (Camelina sativa) are being grown in the arid southwestern USA as potential feedstock for biofuel and/or other environmentally friendly products. A plant feeding choice test was conducted to determine the relative attractiveness of these three "new" crops to a possible insect pest, Lygus hesperus Knight. Adult L. hesperus were readily observed feeding or resting on the flowering structures of each plant type, but they were seen most often on vernonia and least often on camelina. Lygus hesperus readily deposited their eggs on each plant species, but again, the greatest amount of egg deposition was found on vernonia and the least on camelina. These studies indicate that L. hesperus might pose a threat to the production of these new crops. Moreover, the commercial expansion of these crops could significantly alter the population dynamics of the existing arthropod community. New challenges for managing this pest during regional crop production changes are discussed. © 2016.

AB  - Giant Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) is a perennial, warm-season C4 grass. It is a sterile triploid that grows rapidly, accumulates significant biomass, and has the potential to be a new bioenergy crop. Hexaploid Miscanthus × giganteus can be induced from triploid M × giganteus using colchicine. Here, we compared a range of parameters between triploid and hexaploid plants using phytochemical and histological analyses. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic energy spectrometry (ICP-AES) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed significant differences in the amounts of 21 microelements and macroelements elements (Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Ag, Ti, Zn, P, Si, S, Na, K, and Sr) between triploid and hexaploid plants. Additionally, phenolic compounds such as pyrogallol, catechin, veratric acid, o-coumaric acid, and myricetin were present at higher concentrations in leaf extracts of hexaploid plants compared to triploid plants. Pyrogallol, gentisic acid, chlorogenic acid, and catechin were also higher in the stem extracts of hexaploid plants. The cellulose content of leaf extracts of hexaploid plants was significantly higher than that of triploid plants, while total lignin content was higher in triploid plants. Significant differences were found between triploid and hexaploid plants for plant height, number of leaves, leaf length, leaf width, number of nodes, stem diameter, tiller number, fresh weight during both pre-flowering and post-flowering stages, and photosynthetic rate. Our analyses indicate that hexaploid M × giganteus exhibited superior agronomical traits and improved biomass yield compared to triploid plants and thus could be suitable for future large-scale biomass production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The goals of ensuring energy, water, food, and climate security can often conflict. Microalgae (algae) are being pursued as a feedstock for both food and fuels - primarily due to algae's high areal yield and ability to grow on non-arable land, thus avoiding common bioenergy-food tradeoffs. However, algal cultivation requires significant energy inputs that may limit potential emission reductions. We examine the tradeoffs associated with producing fuel and food from algae at the energy-food-water-climate nexus. We use the GCAM integrated assessment model to demonstrate that algal food production can promote reductions in land-use change emissions through the offset of conventional agriculture. However, fuel production, either via co-production of algal food and fuel or complete biomass conversion to fuel, is necessary to ensure long-term emission reductions, due to the high energy costs of cultivation. Cultivation of salt-water algae for food products may lead to substantial freshwater savings; but, nutrients for algae cultivation will need to be sourced from waste streams to ensure sustainability. By reducing the land demand of food production, while simultaneously enhancing food and energy security, algae can further enable the development of terrestrial bioenergy technologies including those utilizing carbon capture and storage. Our results demonstrate that large-scale algae research and commercialization efforts should focus on developing both food and energy products to achieve environmental goals. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel feedstocks provide a renewable energy source that can reduce fossil fuel emissions; however, if produced on a large scale they can also impact local to regional water and carbon budgets. Simulation results for 2005–2014 from a regional weather model adapted to simulate the growth of two perennial grass biofuel feedstocks suggest that replacing at least half the current annual cropland with these grasses would increase water use efficiency and drive greater rainfall downwind of perturbed grid cells, but increased evapotranspiration (ET) might switch the Mississippi River basin from having a net warm-season surplus of water (precipitation minus ET) to a net deficit. While this scenario reduces land required for biofuel feedstock production relative to current use for maize grain ethanol production, it only offsets approximately one decade of projected anthropogenic warming and increased water vapor results in greater atmospheric heat content. ©2016.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is the main liquid biofuel in the EU and is currently mainly produced from vegetable oils. Alternative feedstocks are lignocellulosic materials, which provide several benefits compared with many existing feedstocks. This study examined a technical process and its mass and energy balances to gain a systems perspective of combined biodiesel (FAME) and biogas production from straw using oleaginous yeasts. Important process parameters with a determining impact on overall mass and energy balances were identified and evaluated. Results: In the base case, 41% of energy in the biomass was converted to energy products, primary fossil fuel use was 0.37 MJprim/MJ produced and 5.74 MJ fossil fuels could be replaced per kg straw dry matter. The electricity and heat produced from burning the lignin were sufficient for process demands except in scenarios where the yeast was dried for lipid extraction. Using the residual yeast cell mass for biogas production greatly increased the energy yield, with biogas contributing 38% of total energy products. Conclusions: In extraction methods without drying the yeast, increasing lipid yield and decreasing the residence time for lipid accumulation are important for the energy and mass balance. Changing the lipid extraction method from wet to dry makes the greatest change to the mass and energy balance. Bioreactor agitation and aeration for lipid accumulation and yeast propagation is energy demanding. Changes in sugar concentration in the hydrolysate and residence times for lipid accumulation greatly affect electricity demand, but have relatively small impacts on fossil energy use (NER) and energy yield (EE). The impact would probably be greater if externally produced electricity were used. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of the present work is to determine the potentials of woody residues from agriculture (tree trimmings or vine shoots) for fuel applications. Fraunhofer UMSICHT is carrying out research for a new thermochemical conversion technology to convert biogenic residues into valuable storable products, such as carbonizates, hydrogen, and fuel. Thermo-catalytic reforming (TCR) is an intermediate pyrolysis combined with a unique integrated catalytic reforming step. In this experimental study, the TCR of three different woody biomasses has been investigated in a 2 kg/h laboratory-scale plant. The feedstocks were woody residues produced from the pruning of agricultural lands. This is a sustainable biomass solution with an up-to-date great unexploited potential. The results revealed that the composition of the feedstock had only a minor effect in the compositions and characterizations of the products, with the catalytic reforming step at 973 K. The gas had a higher heating value between 14.6 and 14.9 MJ/kg and a high H2 content at 33-36 vol %. The bio-oil obtained had a low water content and a high heating value. The high quality of the bio-oil is reflected in the low O/C ratio of 0.15 ± 0.04. The study revealed that the quality of pyrolysis bio-oils of other processes, such as fast pyrolysis, is only comparable to TCR bio-oils after additional intense hydrodeoxygenation treatment. The carbonizate generated had a high heating value and a high carbon content. As a result of the low O/C ratio, the carbonizate has a high stability and, consequently, good carbon storage in soil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofuel crops are gaining importance because of the need to replace non-renewable sources. Also, due to the increasing amounts of wastes generated, there is the need to recycle them to the soil, both to fertilize crops and to improve soil physical properties through organicmatter increase and microbiological changes in the rhizosphere.We therefore studied the influence of six biofuel crops (elephant grass, giant cane, sugarcane, blue gum, black cottonwood,willow) on the decomposition rateandenzymatic activityof compostedmunicipal solidwaste andpoultrymanure. Organic amendmentswere incubated inthe field (litterbag method), buried near each plant or bare soil. Biomass decrease and dehydrogenase, urease and acid phosphatase level in amendments was monitored over a 180-day period. Soil under the litterbags was analysed for the same enzymatic activity and organic matter fractions (last sampling). After 365 days, a fractionation of organic matter was carried out in both amendments and soil under the litterbags. RESULTS: For compost, willow and sugarcane generally led to the greatest enzymatic activity, at the end of the experiment. For manure, dehydrogenase activity decreased sharplywith time, the smallest value near sugarcane, while phosphatase and urease generally presented the highest values, at the beginning or after 90 days’ incubation. Clustering showed that plant species could be grouped based on biomass and enzymesmeasured over time. CONCLUSIONS: Plant species influenced the decomposition rate and enzymatic activities of the organic amendments. Overall, mineralization of both amendments was associated with a greater urease activity in soils. Dehydrogenase activity in manure was closely associated with urease activity. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Background: In an effort to find economical, carbon-neutral transportation fuels, biomass feedstock compositional analysis methods are used to monitor, compare, and improve biofuel conversion processes. These methods are empirical, and the analytical variability seen in the feedstock compositional data propagates into variability in the conversion yields, component balances, mass balances, and ultimately the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP). We report the average composition and standard deviations of 119 individually extracted National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) bagasse [Reference Material (RM) 8491] run by seven analysts over 7 years. Two additional datasets, using bulk-extracted bagasse (containing 58 and 291 replicates each), were examined to separate out the effects of batch, analyst, sugar recovery standard calculation method, and extractions from the total analytical variability seen in the individually extracted dataset. We believe this is the world's largest NIST bagasse compositional analysis dataset and it provides unique insight into the long-term analytical variability. Understanding the long-term variability of the feedstock analysis will help determine the minimum difference that can be detected in yield, mass balance, and efficiency calculations. Results: The long-term data show consistent bagasse component values through time and by different analysts. This suggests that the standard compositional analysis methods were performed consistently and that the bagasse RM itself remained unchanged during this time period. The long-term variability seen here is generally higher than short-term variabilities. It is worth noting that the effect of short-term or long-term feedstock compositional variability on MESP is small, about $0.03 per gallon. Conclusions: The long-term analysis variabilities reported here are plausible minimum values for these methods, though not necessarily average or expected variabilities. We must emphasize the importance of training and good analytical procedures needed to generate this data. When combined with a robust QA/QC oversight protocol, these empirical methods can be relied upon to generate high-quality data over a long period of time. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper describes the process of developing a technology roadmap for deploying bioenergy technologies at a country level. A method for energy technology roadmapping adapted to the conditions of developing countries is proposed. This method combines an acknowledged roadmapping framework from prior art, a new strategy to build consensus based on the Delphi method and a strong focus on analytical modeling for supporting expert judgment. This method aims to be simple, transparent and affordable. The proposed method is applied to Colombia for creating a plan to deploy sustainable bioenergy technologies in Colombia until 2030. This plan consists of a set of long-term goals, milestones, barriers and action items identified by over 30 experts for key bioenergy technology areas (viz. bioethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, biomethane, biogas, waste-to-energy and power generation and combined heat and power). Finally, the relevance of the process of developing a technology roadmap for bioenergy exploitation in Colombia in other developing countries is discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to assess indirect land use change (iLUC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of Thailand's bioethanol policy by using consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) and a systematic iLUC model based on global land market. The results indicated the risk that life cycle GHG emissions of cassava- and molasses-based bioethanol systems may outweigh those from their fossil fuel counterparts both with and without the iLUC effects. The iLUC emissions from bioethanol were around 39%–76% (±8–15%) of the gasoline GHG emission baseline. Inclusion of relevant suppliers for the use of fully utilised by-products which are renewable energy sources (i.e. molasses and bagasse) highly affected the GHG consequences. Various controlled conditions such as non-fully utilised molasses and bagasse potentially lead to significant GHG reductions. The additional molasses and bagasse production dedicated specifically for bioethanol production potentially contribute to substantial GHG reductions. Further studies are required to determine other environmental impacts from bioethanol and to consider other iLUC modelling choices and emerging research development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thailand depends heavily on importation of fossil oil to satisfy its energy demand. The transportation sector is an important contributor to energy demand; biofuels are therefore strongly promoted in Thailand, notably biodiesel from oil palm. According to the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2012–2021) a biodiesel target of 5.97 million litres per day is to be achieved by 2021. This research focuses on assessing the implication of this on oil palm plantation area requirement, regions most suitable for its expansion and related greenhouse gas (GHG) implications as well as feedstock security. The investigations revealed that about 91,200 ha of land would be required for oil palm expansion to achieve the biodiesel target while also meeting other requirements for palm oil including domestic consumption, export, stock and surplus. The Eastern and Southern regions were identified as the two most suitable for oil palm cultivation with respectively 29,772 ha and 61,427 ha of mainly grassland and abandoned land. Oil palm expansion in the East would lead to overall land use change related GHG savings amounting to 47,214 tonnes CO2-eq per year. Oil palm expansion in the South would also bring GHG savings, 2.5 times higher than for the East. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of wheat was investigated under batch conditions. The article compares the potential net energy yield between a winter wheat (sown in the autumn) and a spring wheat (sown in the spring) grown in the same year and harvested at the same growth stage in the same farm. The spring wheat had a slightly higher biochemical methane potential and required lower energy inputs in cultivation, but produced a lower dry biomass yield per hectare, which resulted in winter wheat providing the best overall net energy yield. The difference was small; both varieties gave a good net energy yield. Spring sowing may also offer the opportunity for growing an additional over-winter catch crop for spring harvest, thus increasing the overall biomass yield per hectare, with both crops being potential digester feedstocks. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Climate change means that countries like Canada need to find suitable transition pathways to overcome fossil-fuel dependence; one such pathway is the so-called 'bio-economy'. The bio-economy is a term used to define an economic system in which biological resources (e.g., plants) form the basis of production and production processes. For example, it would involve the replacement of petroleum energy, inputs, chemicals, and products with bioenergy, biological inputs, bio-chemicals, and bio-products. A number of countries and jurisdictions have established policy strategies in order to promote and support the development of a bio-economy, exemplified by the European Union where the bio-economy represents a key pillar in its broader Horizon 2020 strategy. Other countries, like Canada, do not yet have an over-arching bio-economy strategy, but have a series of diverse, and often competing, policy visions and frameworks. It is useful to analyse countries like Canada in order to understand how these policy visions and policy frameworks are co-constituted, and what this might mean for the development of an over-arching bio-economy strategy. This raises a number of questions: How is the bio-economy imagined by different social actors? How are these imaginaries and policy frameworks co-produced?. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - This work describes how dark fermentation (DF), anaerobic digestion (AD) and microbial fuel cells (MFC) and solid-liquid separation can be integrated to co-produce valuable biochemicals (hydrogen and methane), bioelectricity and biofertilizers. Two integrated systems (System 1: AD + MFC, and System 2: DF + AD + MFC) are described and compared to a traditional one-stage AD system in converting a mixture (COD = 124 ± 8.1 gO2 kg−1 Fresh Matter) of swine manure and rice bran. System 1 gave a biomethane yield of 182 LCH4 kg−1 COD-added, while System 2 gave L yields of bio-hydrogen and bio-methane of 27.3 ± 7.2 LH2 kg−1 COD-addedand 154 ± 14 LCH4 kg−1 COD-added, respectively. A solid-liquid separation (SLS) step was applied to the digested slurry, giving solid and liquid fractions. The liquid fraction was treated via the MFC-steps, showing power densities of 12–13 W m−3(500 Ω) and average bioelectricity yields of 39.8 W h kg−1 CODto 54.2 W h kg−1 COD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The scope of this study is to evaluate the use of laboratory-scale landfill-bioreactors, operated consecutively under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, for the combined treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) with two different co-substrates of lignocellulosic nature, namely green waste (GW) and dried olive pomace (DOP). According to the results such a system would represent a promising option for eventual larger scale applications. Similar variation patterns among bioreactors indicate a relatively defined sequence of processes. Initially operating the systems under anaerobic conditions would allow energetic exploitation of the substrates, while the implementation of a leachate treatment system ultimately aiming at nutrient recovery, especially during the anaerobic phase, could be a profitable option for the whole system, due to the high organic load that characterizes this effluent. In order to improve the overall effectiveness of such a system, measures towards enhancing methane contents of produced biogas, such as substrate pretreatment, should be investigated. Moreover, the subsequent aerobic phase should have the goal of stabilizing the residual materials and finally obtain an end material eventually suitable for other purposes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, conversion of wastes from poultry farming and industry into biochar and bio-oil via thermochemical processes was investigated. Fuel characteristics and chemical structure of biochars and bio-oils have been investigated using standard fuel analysis and spectroscopic methods. Biochars were produced from poultry litter through both hydrothermal carbonization (sub-critical water, 175–250 °C) and pyrolysis over a temperature range between 250 and 500 °C. In comparison to hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis at lower temperatures produced biochar with greater energy yield due to the higher mass yield. Biochars obtained by both processes were comparable to coal. Hydrothermal liquefaction of poultry meal at different temperatures (200–325 °C) was conducted and compared to optimize its process conditions. Higher temperatures favored the formation of bio-crude oil, with a maximum yield of 35 wt.% at 300 °C. The higher heating values of bio-oils showed that bio-oil could be a potential source of synthetic fuels. However, elemental analysis demonstrated the high nitrogen content of bio-oils. Therefore, bio-oils obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of poultry meal should be upgraded for utilization as a transport and heating fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aeration pretreatment was demonstrated as an efficient technology to promote methane recovery from a bioreactor landfill with high food waste content. In this study, a short-term experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of aerobic-anaerobic operation modes on biogas recovery. Three landfill-simulated columns (anaerobic control (A1), a constant aeration (C1) and a gradually reduced aeration (C2)) were constructed and operated for 130 days. The aeration frequency was adjusted by oxygen consumption in an aerated MSW landfill. After aerobic pretreatment was halted, the methanogenic phase was rapidly developed in both the C1 and C2 columns, reducing the volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and increasing pH. The methane volumes per dry MSW produced from the C1 and C2 columns were approximately 62 L/kg VS and 75 L/kg VS, respectively, while methane produced from the A1 column was almost negligible. The result clearly showed that aerobic pretreatment with gradual reduction of aeration rates could not only improve methane recovery from waste decomposition, but also enhance leachate COD and VFA removal. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Better strains of green algae of desirable biomass yield and oil characteristics are important to algal-based bio-industries. Biomass-yield per unit time, oil productivity per unit biomass, chemical characteristics of oil, nutritional significance and biofuel potentials of the oil of eight different common freshwater-blooming green-algae are compared. Preliminary screening for lipid richness was carried out using Sudan-black lipid staining method. Selected algae were cultured in Bold's Basal Medium under uniform laboratory condition for 30 days. Fatty acid profiling was done by GCMS and the preliminary biodiesel feasibility was confirmed by FTIR. Percentage composition of omega-3, omega-6 and omega-7 group of fatty acids was used to assess the nutritional value of the oil. Algal biomass yield of the eight species varied from 35.4% to 201.6% mg/L/Day. The biomass-yield and oil productivity of Keratococcus bicaudatus is reported for the first time, which is quite comparable to Botryococcus spp., one of the universally well known species in this regard. Another species Monoraphidium obtusum is observed to contain good quantity of omega-3 fatty acids (13.18%). The oil of the different species of algae showed 6.06–82.14% saturated fatty acids, 1.14–25.92% monounsaturated fatty acids and 0.79–41.26% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Since C14 to C18 fatty acids are considered as the feed-stock for quality based biodiesel, presence of such fatty acids in the oil of all these algae is a preliminary indication for biodiesel feasibility of the same, further confirmed by FTIR of its methyl esters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low molar mass homopolymers, synthesized through free radical polymerization of acrylic acid under solvent control were reported. The polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR, TGA, and GPC. The behavior as pour point improvers in biodiesel and blends biodiesel/diesel, were evaluated. By using 1000 ppm of the poly(tetradecyl acrylate) (A14) it was possible to decrease the pour point (PP) of neat biodiesel to −10°C, blend B5 to −39°C and blend B20 to −28°C, values below those reported in the literature. These results indicated that it would be possible to use higher amount of biodiesel in blends with diesel in regions where their use would not be feasible, mainly because of their poor flow properties. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Taking a European Union focus, this paper explicitly models competing uses of biomass to quantify its contribution toward a sustainable low carbon model of economic growth. To this end, a state-of-the-art multisector multiregion modelling tool is combined with a specially developed bio-based variant of a well-known global database. Employing a decomposition method of the market drivers and classifying alternative future pathways, the aim is to understand how public policies can influence the apparent trade-off between the goals of lower carbon economic growth, environmental preservation and sustainable biomass usage. Results reveal that in targeting specific societal goals public policy can be effective, although this can lead to broader economic issues of resource inefficiency and even direct policy conflicts. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Computer models are useful tools for evaluating environmental and economic sustainability of proposed dedicated cellulosic grass ecosystems for biofuel production. This study developed an integrated, field scale, and process-based ecosystem model (DRAINMOD-GRASS) for simulating hydrological processes, soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and plant growth in cropping systems for producing bioenergy grasses in lowland areas. We tested the model using measurements from three replicated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) plots located in eastern North Carolina, USA. Results showed that the model accurately predicted 5-year (2009–2013) biomass yield. Predicted daily water table depth closely matched field measurements with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.86. The model also accurately predicted temporal dynamics of daily soil moisture and temperature with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. Predicted seasonal changes in net N mineralization and nitrification rates were comparable to field measurements in 2011 and 2012. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fatty acid methyl ester analysis (FAME) by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used technique in biodiesel/bioproduct (e.g. poly-unsaturated fatty acids, PUFA) research but typically does not allow distinguishing between bound and free fatty acids. To understand and optimize biosynthetic pathways, however, the origin of the fatty acid is an important information. Furthermore the annotation of PUFAs is compromised in classical GC-EI-MS because the precursor molecular ion is missing. In the present protocol an alkaline methyl esterification step with TMS derivatization enabling the simultaneous analysis of bound and free fatty acids but also further lipids such as sterols in one GC-MS chromatogram is combined. This protocol is applied to different lipid extracts from single cell algae to higher plants: Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Coffea arabica, Pisum sativum and Cuscuta japonica. Further, field ionization (GC-FI-MS) is introduced for a better annotation of fatty acids and exact determination of the number of double bonds in PUFAs. The proposed workflow provides a convenient strategy to analyze algae and other plant crop systems with respect to their capacity for third generation biodiesel and high-quality bioproducts for nutrition such as PUFAs.

AB  - Expected changes in European biofuel regulations lead to uncertainty in supply chain planning for second generation biofuel industries. Previous studies used optimization to design biofuels' supply chains and a few of them analyzed the impact of selected biofuel policy instruments on sustainability targets. This study presents a mixed integer programming model for the optimal design of second generation biofuel supply chains considering all policy instruments of European biofuel regulations. The model maximizes the net present value of second generation biofuel supply chains considering time-dependent quotas for biofuel market shares and greenhouse gas emission savings. The model includes multiple counting of second generation biofuel towards meeting biofuel market share targets and captures all greenhouse gas emissions of the second generation biofuel supply chain including land use change emissions. We demonstrated the use of the model through the case study of second generation biodiesel in a German region, and evaluated the sensitivity of the optimal solution to model parameters and policy instruments' levels. A set of remarks were made regarding the impact of policy instruments on the performance of second generation biodiesel supply chain under study. Future work entails the application of the analysis to the aggregate level in the European Union. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural lignocelluloses could represent great resources for the production of biofuels and renewable chemicals if the recalcitrant lignin polymer could be efficiently removed without negatively impacting the environment. Recently, a monocopper polyphenol oxidase (Tfu1114) from Thermobifida fusca was found capable of assisting the bacterium's own xylanase/cellulase to release reducing sugars from sugarcane bagasse. This study demonstrates that molecular oxygen was reduced to hydrogen peroxide by Tfu1114, coupled to the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, alkaline lignin, or sugarcane bagasse. Tfu1114 was able to reduce the total phenolic content of alkaline lignin and shift the molecular weight distribution to species with smaller sizes. Dilignol subunits such as syringaresinol and simulanol were generated in the hydrolysate of bagasse treated with Tfu1114. FTIR analysis suggests that Tfu1114 removed some C[sbnd]C and/or C[sbnd]O bonds adjacent to aromatic rings of lignin. From an applied perspective, Tfu1114 and cellulases acted in concert to release reducing sugars that were as usable as glucose for the cultivation of Escherichia coli, suggesting that toxins such as furfural and furan were absent, or at ignorable concentrations, in the hydrolysate. Tfu1114, therefore, represents a new type of lignin-degrading enzyme with potential to provide an eco-friendly way to modify the lignin in lignocellulose. © 2016

AB  - Marine macroalgae are potential resources for the sustainable production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Alginate, a major component of brown macroalgae, consists of two uronate monomers, which are further non-enzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate (DEH). In several marine bacteria, DEH is known to be metabolized via three enzymatic steps, consisting of DEH reductase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (KDG) kinase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase, which yields two glycolytic intermediates: D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. However, such functions of these enzymes for the DEH pathway have rarely been experimentally validated. In the present study, the DEH metabolic pathway was investigated in Saccharophagus degradans 2-40T, a marine bacterium that utilizes alginate. Through in vitro tests assisted by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the purified enzymes were functionally confirmed and annotated as dehR, kdgK, and kdpgA, respectively. In conclusion, we report the in vitro validation of the metabolic pathway of DEH monomerized from alginate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Measurements of CO2 fluxes in temperate climates have shown that urban areas are a net source of CO2 and that photosynthetic CO2 uptake is generally not sufficient to offset local CO2 emissions. However, little is known about the role of vegetation in cities where biogenic CO2 uptake is not limited to a 2–8 months growing season. This study used the eddy covariance technique to quantify the atmospheric CO2 fluxes over a period of 12 months in a residential area in subtropical Auckland, New Zealand, where the vegetation cover (surface cover fraction: 47%) is dominated by evergreen vegetation. Radiocarbon isotope measurements of CO2 were conducted at three different times of the day (06:00–09:00, 12:00–15:00, 01:00–04:00) for four consecutive weekdays in summer and winter to differentiate anthropogenic sources of CO2 (fossil fuel combustion) from biogenic sources (ecosystem respiration, combustion of biofuel/biomass). The results reveal previously unreported patterns for CO2 fluxes, with no seasonal variability and negative (net uptake) CO2 midday fluxes throughout the year, demonstrating photosynthetic uptake by the evergreen vegetation all year-round. The winter radiocarbon measurements showed that 85% of the CO2 during the morning rush hour was attributed to fossil fuel emissions, when wind was from residential areas. However, for all other time periods radiocarbon measurements showed that fossil fuel combustion was not a large source of CO2, suggesting that biogenic processes likely dominate CO2 fluxes at this residential site. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of vegetation in residential areas to mitigate local CO2 emissions, particularly in cities with a climate that allows evergreen vegetation to maintain high photosynthetic rates over winter. As urban areas grow, urban planners need to consider the role of urban greenspace to mitigate urban CO2 emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of liquid biofuels has expanded over the past decade in response to policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that promote their use for transportation. One rationale is the belief that biofuels are inherently carbon neutral, meaning that only production-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be tallied when comparing them to fossil fuels. This assumption is embedded in the lifecycle analysis (LCA) modeling used to justify and administer such policies. LCA studies have often found that crop-based biofuels such as corn ethanol and biodiesel offer at least modest net GHG reductions relative to petroleum fuels. Data over the period of RFS expansion enable empirical assessment of net CO2 emission effects. This analysis evaluates the direct carbon exchanges (both emissions and uptake) between the atmosphere and the U.S. vehicle-fuel system (motor vehicles and the physical supply chain for motor fuels) over 2005–2013. While U.S. biofuel use rose from 0.37 to 1.34 EJ/yr over this period, additional carbon uptake on cropland was enough to offset only 37 % of the biofuel-related biogenic CO2 emissions. This result falsifies the assumption of a full offset made by LCA and other GHG accounting methods that assume biofuel carbon neutrality. Once estimates from the literature for process emissions and displacement effects including land-use change are considered, the conclusion is that U.S. biofuel use to date is associated with a net increase rather than a net decrease in CO2 emissions. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Most contemporary land grab research focuses on the food and biofuel industries. In resource-rich countries such as Indonesia, however, the prevalent form of land transfers is investment in and production of non-renewable resources. This case study of ExxonMobil Corporation in the Bojonegoro District of East Java province, Indonesia – the area known as the “Cepu Block” – starts with the government’s provision in 2001 of a large concession for energy production. It highlights a combination of legal pressures, market transactions and political manipulation of civil society protests that resulted in the exclusion of local people from decision-making and dispossession of their land and livelihoods. © 2016 Canadian Association for the Study of International Development (CASID).

AB  - Compensation for ecosystem services can encourage the management of agricultural systems for a broad range of benefits beyond crop production. Here we explore how payments for carbon sequestration and phosphorus retention affect the profitability and economic competitiveness of perennial herbaceous biomass. We consider the case of converting marginal land currently in corn and soy production in southern Minnesota, United States, to native diverse prairie grown as a biofuel feedstock. We estimate the resulting changes in soil carbon storage and water quality, and the economic value of both. To test the robustness of our results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate variability and uncertainty in our model parameters. Our analyses show that prairie biomass production on marginal lands is 22% likely to be profitable when ecosystem service compensation is included, but only 5% when it is not. This suggests that the two ecosystem services modeled here may alone be insufficient to make prairie biomass production reliably profitable. Furthermore, by using ranges of model parameters rather than point estimates, this study shows that the profitability gap between conventional row crops and prairie is too large to be closed with the two services modeled here across a range of recent economic conditions. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The ongoing debate over the impact of biofuels on food security makes it difficult for governments to develop clear policies for an industry that can enhance rural employment and help to alleviate rural poverty, but may also reduce food availability and raise food prices. Whilst there have been many studies reporting a wide range of global commodity price impacts arising from the sharp rise in biofuel use over the past decade, there has been less evidence on food security impacts at a local level in developing countries. Where evidence does exist the impact is difficult to assess, often due to different types of production models and feedstocks, but also due to weaknesses in the methodologies and measures of food security used. This paper aims to help address this evidence gap by analysing household survey data from sites close to different types of biofuel operations in Mozambique and Tanzania, using an index that measures key macronutrient and micronutrient deficits at the household level. The results show that those households with employees in medium to large-scale biofuel feedstock operations achieved significantly higher food security outcomes than other households in the same locations. Furthermore, most of the households with better food security outcomes reported an improvement in food security since the biofuel operations had been established and attributed this mainly to increased and more regular income from salaried employment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - In central regions of the U. S. Corn Belt, agricultural production since 2001 has changed in response to federal policies implemented to encourage production of biofuels. Such changes have influenced agricultural practices, land uses, and their spatial character. This study examines site-specific temporal and spatial patterns of agricultural land use dynamics from 2001 to 2012 in a nine-county region of East-Central Iowa using the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer. Results indicate that increases in corn production in response to US biofuel policies and high grain prices have been achieved mainly by altering crop rotation patterns. These changes may be correlated with market forces, although variations suggest a multiplicity of causes. This study also examines spatial relationships between cultivated fields and crop rotation practices with respect to underlying soils and terrain. Intensity of cultivated land use depends on topographic and pedologic properties, although motivations and constraints perceived by producers and managers as they plan their use of landscapes are important. The most intensively cultivated lands have shallower slopes and fewer pedologic limitations than others, and corn was planted in higher quality soil while soybeans were moved to lesser quality soils. Declining acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program since 2007 indicates that they may be used for other crops displaced by corn. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

We find that nation-wide low-carbon electricity supply is possible at about 160 GW installed capacity, at indicative cost of around 20 ¢/kWh, involving wind, concentrating solar, and PV utilities, and less than 20 TWh of biofuelled generation. Dispatchable hydro and biofuel plants are required to plug gaps caused by occasional low-resource periods. Technology and cost breakthroughs for storage, geothermal, and ocean technologies, as well as offshore wind deployment would substantially alter our assessment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Influential components of the biodiesel production (stakeholders like government, farmers and enterprises as well as resources such as land and water) and how they are interconnected are pinpointed. In addition, the article gives recommendations to the main actors under ecological and socio-economic criteria to ensure a sustainable production of J. curcas oil in regions with appropriate climatic conditions for the plant's viability. Hence, this analysis of experiences discusses the following questions: What are the reasons and factors for the previous unsuccessful and unsustainable cultivation of J. curcas for producing biodiesel? Can it be lucrative and simultaneously achieve poverty alleviation/job creation under the constraints of efficient use of resources (land and water)?. © 2016

AB  - The emission of greenhouse gases continues to amplify the impacts of global climate change. This has led to the increased focus on using renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, due to their lower impact on the environment. However, the production of biofuels can still have negative impacts on water resources. This study introduces a new strategy to optimize bioenergy landscapes while improving stream health for the region. To accomplish this, several hydrological models including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, Hydrologic Integrity Tool, and Adaptive Neruro Fuzzy Inference System, were linked to develop stream health predictor models. These models are capable of estimating stream health scores based on the Index of Biological Integrity. The coupling of the aforementioned models was used to guide a genetic algorithm to design watershed-scale bioenergy landscapes. Thirteen bioenergy managements were considered based on the high probability of adaptation by farmers in the study area. Results from two thousand runs identified an optimum bioenergy crops placement that maximized the stream health for the Flint River Watershed in Michigan. The final overall stream health score was 50.93, which was improved from the current stream health score of 48.19. This was shown to be a significant improvement at the 1% significant level. For this final bioenergy landscape the most often used management was miscanthus (27.07%), followed by corn-soybean-rye (19.00%), corn stover-soybean (18.09%), and corn-soybean (16.43%). The technique introduced in this study can be successfully modified for use in different regions and can be used by stakeholders and decision makers to develop bioenergy landscapes that maximize stream health in the area of interest. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of fossil fuels as a main source of energy is directly linked to global climate change (due to CO2 emission), so there is a necessity to find new, cheap and easily available energy sources for the earth's inhabitants. Nowadays renewable energy sources are forced also for the mitigation of the effects of climate change as a result of greenhouse gases emission control. Decentralized sources of low-cost renewable fuels that may be used, in particular, in those households where there is no possibility of using gas or heat delivered from other sources should be of special interest. This paper describes the possibility of using untreated plants such as Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.), mugwort wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.) and common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) as a source of biofuels. These plants are considered weeds and have many advantages, enabling a wider use for energy purposes, especially in cases where there is a large acreage of land set aside. Clean, full-biogenic, renewable fuel without transportation energy demand and taxes is an interesting economical alternative to usually expensive processed wood biomass, such as pellets or briquettes. The following parameters of the studied fuels were investigated: the yield per hectare, density of growth, dry matter content during the harvest, bulk density, ash content and calorific value. Results revealed that the investigated species could be considered as great primary energy sources due high calorific value (over 16 MJ kg−1), low moisture, low costs and availability. Canadian Goldenrod was found to be especially promising since it covers most of uncultivated land and could be burned in large number of rural households without boiler and heating system change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pyrolysis was demonstrated to investigate the thermal decomposition characteristics and potential of lignin-rich cotton by-products cotton exocarp (CE) and spent mushroom substrate consisted of cotton by-products (MSC) for biorefineries. The chemical component and structure alteration of CE and MSC was found to affect their thermochemical behaviors. The bio-oil yield from CE was 58.13 wt% while the maximum yield from MSC was 45.01% at 600 °C. The phenolic compounds obtained from CE and MSC were 33.9% and 39.2%, respectively. The yield of acetic acid from MSC between 400 and 600 °C was about 30-38% lower than that from CE, which suggests the high quality of bio-oil was obtained. Biochar from MSC via slow pyrolysis had a high mass yield (44.38 wt%) with well-developed pore structure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the effect of different agricultural management on the yield and quality of two poplar biomass clones (AF2 and I-214 clones) in short rotation coppices (SRC), which were harvested using different alternatives (with and without cutting and sprouting after the first year), with two fertilisation doses and through three different 3-year rotation cycles. The plantation was established in 2006 in a marginal land at 1100 m above sea level in central-northern Spain. Yields were evaluated and biomass samples were analysed to determine the quality of the biomass for energy purposes. Biomass quality was estimated taking into account calorific value, volatile matter, ash content, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine contents, as well as the chemical composition and melting behaviour of their ashes. The highest yields, around 9 dry tons per hectare and year, were obtained in this marginal land during the first and second rotation cycles when plots received a supplementary fertilisation. Both clones (AF2 and I-214) provided similar yield and biomass quality. Plots where poplar was not harvested the first year (without cutting and sprouting after the first year) provided higher accumulated yields. Poplar biomass from SRC can be considered a suitable solid biofuel due to its appropriate ash melting behaviour and its low content of nitrogen (0.44 wt-%), sulphur (0.03 wt-%) and chlorine (around 0.01 wt-%). No important significance effect on the poplar quality can be found depending on the additional fertilisation. Poplar quality varied as a function of root/stem age. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aquatic micro-algae can be used as feedstocks for gaseous biofuel production via biological fermentation. However, micro-algae usually have low C/N ratios, which are not advantageous for fermentation. In this study, carbon-rich macro-algae (Laminaria digitata) mixed with nitrogen-rich micro-algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nannochloropsis oceanica) were used to maintain a suitable C/N ratio of 20 for a two-stage process combining hydrogen and methane fermentation. Co-fermentation of L. digitata and micro-algae facilitated hydrolysis and acidogenesis, resulting in hydrogen yields of 94.5-97.0 mL/gVS; these values were 15.5-18.5% higher than mono-fermentation using L. digitata. Through the second stage of methane co-fermentation, a large portion of energy remaining in the hydrogenogenic effluents was recovered in the form of biomethane. The two-stage batch co-fermentation markedly increased the energy conversion efficiencies (ECEs) from 4.6-6.6% during the hydrogen fermentation to 57.0-70.9% in the combined hydrogen and methane production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biomass of Chlorella sp. was pretreated with three different aqueous deep eutectic solvents (aDESs), i.e. aqueous choline chloride-oxalic acid (aCh-O), aqueous choline chloride-ethylene glycol (aCh-EG) and aqueous urea-acetamide (aU-A). The effect of aDESs pretreatment of microalgae biomass was evaluated in terms of lipid recovery rate, total carbohydrate content, fatty acid composition, and thermal chemical behavior of biomass. Results indicated that, lipid recovery rate was increased from 52.03% of untreated biomass to 80.90%, 66.92%, and 75.26% of the biomass treated by aCh-O, aCh-EG and aU-A, respectively. However, there were no major changes observed in fatty acid profiles of both untreated and treated biomass, specifically palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and stearic acid under various pretreatments. Furthermore, characterizations of untreated and treated biomass were carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) to understand the enhanced lipids recovery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In modern agriculture, the interplay between complex physical, agricultural, and socioeconomic water use drivers must be fully understood to successfully manage water supplies on extended timescales. This is particularly evident across large portions of the High Plains Aquifer where groundwater levels have declined at unsustainable rates despite improvements in both the efficiency of water use and water productivity in agricultural practices. Improved technology and land use practices have not mitigated groundwater level declines, thus water management strategies must adapt accordingly or risk further resource loss. In this study, we analyze the water-energy-food nexus over the High Plains Aquifer as a framework to isolate the major drivers that have shaped the history, and will direct the future, of water use in modern agriculture. Based on this analysis, we conclude that future water management strategies can benefit from: (1) prioritizing farmer profit to encourage decision-making that aligns with strategic objectives, (2) management of water as both an input into the water-energy-food nexus and a key incentive for farmers, (3) adaptive frameworks that allow for short-term objectives within long-term goals, (4) innovative strategies that fit within restrictive political frameworks, (5) reduced production risks to aid farmer decision-making, and (6) increasing the political desire to conserve valuable water resources. This research sets the foundation to address water management as a function of complex decision-making trends linked to the water-energy-food nexus. Water management strategy recommendations are made based on the objective of balancing farmer profit and conserving water resources to ensure future agricultural production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainability assessment is a critical issue for the biodiesel production chain. The constant growth of the biodiesel industry has generated important sustainability concerns, such as competition with food production, indirect land use change, and impacts on water, biodiversity and social values. Government policies consider that quantitative, robust and independent sustainability assessment is vital to estimate the extent to which the biodiesel industry impacts sustainability issues. However, weaknesses in the definition of adequate indicators to measure the sustainability of biodiesel production have been identified. In this context, this work proposes a hierarchical assessment framework based on sustainability dimensions, principles, criteria and indicators. To do this, after a systematic literature review, a first version of the framework was proposed. Then, to define the final framework, a validation strategy based on expert survey consultations and a descriptive statistical analysis were developed. In order to define the principles and criteria importance for sustainability assessment of biodiesel, 62 experts answered an online survey assessing three attributes: relevance, ease of measurement and reliability. The first result of the validation analysis was the definition of a framework composed of five dimensions (social, economic, environmental, political and technological), 13 principles, and 30 criteria that would be part of a sustainability assessment of biodiesel production. The second result was the identification of potential groups and relationships between principles and criteria represented through data visualization techniques. The validated framework provides the basis for defining future studies about interdimensional principles and criteria. Also, the proposed sustainability assessment framework could be adapted and applied to biodiesel production in specific contexts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Radiometric surveys have been conducted in support of a project investigating the potential of biofuel power generation coupled with remediation of forests contaminated with radionuclides following the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Surveys conducted in 2013 and 2014 were used to determine the distribution and time dependence of radionuclides in a cedar plantation and adjacent deciduous forestry subject to downslope radionuclide migration, and a test area where litter removal was conducted. The radiocaesium results confirmed enhanced deposition levels in the evergreen areas compared with adjacent areas of deciduous forestry, implying significant differences in depositional processes during the initial interception period in 2011. Surveys were conducted both with and without a collimator on both occasions, which modified the angular response of the detector to separate radiation signals from above and below the detector. The combined data have been used to define the influence of radionuclides in the forest canopy on dose rate at 1 m, indicating that, in evergreen areas, the activity retained within the canopy even by 2013 contributed less than 5% of ground level dose rate. The time dependent changes observed allow the effect of remediation by litter removal in reducing radionuclide inventories and dose rates to be appraised relative natural redistribution processes on adjacent control areas. A 15 × 45 m area of cedar forest was remediated in September 2013. The work involved five people in a total of 160 person hours. It incurred a total dose of 40-50 μSv, and generated 2.1 t of waste comprising forest litter and understory. Average dose rates were reduced from 0.31 μSv h-1 to 0.22 μSv h-1, with nuclide specific analyses indicating removal of 30 ± 3% of the local radiocaesium inventory. This compares with annual removal rates of 10-15% where radionuclide migration down-slope over ranges of 10-50 m could be observed within adjacent areas. Local increases were also observed in areas identified as sinks. The results confirm the utility of time-series, collimated, radiometric survey methods to account for the distribution and changes in radionuclide inventory within contaminated forests. The data on litter removal imply that significant activity transfer from canopy to soil had taken place, and provide benchmark results against which such remediation actions can be appraised. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - By starting first at the laboratory scale, optimal operating conditions for the reaction unit aimed at producing ethyl biodiesels from non-edible vegetable oils (NEVO) were determined with the ultimate objective of proposing an on-farm processing technology that should be sustainable for emerging countries. Three NEVO widely available in Burkina Faso were selected: Balanites aegyptiaca (BA), Azadirachta indica (AI), and Jatropha curcas (JC) oils. Their conversion to fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) was conducted via a two-stage procedure under atmospheric pressure: an alkali-catalyzed ethanolysis at ambient temperature for the BA and AI oils (leading to 93 and 87 wt.% FAEE respectively) and an acid-catalyzed ethanolysis at the normal boiling of the alcohol for the JC oil (leading to 89 wt.% FAEE). Based on the intermediate addition of glycerol at ambient temperature, the two-stage procedure combines chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, and phase equilibrium phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integrating bioenergy feedstock production with existing agricultural production systems and available land, resources, economic systems, and communities is critical for long-term sustainability of production systems. The ability of an agroforestry system of loblolly pine and switchgrass to produce biomass feedstock in flood prone sites are strategies to advance towards. The specific objective of this study is to assess and compare the performance of agroforestry against monoculture systems based on land use and production yield, by measuring various efficiency indices. Results across plots indicated biomass yield of switchgrass and loblolly pine grown in monoculture system were consistently higher in comparison to those grown in agroforestry system, where an average of 2.27 Mg/ha year−1 and 2.50 Mg/ha year−1 were seen respectively. The combined analysis of land equivalent ratio (LER) for loblolly pine and switchgrass intercrops, however, was a ratio ranging 1.25–1.74, which shows that pure strand or monoculture system would require 25–74 % more land to produce the same amount of yield relative to intercropping (agroforestry) system. An Agroforestry system has great potential for producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. Using agroforestry intercropping of woody and perennial herbaceous bioenergy crops enhances combined biomass yield, decreases the need for input, and therefore reduces the cost of biomass production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Purpose: Governments around the world encourage the use of biofuels through fuel standard policies that require the addition of renewable diesel in diesel fuel from fossil fuels. Environmental impact studies of the conversion of biomass to renewable diesel have been conducted, and life cycle assessments (LCA) of the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD) are limited, especially for countries with cold climates like Canada. Methods: In this study, an LCA was conducted on converting lignocellulosic biomass to HDRD by estimating the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel energy input of the production of biomass and its conversion to HDRD. The approach to conduct this LCA includes defining the goal and scope, compiling a life cycle inventory, conducting a life cycle impact assessment, and executing a life cycle interpretation. All GHG emissions and fossil fuel energy inputs were based on a fast pyrolysis plant capacity of 2000 dry tonnes biomass/day. A functional unit of 1 MJ of HDRD produced was adopted as a common unit for data inputs of the life cycle inventory. To interpret the results, a sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the impact of variables involved, and an uncertainty analysis was performed to assess the confidence of the results. Results and discussion: The GHG emissions of three feedstocks studied—whole tree (i.e., chips from cutting the whole tree), forest residues (i.e., chips from branches and tops generated from logging operations), and agricultural residues (i.e., straw from wheat and barley)—range from 35.4 to 42.3 g CO2,eq/MJ of HDRD (i.e., lowest for agricultural residue- and highest for forest residue-based HDRD); this is 53.4–61.1 % lower than fossil-based diesel. The net energy ratios range from 1.55 to 1.90 MJ/MJ (i.e., lowest for forest residue- and highest for agricultural residue-based HDRD) for HDRD production. The difference in results among feedstocks is due to differing energy requirements to harvest and pretreat biomass. The energy-intensive hydroprocessing stage is responsible for most of the GHG emissions produced for the entire conversion pathway. Conclusions: Comparing feedstocks showed the significance of the efficiency in the equipment used and the physical properties of biomass in the production of HDRD. The overall results show the importance of efficiency at the hydroprocessing stage. These findings indicate significant GHG mitigation benefits for the oil refining industry using available lignocellulosic biomass to produce HDRD for transportation fuel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Clostridium pasteurianum is emerging as a prospective host for the production of biofuels and chemicals, and has recently been shown to directly consume electric current. Despite this growing biotechnological appeal, the organism's genetics and central metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we present a concurrent genome sequence for the C. pasteurianum type strain and provide extensive genomic analysis of the organism's defence mechanisms and central fermentative metabolism. Next generation genome sequencing produced reads corresponding to spontaneous excision of a novel phage, designated I †6013, which could be induced using mitomycin C and detected using PCR and transmission electron microscopy. Methylome analysis of sequencing reads provided a near-complete glimpse into the organism's restriction-modification systems. We also unveiled the chief C. pasteurianum Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) locus, which was found to exemplify a Type I-B system. Finally, we show that C. pasteurianum possesses a highly complex fermentative metabolism whereby the metabolic pathways enlisted by the cell is governed by the degree of reductance of the substrate. Four distinct fermentation profiles, ranging from exclusively acidogenic to predominantly alcohologenic, were observed through redox consideration of the substrate. A detailed discussion of the organism's central metabolism within the context of metabolic engineering is provided.

AB  - Biogasification is the suitable biomass-to-biofuel technology in rural areas. In coastal communities, seaweed is an abundant feedstock for household biogas digester. However, biogasification requires expensive and dangerous chemicals for pH adjustment. Hence, Venerupis species shell was tested as pH buffer on biogasification of Undaria pinnatifida. Addition of 3% and 5% (w/w) shell at the start of digestion successfully started biogasification [86.4 ml CH4/g volatile solid (VS) and 109.5 ml CH4/g VS, respectively]. Biogasification efficiencies of shell setups (3% shell: 24.2%, 5% shell: 30.7%, and “BH then 5% shell”: 19.4%) were lower than in “BH then NaOH” (68.3%). Nonetheless, biogas start-up failed when shells are not added. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Utilization of forest and wood residues to produce bioenergy and biofuels could generate additional revenue streams for forestry companies, reduce their environmental impacts and generate new development opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Further development of forest-based biorefineries entails addressing complexities and challenges related to biomass procurement, logistics, technologies, and sustainability. Numerous optimization models have been proposed for the economic and environmental design of biomass-to-bioenergy or biofuel supply chains. A few of them also maximized the job creation potential of the supply chain through the use of employment multipliers. The use of a total job creation indicator as the social optimization objective implies that all new jobs generate the same level of social benefit. In this paper, we quantify the potential social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest-based biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas emission savings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Concerns over climate change and finite fossil fuels have generated interest in biofuels. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a biofuel feedstock, was planted in intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands to investigate sustainability of this system for producing an alternative energy source. We hypothesized that changes in understory habitat conditions caused by intercropping switchgrass in pine stands would affect rodent population and community dynamics within three years. Therefore, we assessed effects of three treatments (control pine, switchgrass intercropped in pine, and switchgrass monocrop) on rodent population (abundance, survival, and recruitment) and community (diversity, richness, evenness, and community assemblages) measures. We conducted vegetation surveys and live-trapping during 2013-2015 summers in Kemper County, Mississippi, USA. We conducted 6 trapping sessions each summer (n = 14,112 trap nights per year) and captured 1,733 cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), 102 Oryzomys palustris, 31 Mus musculus, 28 Reithrodontomys fulvescens, 22 Reithrodontomys humulis, 20 Peromyscus leucopus, 9 Microtus pinetorum, 9 Peromyscus gossypinus, and 2 Neotoma floridana. We found greater cotton rat abundance and lower recruitment in monocrop versus control plots. Rodent diversity was lower in monocrop than control plots. Intercropped plots had intermediate levels of cotton rat abundance and recruitment, and rodent diversity. More dispersal may have occurred in monocrop plots because of high population abundance and limited habitat availability. Cotton rat survival and rodent community assemblage were similar among treatments but differed among years. Although rodents responded negatively to monocrop plots, our results suggested intercropped plots would be an appropriate management practice in pine plantations to produce biofuel feedstocks while maintaining rodent diversity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a modeling framework to address the energy, economy, emissions and land use nexus when exploiting bioenergy in developing countries. The modeling framework combines a qualitative and a quantitative element. The qualitative element integrates two components: (1) technology roadmapping to identify long-term technology targets through expert judgment and (2) scenario analysis to investigate different future storylines. The quantitative element comprises four integrated tools, namely the energy system model (ESM), the land use and trade model (LUTM), an economic model, and an external climate model. An overview of the modeling framework, scenario analysis, structure of the models, modeling techniques, mathematical formulations and assumptions is presented and discussed. The modeling framework is applied to the particular context of Colombia, as a case study of a developing country with large bioenergy potential. In this study case, the impacts that an accelerated deployment of bioenergy technologies might cause on the energy demand and supply, emissions and land use until 2030 are evaluated. Results suggest that a plan to exploit bioenergy in Colombia should prioritize the deployment of technologies for biomethane production, power generation & CHP, which can reduce more GHG emissions and more emissions per incremental hectare of land than first-generation biofuels. Moreover, while the share of bioenergy in the primary energy demand decreases in all the analyzed scenarios, it is possible to envision significant increases in the share of bioenergy in road transport energy demand, power generation and natural gas supply for scenarios implementing roadmap goals. In addition, impacts of El Niño oscillation on the dependence of hydro for power generation can be partly mitigated by exploiting the complementarity of hydro and bioenergy, which might result in a reduction of up to 5-6% in the demand for fossil fuels used in power generation in dry years. However, despite the ambitious goals proposed here, bioenergy alone cannot significantly reduce emissions by 2030 (maximum 10% reduction relative to baseline) and effective climate change mitigation requires a portfolio of additional measures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production because they yield a substantial amount of oil. In order to accelerate the commercialization of microalgal biodiesel, this paper proposes a two-stage model for the design and planning of a microalgae-based biodiesel supply chain. The macro-stage performs a spatial filtering using GIS and AHP to identify the most suitable candidate locations to establish biodiesel production facilities. These potential locations are later applied in the supply chain design model of the micro-stage. Consequently, the macro-stage obviates the need to consider a large set of candidate locations which is the main reason for the computational complexity of the supply chain optimization problems. In the micro-stage, a robust mixed-integer linear programming (RMILP) optimization model, which provides a trade-off between system cost and reliability, is elaborated to determine the strategic and tactical supply chain decisions that remain optimal for almost all possible realizations of the uncertain parameters. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study considering different uncertainty settings. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the traditional supply chain design models in terms of solution robustness and computational time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The share of biofuels has increased significantly over the last decade, which has lead to several negative impacts on the environment. As a solution, several governments worldwide have promoted the use of certification systems, which have been implemented and in some cases have even been established as mandatory regulations. Due to the focus of the public debate, standard-setting has mainly been limited to developing and newly industrializing countries. Hence, the issues of environmental impacts as a consequence of agricultural intensification in Germany has been given little attention, and the question whether existing biofuel certification systems sufficiently cover ecological issues remains. In order to answer this question, this study performs a benchmarking analysis of selected certification systems, whereby their ability to ensure ecological sustainability is evaluated and compared. The assessment reveals that the currently existing national ordinances, like Cross Compliance, are in many aspects insufficient to ensure sustainability. Contrarily, they often deter necessary discussions to tackle these issues. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Human reliance on insect pollination services continues to increase even as pollinator populations exhibit global declines. Increased commodity crop prices and federal subsidies for biofuel crops, such as corn and soybeans, have contributed to rapid land-use change in the US Northern Great Plains (NGP), changes that may jeopardize habitat for honey bees in a part of the country that supports >40% of the US colony stock. We investigated changes in biofuel crop production and grassland land covers surrounding ?18,000 registered commercial apiaries in North and South Dakota from 2006 to 2014. We then developed habitat selection models to identify remotely sensed land-cover and land-use features that influence apiary site selection by Dakota beekeepers. Our study demonstrates a continual increase in biofuel crops, totaling 1.2 Mha, around registered apiary locations in North and South Dakota. Such crops were avoided by commercial beekeepers when selecting apiary sites in this region. Furthermore, our analysis reveals how grasslands that beekeepers target when selecting commercial apiary locations are becoming less common in eastern North and South Dakota, changes that may have lasting impact on pollinator conservation efforts. Our study highlights how land-use change in the NGP is altering the landscape in ways that are seemingly less conducive to beekeeping. Our models can be used to guide future conservation efforts highlighted in the US national pollinator health strategy by identifying areas that support high densities of commercial apiaries and that have exhibited significant land-use changes.

AB  - Biofuel as a promising pathway for substituting the traditional fossil fuels, mitigating environmental contaminations, and enhancing the energy security has attracted more and more attention in China. This study aims at identifying the critical success factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry and helping the stakeholders/decision-makers to draft the appropriate strategic measures for enhancing the sustainability of biofuel industry in China. A generic methodology in which the decision-makers are allowed to use linguistic terms to express their views and options, multiple decision-makers are allowed to participate in the decision-making, has been developed to prioritize the factors influencing the sustainability of biofuel industry and to identify the cause-effect relationships among these factors. The three factors, including government support degree, competitiveness, and local acceptability are identified as the most critical factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry in China, but they are all effects rather than the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. In contrast, maturity, safety and reliability, complexity, conversion efficiency, and investment cost are the most important causes, and they are also the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. Six effective strategic measures including popularizing the use of biofuels in large scales, subsidies and tax exemption policies, investing more on R&D on biofuel technologies, encouraging more private enterprises and joint ventures to participate in the biofuel industry, developing the integrated utilization manner of biofuels by further developing the byproducts of biofuels, and popularizing the use of biodiesel and bioethanol among the vehicle users through publicity and education have been proposed for promoting the sustainable development of China's biofuel industry according to the obtained results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ancient phylum Actinobacteria is composed of phylogenetically and physiologically diverse bacteria that help Earth's ecosystems function. As free-living organisms and symbionts of herbivorous animals, Actinobacteria contribute to the global carbon cycle through the breakdown of plant biomass. In addition, they mediate community dynamics as producers of small molecules with diverse biological activities. Together, the evolution of high cellulolytic ability and diverse chemistry, shaped by their ecological roles in nature, make Actinobacteria a promising group for the bioenergy industry. Specifically, their enzymes can contribute to industrial-scale breakdown of cellulosic plant biomass into simple sugars that can then be converted into biofuels. Furthermore, harnessing their ability to biosynthesize a range of small molecules has potential for the production of specialty biofuels. Copyright © 2016 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis bio-oils are feasible energy carriers and a potential source of chemicals. Detailed characterization of bio-oils is essential to further develop its potential use. In this study, quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) combined with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) was used to characterize fast pyrolysis bio-oils originated from pinewood, wheat straw, and rapeseed cake. The combination of both techniques provided new information on the chemical composition of bio-oils for further upgrading. 13C NMR analysis indicated that pinewood-based bio-oil contained mostly methoxy/hydroxyl (≈30%) and carbohydrate (≈27%) carbons; wheat straw bio-oil showed to have high amount of alkyl (≈35%) and aromatic (≈30%) carbons, while rapeseed cake-based bio-oil had great portions of alkyl carbons (≈82%). More than 200 compounds were identified and quantified using GC × GC coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) and a time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). Nonaromatics were the most abundant and comprised about 50% of the total mass of compounds identified and quantified via GC × GC. In addition, this analytical approach allowed the quantification of high value-added phenolic compounds, as well as of low molecular weight carboxylic acids and aldehydes, which exacerbate the unstable and corrosive character of the bio-oil. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: To develop pathways for advanced biofuel production, and to understand the impact of host metabolism and environmental conditions on heterologous pathway engineering for economic advanced biofuels production from biomass, we seek to redirect the carbon flow of the model ethanologen Zymomonas mobilis to produce desirable hydrocarbon intermediate 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO). 2,3-BDO is a bulk chemical building block, and can be upgraded in high yields to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Results: 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathways from various bacterial species were examined, which include three genes encoding acetolactate synthase, acetolactate decarboxylase, and butanediol dehydrogenase. Bioinformatics analysis was carried out to pinpoint potential bottlenecks for high 2,3-BDO production. Different combinations of 2,3-BDO biosynthesis metabolic pathways using genes from different bacterial species have been constructed. Our results demonstrated that carbon flux can be deviated from ethanol production into 2,3-BDO biosynthesis, and all three heterologous genes are essential to efficiently redirect pyruvate from ethanol production for high 2,3-BDO production in Z. mobilis. The down-selection of best gene combinations up to now enabled Z. mobilis to reach the 2,3-BDO production of more than 10 g/L from glucose and xylose, as well as mixed C6/C5 sugar streams derived from the deacetylation and mechanical refining process. Conclusions: This study confirms the value of integrating bioinformatics analysis and systems biology data during metabolic engineering endeavors, provides guidance for value-added chemical production in Z. mobilis, and reveals the interactions between host metabolism, oxygen levels, and a heterologous 2,3-BDO biosynthesis pathway. Taken together, this work provides guidance for future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at boosting 2,3-BDO titer anaerobically. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) and Hybrid Pennisetum (Pennisetum americanum × P. purpureum Schumach) are tall, fast-growing perennial C4 bunchgrasses that have been in recent developed as the most appropriate biomass feedstock in many countries for exploring various biofuel products. However, the challenges of increasing plant biomass yield and enhancing their stress tolerance, especially on marginal lands, have been existed for a long while. In the past several years, bacterial endophytes used as bio-fertilizers for improving crop production have offered an opportunity to facilitate high biomass yield of energy crops in a more sustainable manner. Results: A total of 16 endophytic bacteria strains were isolated and purified from the roots of elephant grass, which were classified into four bacterial genera: Sphingomonas, Pantoea, Bacillus, and Enterobacter. Four strains, pp01, pp02, pp04, and pp06, represented four different genera, were then selected and tested in vitro for their plant growth promoting properties, effects on plant growth and salt stress tolerance of Hybrid Pennisetum. The inoculation with these four bacterial mixture demonstrated a significant plant growth promotion for Hybrid Pennisetum from the normal to salt stress conditions at 0, 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. The highest promotion rate for biomass yield was 116.01 and 81.72 % for shoot fresh weight and dry weight, respectively. The bacterial strains tested were shown to solubilize insoluble phosphate, fix nitrogen, produce indole acetic acid and ammonia, but only strains from Sphingomonas, Bacillus, and Enterobacter can produce siderophore. In addition, the endophyte strains tested were all able to successfully colonize the roots of Hybrid Pennisetum, reaching upto 12.12 ± 0.98 CFU/g fresh roots at the 3rd day of inoculation. Conclusion: The four endophytic bacteria from elephant grass significantly promoted plant growth and biomass yield, alleviated the harmful effects of salt stress on Hybrid Pennisetum. These bacteria have indicated some unique properties that are very valuable for exploiting bio-inoculants aiding in the efforts to establish a sustainable and large-scale feedstock production system for Hybrid Pennisetum, particularly, on the saline marginal lands. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper analyses the dynamics of land use via the perspectives, motivations and behaviours of local landowners looking at land-use change (through the landowner’s eyes) in the way that the landowners would prefer to do and not to do in various situations. The dynamics are explored in the context of an oil-palm-based biodiesel development in Thailand where the advent of oil palm (OP) has caused the loss of paddy areas. A sequential mixed-method strategy, including 10 in-depth interviews and 180 responses to a questionnaire survey, indicates that the likelihood of a landowner switching traditional land for OP cultivation is affected by a number of factors including age and education of the head of household, number of household farming labourers, amount and source of income, land size and land right. Moreover, the results indicate that success of switching land to OP cultivation was determined by factors influencing willingness and capacity to change. Willingness-related factors are relevant to outcome expectation and social networks and connections while capacity-related factors are relevant to finance, labour, capital, land rights and transportation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite the introduction of the Nigerian Biofuel Policy and Incentive in 2007, little is known about the impact of that policy for biodiesel development in Nigeria. The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of smallholder farmers’ continued adoption of Jatropha as raw materials for biodiesel development in northern Nigeria, with Jigawa State as an area of study. Building on the literature, this paper proposes a model for Nigeria on determinants of smallholder farmers’ continued adoption of Jatropha as raw material for biodiesel production. A pilot testing using few samples in Jigawa state revealed that the determinants composed in the proposed model are likely to influence farmers’ decision on continued adoption of Jatropha as a raw material for biodiesel production. The proposed model if further validated using larger survey samples will guide policymakers towards the enhancement of farmers’ participation and retention in the Jatropha project for biodiesel raw materials production. As a byproduct, implementing research findings from the larger sample will be employment generation, poverty reduction, combating desert encroachment, economic diversification to renewable energy sources and electricity generation using biodiesel. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study combines legal and anthropological approaches to investigate how the establishment of a large-scale biofuel agro-industry is reinterpreting and potentially transforming customary institutional arrangements in rural Sierra Leone. The contractual relationships established between land acquirers and local authorities can be seen as an ‘institutional innovation’ that aims at interpreting and overcoming the limits of the national land regime. However, by formalizing customary land tenure structures through land registration, such innovations are exacerbating pre-existing social inequalities. We identified four categories of resulting conflicts: interlineage, intervillage, interfamily and intergenerational conflicts. Taken together, these conflicts question the current land-based sociopolitical structures of rural Sierra Leone and could be drivers of societal change. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Global change will likely affect savanna and forest structure and distributions, with implications for diversity within both biomes. Few studies have examined the impacts of both expected precipitation and land use changes on vegetation structure in the future, despite their likely severity. Here, we modeled tree cover in sub-Saharan Africa, as a proxy for vegetation structure and land cover change, using climatic, edaphic, and anthropic data (R(2)  = 0.97). Projected tree cover for the year 2070, simulated using scenarios that include climate and land use projections, generally decreased, both in forest and savanna, although the directionality of changes varied locally. The main driver of tree cover changes was land use change; the effects of precipitation change were minor by comparison. Interestingly, carbon emissions mitigation via increasing biofuels production resulted in decreases in tree cover, more severe than scenarios with more intense precipitation change, especially within savannas. Evaluation of tree cover change against protected area extent at the WWF Ecoregion scale suggested areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem services concern. Those forests most vulnerable to large decreases in tree cover were also highly protected, potentially buffering the effects of global change. Meanwhile, savannas, especially where they immediately bordered forests (e.g. West and Central Africa), were characterized by a dearth of protected areas, making them highly vulnerable. Savanna must become an explicit policy priority in the face of climate and land use change if conservation and livelihoods are to remain viable into the next century. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Landfilling continues to be one of the main methods used in managing Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Although in many countries national legislation aims to reduce this practice as much as possible, landfill is a necessary and unavoidable step in closing the material cycle. The need for innovative waste management techniques to improve landfill management and minimize the adverse environmental impact produced has resulted in an increasing interest in innovative systems capable of accelerating waste stabilization. Landfill bioreactors allow decomposition kinetics to be increased and post-operational phase to be shortened; in particular, hybrid bioreactors combine the benefits afforded by both aerobic and anaerobic processes. Six bioreactor simulators were used in the present study: four managed as hybrid, with an initial semi-aerobic phase and a second anaerobic phase, and two as anaerobic control bioreactors. The main goal of the first aerated phase is to reduce Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) in order to increase pH and enhance methane production during the anaerobic phase; for this reason, air injection was stopped only when these parameters reached the optimum range for methanogenic bacteria. Biogas and leachate were constantly monitored throughout the entire methanogenic phase with the aim of calibrating a Gompertz Model and evaluating the effects of pre-aeration on subsequent methane production. The results showed that moderate and intermittent pre-aeration produces a positive effect both on methane potential and in the kinetics of reaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transport is the most significant energy consuming sector in Ireland, accounting for 40% of final energy demand in 2013, with private cars and road freight contributing 51% and 25% to transport energy demand respectively. Despite a large literature body analysing private car energy use, there has been very little published analysis on freight transport, which itself has largely been limited to one aspect of freight transport, namely heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). This paper focuses on the energy and related CO2 emissions associated with light goods vehicles (LGVs) in Ireland, which contributes to addressing the knowledge gap in freight transport energy use. Low carbon pathways for LGV transport in Ireland, which align with an 80% CO2 emissions reduction by 2050 (relative to 1990), were developed using scenario analysis and a multi-model approach, which included i) the Irish TIMES energy systems model – a least cost optimisation model of the Irish energy system - and ii) an LGV stock model for Ireland – a sectoral simulation model of LGVs in Ireland. The introduction of energy efficiency measures and indigenous gaseous biofuels were found to be key elements in a technically feasible roadmap, which can meet the required CO2 emissions reduction target. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Clipping (i.e., harvesting aboveground plant biomass) is common in agriculture and for bioenergy production. However, microbial responses to clipping in the context of climate warming are poorly understood. We investigated the interactive effects of grassland warming and clipping on soil properties and plant and microbial communities, in particular, on microbial functional genes. Clipping alone did not change the plant biomass production, but warming and clipping combined increased the C4 peak biomass by 47% and belowground net primary production by 110%. Clipping alone and in combination with warming decreased the soil carbon input from litter by 81% and 75%, respectively. With less carbon input, the abundances of genes involved in degrading relatively recalcitrant carbon increased by 38% to 137% in response to either clipping or the combined treatment, which could weaken long-term soil carbon stability and trigger positive feedback with respect to warming. Clipping alone also increased the abundance of genes for nitrogen fixation, mineralization, and denitrification by 32% to 39%. Such potentially stimulated nitrogen fixation could help compensate for the 20% decline in soil ammonium levels caused by clipping alone and could contribute to unchanged plant biomass levels. Moreover, clipping tended to interact antagonistically with warming, especially with respect to effects on nitrogen cycling genes, demonstrating that single-factor studies cannot predict multifactorial changes. These results revealed that clipping alone or in combination with warming altered soil and plant properties as well as the abundance and structure of soil microbial functional genes. Aboveground biomass removal for biofuel production needs to be reconsidered, as the long-term soil carbon stability may be weakened. IMPORTANCE Global change involves simultaneous alterations, including those caused by climate warming and land management practices (e.g., clipping). Data on the interactive effects of warming and clipping on ecosystems remain elusive, particularly in microbial ecology. This study found that clipping alters microbial responses to warming and demonstrated the effects of antagonistic interactions between clipping and warming on microbial functional genes. Clipping alone or combined with warming enriched genes degrading relatively recalcitrant carbon, likely reflecting the decreased quantity of soil carbon input from litter, which could weaken long-term soil C stability and trigger positive warming feedback. These results have important implications in assessing and predicting the consequences of global climate change and indicate that the removal of aboveground biomass for biofuel production may need to be reconsidered. © 2016 Xue et al.

AB  - Energy production in the United States for domestic use and export is predicted to rise 27% by 2040. We quantify projected energy sprawl (new land required for energy production) in the United States through 2040. Over 200,000 km2 of additional land area will be directly impacted by energy development. When spacing requirements are included∗over 800,000 km2 of additional land area will be affected by energy development, an area greater than the size of Texas. This pace of development in the United States is more than double the historic rate of urban and residential development, which has been the greatest driver of conversion in the United States since 1970, and is higher than projections for future land use change from residential development or agriculture. New technology now places 1.3 million km2 that had not previously experienced oil and gas development at risk of development for unconventional oil and gas. Renewable energy production can be sustained indefinitely on the same land base, while extractive energy must continually drill and mine new areas to sustain production. We calculated the number of years required for fossil energy production to expand to cover the same area as renewables, if both were to produce the same amount of energy each year. The land required for coal production would grow to equal or exceed that of wind, solar and geothermal energy within 2-31 years. In contrast, it would take hundreds of years for oil production to have the same energy sprawl as biofuels. Meeting energy demands while conserving nature will require increased energy conservation, in addition to distributed renewable energy and appropriate siting and mitigation. © 2016 Trainor et al.

AB  - In future decades, the global demand for cereals will increase due to growing demand for food and feed and use of cereal crops as a source for biofuels. Some studies on cereal production within Europe have identified the Ukraine as a country with a large potential to increase production. However, the Ukraine is widely known for its high-quality soils, but its yield is relatively low. In principle, two routes for production growth exist: increasing yield (intensification) and/or converting more land into production (expansion). In this study, an assessment of the potential levels of wheat production that could be attained in the Ukraine at a regional level have been derived as well as quantifying the optimal levels of fertilizer application needed. The study identifies why farmers currently have low levels of motivation to intensify production and the reasons for increasing land using efficiency. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Although strategic and operational uncertainties differ in their significance of impact, a “one-size-fits-all” approach has been typically used to tackle all types of uncertainty in the optimal design and operations of supply chains. In this work, we propose a stochastic robust optimization model that handles multi-scale uncertainties in a holistic framework, aiming to optimize the expected economic performance while ensuring the robustness of operations. Stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches are integrated in a nested manner to reflect the decision maker's different levels of conservativeness toward strategic and operational uncertainties. The resulting multi-level mixed-integer linear programming model is solved by a decomposition-based column-and-constraint generation algorithm. To illustrate the application, a county-level case study on optimal design and operations of a spatially-explicit biofuel supply chain in Illinois is presented, which demonstrates the advantages and flexibility of the proposed modeling framework and efficiency of the solution algorithm. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 3041–3055, 2016. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This paper examines the likelihood that farm managers would be willing to harvest crop residue, or grow a dedicated annual or perennial bioenergy crop. In addition, factors affecting how many initial acres adopters would be willing to plant of a dedicated annual or perennial bioenergy crop are assessed. The study finds several factors affect farm managers' decisions to harvest crop residue, or grow annual or perennial bioenergy crops, as well as their potential initial acreage allocation decisions. These factors lead to several policy implications that should be tailored to the specific type of cellulosic bioenergy crop. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With high productivity and stress tolerance, numerous grass genera of the Andropogoneae have emerged as candidates for bioenergy production. To optimize these candidates, research examining the genetic architecture of yield, carbon partitioning, and composition is required to advance breeding objectives. Significant progress has been made developing genetic and genomic resources for Andropogoneae, and advances in comparative and computational genomics have enabled research examining the genetic basis of photosynthesis, carbon partitioning, composition, and sink strength. To provide a pivotal resource aimed at developing a comparative understanding of key bioenergy traits in the Andropogoneae, we have established and characterized an association panel of 390 racially, geographically, and phenotypically diverse Sorghum bicolor accessions with 232,303 genetic markers. Sorghum bicolor was selected because of its genomic simplicity, phenotypic diversity, significant genomic tools, and its agricultural productivity and resilience. We have demonstrated the value of sorghum as a functional model for candidate gene discovery for bioenergy Andropogoneae by performing genome-wide association analysis for two contrasting phenotypes representing key components of structural and non-structural carbohydrates. We identified potential genes, including a cellulase enzyme and a vacuolar transporter, associated with increased non-structural carbohydrates that could lead to bioenergy sorghum improvement. Although our analysis identified genes with potentially clear functions, other candidates did not have assigned functions, suggesting novel molecular mechanisms for carbon partitioning traits. These results, combined with our characterization of phenotypic and genetic diversity and the public accessibility of each accession and genomic data, demonstrate the value of this resource and provide a foundation for future improvement of sorghum and related grasses for bioenergy production. © 2016 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - There is a clear and unmet need for a robust and affordable biomass conversion technology that can process a wide range of biomass feedstocks and produce high yields of fermentable sugars and biofuels with minimal intervention between unit operations. The lower microbial toxicity of recently-developed renewable ionic liquids (ILs), or bionic liquids (BILs), helps overcome the challenges associated with the integration of pretreatment with enzymatic saccharification and microbial fermentation. However, the most effective BILs known to date for biomass pretreatment form extremely basic pH solutions in the presence of water, and therefore require neutralization before the pH range is acceptable for the enzymes and microbes used to complete the biomass conversion process. Neutralization using acids creates unwanted secondary effects that are problematic for efficient and cost-effective biorefinery operations using either continuous or batch modes. We demonstrate a novel approach that addresses these challenges through the use of gaseous carbon dioxide to reversibly control the pH mismatch. This approach enables the realization of an integrated biomass conversion process that eliminates the need for intermediate washing and/or separation steps. A preliminary technoeconomic analysis indicates that this integrated approach could reduce production costs by 50-65% compared to previous IL biomass conversion methods studied. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Land use change (LUC)-induced surface albedo effects for expansive biofuel production need to be quantified for improved understanding of biofuel climate impacts. We addressed this emerging issue for expansive biofuel production in the United States (U.S.) and compared the albedo effects with greenhouse gas emissions highlighted by traditional life-cycle analysis of biofuels. We used improved spatial representation of albedo effects in our analysis by obtaining over 1.4 million albedo observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer flown on NASA satellites over a thousand counties representative of six Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) in the U.S. We utilized high-spatial-resolution, crop-specific cropland cover data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and paired the data with the albedo data to enable consideration of various LUC scenarios. We simulated the radiative effects of LUC-induced albedo changes for seven types of crop covers using the Monte Carlo Aerosol, Cloud and Radiation model, which employs an advanced radiative transfer mechanism coupled with spatially and temporally resolved meteorological and aerosol conditions. These simulations estimated the net radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere as a result of the LUC-induced albedo changes, which enabled quantification of the albedo effects on the basis of radiative forcing defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for CO2 and other greenhouse gases effects. Finally, we quantified the LUC-induced albedo effects for production of ethanol from corn, miscanthus, and switchgrass in different AEZs of the U.S. Results show that the weighted national average albedo effect is a small cooling effect of -1.8 g CO2 equivalent (CO2e) for a mega-Joule (MJ) of corn ethanol, a relatively stronger warming effect of 12.1 g CO2e per MJ of switchgrass ethanol, and a small warming effect of 2.7 g CO2e per MJ of miscanthus ethanol. Significant variations in albedo-induced effects are found among different land conversions for the same biofuel, and among different AEZ regions for the same land conversion and biofuel. This spatial heterogeneity, owing to non-linear albedo dynamics and radiation processes, suggests highly variable LUC-induced albedo effects depending on geographical locations and vegetation. These findings provide new insights on potential climate effects by producing biofuels through considering biogeophysical as well as biogeochemical effects of biofuel production and use in the U.S. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Temporal variation in prices is an important factor that influences returns on investments and decisions made by policy makers. This study investigates the behaviour of two output prices potentially associated with growing improved poplars in Canada: hardwood pulp and ethanol. Time series techniques are used to assess the processes and volatility of hardwood pulp and ethanol price series. The findings indicate that price series for hardwood pulp and ethanol are best characterized by mean reverting processes around constant averages, indicating more predictability for poplar producers than would be the case for random walks. However, the results from the volatility analysis suggest substantial uncertainty for producers. The volatility of both markets is found be to be highly related to past volatilities, and therefore persistent. To the extent that future prices are more volatile, the importance of producers considering multiple product options for pulp plantations increases, as do complexities for policy makers to predict the impacts of policies to support biofuels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing production of biofuels has led to concerns about indirect land-use change (ILUC). So far, significant efforts have been made to assess potential ILUC effects. But limited attention has been paid to strategies for reducing the extent of ILUC and controlling the type of LUC. This case study assesses five key ILUC mitigation measures to quantify the low-ILUC-risk production potential of miscanthus-based bioethanol in Lublin province (Poland) in 2020. In 2020, a total area of 196 to 818 thousand hectare of agricultural land could be made available for biomass production by realizing above-baseline yield developments (95–413 thousand ha), increased food chain efficiencies (9–30 thousand ha) and biofuel feedstock production on underutilized lands (92–375 thousand ha). However, a maximum 203–269 thousand hectare is considered legally available (not protected) and biophysically suitable for miscanthus production. The resulting low-ILUC-risk bioethanol production potential ranges from 12 to 35 PJ per year. The potential from this region alone is higher than the national Polish target for second-generation bioethanol consumption of 9 PJ in 2020. Although the sustainable implementation potential may be lower, the province of Lublin could play a key role in achieving this target. This study shows that the mitigation or prevention of ILUC from bioenergy is only possible when an integrated perspective is adopted on the agricultural and bioenergy sectors. Governance and policies on planning and implementing ILUC mitigation are considered vital for realizing a significant bioenergy potential with low ILUC risk. One important aspect in this regard is monitoring the risk of ILUC and the implementation of ILUC mitigation measures. Key parameters for monitoring are land use, land cover and crop yields. © 2015 The Authors. Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The simultaneous rise in commodity prices and the global production of biofuels, between 2007 and 2008, strengthened discussions, which persist currently, about the competition of land use between biofuel production and food production. The objective of this paper is to compare and evaluate the arguments from both sides. The methodology used was an analysis of the relevant and comprehensive reports and manuscripts on the topic, comparing them to the available data from international organizations and agencies. Biodiesel received special attention in this analysis. The conclusion is that hunger and poverty problems are due to structural and historical roots and they do not have a cause-effect relationship with biodiesel production. In fact, the production of biodiesel, under specific regulatory and production conditions, can be a driver of economic development improving energy security and promoting social inclusion in poor countries, which still have land available for agriculture. © 2016 International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - Perennial grasses are promising feedstocks for bioenergy production in the Midwestern USA. Few experiments have addressed how drought influences their carbon fluxes and storage. This study provides a direct comparison of ecosystem-scale measurements of carbon fluxes associated with miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), restored native prairie and maize (Zea mays)/soybean (Glycine max) ecosystems. The main objective of this study was to assess the influence of a naturally occurring drought during 2012 on key components of the carbon cycle and plant development relative to non-extreme years. The perennials reached full maturity 3–5 years after establishment. Miscanthus had the highest gross primary production (GPP) and lowest net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in 2012 followed by similar values for switchgrass and prairie, and the row crops had the lowest GPP and highest NEE. A post-drought effect was observed for miscanthus. Over the duration of the experiment, perennial ecosystems were carbon sinks, as indicated by negative net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), while maize/soybean was a net carbon source. Our observations suggest that perennial ecosystems, and in particular miscanthus, can provide a high yield and a large potential for CO2 fixation even during drought, although drought may negatively influence carbon uptake in the following year, questioning the long-term consequence of its maintained productivity. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Interest in biofuels produced from perennial crops like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has increased over the past decades. It has been suggested that perennial biofuel crops have additional climate benefits compared to annual crops, such as carbon sequestration and albedo increase, but these effects have not been quantified in field studies. We compared carbon dioxide and water exchange results from eddy covariance measurements and surface albedo over a switchgrass and a corn field in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, for the year 2014. Results for the carbon budget showed more carbon uptake for switchgrass compared to corn (annual net ecosystem exchange NEE of −336 ± 40 vs +64 ± 41 g C m−2). Switchgrass was a small sink of carbon with a net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of −66 ± 59 g C m−2 but corn was a source for a scenario where corn grain only is harvested (NECB 393 ± 44 g C m−2) and a 1.5 times larger source if both corn grain and stover are harvested (NECB 699 ± 47 g C m−2). Switchgrass had, however, a lower yield 568 ± 93 g m−2 than either corn scenario (751 ± 40 g m−2 for grain only and 1439 ± 52 g m−2 for grain plus stover). Results from the albedo measurements showed a negative radiative forcing on an annual basis for the switchgrass field compared to corn. Differences in albedo were especially pronounced during spring and fall when radiative forcing values of −10.2 and −5.5 W m−2 were observed, respectively. Qualitative analysis of the carbon budget, evapotranspiration, and albedo results from this study suggests that biofuel produced from switchgrass can have more climate benefits than biofuel produced from continuous corn cropping systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to build prospective scenarios for biodiesel industry in Brazil, with a sustainable perspective, it was necessary to develop a cross-disciplinary work to include Sachs’ dimensions of sustainability into the scenarios method. This meant linking concepts from different disciplines, without transforming it in a new discipline. In order to support the proposition for the new method, a study case is presented, the framework for the biodiesel scenarios in Brazil, by 2030. An in-depth interview was used to test the proposition of having the sustainability dimensions as driving forces. The result was the identification of a critical uncertainty composed of various aspects related the response to climate change and environmental conservation. The scenario storylines that were developed based on the critical uncertainties showed that sustainable options for the future are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual. The results show that the scenarios storylines go through social, environmental and economic aspects, supported by other aspects like the territorial and political. Also it showed that sustainable options are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Native perennial grasslands have been proposed as a source of feedstocks for the production of second-generation lignocellulosic biofuels in the Midwestern USA. Although the consequences of some management decisions for biomass production and plant community composition are well understood (e.g. fertilization), less is known about the effects of harvesting frequency. We compared a once- and twice-annual harvesting regime at two restored prairies in southwestern Michigan established with identical seed mixtures as part of a large-scale bioenergy experiment. We determined biomass production and species composition in experimental plots and also measured the availability of light, inorganic nitrogen and soil moisture. The plant communities that established at the two sites differed markedly in composition and there was little evidence of convergence after five years. At the site dominated by warm-season C4 grasses, single harvests generally produced more biomass than double harvests. By contrast, biomass production was unaffected by harvesting at the more diverse site. Contrary to our prediction that a summer harvest would increase diversity, we found small and subtle effects on plant community composition. This may be due in part to the timing of our harvest treatment. Our results suggest that a single, end-of-season harvest is the best practice for maximizing biomass production in prairies, especially at sites where warm-season grasses dominate. However, at more diverse sites, two harvests can produce the same total biomass and may support other beneficial ecosystem services. This study indicates that in the short term, double harvests are unlikely to affect plant species diversity or community composition in prairie plantings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main tree species planted for woodchips production for energy use are: poplar (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.). Nevertheless, in the course of the years, other tree species were planted (i.e. Pinus strobus L.; Pauwlonia spp …). The scope of this study is the evaluation of energy and economic advantages, and quality of woodchip produced by a Cedrus deodara plantation situated in Italy. The plantation had a surface of 1.2 ha and trees were 14 years old. An amount of 363 t of fresh comminuted wood (about 300 t ha−1) was produced by the plantation considered. A total time of 39.5 h (about 5 days) was required to transform all trees in woodchip. The moisture content of woodchip produced was 52%, while the average Low Heating Value (HHV) was 8.51 MJ kg−1. In this study, economic (production cost = 93 € t−1 DM) and energetic (output/input ratio = 74) evaluations of woodchip produced by Cedrus deodara plantations were positives. Nevertheless, the results obtained in this experimentation are close to the climate conditions and soil characteristics of Northwestern Italy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Study creates a scenario for enrichment and selection of ligno-hemicellulose degrading genotypes with anaerobic bioreactor as a model using rice straw, vegetable waste and food waste as substrates. Relative discrimination analysis showed that the hydrolytic pathways and associated microbial communities for ligno-hemicellulose degradation were dominatingly colonized with rice straw as substrate. The dominating bacteria were Caldicellulosiruptor, Fervidobacterium, Cytophaga, Ruminococcus, Thermotoga associated with hemicellulose degradation and Burkholderia, Pandorea, Sphingomonas, Spirochaeta, Pseudomonas for lignocellulose hydrolysis. This was further supported by the abundance of anaerobic aromatic compound degrading genes along with genes for xylanase and xylosidase in rice straw enriched community. The metagenome analysis data was validated by evaluation of the biochemical methane potential for these substrates. Food waste being most amenable substrate yielded 1410 mL of biogas/g VS added whereas, biogas yield of 1160 mL/g VS and 1080 mL/g VS was observed in presence of vegetable waste and rice straw respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions were measured over two years at an earthen storage containing digestate from a mesophilic biodigester in Ontario, Canada. The digester processed dairy manure and co-substrates from the food industry, and destroyed 62% of the influent volatile solids (VS). Annual average emissions were 19 g CH4 m-3 d-1 and 0.27 g CH4 kg-1 VS d-1. About 76% of annual emissions occurred from June to October. Annual cumulative emissions from digestate corresponded to 12% of the CH4 produced within the digester. A key contributor to CH4 emissions was the sludge layer in storage, which contained as much VS as the annual discharge from the digester. These findings suggest that digestate management provides an opportunity to further enhance the benefits of biogas (i.e. reducing CH4 emissions compared to undigested liquid manure, and producing renewable energy). Potential best practices for future study include complete storage emptying, solid-liquid separation, and storage covering. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Waste biomass is generated during the conservation management of semi-natural habitats, and represents an unused resource and potential bioenergy feedstock that does not compete with food production. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to characterise a representative range of biomass generated during conservation management in Wales. Of the biomass types assessed, those dominated by rush (Juncus effuses) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) exhibited the highest and lowest volatile compositions respectively and were selected for bench scale conversion via fast pyrolysis. Each biomass type was ensiled and a sub-sample of silage was washed and pressed. Demineralization of conservation biomass through washing and pressing was associated with higher oil yields following fast pyrolysis. The oil yields were within the published range established for the dedicated energy crops miscanthus and willow. In order to examine the potential a multiple output energy system was developed with gross power production estimates following valorisation of the press fluid, char and oil. If used in multi fuel industrial burners the char and oil alone would displace 3.9 × 105 tonnes per year of No. 2 light oil using Welsh biomass from conservation management. Bioenergy and product development using these feedstocks could simultaneously support biodiversity management and displace fossil fuels, thereby reducing GHG emissions. Gross power generation predictions show good potential. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use changes (LUC) from pasture to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) crop are expected to add 6.4 Mha of new sugarcane land by 2021 in the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. We assessed the effects of these LUC on the abundance and community structure of animals that inhabit soils belowground through a field survey using chronosequences of land uses comprising native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane along a 1000-km-long transect across these two major tropical biomes in Brazil. Macrofauna community composition differed among land uses. While most groups were associated with samples taken in native vegetation, high abundance of termites and earthworms appeared associated with pasture soils. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected total abundance (X2(1) = 6.79, p = 0.03) and taxa richness (X2(1) = 6.08, p = 0.04) of soil macrofauna. Abundance increased from 411 ± 70 individuals m-2 in native vegetation to 1111 ± 202 individuals m-2 in pasture, but decreased sharply to 106 ± 24 individuals m-2 in sugarcane soils. Diversity decreased 24% from native vegetation to pasture, and 39% from pasture to sugarcane. Thus, a reduction of ~90% in soil macrofauna abundance, besides a loss of ~40% in the diversity of macrofauna groups, can be expected when sugarcane crops replace pasture in Brazilian tropical soils. In general, higher abundances of major macrofauna groups (ants, coleopterans, earthworms, and termites) were associated with higher acidity and low contents of macronutrients and organic matter in soil. This study draws attention for a significant biodiversity loss belowground due to tropical LUC in sugarcane expansion areas. Given that many groups of soil macrofauna are recognized as key mediators of ecosystem processes such as soil aggregation, nutrients cycling and soil carbon storage, our results warrant further efforts to understand the impacts of altering belowground biodiversity and composition on soil functioning and agriculture performance across LUC in the tropics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intensive monitoring was carried out to evaluate the performance of a full-scale innovative swine waste-to-energy system at a commercial swine farm with 8640 heads of swine. Detailed mass balances over each unit of the system showed that the system, which includes a 7600 m3 anaerobic digester, a 65-kW microturbine, and a 4200 m3 aeration basin, was able to remove up to 92% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD), 99% of the biological oxygen demand (BOD), 77% of the total nitrogen (TN), and 82% of the total phosphorous (TP) discharged into the system as fresh pig waste. The overall biogas yield based on the COD input was 64% of the maximum theoretical, a value that indicates that even greater environmental benefits could be obtained with process optimization. Overall, the characterization of the materials fluxes in the system provides a greater understanding of the fate of organics and nutrients in large scale animal waste management systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tajikistan like other mountainous nations in Central Asia faces the dual problem of poverty and exposure to multiple natural hazards such as mass wasting, flooding, and prolonged cold. In this case study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 rural Tajik households in order to characterize their vulnerability and adaptation to prolonged winter cold. The household interviews were supplemented with interviews with village leaders, doctors, and school staff. Key interview themes regarding the road network were then compared with GIS road network analysis of the region. Results suggested that the area is highly vulnerable to the impacts of prolonged cold, which could ultimately be made worse through the unsustainable land-use practices, especially for agricultural and biofuel resources. The combination of unreliable sources of income and lower accessibility to markets in winter results in less ability of the residents of these rural villages to mitigate the impacts of prolonged cold. Analysis of the road network using GIS provided additional evidence for the influence of accessibility on vulnerability to prolonged cold. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) is increasing prominence as a feedstock for biodiesel production due to its potential in reducing costs and environmental impacts of biodiesel when compared with virgin oils. However, several life-cycle studies have reported a wide range of WCO biodiesel impacts, mainly due to the WCO collection stage, which has not been discussed in the literature. The lack of a comprehensive assessment of the collection stage influence on biodiesel overall impacts motivates this article, in which a detailed Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biodiesel produced from WCO addressing different collection systems is presented. An inventory for WCO collection was implemented for different systems in the domestic and the food service industry sectors in Portugal as well as for biodiesel companies. The characterization and incorporation of the variation associated with WCO collection systems, parameter uncertainty and variability, as well as modelling options was performed. A wide range of impacts was calculated. Two factors contribute the most to the variation observed: the WCO collection efficiency and the characteristics of the collection system (e.g. sector, type of collection and population density). Results show that WCO collection cannot be neglected or simplified when assessing the overall environmental performance of biodiesel produced from WCO. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth in ethanol production in the United States has sparked interest in potential land-use change and the associated environmental impacts that may occur in order to accommodate the increasing demand for grain feedstocks. In this study water quality and sustainability indicators are used to evaluate the impacts of land-use change to increase corn and grain sorghum acreage for biofuel production in the Perry Lake watershed in northeast Kansas. Water quality indicators include sediment loads per converted land acreage and the relative increase of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and sediment loads compared to the baseline conditions. Sustainability indicators include land-use, water use, and nutrient use efficiencies. Hay, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and winter wheat were selected as targeted land-uses for conversion to biofuel feedstocks. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to evaluate 6 different scenarios, each at 10 land-use change increments, for a total of 60 simulations. Results demonstrate that increased corn production generates significantly greater sediment loads than increased grain sorghum production and larger relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum cropland by replacing hay or CRP land-uses resulted in the highest sediment loads and relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum by replacing winter wheat cropland produced the lowest relative changes in nutrient and sediment loads and therefore may be a more sustainable land-use change. Corn had a higher yield potential per km2 compared to grain sorghum, resulting in better land, nutrient and water use efficiencies. © 2016

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability of a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating urban wastewater (UWW) and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) at ambient temperature in mild/hot climates. To this aim, power requirements, energy recovery from methane (biogas methane and methane dissolved in the effluent), consumption of reagents for membrane cleaning, and sludge handling (polyelectrolyte and energy consumption) and disposal (farmland, landfilling and incineration) were evaluated within different operating scenarios. Results showed that, for the operating conditions considered in this study, AnMBR technology is likely to be a net energy producer, resulting in considerable cost savings (up to €0.023 per m3 of treated water) when treating low-sulphate influent. Life cycle analysis (LCA) results revealed that operating at high sludge retention times (70 days) and treating UWW jointly with OFMSW enhances the overall environmental performance of AnMBR technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to enzymatic and microbial degradation due to its chemical compositions and physical structures that inhibit the hydrolysis reactions. To obtain a high sugar yield for biofuel production, pretreatment process is generally needed to improve efficiency of hydrolysis. Here, organic acids were used to pretreat rice straw. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effect of three pretreatment parameters, including acid concentration, treatment time, and reaction temperature, on pretreatment efficiency were evaluated and used to generate mathematic optimization model. The hydrolysis results indicated that oxalic acid pretreatment led to the highest enhancement of enzymatic saccharification up to 213.4 mg (starting from 500 mg of pretreated sample) when using 5.01% oxalic acid concentration at 135.91 °C for 30.86 min, which was 2.68 times higher than the untreated rice straw. The structural changes in the pretreated biomass were investigated using FT-IR analysis. The results suggested that lignin composition was significantly removed from the pretreated biomass, and the crystalline cellulose was also modified to amorphous form during pretreatment. Both untreated and pretreated rice straw were subjected to anaerobic digestion to evaluate the influence of organic acid pretreatment on biogas production. The highest biogas yield was 322.1 ml/g-rice straw when using citric acid pretreatment which was 7.40 times higher than untreated biomass. These results demonstrated that organic acids can be used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to enhance hydrolysis and biogas production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pongamia (Millettia pinnata) has been widely studied as a potential feedstock for biodiesel fuel, though little is known about its feasibility at a commercial level. Capital budgeting and cash flow analysis was conducted for a potential Pongamia plantation and crushing plant in Queensland, Australia. For annual seed yields ranging from 20 to 80 kg (in shell) per tree, the delivered cost of Pongamia oil was estimated to be between AUD $2.22 and AUD $0.64 per litre. The seed yield range of 20 to 80 kg per tree is roughly equivalent to between 7 and 29 t per hectare at a planting density of 357 trees per hectare. Major components of the delivered cost of (Pongamia) oil are the capital expenses of land acquisition, plantation establishment and the crushing plant construction. The major operational costs include mechanical harvesting; fertiliser; control of weed, pests and diseases; seed crushing; and freight of oil to a refinery. The cost items with the greatest volume sensitivity are the capital expenses, overheads (consisting mostly of salaries and wages of employees) and the expenses associated with harvesting and crushing operations. These costs could be significantly reduced if the seed yield could be increased. Several scenarios were tested to demonstrate the effect of seed yield and oil price on the profitability and cash flow of the Pongamia enterprise. At most plausible oil prices and seed yields, Pongamia oil is not expected to be economically viable. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Liquid biofuels represent a valid option for traditional fossil liquid fuels, but their sustainability is still under enquiry. In this work, we merge the Life-Cycle-Assessment methods with the Multivariate Statistic Analysis (MVA), to define a general methodology to compare biofuels derived from different feedstocks and fossil fuels. We tried to assess in an unambiguous way whether the biofuels are more sustainable than liquid fuels, in terms of both emissions and depletion of non-renewable sources. Whereas first generation products present even higher environmental impacts than fossil fuels, which in turn rely on consolidated, optimized processes, whose environmental footprint and yields have been improved over the years. Our results trace a good sustainability profile for second generation biofuels, especially for biogas that seems to be the best trade-off both from a LCA perspective and as a single dimensionless score derived from the MVA. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A large area of unutilized or underutilized marginal land in the northeastern USA, some of which currently produce a mature hay crop for use as mulch, is potentially suitable for bioenergy crop production. Mature-mixed grass hay bales (n = 1980) were sampled across New York in late summer and fall of 2011 and 2012 from 65 farms. Chemical analysis of 19 parameters, including gross calorific value, fiber, and elemental analyses, was conducted on the samples. In addition, 156 soil samples, representing 67 soil types, were analyzed for 12 to 14 parameters, using two different extraction procedures. Results indicate that hay composition is extremely variable among bales, and that much of the variation is due to soil contamination. Soil contamination reduced energy content of hay, a reduction best estimated from ash content of the hay. Standard plant analyses of contaminated hay samples determine total elemental content, but the same analyses only partially extract soil elements. A subset of samples showed that fiber analysis of soil-contaminated hay is problematic, with results impacted greatly by soil type and gravimetric filtration method. Aluminum, because of its low plant uptake potential, its high concentration in most soils, and its relatively moderate range in concentration across soil types compared to other soil elemental predictors, is the best indicator of soil contamination of biomass when the soil type is unknown. Evaluation of herbaceous plants for bioenergy parameters should include ash and Al analysis to assess soil contamination, which could significantly bias other compositional analyses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - World crop prices increased dramatically during the period 2006-2009. In this context of high crop prices, farmers may tend to increase the amount of agro-chemical inputs they use in order to increase yield and manage risks related to crop production. These practices could, however, have potentially adverse environmental effects in terms of loss of biodiversity and increased water and air pollution. This study uses a structural econometric model to measure the effects of crop prices on demand for agro-chemical inputs and land allocation. We study individual farms observed in the period 2006-2009 in the French Département de la Meuse. We estimate a multi-output profit function using farm-level panel data. Our results show that an increase in the rapeseed price, which is the principal feedstock for the production of biodiesel in France, has a positive and significant effect on demand for agro-chemical inputs. Higher rapeseed prices also induce an expansion in the land area allocated to rapeseed at the expense of barley and set-aside. These results suggest that changes in the rapeseed price, partly driven by biofuel policies, induce changes in demand for chemicals and land allocation which may have potentially adverse effects on the environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - HRJ (Hydro-processed Renewable Jet) conversion technology has been recently used to produce renewable jet fuel for commercial or military flights. In this study, a techno-economic analysis is carried out for evaluating the production of jatropha-derived HRJ fuel through a bio-refinery process. Each component of the chosen feedstock jatropha can be converted into valuable products. The bio-refinery process is split into 6 parts: (1) Fruit Dehulling; (2) Shell Combustion; (3) Oil Extraction; (4) Press Cake Pyrolysis; (5) Oil Upgrading; (6) Product Separation. The minimum jet fuel selling price (MJSP) from this fruit scenario is calculated to be $5.42/gal based on the plant capacity of 2400 metric tonne of feedstock per day. The co-products obtained from the process not only significantly deduct the production cost but make the entire process energy self-sustainable. We also discuss the oil scenario, which oil is the starting material and the process begins from Oil Upgrading section. The oil scenario offers the MJSP of $5.74/gal with lower capital but higher operating costs. The differences of MJSPs for fruit and oil scenarios are due to feedstock cost, refinery capital cost, co-product credits and energy cost. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the feedstock price, oil content, plant capacity, reactor construction and catalyst usage are important parameters that control the price of the produced fuel. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context: The phenomenon of known as ‘land grabbing’ is not a new process. Especially, since the 1990s, some capital-rich countries have started to buy or lease foreign lands to be able to produce food and biofuels. Objectives: This article aimed at investigating the (un)sustainability of ‘transnational land deals’ (TLDs) for investors, host governments and local communities. Given the three dimensions of sustainability, the “social acceptability”, “economic viability” and “environmental conservation” of the TLDs have been studied. Methods: To understand whether and to what extent the TLD is sustainable in each dimension a meta-analysis was conducted on 73 journal articles. Results: Results showed that tenure arrangements and livelihoods were the main drivers for the matter’s social acceptability. Accordingly, local communities are affected by losing and receiving little or no compensation for their land, and making them have to face the increasing vulnerability of their livelihoods. This results in a win–win–loss situation for investors, host governments and local communities, respectively. Economic (un)sustainability mainly depends on capital flow, infrastructure and employment. This aspect is evidenced as a win for investors and host governments and implies the aforementioned win–win–loss situation. The main aspects of environmental (un)sustainability are considered as biodiversity, ecosystem services, and climate change. Conclusions: According to the results, both host governments and local communities experience loss. This results in a win–loss–loss status of the TLDs. The major challenge remains in establishing good land governance, which can guarantee the benefits to local people and their access to land. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In 2006, transnational ethanol corporations arrived in Chira, a semi-arid zone located in the Piura region of northern Peru. Large expanses of land were used to produce sugarcane for ethanol, which triggered local concern over the pressure this would mean on the regional water balance. From political ecology, I examine how the state and a corporation produced discourses on the idea of water abundance in the Chira Basin in order to secure water rights, which increased the risk of water scarcity for small communities, pastoralists and farmers in the region. In doing so, I call attention to the discursive strategies aimed to facilitate processes of dispossession under a technical ethos that reinforce capital accumulation. Finally, I argue that water abundance discourses contributed to produce a “waterscape” that not only produced unsustainable water use but also reinforced social inequalities. © 2016 The Author.

AB  - Second-generation biofuels and bio-based products derived from lignocellulosic biomass are likely to replace current fuels derived from simple sugars and starch because of greater yield potential and less competition with food production. Besides the high aboveground biomass production, these bioenergy grasses also exhibit extensive root systems. The decomposition of root biomass greatly influences nutrient cycling and microbial activity and subsequent accumulation of carbon (C) in the soil. The objective of this research was thus to characterize root morphological and chemical differences in six perennial grass species in order to better understand root decomposition and belowground C cycling of these bioenergy cropping systems. Giant reed (Arundo donax), elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum), energycane (Saccharum spp.), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), sweetcane (Saccharum arundinaceum), and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) were established in Fall 2008 in research plots near Gainesville, Florida. Root decomposition rates were measured in situ from root decomposition bags over 12 months along with initial and final root tissue composition. Root potential decomposition rate constant (K) was higher in elephantgrass (3.64 g kg−1day−1) and sweetcane (2.77 g kg−1day−1) than in sugarcane (1.62 g kg−1 day−1) and energycane (1.48 g kg−1 day−1). Notably, K was positively related to initial root tissue total C (Total C), total fiber glucose (TFG), total fiber xylose (TFX), and total fiber carbohydrate (TFC) concentrations, but negatively related to total fiber arabinose (TFA) and lignin (TL) concentrations and specific root volume (SRV). Among the six species, elephantgrass exhibited root traits most favorable for fast decomposition: high TFG, high TFX, high TFC, high specific root length (SRL), and a low SRV, whereas giant reed, sugarcane, and energycane exhibited slow decomposition rates and the corresponding root traits. Thus, despite similar aboveground biomass yields in many cases, these species are likely to differentially affect soil C accumulation. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Bioenergy crop cultivation on former peat extraction areas is a potential after-use option that provides a source of renewable energy while mitigating climate change through enhanced carbon (C) sequestration. This study investigated the full C and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of fertilized (RCG-F) and nonfertilized (RCG-C) reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) cultivation compared to bare peat (BP) soil within an abandoned peat extraction area in western Estonia during a dry year. Vegetation sampling, static chamber and lysimeter measurements were carried out to estimate above- and belowground biomass production and allocation, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in cultivated strips and drainage ditches as well as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots. Fertilization increased the above- to belowground biomass production ratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. CO2, CH4 and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and 180 g C m−2 yr−1 in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively, suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net CO2 exchange, whereas the combined contribution of CH4 and DOC fluxes was &lt;5%. The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively. The CO2 exchange was also the dominant component of the GHG balance, while the contributions of CH4 and N2O were &lt;1% and 1–6%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated CO2 uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCG cultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Environmental or ‘ecological’ footprints have been widely used in recent years as indicators of resource consumption and waste absorption presented in terms of biologically productive land area [in global hectares (gha)] required per capita with prevailing technology. In contrast, ‘carbon footprints’ are the amount of carbon (or carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions for such activities in units of mass or weight (like kilograms per functional unit), but can be translated into a component of the environmental footprint (on a gha basis). The carbon and environmental footprints associated with the world production of liquid biofuels have been computed for the period 2010–2050. Estimates of future global biofuel production were adopted from the 2011 International Energy Agency (IEA) ‘technology roadmap’ for transport biofuels. This suggests that, although first generation biofuels will dominate the market up to 2020, advanced or second generation biofuels might constitute some 75% of biofuel production by 2050. The overall environmental footprint was estimated to be 0.29 billion (bn) gha in 2010 and is likely to grow to around 2.57 bn gha by 2050. It was then disaggregated into various components: bioproductive land, built land, carbon emissions, embodied energy, materials and waste, transport, and water consumption. This component-based approach has enabled the examination of the Manufactured and Natural Capital elements of the ‘four capitals’ model of sustainability quite broadly, along with specific issues (such as the linkages associated with the so-called energy–land–water nexus). Bioproductive land use was found to exhibit the largest footprint component (a 48% share in 2050), followed by the carbon footprint (23%), embodied energy (16%), and then the water footprint (9%). Footprint components related to built land, transport and waste arisings were all found to account for an insignificant proportion to the overall environmental footprint, together amounting to only about 2%. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The Southern High Plains (SHP) region of Texas in the United States, where cotton is grown in a vast acreage, has the potential to grow cellulosic bioenergy crops such as perennial grasses and biomass sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Evaluation of hydrological responses and biofuel production potential of hypothetical land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to cellulosic bioenergy crops enables better understanding of the associated key agroecosystem processes and provides for the feasibility assessment of the targeted land use change in the SHP. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with perennial Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. [Poaceae]), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and annual biomass sorghum on water balances, water use efficiency and biofuel production potential in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed. Under perennial grass scenarios, the average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the entire watershed decreased by 6–8% relative to the baseline cotton scenario. In contrast, surface runoff increased by about 5% under the biomass sorghum scenario. Perennial grass land use change scenarios suggested an increase in average annual percolation within a range of 3–22% and maintenance of a higher soil water content during August to April compared to the baseline cotton scenario. About 19.1, 11.1, 3.2 and 8.8 Mg ha−1 of biomass could potentially be produced if cotton area in the watershed would hypothetically be replaced by Miscanthus, switchgrass, big bluestem and biomass sorghum, respectively. Finally, Miscanthus and switchgrass were found to be ideal bioenergy crops for the dryland and irrigated systems, respectively, in the study watershed due to their higher water use efficiency, better water conservation effects, greater biomass and biofuel production potential, and minimum crop management requirements. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The fate and effect of hormone and antimicrobial residues in the manure of therapeutically treated cattle is of considerable concern because of the adverse effects of environmental loading of these chemicals. The objective of this study was to determine the depletion of tylosin (TYL), chlortetracycline (CTC), sulfamethazine (SMZ) and megestrol (MEG) using thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD). RESULTS: Quantitative methods using HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis were developed to monitor the hormone and antimicrobials, spiked into manure obtained from unmedicated cattle. These manure samples were incubated for a 28-day period, during which hormone and antimicrobial depletion, and biogas production, was determined. Significant depletion of TYL, CTC, SMZ and MEG was demonstrated using TAD. Both TYL and CTC underwent complete depletion, while SMZ and MEG were each 80% depleted by the 28th day of incubation. The presence of antimicrobials had no negative effects on process stability and caused no significant reduction in total methane production. CONCLUSION: This process has demonstrated value in reducing the hormone and antimicrobial load to the environment, while not compromising economic value of the biogas production, and allowing use of post-digested biosolids as a regenerated fertilizer. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - This article evaluates the suitability of the ECOSSE model to estimate soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from short rotation coppice willow (SRC-Willow), short rotation forestry (SRF-Scots Pine) and Miscanthus after land-use change from conventional systems (grassland and arable). We simulate heterotrophic respiration (Rh), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes at four paired sites in the UK and compare them to estimates of Rh derived from the ecosystem respiration estimated from eddy covariance (EC) and Rh estimated from chamber (IRGA) measurements, as well as direct measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. Significant association between modelled and EC-derived Rh was found under Miscanthus, with correlation coefficient (r) ranging between 0.54 and 0.70. Association between IRGA-derived Rh and modelled outputs was statistically significant at the Aberystwyth site (r = 0.64), but not significant at the Lincolnshire site (r = 0.29). At all SRC-Willow sites, significant association was found between modelled and measurement-derived Rh (0.44 ≤ r ≤ 0.77); significant error was found only for the EC-derived Rh at the Lincolnshire site. Significant association and no significant error were also found for SRF-Scots Pine and perennial grass. For the arable fields, the modelled CO2 correlated well just with the IRGA-derived Rh at one site (r = 0.75). No bias in the model was found at any site, regardless of the measurement type used for the model evaluation. Across all land uses, fluxes of CH4 and N2O were shown to represent a small proportion of the total GHG balance; these fluxes have been modelled adequately on a monthly time-step. This study provides confidence in using ECOSSE for predicting the impacts of future land use on GHG balance, at site level as well as at national level. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) is a key criterion in the environmental assessment of biofuels. Life cycle inventories taking into account the latest methodological developments are an essential prerequisite for this assessment. In the last years, substantial progresses in the modelling of nitrogen emissions relevant for the climate as well as in modelling the emissions from land use change (LUC) have been achieved. Therefore, the biomass production inventories in the ecoinvent database were revised to take into account these developments. Methods: The IPCC method tier 1 has been used for the assessment of N2O emissions. Induced emissions from NH3 and NO3 were included as well. Due to the importance of the latter emissions for N2O formation, these emissions have also been updated and harmonised. The Agrammon model was used for the NH3 emissions. The SALCA-NO3 model has been applied in the European inventories to estimate nitrate leaching, whilst in non-European inventories the SQCB-NO3 model has been used. The quantification of the land use change areas has been based on annualized, retrospective data of the last 20 years. All carbon pools (from aboveground biomass to soil organic carbon) were considered and differentiated on a regional level for all of the natural vegetation categories affected. Whenever possible, default values and methods from the IPCC 2006 were applied. Results and discussion: The changes for ammonia emissions were generally very small (−5 % on average). The nitrate emissions increased on average by +13 %, but this slight trend is the result of important downward and upward changes, whilst the average N2O emissions decreased by −26 %. For the existing inventories of soybean, palm oil and sugarcane production, significant increases of GHG emissions resulted from LUC modelling. This was mainly due to the consistent inclusion of all carbon stocks according to the IPCC guidelines. The calculation method can also result in important C sequestration effects in certain cases like African Jatropha production. Conclusions: The changes in greenhouse gas emissions due to the updated methodology were significant. This shows that life cycle assessment studies for biofuels using older methodological bases need to be revised and could lead to different conclusions. The implemented and cultivated superstructure for LUC modelling is modular and flexible and can be easily extended to other important crop activities. The new parameterisation functionality applied for the activities provides powerful means for the simple generation of site-specific activities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biomass based alternative fuels offer a solution to the world’s ever-increasing energy demand. With the ability to produce high biomass in marginal lands with low inputs, sorghum has a great potential to meet second-generation biofuel needs. Despite the sorghum crop importance in biofuel and fodder industry, there is no comprehensive information available on the cell wall related genes and gene families (biosynthetic and modification). It is important to identify the cell wall related genes to understand the cell wall biosynthetic process as well as to facilitate biomass manipulation. Genome-wide analysis using gene family specific Hidden Markov Model of conserved domains identified 520 genes distributed among 20 gene families related to biosynthesis/modification of various cell wall polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin. Chromosomal localization analysis of these genes revealed that about 65% of cell wall related genes were confined to four chromosomes (Chr. 1-4). Further, 56 tandem duplication events involving 169 genes were identified in these gene families which could be associated with expansion of genes within families in sorghum. Additionally, we also identified 137 Simple Sequence Repeats related to 112 genes and target sites for 10 miRNAs in some important families such as cellulose synthase, cellulose synthase-like, and laccases, etc. To gain further insight into potential functional roles, expression analysis of these gene families was performed using publically available data sets in various tissues and under abiotic stress conditions. Expression analysis showed tissue specificity as well as differential expression under abiotic stress conditions. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive information on cell wall related genes families in sorghum which offers a valuable resource to develop strategies for altering biomass composition by plant breeding and genetic engineering approaches. © 2016 Rai, Thu, Balasubramanian, Cobos, Disasa and Mendu.

AB  - Background: The ability to deconstruct plant biomass without conventional pretreatment has made members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor the target of investigation for the consolidated processing of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and bioproducts. These Gram-positive bacteria are hyperthermophilic anaerobes and the most thermophilic cellulolytic organisms so far described. They use both C5 and C6 sugars simultaneously and have the ability to grow well on xylan, a major component of plant cell walls. This is an important advantage for their use to efficiently convert biomass at yields sufficient for an industrial process. For commodity chemicals, yield from substrate is perhaps the most important economic factor. In an attempt to improve even further the ability of C. bescii to use xylan, we introduced two xylanases from Acidothermus cellulolyticus. Acel-0180 includes tandem carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM2 and CBM3) located at the C-terminus, one of which, CBM2, is not present in C. bescii. Also, the sequences of Xyn10A and Acel-0180 have very little homology with the GH10 domains present in C. bescii. For these reasons, we selected these xylanases as potential candidates for synergistic interaction with those in the C. bescii exoproteome. Results: Heterologous expression of two xylanases from Acidothermus cellulolyticus in Caldicellulosiruptor bescii resulted in a modest, but significant increase in the activity of the exoproteome of C. bescii on xylan substrates. Even though the increase in extracellular activity was modest, the ability of C. bescii to grow on these substrates was dramatically improved suggesting that the xylan substrate/microbe interaction substantially increased deconstruction over the secreted free enzymes alone. Conclusions: We anticipate that the ability to efficiently use xylan, a major component of plant cell walls for conversion of plant biomass to products of interest, will allow the conversion of renewable, sustainable, and inexpensive plant feedstocks to products at high yields. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The genome sequence of Defluviitoga tunisiensis L3 originating from a thermophilic biogas-production plant was established and recently published as Genome Announcement by our group. The circular chromosome of D. tunisiensis L3 has a size of 2,053,097 bp and a mean GC content of 31.38%. To analyze the D. tunisiensis L3 genome sequence in more detail, a phylogenetic analysis of completely sequenced Thermotogae strains based on shared core genes was performed. It appeared that Petrotoga mobilis DSM 10674T, originally isolated from a North Sea oil-production well, is the closest relative of D. tunisiensis L3. Comparative genome analyses of P. mobilis DSM 10674T and D. tunisiensis L3 showed moderate similarities regarding occurrence of orthologous genes. Both genomes share a common set of 1351 core genes. Reconstruction of metabolic pathways important for the biogas production process revealed that the D. tunisiensis L3 genome encodes a large set of genes predicted to facilitate utilization of a variety of complex polysaccharides including cellulose, chitin and xylan. Ethanol, acetate, hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were found as possible end-products of the fermentation process. The latter three metabolites are considered to represent substrates for methanogenic Archaea, the key organisms in the final step of the anaerobic digestion process. To determine the degree of relatedness between D. tunisiensis L3 and dominant biogas community members within the thermophilic biogas-production plant, metagenome sequences obtained from the corresponding microbial community were mapped onto the L3 genome sequence. This fragment recruitment revealed that the D. tunisiensis L3 genome is almost completely covered with metagenome sequences featuring high matching accuracy. This result indicates that strains highly related or even identical to the reference strain D. tunisiensis L3 play a dominant role within the community of the thermophilic biogas-production plant. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Taxonomic and functional profiling based on metagenome analyses frequently revealed that members of the class Clostridia dominate biogas reactor communities and perform different essential metabolic pathways in the biogas fermentation process. Clostridium bornimense strain M2/40T was recently isolated from a mesophilic two-phase lab-scale biogas reactor continuously fed with maize silage and wheat straw. The genome of the strain was completely sequenced and manually annotated to reconstruct its metabolic potential regarding carbohydrate active enzyme production and fermentation of organic compounds for consolidated biofuel production from biomass. The C. bornimense M2/40T genome consists of a chromosome (2,917,864 bp in size) containing 2613 protein coding sequences, and a 699,161 bp chromid (secondary replicon) harboring 680 coding sequences. Both replicons feature very similar GC-contents of approximately 29%. The complex genome comprises three prophage regions, two CRISPR-cas systems and a putative cellulosomal gene cluster that is located on the second replicon (chromid) of the strain. The overexpressed glycosyl hydrolases (GH) CelK (GH9) and CelA (GH48) encoded in the cellulosomal gene cluster were shown to be active on the substrates xylan and xyloglucan whereas XghA (GH74) is highly active on xyloglucan. Reconstruction of fermentation pathways from genome sequence data revealed that strain M2/40T encodes all enzymes for hydrogen, acetate, formate, lactate, butyrate, and ethanol production, leading to the classification of the isolate as acidogenic bacterium. Phylogenetic analyses uncovered that the closest characterized relative of C. bornimense is C. cellulovorans. Comparative analyses of the C. bornimense and C. cellulovorans genomes revealed considerable rearrangements within their chromosomes suggesting that both species evolved separately for a relatively long period of time and adapted to specific tasks within microbial consortia responsible for anaerobic digestion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Whole-tree-harvesting (WTH) is gaining support as a means to obtain more bioenergy from forests. One aspect that is scarcely addressed is its impact on the chemical quality of post-harvest plant growth, which may initiate ecological cascade effects through, for example, altered patterns of herbivory and decomposition. We measured C:N ratios and phenolic compounds in foliage from birch Betula spp. that had grown naturally after WTH and conventional harvest (CH) on two boreal sites in inland and more coastal Norway, three or five years after harvest. We found that carbon concentrations were higher after WTH compared to CH on the near-coastal site in spring and summer, but not on the inland site. The only observed change in nitrogen concentration after WTH was that it was lower compared to CH on the near-coastal site in autumn. In line with these changes, the C:N ratio was higher with WTH throughout the season on the near-coastal site, ostensibly favouring production or accumulation of plant defence metabolites. Expectedly, we observed altered concentrations of several phenolic compounds with WTH, particularly at the near-coastal site. Further studies are needed to clarify patterns, but our data strongly suggest that sustainability assessments of WTH should not ignore impact on plant chemical quality, and its potential consequences for trophic interactions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) is an important atmospheric aerosol constituent that affects the climate by absorbing (directly) the sunlight and modifying cloud characteristics (indirectly). Here, we present first time yearlong measurements of BC and carbon monoxide (CO) from an urban location of Guwahati located in the Brahmaputra River valley (BRV) in the northeast region of India from 1st July 2013 to 30th June 2014. Daily BC concentrations varied within the range of 2.86 to 11.56 μg m-3 with an annual average of 7.17 ± 1.89 μg m-3, while, CO varied from 0.19 to 1.20 ppm with a mean value of 0.51 ± 0.19 ppm during the study period. The concentrations of BC (8.37 μg m-3) and CO (0.67 ppm) were ~39% and ~55% higher during the dry months (October to March) than the wet months (April to September) suggesting that seasonal changes in meteorology and emission sources play an important role in controlling these species. The seasonal δBC/δCO ratios were highest (lowest) in the pre-monsoon (winter) 18.1 ± 1.4 μg m-3 ppmv-1 (12.6 ± 2.2 μg m-3 ppmv-1) which indicate the combustion of biofuel/biomass as well as direct emissions from fossil fuel during the pre-monsoon season. The annual BC emission was estimated to be 2.72 Gg in and around Guwahati which is about 44% lower than the mega city 'Delhi' (4.86 Gg). During the study period, the annual mean radiative forcing (RF) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) for clear skies of BC was +9.5 Wm-2, however, the RF value at the surface (SFC) was -21.1 Wm-2 which indicates the net warming and cooling effects, respectively. The highest RF at SFC was in the month of April (-30 Wm-2) which is coincident with the highest BC mass level. The BC atmospheric radiative forcing (ARF) was +30.16 (annual mean) Wm-2 varying from +23.1 to +43.8 Wm-2. The annual mean atmospheric heating rate (AHR) due to the BC aerosols was 0.86 K day-1 indicates the enhancement in radiation effect over the study region. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) captured the seasonal cycle of observed BC fairly well but underestimated the observed BC during the month of May-August. Model results show that BC at Guwahati is controlled mainly by anthropogenic emissions except during the pre-monsoon season when open biomass burning also makes a similar contribution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzymatic reactions involving lipases as catalyst in transesterification can be an excellent alternative to produce environmental-friendly biodiesel. In this study, lipase extracted from Cocoa Pod Husk (CPH) and immobilized through cross linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA) technology catalysed the transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil successfully. Face centered central composite design (FCCCD) under response surface methodology (RSM) was used to get the optimal conditions of 3% (w/w) enzyme loading, 4 h reaction time and 1:6 oil/ethanol ratio to achieve the highest conversion of free fatty acid and glycerides into biodiesel (93%). The reusability of CLEA-lipase was tested and after seven cycles, the conversion percentage reduced to 58%. The results revealed that CLEA lipase from CPH is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: As a key strategy for mitigating global climate change, bioenergy production by reducing CO2 emissions plays an important role in ensuring sustainable development. However, land-use change by converting natural ecosystems into energy crop field could create a carbon debt at the beginning. Thus, the potential carbon debt calculation is necessary for determining a promising bioenergy crop production, especially in the region rich of marginal land. Results: Here, we used high-resolution historical land-use data to identify the marginal land available and to evaluate the carbon debt of planting Miscanthus in the Loess Plateau, China. We found that there were 27.6 Mha for energy production and 9.7 Mha for ecological restoration, with total annual production of 0.41 billion tons of biomass. We also found that soil carbon sequestration and total CO2 mitigation were 9.3 Mt C year-1 and 542 Mt year-1, respectively. More importantly, the result showed that planting Miscanthus on marginal land in the Loess Plateau only took 0.97 years on average to repay the carbon debt. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that Miscanthus production in suitable marginal land in the Loess Plateau can offer considerable renewable energy and mitigate climate change with little carbon debt. These results suggested that bioenergy production in the similar arid and semiarid region worldwide would contribute to carbon sequestration in the context of rapid climate change. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The recent resurgence of hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, driven substantially by phosphorus loads from agriculture, have led the United States and Canada to begin developing plans to meet new phosphorus load targets. To provide insight into which agricultural management options could help reach these targets, we tested alternative agricultural-land-use and land-management scenarios on phosphorus loads to Lake Erie. These scenarios highlight certain constraints on phosphorus load reductions from changes in the Maumee River Watershed (MRW), which contributes roughly half of the phosphorus load to the lake's western basin. We evaluate the effects on phosphorus loads under nutrient management strategies, reduction of fertilizer applications, employing vegetative buffers, and implementing widespread cover crops and alternative cropping changes. Results indicate that even if fertilizer application ceased, it may take years to see desired decreases in phosphorus loads, especially if we experience greater spring precipitation or snowmelt. Scenarios also indicate that widespread conversions to perennial crops that may be used for biofuel production are capable of substantially reducing phosphorus loads. This work demonstrates that a combination of legacy phosphorus, land management, land use, and climate should all be considered when seeking phosphorus-loading solutions. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis was performed with small diameter woody biomasses (Larix Kaempferi and Quercus mongolica) in the fluidized bed reactor under the temperature ranges between 450 and 500°C at the residence time of 1.3 second. Three pyrolytic products (bio-oil, bio-char and gas) were investigated by means of various analytical methods. The yield of bio-oil was determined to 60.6-66.7 wt% for Larix Kaempferi and 59.7-64.4 wt% for Quercus mongolica, respectively. The lowest yield of bio-oil was observed at temperature of 550°C in both feedstocks. As a result of the physicochemical analysis, the water content of bio-oil showed the lowest at 500°C in both Larix Kaempferi and Quercus mongolica (Larix Kaempferi 25.9%, Quercus mongolica 25.3%). According to GC/MS analysis, 36 pyrolysis products were identified from the bio-oil. Acetic acid, levoglucosan, ketone related compounds were produced as major pyrolysis degradation products.

AB  - Ruminants raised for meat and milk are important sources of protein in human diets worldwide. Their unique digestive system allows them to derive energy and nourishment from forages, making use of vast areas of grazing lands not suitable for arable cropping or biofuel production and avoiding direct competition for grain that can be used as human food. However, sustaining an ever-growing population of ruminants consuming forages poses a dilemma: while exploiting their ecological niche, forage-fed ruminants produce large amount of enteric methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Resolving this quandary would allow ruminants an expanded role in meeting growing global demands for livestock products. One way around the dilemma is to devise forage-based diets and feeding systems that reduce methane emissions per unit of milk or meat produced. Ongoing research has made significant strides toward this objective. A wider opportunity is to look beyond methane emissions alone and consider all greenhouse gas emissions from the entire livestock-producing system. For example, by raising ruminants in systems using forages, some of the methane emissions can be offset by preserving or enhancing soil carbon reserves, thereby withholding carbon dioxide from the air. Similarly, well-managed systems based on forages may reduce synthetic fertilizer use by more effective use of manure and nitrogen-fixing plants, thereby curtailing nitrous oxide emissions. The potential environmental benefits of forage-based systems may be expanded even further by considering their other ecological benefits, such as conserving biodiversity, improving soil health, enhancing water quality, and providing wildlife habitat. The quandary, then, can be alleviated by managing ruminants within a holistic land–livestock synchrony that considers not only methane emissions but also suppression of other greenhouse gases as well as other ecological benefits. Given the complexity of such systems, there likely are no singular “best-management” practices that can be recommended everywhere. Using systems-based approaches such as life cycle analysis, ruminant production can be tuned for local lands to achieve greatest net benefits overall. In many instances, such systems, based on forages, may maintain high output of milk and meat while also furnishing other ecosystem benefits, such as reduced overall greenhouse gas emissions. © 2016 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Biofuels represent an opportunity for Brazil to exert global leadership by substantially scaling up the production, consumption, and international trade of bioethanol. Africa represents an ideal venue in which to do this, given its suitable agro-climatic conditions and extensive land area. Brazil has consequently sought to establish bilateral partnerships with African countries, as well as North-South-South trilateral partnerships involving the EU and US. However, empirically grounded assessments of how Brazil’s leadership aspirations have unfolded in practice through these partnerships are limited. In this article, we examine Brazil’s potential to exert global political leadership, by analyzing its policybased, structural, and instrumental qualities in making bilateral and trilateral inroads regarding bioethanol production in Africa. Interviews in Brazil, Africa, and Europe suggest that both the bilateral and trilateral avenues have produced meager results. Lack of domestic strategy and vision, economic recession, and a fragmented alliance network have reduced Brazil’s capacity to achieve its ethanol diplomacy objectives. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - In light of the move toward a low carbon economy, Malaysia is currently promoting the production of palm oil-based biodiesel. This study develops a multicommodity, multistage, comparative static, partial equilibrium model for the Malaysian agricultural sector to be used to examine the impact of shifts in domestic demand for palm oil-based biofuel on the Malaysian agricultural sector. The model links explicitly factor markets, related outputs, and consumer preferences for biofuels. Model results demonstrate a clear converse relationship between the variables representing the competing activities within the same sector. An increase in domestic biofuel demand leads to an increase in biofuel output and primary factor uses while the outputs of competing uses, especially food and other non-food products decline markedly. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and the Association of Applied Biologists.

AB  - A techno-economic and environmental analysis for the production of biodiesel, ethanol, butanol, hydrogen and electricity as main products and acetone as by-product from oil palm was studied considering the biorefinery concept in the Colombian context. Fresh fruit bunches were used as raw material to obtain biofuels and bioenergy. As a result, the production costs under the biorefinery concept are 0.34, 9.59, 5.69, 6.98 and 5.69 USD per kilogram of biodiesel, hydrogen, butanol, ethanol and acetone, respectively. Besides, the cost related to the electricity generation is 0.7 USD per kWh. According to these results, biodiesel and hydrogen, have a positive economic margin of 77 and 20 %, respectively. On the other hand, the biorefinery presents a negative economic margin for both minimum and maximum sale prices of the products due to the low productivity of most of the process stages. As a consequence, the process scale is the key parameter in the economic profitability for this biorefinery. From the environmental point of view, the stages involved in the biodiesel production have a lesser extent of potential environmental impact in the biorefinery due to the minimum waste streams generated. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in the tropics because of insatiable global demand for fruit oil to be used in food, biofuels and cosmetics. Here we show that three tissue-specific volatiles can be quantified in ambient air above an African-American hybrid oil palm plantation in Brazil and linked photosynthesis (isoprene), floral scent (estragole), and for the first time, fruit oil processing (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, MHO). Plant enclosure techniques verified their tissue specific emission sources with ambient concentrations displaying distinct diurnal patterns above the canopy. Isoprene concentrations were near zero at night, but dramatically increased during the day while estragole showed elevated concentrations at night suggesting a light-independent, temperature-driven emission pattern from flowers. MHO also showed elevated concentrations at night and both estragole and MHO increased during the day. Our observations demonstrate that the African-American oil palm hybrid is strong isoprene emitter and suggest that MHO is a specific oxidation product of lycopene released during the industrial processing of palm oil. This study highlights the potential value of quantifying volatile oil palm signals in the atmosphere as a novel, non-invasive method to better understand biological functioning and its interactions with the environment including carbon assimilation, floral-insect interactions, and fruit oil production/processing. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Natural fires ignited by lightning strikes following droughts frequently are posited as the ecological mechanism maintaining discontinuous tree cover and grass-dominated ground layers in savannas. Such fires, however, may not reliably maintain humid savannas. We propose that savanna trees producing pyrogenic shed leaves might engineer fire characteristics, affecting ground-layer plants in ways that maintain humid savannas. We explored our hypothesis in a high-rainfall, frequently burned pine savanna in which the dominant tree, longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), produces resinous needles that become highly flammable when shed and dried. We postulated that pyrogenic needles should have much greater influence on fire characteristics at ground level, and hence post-fire responses of dominant shrubs and grasses, than other abundant fine fuels (shed oak leaves and grass culms). We further reasoned that these effects should increase with amounts of needles. We managed site conditions that affect fuels (time since fire, dominant vegetation), manipulated amounts of needles in ground-layer plots, prescribed burned the plots, and measured fire characteristics at ground level. We also measured characteristics of ground-layer oaks and grasses before, then 2 and 8 months after fires. We tested our hypotheses regarding effects of pyrogenic pine fuels on fire characteristics and vegetation regrowth and explored direct and indirect effects of fuels on fire characteristics and vegetation using a structural equation model. Pine needles influenced fire characteristics, elevating maximum temperature increases, durations of heating above 60°C, and fine fuel consumption considerably above measurements when fuels only included other savanna plants. Presence of pine needles depressed post-fire numbers of oak stems and grass culms, especially in the interior of grass genets, as well as post-fire flowering of grasses. The structural equation model indicated strong direct and indirect pathways from pine needles to post-fire responses of oaks and grasses. The experimental field tests of hypotheses, bolstered by structural equation modeling, indicate pyrogenic fine fuels modify characteristics of prescribed fires at ground level, negatively affecting dominant ground-layer oaks and grasses. Frequent fires fueled by pyrogenic needles should maintain humid savannas and generate spatial pyrodiversity that affects composition and dynamics of pine savanna ground-layer vegetation. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - This article provides an overview of previous research contributions and the current status of technology on the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wood biomass into liquid fuels and valuable chemicals. This process involves the direct liquefaction of biomass, which operates from 200°C to 400°C, 5 to 25 MPa, and 10 to 60 min reaction time in hot-compressed water or solvent and with or without a catalyst in the presence of inert or reducing gas. The influence of process variables, including biomass composition, temperature, residence time, pressure, heating rate, particle size, catalysts, and so on, which are significant for the bio-oil yield and product quality, has been addressed in this review. This review focuses on the HTL fundamentals based on current knowledge and summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge of the HTL of wood biomass. © 2016 by De Gruyter.

AB  - This paper uses per capita data for 132 countries over 1960–2010 to estimate elasticities of sectoral energy use with respect to national gross domestic product (GDP). We estimate models in both levels and growth rates and use our estimates to sectorally decompose the aggregate energy-GDP elasticity. Our estimates show that residential energy use is very inelastic to GDP if primary solid biofuels are counted in energy use tallies, especially at low income levels. Residential use of electricity is more tightly linked to GDP, as is energy use by the transportation, industrial, and services sectors. Agriculture typically accounts for a small share of energy use and has a modest energy-GDP elasticity. The aggregate energy-GDP elasticity tends to be higher for countries at higher income levels, in large part because traditional use of primary solid biofuels is less important. Gasoline prices, winter temperature, population, and land area are among other factors influencing sectoral energy use. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy crop production has been proposed for land of poor quality to avoid competition with food production and negative indirect land use consequences. The objective of this study was to determine the land area requirements, biomass transportation distance, and expected profit consequences of restricting switchgrass biomass production, for use as biofuel feedstock, to marginal land relative to unrestricted land use. The USA soils capability classification system was used to differentiate between high quality land and land of marginal quality. Fifty years of historical weather data were used in combination with a biophysical simulation model to estimate switchgrass biomass yield distributions for land of different quality for counties in the case study region. A mathematical programming model was designed and solved to determine the economic consequences. For the levels of biofuel price considered ($0.50, $0.75 and $1.00/L), and a 262.5 M L/year biorefinery modeled, restricting land use to marginally productive capability Class IV soils, increases the quantity of land optimally leased by 42 to 52%; increases biomass trucking total transportation distance by 115 to 116%; and reduces the expected net returns by $11 to $15 M/year compared to when land use is unrestricted. In the absence of government restrictions, for-profit companies are not likely to limit energy crop production to land of marginal quality. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grassland birds have declined more than any other guild in the United States because of loss and degradation of native grasslands. The United States Department of Agriculture Farm Bill programs have restored some native warm-season grasses (NWSG), but populations of many grassland bird species continue to decline. Market-based NWSG uses focused on hay, pasture, and biofuel feedstock may be more appealing to landowners, and may still provide grassland bird habitat on the landscape. We examined breeding grassland bird occupancy of 102 NWSG production fields including 5 treatments (control [n = 37], grazing [n = 7], hay [n = 22], seed [n = 21], and biofuel [n = 15] production) in Kentucky and Tennessee during 2009–2010 breeding seasons. We used a robust design model in Program MARK to determine occupancy and detection rates for grassland birds. We modeled occupancy differences among treatments and sites (i.e., KY, TN), and included covariates (i.e., field-level vegetation metrics and landscape composition at 3 scales [250 m, 500 m, and 1 km]) for eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Covariates that influenced occupancy included treatment (field sparrow, 2009 only), site (eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, and northern bobwhite), percent NWSG cover (positive, red-winged blackbird), and percent forest cover within 250 m (negative for eastern meadowlark, grasshopper sparrow, northern bobwhite, and red-winged blackbird) or within 1 km (negative, field sparrow). Our results suggest that forest cover in the surrounding landscape negatively influences species occupancy, and species occupancy generally did not differ among NWSG production treatments. These treatments could be an alternative means to provide grassland bird habitat within an agriculture production landscape. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

AB  - Pressure on agricultural land has markedly increased since the start of the century, driven by demographic growth, changes in diet, increasing biofuel demand, and globalization. To better ensure access to adequate land and water resources, many investors and countries began leasing large areas of agricultural land in the global South, a phenomenon often termed "large-scale land acquisition" (LSLA). To date, this global land rush has resulted in the appropriation of 41million hectares and about 490km3 of freshwater resources, affecting rural livelihoods and local environments. It remains unclear to what extent land and water acquisitions contribute to the emergence of water-stress conditions in acquired areas, and how these demands for water may be impacted by climate change. Here we analyze 18 African countries - 20Mha (or 80%) of LSLA for the continent - and estimate that under present climate 210km3year-1of water would be appropriated if all acquired areas were actively under production. We also find that consumptive use of irrigation water is disproportionately contributed by water-intensive biofuel crops. Using the IPCCA1B scenario, we find only small changes in green (-1.6%) and blue (+2.0%) water demand in targeted areas. With a 3°C temperature increase, crop yields are expected to decrease up to 20% with a consequent increase in the water footprint. When the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2concentrations is accounted for, crop yields increase by as much as 40% with a decrease in water footprint up to 29%. The relative importance of CO2 fertilization and warming will therefore determine water appropriations and changes in water footprint under climate change scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second-generation biodiesel (SGB) is one of the next promising biofuels for internal combustion engines due to their advantages compared with the first-generation biodiesel (FGB). However, little research about SGB has been published on the optical diagnostics of their combustion processes and emissions characteristics. In this paper, the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique was applied to study the OH distribution in the flame of different blending ratios diesel/SGB in a constant volume chamber. The ignition delays under different operating conditions were observed by the high-speed imaging technique. After that, the emissions characteristics of those different blending ratios fuels were investigated in a four-cylinder direct injection diesel engine through ESC test cycle. The results show that the ignition delay decreased with increasing blending ratio of SGB and the LIF signal area increased with higher blending ratios of biodiesel. Furthermore, the blending fuel of IV-B20 has better emissions as well as economy performance among all fuels and HC emissions has little sensitivity towards the speed under the same load while NOx emissions at the same load are mainly depended on the engine speed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plant oil is a key commodity in the global economy, particularly for food and bioenergy markets. However, current production practices often impair smallholder livelihoods, cause land use changes, and compete for food production. The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm's ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm's potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC's A2A 'business as usual' emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm's high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The spread of biofuels has generated controversy at international, national and regional levels due to the environmental, economic and social impacts that its production and consumption can cause. Recently, the Spanish government has been promoting the production of biodiesel in industrial plants located in Spain and other EU countries. These developments are expected to stimulate the cultivation of rapeseed in the EU to the detriment of extra-EU imports of biodiesel mainly based on soybean oil from Argentina, which has been one of the main suppliers of biodiesel in Spain for years. As a result, the environmental impacts produced throughout the life cycle of biodiesel consumed in Spain could be radically affected. In this context, the environmental impacts of biodiesel produced in Spain and Argentina with rapeseed cultivated in Spain and soybean cultivated in Argentina were compared under certain growing conditions using life cycle assessment (LCA). Consequential and attributional approaches were compared under the ReCiPe method to test potential biases. The results showed that the biodiesel produced with Argentinean soybean oil had fewer environmental impacts than biodiesel produced with Spanish rapeseed oil. Seed production (and fertilization) was the process (and sub-process) that generated the greatest environmental burdens, and it is an area in which improvement is necessary in order to increase sustainability, particularly with regard to Spanish rapeseed-based biodiesel. © 2016 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Six EU gas grids have a target of 100% substitution of natural gas with renewable gas by 2050. This industry will start with biogas upgraded to biomethane. The biomethane resource and location of waste substrates (such as agricultural slurries, slaughterhouse waste, milk processing waste, and source separated household organic waste) were determined using the most recent spatially explicit data for Ireland. The total biomethane resource was estimated equivalent to: 7.6% of natural gas usage, 7% of energy in transport; 52% of the fuel usage in heavy goods vehicles in 2013. In terms of natural gas usage it corresponded to 26.5% of industrial gas use, and 52% of residential natural gas use. The resource as a source of thermal energy is equivalent to wood chips from 16.5% of arable land under short rotation coppice willow. Thematic maps illustrating the location of each resource were developed to highlight regions of significant biomethane production potential. The regions with the greatest resource of cattle slurry are located in the south and east of the country; sheep manure resources are concentrated on the western seaboard, while the largest biomethane resource from household organic waste is found in urban and city areas (63% of household organic waste biomethane resource). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although the particulate matter (PM) emissions from biodiesel fuelled engines are acknowledged to be lower than those of fossil diesel, there is a concern on the impact of PM produced by biodiesel to human health. As the oxidative potential of PM has been suggested as trigger for adverse health effects, it was measured using the Electron Spin Resonance (OPESR) technique. Additionally, Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (EDXRF) was employed to determine elemental concentration, and Raman Spectroscopy was used to describe the amorphous carbon character of the soot collected on exhaust PM from biodiesel blends fuelled test-bed engine, with and without Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). OPESR results showed higher oxidative potential per kWh of PM produced from a blend of 20% soybean biodiesel and 80% ULSD (B20) engine compared with a blend of 5% soybean biodiesel and 95% ULSD (B5), whereas the SCR was able to reduce oxidative potential for each fuel. EDXRF data indicates a correlation of 0.99 between concentration of copper and oxidative potential. Raman Spectroscopy centered on the expected carbon peaks between 1100 cm-1 and 1600 cm-1 indicate lower molecular disorder for the B20 particulate matter, an indicative of a more graphitic carbon structure. The analytical techniques used in this study highlight the link between biodiesel engine exhaust and increased oxidative potential relative to biodiesel addition on fossil diesel combustion. The EDXRF analysis confirmed the prominent role of metals on free radical production. As a whole, these results suggest that 20% of biodiesel blends run without SCR may pose an increased health risk due to an increase in OH radical generation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural gas transportation fuels are credited in prior studies with greenhouse gas emissions savings relative to petroleum-based fuels and relative to the total emissions of biofuels. These analyses, however, overlook a source of potentially large indirect emissions from natural gas transportation fuels, namely the emissions from incremental coal-fired generation caused by price-induced substitutions away from natural-gas-fired electricity generation. Because coal-fired generation emits substantially more greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants than natural-gas-fired generation, this indirect coal-use change effect diminishes potential emissions savings from natural gas transportation fuels. Estimates from a parameterized multi-market model suggest the indirect coal-use change effect rivals in magnitude the indirect land-use change effect of biofuels and renders natural gas fuels as carbon intensive as petroleum fuels. © 2016.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is targeted as a biofuel feedstock species that may be grown on marginal lands including those with saline soils. Our study investigated salt stress responses in 46 switchgrass lines from the lowland and upland ecotypes by assessing physiological phenotypes and proline concentrations. Lowland switchgrass lines demonstrated less severe responses to salt stress than most upland switchgrass lines, but a number of upland lines performed as well as lowland individuals. Photosynthetic rate (Pn), the most important physiological trait measured, was reduced by salt treatment in all lines. Tolerant lines showed ~50% reduction in Pn under salt stress, and sensitive lines exhibited ~90% reduction in Pn after salt stress. Proline analysis showed the largest amount of variation under salt stress with some lines exhibiting minor increases in proline, but some salt-sensitive lines demonstrated more than 5000-fold increase in proline concentration in response to salt treatment. Clustering of salt-stress phenotypic responses revealed five groups of switchgrass. Lowland lines were present in two of the phenotypic clusters, but upland lines were found in all five of the phenotypic clusters. These results suggest that there are multiple modes of salt response in switchgrass including two distinct modes of salt tolerance. © 2016 .

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is expanding rapidly in the UK. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have highlighted the sensitivity of environmental outcomes to feedstock type, fugitive emissions, biomethane use, energy conversion efficiency and digestate management. We combined statistics on current and planned AD deployment with operational data from a survey of biogas plant operators to evaluate the environmental balance of the UK biogas sector for the years 2014 and 2017. Consequential LCA was applied to account for all major environmental credits and burdens incurred, including: (i) substitution of composting, incineration, sewer disposal, field decomposition and animal feeding of wastes; (ii) indirect land use change (ILUC) incurred by the cultivation of crops used for biogas production and to compensate for bakery and brewery wastes diverted from animal feed. In 2014, the UK biogas sector reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 551-755 Gg CO2e excluding ILUC, or 238-755 Gg CO2e including ILUC uncertainty. Fossil energy depletion was reduced by 8.9-10.8 PJe, but eutrophication and acidification burdens were increased by 1.8-3.4 Gg PO4e and 8.1-14.6 Gg SO2e, respectively. Food waste and manure feedstocks dominate GHG abatement, largely through substitution of in-vessel composting and manure storage, whilst food waste and crop feedstocks dominate fossil energy credit, primarily through substitution of natural gas power generation. Biogas expansion is projected to increase environmental credits and loadings by a factor of 2.4 by 2017. If all AD bioelectricity replaced coal generation, or if 90% of biomethane replaced transport diesel or grid natural gas, GHG abatement would increase by 131%, 38% and 20%, respectively. Policies to encourage digestion of food waste and manures could maximize GHG abatement, avoiding the risk of carbon leakage associated with use of crops and wastes otherwise used to feed livestock. Covering digestate stores could largely mitigate net eutrophication and acidification burdens. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work aimed to characterize two native microalgal strains newly isolated from South Mediterranean areas and identified as Chlorella sorokiniana ES3 and Neochloris sp. AM2. The growth properties and biochemical composition of these microalgae were evaluated in different culture media (Algal, BG-11, f/2, and Conway). Among the tested media, nitrate- and phosphate-rich Algal medium provided the maximum biomass productivities (85.5 and 111.5 mg l−1 day−1 for C. sorokiniana and Neochloris sp., respectively), while the nitrate- and phosphate-deficient f/2 medium resulted in the highest lipid productivities (24.1 and 35.8 mg l−1 day−1 for C. sorokiniana and Neochloris sp., respectively). The physiological state of both microalgae was investigated under different light and temperature levels using the pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry. The better photosynthetic efficiency of C. sorokiniana was obtained at 23 °C with a light saturation of 156 μE m−2 s−1, while that of Neochloris sp. was achieved at 15 °C with a light saturation of 151 μE m−2 s−1. The analysis of fatty acid profile and biodiesel parameters revealed that C. sorokiniana, cultivated in Algal and f/2 media, can be considered as a suitable candidate for high-quality biodiesel production. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Economic and technological assessments have identified difficulties with the commercialization of bulk products from microalgae, like biofuels. To overcome these problems, a multi-product algal-based biorefinery has been proposed. This paper performs a techno-economic assessment of such a biorefinery. Four production pathways, ranging from a base case with commercial technologies to an improved case with innovative technologies, are analyzed. All region-specific parameters were adapted to Belgian conditions. Three scenarios result in techno-economically viable production plants. The most profitable scenario is the scenario which uses a specialized membrane for medium recycling and an open pond algae cultivation. Although the inclusion of a photobioreactor decreases the culture medium costs, the higher investment costs result in lower economic profits. The carotenoid content and price are identified as critical parameters. Furthermore, the economies of scale assumption for the photobioreactor is critical for the feasibility of this cultivation technology. The techno-economic assessment is an important methodology to guide and evaluate further improvements in research and shorten the time-to-market for innovative technologies in this field. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from land-use change are of particular concern for land-based biofuels. Emissions avoided by substituting fossil fuels with biofuels may be offset by emissions from direct and indirect land-use changes (LUC). There is an urgent need to investigate what impact land-use change emissions may have on the expansion of bioenergy and biofuels, in the context of EU mitigation policies. This paper focuses on Ireland, which faces a number of challenges in delivering its renewable energy and GHG reduction targets. The Irish TIMES energy systems model was used to assess the impact of a range of land-use change emissions’ levels on the evolution of Ireland’s low-carbon energy system. A reference scenario was developed where LUC is ignored and Ireland achieves a least-cost low-carbon energy system by 2050. If high indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions are included, this results in a decrease by 30 % in bioenergy and a 68 % increase in marginal abatement costs by 2050. Hydrogen is used instead of bioenergy in the freight sector in this scenario, while private cars are fuelled by renewable electricity. If GHG emissions from ILUC were considered less severe, indigenous grass biomethane becomes the key biofuel representing 31 % of total bioenergy consumption. This is in line with recent research in Ireland of the key role that grass biomethane can play. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Need for food and energy challenge humanity. Producing biofuels from energy crops leads to the dilemma: "energy crops for biofuel or for food?" This paper aims to answer this dilemma through the SWOT analysis, for the first time for Greece. Results of the first alternative show strengths including creation of direct and indirect jobs (Biofuel production industry), diversity of energy supply, and positive contribution of the greenhouse effect. Weaknesses include environmental impact, and dependence on land availability (additional need of arable land other than that required to grow food). Energy and climate change priority on policy agenda, EU directives promoting the use of biofuels, and economic competitiveness with fossil fuels, could create the external environment to promote bioenergy production. Conversely, results of the second option show strengths including food security, and non-risk of deforestation in order to find new land. Weaknesses include failure to increase employment opportunities by not creation of indirect jobs, and non exploitation of marginal lands. Respective external environmental factors include solution to food crisis, use of second generation biofuels, and development of new and non-edible varieties. Dependence on fossil fuels and failure to comply with the world agenda regarding climate change, constitute threats for this option. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the factors that influence households' decisions on adoption of biogas technology in northern Ethiopia. It involved 179 biogas-user and 179 non-user sample households. They were selected using proportionate simple random and purposive sampling techniques, respectively. Data were collected mainly using semi-structured questionnaires. Data analyses employed logistic regression model. The results of the study showed that male-headed households are more likely to adopt the technology than female-headed ones. Educational level, heads of cattle, income level, access to credit, distance to the main fuelwood source, and number of planted trees have significant (p < 0.01) positive influences on adoption of biogas technology. Significant (p < 0.01) spatial variations are also obtained between the two study sites. Furthermore, the interaction effects of a few pairs of explanatory variables were found significant (p < 0.1). Empowering females and female-headed households, improving educational levels of the household heads, increasing cattle size, raising income levels, improving access to credit, and encouraging households to plant more trees are likely to be some of the way forward to increase the adoption of the technology. Considering the spatial variations, ensuring the creation of satisfied biogas-users, upgrading the existing biogas model through addition of 'injera' stove can also enhance adoption of biogas technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To date, feedstock resource assessments have evaluated cellulosic and algal feedstocks independently, without consideration of demands for, and resource allocation to, each other. We assess potential land competition between algal and terrestrial feedstocks in the United States, and evaluate a scenario in which 41.5 × 109 L yr-1 of second-generation biofuels are produced on pastureland, the most likely land base where both feedstock types may be deployed. Under this scenario, open-pond microalgae production is projected to use 1.2 × 106 ha of private pastureland, while terrestrial biomass feedstocks would use 14.0 × 106 ha of private pastureland. A spatial meta-analysis indicates that potential competition for land under this scenario would be concentrated in 110 counties, containing 1.0 and 1.7 × 106 ha of algal and terrestrial dedicated feedstock production, respectively. A land competition index applied to these 110 counties suggests that 38 to 59 counties could experience competition for upwards of 40% of a county's pastureland, representing 2%-5% of total pastureland in the U.S.; therefore suggesting little overall competition between algae production, terrestrial energy feedstocks and alternative uses for existing agricultural production such as livestock grazing. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Development of biofuels causes reduction of environmental pollution, but certain limitations affect their production. In this research, a hybrid system dynamics-mathematical programming approach is developed to design and plan a biodiesel supply chain from biomass fields to consumption markets. The supply chain faces limitations in biodiesel production. Water resource limitations for biodiesel production, land limitations for biomass procurement, and technological issues are the most important limitations considered in the system dynamics model. In addition, competition between fossil fuels and biodiesel is taken into account. The proposed methodology, firstly, estimates the most important parameters in biodiesel supply chain in a given planning horizon. Then, estimated parameters are used as inputs of the mathematical model and the optimal supply chain decisions are made by means of a stochastic mixed-integer programming model. Besides, a scenario-based approach is used to model the disruption risks for links and biomass fields. Finally, a numerical experiment is presented to show the applicability of the methodology according to some interviews with experts in Iran. Results demonstrate the potential appropriate market of biodiesel in Iran while several resource and technology limitations and environmental pollution avoid growth of biodiesel market. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed on risk preferences of decision makers and government policies adopted to improve the biodiesel market. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Scenedesmus quadricauda, accumulated more lipid but with a drastic reduction in biomass yield during nitrogen starvation. Abscisic acid (ABA) being a stress responsible hormone, its effect on growth and biomass with sustainable lipid yield during nitrogen depletion was studied. The result revealed that the ABA level shoots up at 24 h (27.21 pmol/L) during the onset of nitrogen starvation followed by a sharp decline. The external supplemented ABA showed a positive effect on growth pattern (38×106 cells/ml) at a lower concentration. The dry biomass yield is also increasing up to 2.1 fold compared to nitrogen deficient S. quadricauda. The lipid content sustains in 1 and 2 μM concentration of ABA under nitrogen-deficient condition. The fatty acid composition of ABA treated S. quadricauda cultures with respect to nitrogen-starved cells showed 11.17% increment in saturated fatty acid content, the desired lipid composition for biofuel application. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study has attempted to estimate the energy consumption and emission of pollutants namely carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) from the road transport sector in Malaysia from the year 2012 till 2040. This was done using the long-range energy alternatives planning (LEAP) model. Estimates of energy consumption and emissions were evaluated and analysed under a business-as-usual scenario and three other alternative fuel policy scenarios of biodiesel vehicles (BIO), natural gas vehicles (NGV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). The aim of this study has been to identify the potential alternative fuel policies that would be effective in reducing the future growth of road transport energy consumption and emission in Malaysia. Results indicate that the NGV scenario contributes towards the highest reduction in road transport energy consumption followed by BIO and HEV. The NGV scenario also achieves highest mitigation of emission of all the four pollutants. In the case of CO2 emission, BIO scenario attains second highest mitigation, whereas in the event of CO, NOx and NMVOC emission, HEV scenario achieves second highest mitigation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrogen fertilizers applied to sugarcane has high environmental impact on ethanol production. This study aimed to determine the main microbial processes responsible for the N2O emissions from soil fertilized with different N sources, to identify options to mitigate N2O emissions, and to determine the impacts of the N sources on the soil microbiome. In a field experiment, nitrogen was applied as calcium nitrate, urea, urea with dicyandiamide or 3,4 dimethylpyrazone phosphate nitrification inhibitors (NIs), and urea coated with polymer and sulfur (PSCU). Urea caused the highest N2O emissions (1.7% of N applied) and PSCU did not reduce cumulative N2O emissions compared to urea. NIs reduced N2O emissions (95%) compared to urea and had emissions comparable to those of the control (no N). Similarly, calcium nitrate resulted in very low N2O emissions. Interestingly, N2O emissions were significantly correlated only with bacterial amoA, but not with denitrification gene (nirK, nirS, nosZ) abundances, suggesting that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, via the nitrification pathway, were the main contributors to N2O emissions. Moreover, the treatments had little effect on microbial composition or diversity. We suggest nitrate-based fertilizers or the addition of NIs in NH4+-N based fertilizers as viable options for reducing N2O emissions in tropical soils and lessening the environmental impact of biofuel produced from sugarcane.

AB  - Optimum catalyst design plays a pivotal role in maximizing catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) bio-oil yield and quality. This work investigates the use of mordenite framework inverted (MFI) zeolites with hierarchical pore structures as potential catalysts to address the aforementioned challenges. Mesoporous MFI catalysts were created using both top-down and bottom-up approaches, were characterized and evaluated as CFP catalysts. CFP with mesoporous catalysts resulted in higher yields to aromatics and lower coke and char yields. The results of this study indicate that there is a maximum amount of mesopore volume required for optimal acid site accessibility leading to increased bio-oil production. After this maximum, intermediate aromatic hydrocarbons continue to polymerize to form bulky poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and coke. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Biofuels production from plant biomasses is a complex multi-step process with important economic burdens. Several biotechnological approaches have been pursued to reduce biofuels production costs. The aim of the present study was to explore the production in tobacco plastome of three genes encoding (hemi)cellulolytic enzymes from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacterium and Archaea, respectively, and test their application in the bioconversion of an important industrially pretreated biomass feedstock (A. donax) for production of second-generation biofuels. Results: The selected enzymes, endoglucanase, endo-β-1,4-xylanase and β-glucosidase, were expressed in tobacco plastome with a protein yield range from 2 % to more than 75 % of total soluble proteins (TSP). The accumulation of endoglucanase (up to 2 % TSP) gave altered plant phenotypes whose severity was directly linked to the enzyme yield. The most severe seedling-lethal phenotype was due to the impairment of plastid development associated to the binding of endoglucanase protein to thylakoids. Endo-β-1,4-xylanase and β-glucosidase, produced at very high level without detrimental effects on plant development, were enriched (fourfold) by heat treatment (105.4 and 255.4 U/mg, respectively). Both plastid-derived biocatalysts retained the main features of the native or recombinantly expressed enzymes with interesting differences. Plastid-derived xylanase and β-glucosidase resulted more thermophilic than the E. coli recombinant and native counterpart, respectively. Bioconversion experiments, carried out at 50 and 60 °C, demonstrated that plastid-derived enzymes were able to hydrolyse an industrially pretreated giant reed biomass. In particular, the replacement of commercial enzyme with plastid-derived xylanase, at 60 °C, produced an increase of both xylose recovery and hydrolysis rate; whereas the replacement of both xylanase and β-glucosidase produced glucose levels similar to those observed with the commercial cocktails, and xylose yields always higher in the whole 24-72 h range. Conclusions: The very high production level of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic enzymes, their stability and bioconversion efficiencies described in this study demonstrate that plastid transformation represents a real cost-effective production platform for cellulolytic enzymes. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Process and Input–Output based methods are standard models used in attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA). These are linear models that, when used to estimate environmental consequences of a decision that involves changes, rely on linear extrapolation to approximate the changes. Behind this linearity are several assumptions such as fixed input/output relationships and unlimited supply of inputs. These assumptions expose the limitations of the attributional framework when used for consequential modeling. For example, if a product system faces supply constraints and an additional output would induce input substitution, a simple linear extrapolation from existing situations would fall short of estimating the environmental consequences of the additional output. These assumptions, however, can be relaxed to better reflect reality and the attributional framework can provide more relevant and accurate estimates for consequential modeling and decision making. Drawing insights from LCA studies on biofuels and the rich literature of Input–Output Analysis, this paper presents a two-step approach to consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) based on the attributional framework. The first step compiles inventories and conducts attributional analysis to evaluate the status quo of the system under study, identify hotspots on which to focus on subsequently, and construct business-as-usual scenarios. The second step introduces the decision in question, evaluates possible changes to take place, builds scenarios representing associated environmental consequences, and modifies the original inventories accordingly. This paper demonstrates that the attributional framework can serve the purpose of addressing change-oriented questions when it is used properly and its assumptions and limitations are recognized. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Butanol is not only an important solvent and chemical intermediate in food and pharmaceutical industries, but also considered as an advanced biofuel. Recently, there have been resurging interests in producing biobutanol especially using low-cost lignocellulosic biomass, but the process still suffers from low titer and productivity. The challenge for the bioconversion approach is to find an effective way of degrading materials into simple sugars that can then be converted into fuels by microorganisms. The pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is the great important process in influencing butanol production and recovery, finally determining its eco-feasibility in commercialization. Results: The effects of various strengths of citrate buffer on enzymatic hydrolysis and acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation using corn stover or glucose as feedstock were investigated. The strengths of citrate buffer in the range of 20-100 mM had no effect on enzymatic hydrolysis, but greatly influenced the performance of ABE fermentation using corn stover hydrolysate. When 30 mM citrate buffer was used for enzymatic hydrolysis, the fermentation broth with the maximum butanol and ABE concentrations of 11.2 and 19.8 g/L were obtained from 30.9 g/L glucose and 9.7 g/L xylose, respectively, which was concentrated to 100.4 g/L butanol and 153.5 g/L ABE by vapor stripping-vapor permeation process. Furthermore, using glucose as sole carbon source, there were no cell growth and ABE production in the P2 medium with 80 or 100 mM citrate buffer, indicating that higher concentrations of citrate buffer had deleterious effect on cell growth and metabolism due to the variation of cells internal pH and cell membrane permeability. To mimic in situ product recovery for ABE fermentation, the VSVP process produced the condensate containing 212.0-232.0 g/L butanol (306.6-356.1 g/L ABE) from fermentation broth containing ~10 g/L butanol (~17 g/L ABE), the performance of which was more effective than pervaporation and gas stripping. Conclusions: As it has significant impact on butanol fermentation, the strength of citrate buffer is of great importance in lignocellulosic butanol fermentation. Compared with pervaporation and gas stripping, the VSVP process has great potential for efficient butanol recovery in biobutanol production. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The planting of sugarcane crops has expanded in the last decade in the southeast of Brazil, mainly due to its use for biofuel production, such as ethanol. This expansion in the State of São Paulo has occupied land that was previously used for cattle production. The change in land use affects soil and water through changes in ground cover and disturbance associated with farming practices. The objective of the following study was to determine the impact on runoff and erosion resulting from the conversion of pastureland to sugarcane for biofuel production. Erosion plots measuring 100 m2 were built on a farm in Itirapina-SP, Brazil, on land with a slope gradient of 9% and soil composed of Quartz-sand Neosols (Typic quartzipsaments). The treatments were an 18-year old pasture and a new sugarcane plantation, with three replicates for each. After each rainfall episode, erosion and runoff were monitored during the first and second years after sugarcane was planted. The results show increased runoff and soil loss during the first year, though levels decreased in the second year when the sugarcane residue mulch ground cover increased. In addition, the necessary rainfall characteristics (e.g,; intensity, duration) required to produce runoff and soil erosion were identified. © 2016.

AB  - In Brazil, sugarcane expansion for ethanol production has been predominantly on areas previously used as pasture. Losses of C and N induced by land use change raise controversies about the environmental suitability of biofuel production. Therefore, we conducted a field study within the largest sugarcane-producing region of Brazil to evaluate the effects of the primary land use change (LUC) sequence in sugarcane expansion areas (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane), on C and N dynamics in the top 1 m soil layer. The LUC sequences caused substantial but varying changes in soil C and N stocks in areas undergoing expansion of sugarcane in south-central Brazil. The increase of C stocks in areas converted from pasture to sugarcane cultivation was 1.97 Mg ha-1 yr-1, in contrast to conversion of native vegetation to pasture, which decreased soil C stocks by 1.01 Mg ha-1 yr-1 for 0-1.0 m soil layer. The use of 13C measurements to partition soil C sources showed that the greater C stocks in sugarcane areas compared to pasture was due to retention of the native-C stocks and increased accrual of modern-C comparing to pasture. Finally, the inclusion of deeper soil layers, at least down to 1.0 m depth, is essential to assess the impacts of LUC on C balances in agricultural areas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study considered the environmental advantages of switchgrass, along with the economic challenges in its logistics, in the design of a sustainable switchgrass supply chain in Tennessee. Applying a multi-objective optimization model to high-resolution spatial data, potential tradeoffs among the objectives of minimizing feedstock costs, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, and soil erosion were identified for a set of conversion facilities on an efficient frontier. The tradeoff relationship was primarily driven by the type of agricultural land converted to switchgrass. Hay and pasture lands were more cost effective but resulted in higher soil carbon losses and soil erosion after being converted to switchgrass. Converting crop lands reduced GHG emissions and soil erosion but caused higher feedstock cost primarily due to the higher opportunity cost of land use. The respective average costs of abating GHG emissions and soil erosion on the efficient frontier were $2378 Mg-1 and $10 Mg-1. The compromise solution conversion facility site generated 63% higher feedstock cost compared to the cost minimizing location, while reducing soil erosion by 70 fold and diminishing GHG emissions by 27%. Reducing soil erosion may be a more cost effective environmental criterion than reducing GHG emissions in developing a sustainable switchgrass supply chain in Tennessee. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In conventional pig husbandry, antibiotics are frequently applied. Together with excreta, antibiotic residues enter liquid manures finally used as organic soil fertilizers or input materials for biogas plants. Therefore, this first screening study was performed to survey the application patterns of antibiotics from fall 2011 until spring 2013. Manures and digestates were then analyzed for selected antibiotic residues from spring 2012 to 2013. The data analysis of veterinary drug application documents revealed the use of 34 different antibiotics belonging to 11 substance classes at 21 farms under study. Antibiotics, particularly tetracyclines, frequently administered to larger pig groups were detected in manure samples up to higher mg kg-1 dry weight (DW) concentrations. Antibiotic residues in digestates, furthermore, show that a full removal capacity cannot be guaranteed through the anaerobic digestion process in biogas plants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Smallholder planters manage almost 40% of Malaysia's oil palm plantations, indicating that their perception is significant to the success of biofuel produced from palm biomass. The success development of the second generation biofuel can be hampered due to lack of understanding on planter's motive to supply oil palm biomass, which in turn will lead to disruption in continuous supply of feedstock. This study was conducted to examine the smallholder planters' intention to supply oil palm residues available at their plantations. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is used in this study with three additional attitudinal belief variables, namely, perceived production benefit, perceived environmental benefit and perceived ecological impact. A total of 327 valid questionnaires were obtained via a face-to-face survey conducted at oil palm fresh fruit bunches collection centres. Structural equation modelling was conducted using smartPLS version 3.0 software. The results indicate that smallholder planters' intention can be predicted by attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived production benefit and perceived environmental benefit. In advance, this study confirms that attitude and subjective norm can be determined by all three attitudinal beliefs whereas perceived environmental benefit has an insignificant influence on perceived behavioural control. Our result suggests that the policy makers and biofuel producers shall assure planters that their current harvest practice and income will be maintained as and at the level of business as usual when promoting their involvement in supplying oil palm biomass. A precautious step is needed to prevent additional fertilizer usage by planters to trade-off potential ecological impact (e.g. nutrient loss) caused by oil palm biomass removal from their plantation. As this study is conducted prior to an established palm based biomass market, the researcher may want to compare our result with the established market in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability assessment of biodiesel production is a topic of increasing importance due to the interest of governments to define sovereignty strategies and diversification of their energy matrix, and to set up the impact of biofuels production. In this context, this work aims to propose a hierarchical structure of sustainability assessment that integrates dimensions of sustainable development with principles, criteria and indicators (PC&I). The method employed to define the hierarchical structure was a comprehensive literature review, based on information search strategy and classification. About 400 documents were reviewed and 103 documents were ultimately selected, including laws, policy documents, certificates, directives and other normative documents and papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The first result of the analysis was the need to strengthen identification of the sustainable development assessment, adding the political and technological dimensions to the three traditional dimensions, social, economic and environmental, studied in this kind of evaluation. The second result was the proposal of a hierarchical framework for the sustainability assessment of biodiesel production, organized in four levels: The first level comprises the five dimensions associated with sustainable development evaluation, the second includes 13 principles, the third contains 40 criteria and the fourth level corresponds to a set of indicators that describes each criterion. Outcomes of this work provide a foundation for further discussion of sustainability assessments for biodiesel production and its potential application in specific contexts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cultivating annual row crops in high topographic relief waterway buffers has negative environmental effects and can be environmentally unsustainable. Growing perennial grasses such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for biomass (e.g., cellulosic biofuel feedstocks) instead of annual row crops in these high relief waterway buffers can improve local environmental conditions (e.g., reduce soil erosion and improve water quality through lower use of fertilizers and pesticides) and ecosystem services (e.g., minimize drought and flood impacts on production; improve wildlife habitat, plant vigor, and nitrogen retention due to post-senescence harvest for cellulosic biofuels; and serve as carbon sinks). The main objectives of this study are to: (1) identify cropland areas with high topographic relief (high runoff potentials) and high switchgrass productivity potential in eastern Nebraska that may be suitable for growing switchgrass, and (2) estimate the total switchgrass production gain from the potential biofuel areas. Results indicate that about 140,000 hectares of waterway buffers in eastern Nebraska are suitable for switchgrass development and the total annual estimated switchgrass biomass production for these suitable areas is approximately 1.2 million metric tons. The resulting map delineates high topographic relief croplands and provides useful information to land managers and biofuel plant investors to make optimal land use decisions regarding biofuel crop development and ecosystem service optimization in eastern Nebraska. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Synthesis gas (syngas) fermentation by anaerobic acetogenic bacteria employing the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is a bioprocess for production of biofuels and biocommodities. The major fermentation products of the most relevant biocatalytic strains (Clostridium ljungdahlii, C. autoethanogenum, C. ragsdalei, and C. coskatii) are acetic acid and ethanol. A comparative metabolic and genomic analysis using the mentioned biocatalysts might offer targets for metabolic engineering and thus improve the production of compounds apart from ethanol. Autotrophic growth and product formation of the four wild type (WT) strains were compared in uncontrolled batch experiments. The genomes of C. ragsdalei and C. coskatii were sequenced and the genome sequences of all four biocatalytic strains analyzed in comparative manner. Growth and product spectra (acetate, ethanol, 2,3-butanediol) of C. autoethanogenum, C. ljungdahlii, and C. ragsdalei were rather similar. In contrast, C. coskatii produced significantly less ethanol and its genome sequence lacks two genes encoding aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductases (AOR). Comparative genome sequence analysis of the four WT strains revealed high average nucleotide identity (ANI) of C. ljungdahlii and C. autoethanogenum (99.3%) and C. coskatii (98.3%). In contrast, C. ljungdahlii WT and C. ragsdalei WT showed an ANI-based similarity of only 95.8%. Additionally, recombinant C. ljungdahlii strains were constructed that harbor an artificial acetone synthesis operon (ASO) consisting of the following genes: adc, ctfA, ctfB, and thlA (encoding acetoacetate decarboxylase, acetoacetyl-CoA:acetate/butyrate:CoA-transferase subunits A and B, and thiolase) under the control of thlA promoter (PthlA) from C. acetobutylicum or native pta-ack promoter (Ppta-ack) from C. ljungdahlii. Respective recombinant strains produced 2-propanol rather than acetone, due to the presence of a NADPH-dependent primary-secondary alcohol dehydrogenase that converts acetone to 2-propanol. Furthermore, the ClosTronTM system was used to construct an adhE1 integration mutant. These results provide extensive insights into genetic features of industrially relevant bacterial biocatalysts and expand the toolbox for metabolic engineering of acetogenic bacteria able to ferment syngas. © 2016 Bengelsdorf, Poehlein, Linder, Erz, Hummel, Hoffmeister, Daniel and Dürre.

AB  - Background: Camelina sativa is an emerging dedicated oilseed crop designed for biofuel and biodiesel applications as well as a source for edible and general-purpose oils. Such valuable oilseed crop is subjected to plant breeding programs and is suggested for large-scale production of better seed and oil quality. To accomplish this objective and to further enhance its oil content, a better understanding of lipid metabolism at the molecular level in this plant is critical. Here, we applied tissue transcriptomics and lipid composition analysis to identify and profile the genes and gene networks associated with triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, and to investigate how those genes are interacting to determine the quantity and quality of Camelina oil during seed development. Results: Our Camelina transcriptome data analysis revealed an approximate of 57,854 and 57,973 genes actively expressing in developing seeds (RPKM ≥ 0.1) at 10-15 (Cs-14) and 16-21 (Cs-21) days after flowering (DAF), respectively. Of these, 7932 genes showed temporal and differential gene expression during the seed development (log2 fold change ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5; P ≤ 0.05). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated and were found to be involved in distinct functional categories and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, performing quantitative real-time PCR for selected candidate genes associated with TAG biosynthesis validated RNA-seq data. Our results showed strong positive correlations between the expression abundance measured using both qPCR and RNA-Seq technologies. Furthermore, the analysis of fatty-acid content and composition revealed major changes throughout seed development, with the amount of oil accumulate rapidly at early mid seed development stages (from 16-28 DAF onwards), while no important changes were observed in the fatty-acid profile between seeds at 28 DAF and mature seeds. Conclusions: This study is highly useful for understanding the regulation of TAG biosynthesis and identifying the rate-limiting steps in TAG pathways at seed development stages, providing a precise selection of candidate genes for developing Camelina varieties with improved seed and oil yields. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Mitigation of climate change via increased plant productivity and soil carbon (C) sequestration during land use change can be a powerful driver of the net greenhouse gas emissions of a sustainable production system. Yet the net climate change mitigation of managed forests is affected by both tradeoffs between C sequestration and non-renewable C emissions and assessment methodology. As a case study, we measured ecosystem stocks to determine the potential C implications of converting pasture to managed eucalyptus forest and compared them with the eucalyptus production system's non-renewable C emissions. The forest border was chosen as the system boundary and operations spanned from forest establishment activities to harvested wood placed at the forest perimeter. Eucalyptus biomass C was 57.2 ± 4.2 Mg C ha− 1 and soil C stock (to ∼1 m depth) was approximately an order of magnitude greater. By the prevalent method for bulk density-based determination of C stock, conversion of pasture to eucalyptus forest significantly increased soil C stock by 17.5 ± 8.0%. However, no significant change was detected by the equivalent soil mass method, a less prevalent but more accurate approach to detecting differences in soil C stock due to land use or management changes. A 7-year eucalyptus production cycle generated 1.0 Mg C ha− 1 in non-renewable emissions, which was far exceeded by the tree biomass C. Thus, even without significant soil C sequestration, this system provided a substantial climate change mitigation service by offsetting non-renewable energy use and C emissions associated with wood production, and providing opportunities for biofuel and bioenergy products to displace fossil fuel products. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Debate has surrounded corn-based ethanol since its introduction as a biofuel. This debate centers on whether corn-based ethanol plays a positive or negative role with regard to energy consumption, hunger and malnutrition, environmental degradation, and economic impacts. This study aims to improve the understanding of the changes in the amount of land in the United States devoted to corn production for corn-based ethanol. Through geographical analysis using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, this research explores (1) the change, from 2007 to 2012, in total number of acres harvested in each county of the United States; (2) the change, from 2007 to 2012, in total number of corn acres harvested in each county of the United States; and (3) significant relationships among total acres harvested and total corn acres harvested (2007–2012) by states in the United States. This analysis of corn production can aid in a further understanding of the land allocation increases in U.S. counties and states due to rising corn-based ethanol, livestock, and human population demands. The analysis provides potential awareness to the stressors corn production has on U.S. lands and the cultivation of other crops within county and state-level regions. © 2016, © 2016 Applied Geography Conferences.

AB  - Reduction of the energy use and emissions associated with the provision of transport services is one of the most challenging areas of energy policy. This arises both from the pervasive nature of transport use in modern society and its dependence on the most limited of fossil fuels. Advances in renewable energy utilization offer an avenue by which this may be addressed, including the possibility of achieving fully sustainable transport energy supply. The article considers what potential exists for sustainable road transport energy in New Zealand. That country already has high renewable energy utilization, but also a high per-capita transport demand and limited domestic hydrocarbon resources. Three main routes for renewable fuel supplies are examined, with the conclusion that two (the production of biofuels from forest products, and the amplification of electricity supply from renewable energy sources for use in electric vehicles) offer technically feasible pathways toward a fully sustainable transport energy system. Cost and confidence in investment remain the principal barriers to this development. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We report a scalable method for recovery of cellular lipids and subsequent conversion to products. When in situ transesterification was performed at high solid loadings (&gt;20%(w/w)) by reacting microalgal biomass in acidified methanol (containing 5%(v/v) H2SO4), the released FAMEs were produced at sufficiently high concentrations such that their solubility limit in the reaction medium was exceeded. As a result, the FAMEs spontaneously formed a separate phase lighter than methanol that could be directly recovered without solvent extraction. Further, FAME production rates were easily predicted, even in concentrated biomass slurries, by models derived from fundamental reaction kinetics. Our results also suggest that un-reacted methanol and catalyst, when recovered, could be reused in subsequent reactions. Thus, this "one-pot" process represents a viable method for production of biodiesel from algal biomass since this approach (1) eliminates costs associated with co-solvent (e.g., hexane) use, recovery and storage, (2) is easily scalable by virtue of the reaction not being constrained by mass transport limitations, and (3) facilitates processing of concentrated biomass slurries that would reduce reactor volumes and minimize reactor and handling costs. © 2016 Z.

AB  - Even though hydropyrolysis of biomass has been studied for many years, it was characterized by long residence times and low heating rates. On the other hand, fast hydropyrolysis, the rapid decomposition of an organic material under a hydrogen atmosphere, has been primarily reported only over the last five years. There is growing interest in the topic, and this brief article reviews fast hydropyrolysis of biomass, describing previous findings, current challenges, and research opportunities for the future. The current literature shows that catalytic fast hydropyrolysis produces primarily aromatic hydrocarbons, but alkanes and naphthenes can also be produced under appropriate conditions if a secondary unit is added for hydrotreating (ex-situ upgrading). Compared to catalytic fast pyrolysis, the higher yields of hydrocarbons and much slower catalyst deactivation due to coking promising. Yields in the range of 80-95 gal/t can be obtained, and the process economics is equivalent to those of other biofuel processes, such as fast pyrolysis followed by hydrotreating/hydrocracking. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need for cleaner sources of energy has stirred research into utilising alternate fuel sources with favourable emission and sustainability such as biodiesel. However, there are technical constraints that hinder the widespread use of some of the low cost raw materials such as pork fatty wastes. Currently available technology permits the use of lipolytic microorganisms to sustainably produce energy from fat sources; and several microorganisms and their metabolites are being investigated as potential energy sources. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterise the process of Staphylococcus xylosus mediated fermentation of pork fatty waste. We also wanted to explore the possibility of fermentation effecting a modification in the lipid carbon chain to reduce its melting point and thereby act directly on one of the main technical barriers to obtaining biodiesel from this abundant source of lipids. Pork fatty waste was obtained from slaughterhouses in southern Brazil during evisceration of the carcasses and the kidney casing of slaughtered animals was used as feedstock. Fermentation was performed in BHI broth with different concentrations of fatty waste and for different time periods which enabled evaluation of the effect of fermentation time on the melting point of swine fat. The lowest melting point was observed around 46 °C, indicating that these chemical and biological reactions can occur under milder conditions, and that such pre-treatment may further facilitate production of biodiesel from fatty animal waste. © 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia

AB  - The development of cellulosic bioethanol and other second-generation (2G) biofuels has gone through various phases during the last few years. The prospect of technological breakthroughs stimulates extensive research on turning cellulose into bioethanol or biodiesel. Agricultural or forestry residues and some plants, referred to as 'lignocellulosic energy crops' or 'second generation (2G) energy crops' can provide feedstock for new types of biofuels. The impact of lignocellulosic energy crops on farmland birds has been relatively well studied. This is surprising since the technology of converting these crops into fuel has so recently been developed. However, we believe that some questions regarding potential bird use of 2G energy crops have still not been answered. In Europe, most research has been carried out in agricultural areas of Western Europe. However, Central & Eastern Europe host the highest densities of farmland birds and, in general, the highest biodiversity. There is huge potential for 2G energy cropping due to large areas of mainly marginal land. We have outlined possible discrepancies between the results obtained from W. Europe and potential relationships between birds and 2G energy crops in Central Europe. © 2016 Jan M. Kaczmarek et al., published by De Gruyter Open.

AB  - Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are key enzymes in the depolymerization of plant-derived cellulose, a process central to the global carbon cycle and the conversion of plant biomass to fuels and chemicals. A limited number of GH families hydrolyze crystalline cellulose, often by a processive mechanism along the cellulose chain. During cultivation of thermophilic cellulolytic microbial communities, substantial differences were observed in the crystalline cellulose saccharification activities of supernatants recovered from divergent lineages. Comparative community proteomics identified a set of cellulases from a population closely related to actinobacterium Thermobispora bispora that were highly abundant in the most active consortium. Among the cellulases from T. bispora, the abundance of a GH family 12 (GH12) protein correlated most closely with the changes in crystalline cellulose hydrolysis activity. This result was surprising since GH12 proteins have been predominantly characterized as enzymes active on soluble polysaccharide substrates. Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of the suite of T. bispora hydrolytic cellulases confirmed that the GH12 protein possessed the highest activity on multiple crystalline cellulose substrates and demonstrated that it hydrolyzes cellulose chains by a predominantly random mechanism. This work suggests that the role of GH12 proteins in crystalline cellulose hydrolysis by cellulolytic microbes should be reconsidered. IMPORTANCE Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth, and its enzymatic hydrolysis is a key reaction in the global carbon cycle and the conversion of plant biomass to biofuels. The glycoside hydrolases that depolymerize crystalline cellulose have been primarily characterized from isolates. In this study, we demonstrate that adapting microbial consortia from compost to grow on crystalline cellulose generated communities whose soluble enzymes exhibit differential abilities to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose. Comparative proteomics of these communities identified a protein of glycoside hydrolase family 12 (GH12), a family of proteins previously observed to primarily hydrolyze soluble substrates, as a candidate that accounted for some of the differences in hydrolytic activities. Heterologous expression confirmed that the GH12 protein identified by proteomics was active on crystalline cellulose and hydrolyzed cellulose by a random mechanism, in contrast to most cellulases that act on the crystalline polymer in a processive mechanism. © 2016 Hiras et al.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerdardii Vitman) are potential bioenergy feedstocks. Perennial grasses managed as bioenergy feedstock require nitrogenous inputs, which can cause N2O emission and, thereby, alter their effectiveness to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Few studies have measured N2O emission from perennial grasses managed as feedstock. The objectives of this study were to compare N2O flux and soil organic C (SOC) storage between (i) grasses with legume companion crops or with nitrogenous fertilizer, (ii) two grass harvest times (autumn and spring), and (iii) perennial systems and corn (Zea maize L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (C-S) rotation, all without tillage. Nitrous oxide flux was measured from May 2009 to May 2012, and SOC was measured in 2000, 2006, and 2011. Big bluestem-clover (Dalea) and switchgrass-clover treatments had dramatically reduced annual N2O emissions and yield-scaled emissions compared with the respective grasses with urea fertilizer. Cumulative N2O emission was 14 to 40% greater in the big bluestem-spring and switchgrass-spring treatments compared with respective autumn-harvested treatments. The average cumulative emission in fertilized big bluestem and switchgrass treatments (18.5 kg N2O-N ha-1) exceeded that of the C-S rotation (12.7 kg N2O-N ha-1). The emission factor (EF) for fertilized grasses averaged 2.5%, corn averaged 1.05%, and C-S rotation averaged 1.9%. The SOC storage by perennial grasses was limited to 0 to 5 cm and thus may not be adequate to offset N2O emission. Nitrogen management refinement is recommended for herbaceous perennials to optimize biomass production and minimize N2O emission. © Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Increased biofuel production has prompted concerns about the environmental tradeoffs of biofuels compared to petroleum-based fuels. Biofuel production in general, and feedstock production in particular, is under increased scrutiny. Water footprinting (measuring direct and indirect water use) has been proposed as one measure to evaluate water use in the context of concerns about depleting rural water supplies through activities such as irrigation for large-scale agriculture. Water footprinting literature has often been limited in one or more key aspects: complete assessment across multiple water stocks (e.g., vadose zone, surface, and ground water stocks), geographical resolution of data, consistent representation of many feedstocks, and flexibility to perform scenario analysis. We developed a model called BioSpatial H2O using a system dynamics modeling and database framework. BioSpatial H2O could be used to consistently evaluate the complete water footprints of multiple biomass feedstocks at high geospatial resolutions. BioSpatial H2O has the flexibility to perform simultaneous scenario analysis of current and potential future crops under alternative yield and climate conditions. In this proof-of-concept paper, we modeled corn grain (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max) under current conditions as illustrative results. BioSpatial H2O links to a unique database that houses annual spatially explicit climate, soil, and plant physiological data. Parameters from the database are used as inputs to our system dynamics model for estimating annual crop water requirements using daily time steps. Based on our review of the literature, estimated green water footprints are comparable to other modeled results, suggesting that BioSpatial H2O is computationally sound for future scenario analysis. Our modeling framework builds on previous water use analyses to provide a platform for scenario-based assessment. BioSpatial H2Os system dynamics is a flexible and user-friendly interface for on-demand, spatially explicit, water use scenario analysis for many US agricultural crops. Built-in controls permit users to quickly make modifications to the model assumptions, such as those affecting yield, and to see the implications of those results in real time. BioSpatial H2Os dynamic capabilities and adjustable climate data allow for analyses of water use and management scenarios to inform current and potential future bioenergy policies. The model could also be adapted for scenario analysis of alternative climatic conditions and comparison of multiple crops. The results of such an analysis would help identify risks associated with water use competition among feedstocks in certain regions. Results could also inform research and development efforts that seek to reduce water-related risks of biofuel pathways. Copyright © 2016 Soil and Water Conservation Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The substitution of fossil by renewable energy sources is a major strategy in reducing CO2 emission and mitigating climate change. In the transport sector, which is still mainly dependent on liquid fuels, the production of second generation ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstock is a promising strategy to substitute fossil fuels. The main prerequisites on designated crops for increased biomass production are high biomass yield and optimized saccharification for subsequent use in fermentation processes. We tried to address these traits by the overexpression of a sucrose-phosphate synthase gene (SoSPS) from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. The resulting transgenic B. distachyon lines not only revealed increased plant height at early growth stages but also higher biomass yield from fully senesced plants, which was increased up to 52 % compared to wild-type. Additionally, we determined higher sucrose content in senesced leaf biomass from the transgenic lines, which correlated with improved biomass saccharification after conventional thermo-chemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Combining increased biomass production and saccharification efficiency in the generated B. distachyon SoSPS overexpression lines, we obtained a maximum of 74 % increase in glucose release per plant compared to wild-type. Therefore, we consider SoSPS overexpression as a promising approach in molecular breeding of energy crops for optimizing yields of biomass and its utilization in second generation biofuel production. © 2015, Society for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology.

AB  - The controversial debate on the impacts of rising biofuel production on food commodity markets is of great policy relevance in Brazil. This paper contributes to the discussion by applying panel data regression models with fixed effects using OLS. Our dataset comprises annual production/harvested area data for sugar, ethanol and five other staple commodities ranging from 1981 to 2009 for 24 Brazilian states. Our results indicate that rising ethanol production exerts statistically significant positive impacts on sugarcane; negative impacts on rice, beans and soybeans acreage but no statistically significant effect on the areas for corn and manioc. The negative impacts on commodities’ acreage have implications for the associated prices. Ceteris paribus, rising ethanol production puts some upward pressure on the prices for rice, beans and soybeans. However, the economic implication of these direct land use effects is attenuated due to the moderate scale of any effect. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Glomus spp.) on some physiological and biochemical characteristics of bioenergy grass Saccharum arundinaceum subjected to drought stress was studied. The symbiotic association of Glomus spp. was established with S. arundinaceum, a potential bioenergy grass as evident from the increase in percentage of root infection and distribution frequency of vesicles when compared with non-arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. AMF-treated plants exhibited an enhanced accumulation of osmolytes such as sugars and proline and also increased protein content under drought. AMF association significantly increased the accumulation of non-enzymatic antioxidants like phenols, ascorbate and glutathione as well as enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD (superoxide dismutase), APX (ascorbate peroxidase) and GPX (guaiacol peroxidase) resulting in reduced lipid peroxidation in S. arundinaceum. AMF symbiosis also ameliorated the drought-induced reduction of total chlorophyll content and activities of photosystem I and II. The maximum quantum efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm) and potential photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fo) were higher in AMF plants as compared to non-AMF plants under drought stress. These results indicate that AMF association alleviate drought stress in S. arundinaceum by the accumulation of osmolytes and non-enzymatic antioxidants and enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes, and hence, the photosynthetic efficiency is improved resulting in increased biomass production. AMF association with energy grasses also improves the acclimatization of S. arundinaceum for growing in marginal lands of drought-affected soils. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is considered a model herbaceous energy crop for the USA, for its adaptation to marginal land, low rainfall and nutrient-deficient soils; however, its low biomass yield is one of several constraints, and this might be rectified by modulating plant growth regulator levels. In this study, we have determined whether the expression of the Zea mays gibberellin 20-oxidase (ZmGA20ox) cDNA in switchgrass will improve biomass production. The ZmGA20ox gene was placed under the control of constitutive CaMV35S promoter with a strong TMV omega enhancer, and introduced into switchgrass via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgene integration and expression levels of ZmGA20ox in T0 plants were analysed using Southern blot and qRT-PCR. Under glasshouse conditions, selected transgenic plants exhibited longer leaves, internodes and tillers, which resulted in twofold increased biomass. These phenotypic alterations correlated with the levels of transgene expression and the particular gibberellin content. Expression of ZmGA20ox also affected the expression of genes coding for key enzymes in lignin biosynthesis. Our results suggest that the employment of ectopic ZmGA20ox and selection for natural variants with high level expression of endogenous GA20ox are appropriate approaches to increase biomass production of switchgrass and other monocot biofuel crops. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This paper provides spatial estimates of potentially available biomass for bioenergy in Australia in 2010, 2030 and 2050 (under clearly stated assumptions) for the following biomass sources: crop stubble, native grasses, pulpwood and residues (created either during forest harvesting or wood processing) from plantations and native forests, bagasse, organic municipal solid waste and new short-rotation tree crops. For each biomass type, we estimated annual potential availability at the finest scale possible with readily accessible data, and then aggregated to make estimates for each of 60 Statistical Divisions (administrative areas) across Australia. The potentially available lignocellulosic biomass is estimated at approximately 80 Mt per year, with the major contributors of crop stubble (27.7 Mt per year), grasses (19.7 Mt per year) and forest plantations (10.9 Mt per year). Over the next 20–40 years, total potentially available biomass could increase to 100–115 Mt per year, with new plantings of short-rotation trees being the major source of the increase (14.7 Mt per year by 2030 and 29.3 Mt per year by 2050). We exclude oilseeds, algae and ‘regrowth’, that is woody vegetation naturally regenerating on previously cleared land, which may be important in several regions of Australia (Australian Forestry 77, 2014, 1; Global Change Biology Bioenergy 7, 2015, 497). We briefly discuss some of the challenges to providing a reliable and sustainable supply of the large amounts of biomass required to build a bioenergy industry of significant scale. More detailed regional analyses, including of the costs of delivered biomass, logistics and economics of harvest, transport and storage, competing markets for biomass and a full assessment of the sustainability of production are needed to underpin investment in specific conversion facilities (e.g. Opportunities for forest bioenergy: An assessment of the environmental and economic opportunities and constraints associated with bioenergy production from biomass resources in two prospective regions of Australia, 2011a). © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The overwhelming interest in the use of microalgae to handle associated nutrient surge from anaerobic digestion technologies for the treatment of wastewater, is driven by the need for efficient nutrient recovery, greenhouse gas mitigation, wastewater treatment and biomass reuse. Here, the feasibility of growth and ammonium nitrogen removal rate of semi-continuous mixed microalgae culture in paddle wheel-driven raceway pond and helical tubular closed photobioreactor (Biocoil) for treating sand-filtered, undiluted anaerobic digestion piggery effluent (ADPE) was compared under outdoor climatic conditions between June and September 2015 austral winter season. Two Biocoils, (airlift and submersible centrifugal pump driven) were tested. Despite several attempts in using airlift-driven Biocoil (e.g. modification of the sparger design), no net microalgae growth was observed due to intense foaming and loss of culture. Initial ammonium nitrogen concentration in the Biocoil and pond was 893.03 ± 17.0 mg NH4+-N L-1. Overall, similar average ammonium nitrogen removal rate in Biocoil (24.6 ± 7.18 mg NH4+-N L-1 day-1) and raceway pond (25.9 ± 8.6 mg NH4+-N L-1 day-1) was achieved. The average volumetric biomass productivity of microalgae grown in the Biocoil (25.03 ± 0.24 mg AFDW L-1 day-1) was 2.1 times higher than in raceway pond. While no significant differences were detected between the cultivation systems, the overall carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents of the consortium averaged 29.17 ± 3.22, 32.79 ± 3.26 and 23.29 ± 2.15% AFDW respectively, revealing its suitability as animal feed or potential biofuel feedstock. The consortium could be maintained in semi-continuous culture for more than three months without changes in the algal composition. Results indicated that microalgae consortium is suitable for simultaneous nutrient removal and biomass production from piggery effluent. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Microbial growth on hydrocarbons is common in nature and used in bioremediation of contaminated sites, whereas in fuel storage tanks this phenomenon can affect the stability of the fuel and the tank. The impact of microbial growth and produced metabolites on materials, which are used in the construction of storage tanks, were analyzed. In contrast to metal tank components, polymeric materials did not affect or were influenced by microorganisms. Zinc was highly corroded by microbial growth, most likely due to the formation of organic acids that were produced during microbial growth on hydrocarbons. A contaminated water phase in a storage tank of a heating system was simulated with a self-constructed pump test bench. Microbial growth began in the water phase of the storage tank and microbes were distributed throughout the tank system, through water-in-oil microemulsions. No microbial growth was observed in oil that was previously contaminated, indicating that essential nutrients had been depleted. The identification and removal of these essential nutrients from fuels could minimize or prevent microbial contamination. The results are discussed with regard to developing recommendations for the design and operation of domestic heating oil storage tanks to lower the risk of technical failure due to microbial contamination. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Microalgae can serve as a highly productive biological feedstock for fuels and chemicals. The lipid fraction has been the primary target of research, but numerous assessments have found that valorization of co-products is essential to achieve economic and environmental goals. The relative proportion of co-products depends on the biomolecular composition of algae at the time of harvesting. In the present study, the productivity of lipid, starch, and protein fractions were shown through growth experiments to vary widely with species, feeding regime, and harvesting period. Four algae species were cultivated under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions and analyzed at 3-day intervals. Dynamic growth results were then used for life cycle assessment using the US Department of Energy's GREET model to determine optimal growth scenarios that minimize life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand (CED), while aiming for an energy return on investment (EROI) greater than unity. Per kg of biodiesel produced, C. sorokiniana in N-replete conditions harvested at 12 days was most favorable for GHG emissions and CED, despite having a lipid content of <20%. N. oculata in N-deplete conditions with a 12-day harvesting period had the lowest life cycle eutrophication impacts, driven by efficient nutrient cycling and valorization of microalgal protein and anaerobic digester residue co-products. Results indicate that growth cycle times that maximize a single fraction do not necessarily result in the most favorable environmental performance on a life cycle basis, underscoring the importance of designing biorefinery systems that -simultaneously optimize for lipid and non-lipid fractions. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Building on an extensive literature review that included peer-reviewed publications, grey literature, national statistics, official reports, and regulations enacted by the Colombian government, this paper identifies opportunities, challenges, and constraints faced by solid biofuels production from energy crops in Colombia. Our findings suggest that the solid biofuels industry currently lacks policy regulations and an adequate research framework. The paper notes the industry's market potential and addresses its dependency on a legal framework, political willingness, and technological developments. The legal framework includes land ownership formalization, job regulations, and the definition of environmental and administrative permits. Political willingness relates to governmental policies and financial incentives based on environmental and sustainability criteria, which can make the sector competitive compared to other energy sources at the local and international market scales. The technological aspects include public and private support for research and development programs and a strategic analysis of industry-specific requirements for infrastructure, conversion, and transportation within a life cycle assessment framework. The preliminary land-use analysis suggests the potential availability of land for solid biofuels production in the Caribbean, Andean, Inter-Andean Valley, and Orinoco regions. Furthermore, the results show that solid biofuels production can potentially supply internal demand and play a role in international markets with strategic development and government support. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha was identified as a potential feedstock to satisfy off-grid and on-grid energy solutions. However, the potential has been questioned due to agronomic frustrations, the lack of an organized value chain and heavy criticism on biofuels due to emissions triggered by land use change (LUC). To contribute to the realistic integration of Jatropha in rural development, this article proposes a modeling approach to probe the feasibility of Jatropha-based electrification in rural Africa and the layout of such a value chain.A multi-component modeling setup is presented, featuring a life cycle inventory, spatial modeling and the optimization model, OPTIMASS. In this modeling setup, OPTIMASS is parameterized with data regarding the global warming potential and the potential location of each operation in the value chain including cultivation sites and related LUC emissions. This enables OPTIMASS to spatially design the Jatropha-based on-grid and off-grid electrification value chain (i.e. cultivation, transport and storage, biofuel production and electricity generation) in Southern Mali with minimal GWP to reach 10% substitution of fossil fuels for Jatropha in electricity production for a current and two future electricity demand scenarios.Analysis of the optimization results demonstrates that emissions from transporting the oil are lower than LUC emissions per harvestable seed of other sites. Finally, it can be said that harnessing the entirety of the Jatropha value chain is crucial to make it GWP competitive relative to fossil fuels in which the location of plantations is crucial to attain low LUC-related emissions and viable yields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main challenges associated with a growing production of renewable electricity are intermittency and dispersion. Intermittency generates spikes in production, which need to be curtailed when exceeding consumption. Dispersion means electricity has to be transported over long distances between production and consumption sites. In the Directive 2009/28/EC, the European Commission recommends sustainable and effective measures to prevent curtailments and facilitate transportation of renewable electricity. This article explores the material constraints of storing and transporting surplus renewable electricity by conversion into synthetic methane. Europe is considered for its mix of energy technologies, data availability and multiple energy pathways to 2050. Results show that the requirements for key materials and land remain relatively low, respecting the recommendations of the EU Commission. By 2050, more than 6 million tons of carbon dioxide might be transformed into methane annually within the EU. The efficiency of renewable power methane production is also compared to the natural process of converting solar into chemical energy (i.e. photosynthesis), both capturing and reenergizing carbon dioxide. Overall, the production of renewable methane (including carbon dioxide capture) is more efficient and less material intensive than the production of biofuels derived from photosynthesis and biomass conversion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The sufficient supply of food and energy requires large amounts of fresh water. Mainly required for irrigation, but also processing and cooling purposes, water is one of the essential resources in both sectors. Rising global population numbers and economic development could likely cause an increase in natural resource demand over the coming decades, while at the same time climate change might lead to lower overall water availability. The result could be an increased competition for water resources mainly in water-stressed regions of the world in the future. In this study we explore a set of possible changes in consumption patterns in the agricultural and energy sector that could be primarily motivated by other goals than water conservation measures-for example personal health and climate change mitigation targets, and estimate the indirect effect such trends would have on global water requirements until 2050. Looking at five world regions, we investigated three possible changes regarding future food preferences, and two possible changes in future resource preferences for electricity and transport fuels. We find that while an increase in food supply as a result of higher protein demand would lead to an increase in water demand as well, this trend could be counteracted by other potential dietary shifts such as a reduction in grains and sugars. In the energy sector we find that an increasing water demand can be limited through specific resource and technology choices, while a significant growth of first-generation biofuels would lead to a drastic rise in water demand, potentially exceeding the water requirements for food supply. Looking at the two sectors together, we conclude that an overall increase in water demand for both food and energy is not inevitable and that changes in food and energy preferences could indeed lead to an alleviation of water resource use despite rising population numbers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the feasibility of producing bioethanol from solid digestate after a mechanical fractionation (i.e. centrifugal milling), in order to improve the energy recovery from agricultural wastes and the sustainability of anaerobic digestion plants. A bioethanol yield of 37 g kg-1 TS was evaluated for the solid digestate fraction. Mass and energetic balances were performed and compared between two scenarios: (A) one-stage bioethanol fermentation and (B) two-stage anaerobic digestion-bioethanol fermentation, in order to evaluate the feasibility and the advantages of the two-stage process. Results revealed that, compared to the one-stage process, the dual anaerobic digestion-bioethanol process permitted: (i) to diversify biofuels production; (ii) to provide the thermal energy sufficient for drying digestate (13,351 kWhth day-1), for the subsequent milling step; (iii) to reduce the electric energy requirement for the milling step (from 23,880 to 3580 kWhel day-1); (iv) to produce extra electrical energy of 8483 kWhel day-1; (v) to improve the reduction of waste streams generated (from 13% to 54% of organic matter removal). © 2016.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate how the microbial community structure establishes during the start-up phase of a full-scale farm anaerobic reactor inoculated with stale and cold cattle slurry. The 16S/18S high-throughput amplicon sequencing results showed an increase of the bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic diversity, evenness and richness during the settlement of the mesophilic anaerobic conditions. When a steady performing digestion process was reached, the microbial diversity, evenness and richness decreased, indicating the establishment of a few dominant microbial populations, best adapted to biogas production. Interestingly, among the environmental parameters, the temperature, alkalinity, free-NH3, total solids and O2 content were found to be the main drivers of microbial dynamics. Interactions between eukaryotes, characterized by a high number of unknown organisms, and the bacterial and archaeal communities were also evidenced, suggesting that eukaryotes might play important roles in the anaerobic digestion process. © 2016.

AB  - This study examined the diverse environmental impacts of domestic biogas technology in rural Ethiopia. It employed a cross-sectional survey approach involving a total of 358 sample biogas-user and non-user households. The results of the analyses showed that the substitution of traditional biomass fuels and kerosene with biogas energy enabled the biogas-user households to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on average by about 1.9 t of CO2 equivalents per digester per year. The reduced use of chemical fertilizer also assisted GHG emission reductions. Moreover, the technology helped in reducing depletion of woody biomass through improving efficiency of energy use and energy substitutions. It assisted in improving the fertility of soil via reducing biomass removals as fuel and the direct use of nutrient enriched bio-slurry. Furthermore, the reduced biomass removals contributed to carbon sequestration. To further enhance the diverse environmental benefits of the technology, proper and uninterrupted operation and utilization of the biogas technology should be ensured; skillful and standby biogas technicians should be present at reasonable distances to provide maintenance and aftersales services. An operational platform for joint stakeholders' actions should also be in place to assist in exploiting its full potential, and seeking and realizing the carbon reduction financial incentive for the households. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Palm oil is a promising source of cooking oil and biodiesel. The demand for palm oil has been increasing worldwide. However, concerns exist surrounding the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of palm oil production. Indonesia is a major palm oil producing country. We explored scenarios for palm oil production in Indonesia until 2050, focusing on Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. Our scenarios describe possible trends in crude palm oil production in Indonesia, while considering the demand for cooking oil and biodiesel, the available land for plantations, production capacity (for crude palm oil and fresh fruit bunches) and environmentally restricting conditions. We first assessed past developments in palm oil production. Next, we analysed scenarios for the future. In the past 20 years, 95% of the Indonesian oil palm production area was in Sumatra and Kalimantan and was increasingly cultivated in peatlands. Our scenarios for the future indicate that Indonesia can meet a considerable part of the global and Asian demand for palm oil, while avoiding further cultivation of peatlands and forest. By 2050, 264-447 Mt crude palm oil may be needed for cooking oil and biodiesel worldwide. In Indonesia, the area that is potentially suitable for oil palm is 17 to 26 Mha with a potential production rate of 27-38 t fresh fruit bunches/ha, yielding 130-176 Mt crude palm oil. Thus Indonesia can meet 39-60% of the international demand. In our scenarios this would be produced in Sumatra (21-26%), Kalimantan (12-16%), and Papua (2%). The potential areas include the current oil palm plantation in mineral lands, but exclude the current oil palm plantations in peatlands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of ensiled giant reed, ensiled maize, ensiled olive pomace, wheat bran for combined systems (CS: dark fermentation + anaerobic digestion (AD)) producing hydrogen-rich biogas (biohythane), tested in batch under basic operational conditions (mesophilic temperatures, no pH control). Substrates were also analyzed under a single stage AD batch test, in order to investigate the effects of DF on estimated energy recovery (ER) in combined systems. In CS, maize and wheat bran exhibited the highest hydrogen potential (13.8 and 18.9 NL kgVS-1) and wheat bran the highest methane potential (243.5 NL kgVS-1). In one-stage AD, giant reed, maize and wheat bran showed the highest methane production (239.5, 267.3 and 260.0 NL kgVS-1). Butyrate/acetate ratio properly described the dark fermentation, correlating with hydrogen production (r = 0.92). Wheat bran proved to be a promising residue for CS in terms of hydrogen/methane potential and ER. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Information about location of marginal lands in a watershed is of interest to those who view these areas as potential land for producing biofuel crops. However, representing marginal lands into a distributed model such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a challenge due to a rigid framework used for watershed sub-division. In this study, we developed a Geographic Information System (GIS) based approach for implementing targeted land use i.e. marginal lands into the SWAT model and evaluated the applicability of the approach on a 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watershed scale. Comparative results showed that conventional targeting approach overestimates the benefit of targeting marginal lands for Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) production due to simulation of larger area under marginal land category. Compared to baseline condition, which corresponds to no biofuel crop production on marginal lands, the pollutant losses under new targeting approach with simulation of Alamo switchgrass and giant miscanthus on marginal lands were substantially lower. The new targeting approach advances the science behind landscape representation in the SWAT model - that has potential to be used in future targeting studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Improving nitrogen (N) remobilization from aboveground to underground organs during yearly shoot senescence is an important goal for sustainable production of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) as a biofuel crop. Little is known about the genetic control of senescence and N use efficiency in perennial grasses such as switchgrass, which limits our ability to improve the process. Switchgrass aboveground organs (leaves, stems and inflorescences) and underground organs (crowns and roots) were harvested every month over a 3-yr period. Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genes differentially expressed in various organs during development. Total N content in aboveground organs increased from spring until the end of summer, then decreased concomitant with senescence, while N content in underground organs exhibited an increase roughly matching the decrease in shoot N during fall. Hundreds of senescence-associated genes were identified in leaves and stems. Functional grouping indicated that regulation of transcription and protein degradation play important roles in shoot senescence. Coexpression networks predict important roles for five switchgrass NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) and other TF family members in orchestrating metabolism of carbohydrates, N and lipids, protein modification/degradation, and transport processes during senescence. This study establishes a molecular basis for understanding and enhancing N remobilization and conservation in switchgrass. © 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - International migration flows between Guatemala and North America are now over thirty years old. The maturation of this phenomenon permits us to look beyond the immediate impacts of migrants and their remittances on Guatemalan livelihoods and to view how migration processes affect Guatemala's most valuable natural resource - land. We combine an interdisciplinary approach and data from a longitudinal study (1986-2012) that includes qualitative and quantitative methods to uncover and understand the specific impacts of international migration on land use and land distribution in San Lucas, Ixcán. We show that initial migration-related changes to land are not unidirectional and permanent. For example, after initial forest decline related to investment of cash remittances in cattle and pasture, the community experienced some forest recovery. This recovery can be explained by three processes. First, migrant money allowed some families to break their ties and reliance on the land and engage in non-agricultural occupations. Second, cleared land also reverted to forest because some migrant families failed in the technical and expensive business of raising cattle. Third, some farmers took advantage of national forestry incentives and left all or part of their parcels forested. However, as San Lucas and Ixcán become more integrated into the national economy, other options are open to migrant families. For example, in the last five years, some land owners took advantage of nearby expansion of the biofuel economy and improvement in roads and converted their fields to cultivate African Palm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thousands of eroded-soil hectares in the U.S. Midwest have been planted to Miscanthus × giganteus as an industrial or bioenergy crop in recent years, but few studies on factors affecting crop establishment have been performed on these soils. The objective of this study was to quantify how both rhizome quality and depth of soil from the surface to the first argillic horizon (or depth to claypan (DTC. 11DTC-depth to claypan or argillic horizon.)) affected M. × giganteus establishment. Rhizome quality (i.e., mass, length, diameter, viable buds, score), emergence, growth, and winter survival were measured on rhizomes planted in 2013 at Columbia and 2014 at Centralia, Missouri on clay loam soils with a range of DTC. Rhizome emergence and early tillering slightly increased as DTC increased, but these effects on growth diminished as the season progressed. Rhizome emergence and growth were more influenced by some metrics of rhizome quality; the odds of a rhizome emerging increased by 25 and 40% with each 1 cm and 1 bud increase in rhizome length and active bud count, respectively. Furthermore, late tiller counts, basal circumference, and end-of-season biomass increased as rhizome length and mass increased. Winter survival could not be estimated as well as emergence, but the odds of survival across sites increased by 5% with each 1 cm increase in rhizome length. When DTC was categorized as soil erosion class or landscape position, only the backslope at Centralia caused greater M. × giganteus growth than other positions. These findings demonstrate the resiliency of M. × giganteus for early growth and establishment on even the most degraded parts of the claypan soil landscape and indicate that propagating larger rhizomes will improve establishment. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Short-rotation woody biomass crops (SRWCs) have been proposed as an alternative feedstock for biofuel production in the northeastern US that leads to the conversion of current open land to woody plantations, potentially altering the soil microbial community structures and hence functions. We used pyrosequencing of 16S and 28S rRNA genes in soil to assess bacterial and fungal populations when ‘marginal’ grasslands were converted into willow (Salix spp.) and hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) plantations at two sites with similar soils and climate history in northern Michigan (Escanaba; ES) and Wisconsin (Rhinelander; RH). In only three growing seasons, the conversion significantly altered both the bacterial and fungal communities, which were most influenced by site and then vegetation. The fungal community showed greater change than the bacterial community in response to land conversion at both sites with substantial enrichment of putative pathogenic, ectomycorrhizal, and endophytic fungi associated with poplar and willow. Conversely, the bacterial community structures shifted, but to a lesser degree, with the new communities dissimilar at the two sites and most correlated with soil nutrient status. The bacterial phylum Nitrospirae increased after conversion and was negatively correlated to total soil nitrogen, but positively correlated to soil nitrate, and may be responsible for nitrate accumulation and the increased N2O emissions previously reported following conversion at these sites. The legacy effect of a much longer grassland history and a second dry summer at the ES site may have influenced the grassland (control) microbial community to remain stable while it varied at the RH site. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Cellulosic bioenergy feedstock such as perennial grasses and crop residues are expected to play a significant role in meeting US biofuel production targets. We used an improved version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to forecast impacts on watershed hydrology and water quality by implementing an array of plausible land-use changes associated with commercial bioenergy crop production for two watersheds in the Midwest USA. Watershed-scale impacts were estimated for 13 bioenergy crop production scenarios, including: production of Miscanthus × giganteus and upland Shawnee switchgrass on highly erodible landscape positions, agricultural marginal land areas and pastures, removal of corn stover and combinations of these options. Water quality, measured as erosion and sediment loading, was forecasted to improve compared to baseline when perennial grasses were used for bioenergy production, but not with stover removal scenarios. Erosion reduction with perennial energy crop production scenarios ranged between 0.2% and 59%. Stream flow at the watershed outlet was reduced between 0 and 8% across these bioenergy crop production scenarios compared to baseline across the study watersheds. Results indicate that bioenergy production scenarios that incorporate perennial grasses reduced the nonpoint source pollutant load at the watershed outlet compared to the baseline conditions (0–20% for nitrate-nitrogen and 3–56% for mineral phosphorus); however, the reduction rates were specific to site characteristics and management practices. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigates the dynamic linkages between biofuels production and sustainable indicators in the panel of 17 developed and developing countries, over the period of 2000–2012. The study emphasized the role of biofuels production in the sustainable development of the region. For this purpose, the study utilized four main sustainable indicators including carbon dioxide emissions, energy intensity, renewable energy generation, and total population that have a significant impact on the biofuels production. The study used dynamic heterogeneous panel econometric technique – Generalized Method of Moments and found that carbon dioxide emissions increase along with the increase in biofuels production. Therefore, the caution should be applied when burning the biofuels during the production process. In addition, renewable electricity generation also increases the biofuels production in the region. The results of robust least square regression confirmed that all of the sustainable indicators have a significant association with the biofuels production, as total primary energy consumption increases the biofuels production, while total population significantly decreases the biofuels production in the region. The results derived to the conclusion that for sustainable development in the region, the policymakers should have to formulate carbon free policies that coupled with the renewable energy sources for emphasizing the life cycle of bioenergy during the production process. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) of two dedicated energy crops: perennial grass Miscanthus x Giganteus (Miscanthus) and short rotation coppice (SRC)-willow. The amount of SOC sequestered in the soil is a function of site-specific factors including soil texture, management practices, initial SOC levels and climate; for these reasons, both losses and gains in SOC were observed in previous Miscanthus and SRC-willow studies. The ECOSSE model was developed to simulate soil C dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions in mineral and organic soils. The performance of ECOSSE has already been tested at site level to simulate the impacts of land-use change to short rotation forestry (SRF) on SOC. However, it has not been extensively evaluated under other bioenergy plantations, such as Miscanthus and SRC-willow. Twenty-nine locations in the United Kingdom, comprising 19 paired transitions to SRC-willow and 20 paired transitions to Miscanthus, were selected to evaluate the performance of ECOSSE in predicting SOC and SOC change from conventional systems (arable and grassland) to these selected bioenergy crops. The results of the present work revealed a strong correlation between modelled and measured SOC and SOC change after transition to Miscanthus and SRC-willow plantations, at two soil depths (0–30 and 0–100 cm), as well as the absence of significant bias in the model. Moreover, model error was within (i.e. not significantly larger than) the measurement error. The high degrees of association and coincidence with measured SOC under Miscanthus and SRC-willow plantations in the United Kingdom, provide confidence in using this process-based model for quantitatively predicting the impacts of future land use on SOC, at site level as well as at national level. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The production of perennial cellulosic feedstocks for bioenergy presents the potential to diversify regional economies and the national energy supply, while also serving as climate ‘regulators’ due to a number of biogeochemical and biogeophysical differences relative to row crops. Numerous observational and model-based approaches have investigated biogeochemical trade-offs, such as increased carbon sequestration and increased water use, associated with growing cellulosic feedstocks. A less understood aspect is the biogeophysical changes associated with the difference in albedo (α), which could alter the local energy balance and cause local to regional cooling several times larger than that associated with offsetting carbon. Here, we established paired fields of Miscanthus × giganteus (miscanthus) and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), two of the leading perennial cellulosic feedstock candidates, and traditional annual row crops in the highly productive ‘Corn-belt’. Our results show that miscanthus did and switchgrass did not have an overall higher α than current row crops, but a strong seasonal pattern existed. Both perennials had consistently higher growing season α than row crops and winter α did not differ. The lack of observed differences in winter α, however, masked an interaction between snow cover and species differences, with the perennial species, compared with the row crops, having a higher α when snow was absent and a much lower α when snow was present. Overall, these changes resulted in an average net reduction in annual absorbed energy of about 5 W m−2 for switchgrass and about 8 W m−2 for miscanthus relative to annual crops. Therefore, the conversion from annual row to perennial crops alters the radiative balance of the surface via changes in α and could lead to regional cooling. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Biorefining agro-industrial biomass residues for bioenergy production represents an opportunity for both sustainable energy supply and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation. Yet, is bioenergy the most sustainable use for these residues? To assess the importance of the alternative use of these residues, a consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) of 32 energy-focused biorefinery scenarios was performed based on eight selected agro-industrial residues and four conversion pathways (two involving bioethanol and two biogas). To specifically address indirect land-use changes (iLUC) induced by the competing feed/food sector, a deterministic iLUC model, addressing global impacts, was developed. A dedicated biochemical model was developed to establish detailed mass, energy, and substance balances for each biomass conversion pathway, as input to the LCA. The results demonstrated that, even for residual biomass, environmental savings from fossil fuel displacement can be completely outbalanced by iLUC, depending on the feed value of the biomass residue. This was the case of industrial residues (e.g. whey and beet molasses) in most of the scenarios assessed. Overall, the GHGs from iLUC impacts were quantified to 4.1 t CO2-eq.ha−1 demanded yr−1 corresponding to 1.2–1.4 t CO2-eq. t−1 dry biomass diverted from feed to energy market. Only, bioenergy from straw and wild grass was shown to perform better than the alternative use, as no competition with the feed sector was involved. Biogas for heat and power production was the best performing pathway, in a short-term context. Focusing on transport fuels, bioethanol was generally preferable to biomethane considering conventional biogas upgrading technologies. Based on the results, agro-industrial residues cannot be considered burden-free simply because they are a residual biomass and careful accounting of alternative utilization is a prerequisite to assess the sustainability of a given use. In this endeavor, the iLUC factors and biochemical model proposed herein can be used as templates and directly applied to any bioenergy consequential study involving demand for arable land. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Biomass production on low-grade land is needed to meet future energy demands and minimize resource conflicts. This, however, requires improvements in plant water-use efficiency (WUE) that are beyond conventional C3 and C4 dedicated bioenergy crops. Here we present the first global-scale geographic information system (GIS)-based productivity model of two highly water-efficient crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) candidates: Agave tequilana and Opuntia ficus-indica. Features of these plants that translate to WUE advantages over C3 and C4 bioenergy crops include nocturnal stomatal opening, rapid rectifier-like root hydraulic conductivity responses to fluctuating soil water potential and the capacity to buffer against periods of drought. Yield simulations for the year 2070 were performed under the four representative concentration pathway (RCPs) scenarios presented in the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report. Simulations on low-grade land suggest that O. ficus-indica alone has the capacity to meet ‘extreme’ bioenergy demand scenarios (&gt;600 EJ yr−1) and is highly resilient to climate change (−1%). Agave tequilana is moderately impacted (−11%). These results are significant because bioenergy demand scenarios &gt;600 EJ yr−1 could be met without significantly increasing conflicts with food production and contributing to deforestation. Both CAM candidates outperformed the C4 bioenergy crop, Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass) in arid zones in the latitudinal range 30°S–30°N. © 2015 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Summary Alcohols extensively used in internal combustion engines are important renewable and sustainable energy resources from environmental and economical perspectives. Besides, bio production of alcohols decreases consumption of fossil-based fuels. Although there are many studies with regards to the use of lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol in internal combustion engines, there are a limited number of investigations with higher alcohols. Higher alcohols such as propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol are part of the next generation of biofuels, given they provide better fuel properties than lower alcohols. Biodiesel-higher alcohol blends can be used in diesel engines without any engine modification but need to be tested under various engine conditions with long periods in order to evaluate their impacts on engine performance and environmental pollutants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of using propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol in waste oil methyl ester (B100) on engine performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine running at different loads (0, 3, 6, and 9 kW) with a fixed engine speed (1800 rpm). Test fuel blends were prepared by adding propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol (10 vol.%) into waste oil methyl ester to achieve blends of B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10, respectively. According to engine performance and exhaust emissions results, the addition of propanol, n-butanol, and 1-pentanol to B100 had the effect of increasing brake specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperatures. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) decreased for B90Pr10 and B90nB10, while B90Pn10 showed a slight increase in BTE as compared with B100. When compared with B100, B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10 decreased carbon monoxide emissions at lower loads while it increased slightly at 9 kW load. The decrement in oxides of nitrogen emission was observed at whole loads for B90Pr10, B90nB10, and B90Pn10 compared with B100. When considering all loads, B90Pn10 presented the best mean hydrocarbon emission with a reduction of 45.41%. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ZmMYB31 and ZmMYB42 are R2R3-MYB transcription factors implicated in the regulation of phenylpropanoid genes in maize. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the regulatory function of MYB31 and MYB42 is conserved in other monocots, specifically in sorghum and rice. We demonstrate that syntelogs of MYB31 and MYB42 do bind to phenylpropanoid genes that function in all stages of the pathway and in different tissues along the developmental gradient of seedling leaves. We found that caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT1) is a common target of MYB31 and MYB42 in the mature leaf tissues of maize, sorghum and rice, as evidenced by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In contrast, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL2), ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H), and caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE), were targeted by MYB31 or MYB42, but in a more species-specific fashion. Our results revealed MYB31 and MYB42 participation in auto- and cross-regulation in all three species. Apart from a limited conservation of regulatory modules, MYB31 and MYB42 syntelogs appear to have undergone subfunctionalization following gene duplication and divergence of maize, sorghum, and rice. Elucidating the different regulatory roles of these syntelogs in the context of positive transcriptional activators may help guide attempts to alter the flux of intermediates towards lignin production in biofuel grasses.

AB  - Brazil is currently the world's largest sugar producer and exporter, as well as the world's largest producer and consumer of sugarcane ethanol as a transportation fuel. The growth of this market originates from a combination of government policies and technological change, in both the sugarcane ethanol processing sector and the manufacture of flex-fuel vehicles. In recent years however, ethanol production has been questioned due to its possible impact on food prices. The present paper aims to explore the impact of Brazilian ethanol prices on sugar and gasoline prices. The relationships between a times series of these prices are investigated using a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), supported by Granger Causality tests. In addition, Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVD) are computed in order to investigate the dynamic interrelationships within these series. Our results suggest that ethanol prices are affected by both food and fuel prices, but that there is no strong evidence that changes in ethanol prices have an impact on food prices.

AB  - Producing biogas via anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for meeting European and regional goals on energy production from renewable sources. It offers interesting opportunities for the agricultural sector, allowing waste and by-products to be converted into bioenergy and bio-based materials. A consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) was conducted to examine the consequences of the installation of a farm-scale biogas plant, taking account of assumptions about processes displaced by biogas plant co-products (power, heat and digestate) and the uses of the biogas plant feedstock prior to plant installation.Inventory data were collected on an existing farm-scale biogas plant. The plant inputs are maize cultivated for energy, solid cattle manure and various by-products from surrounding agro-food industries. Based on hypotheses about displaced electricity production (oil or gas) and the initial uses of the plant feedstock (animal feed, compost or incineration), six scenarios were analyzed and compared. Digested feedstock previously used in animal feed was replaced with other feed ingredients in equivalent feed diets, designed to take account of various nutritional parameters for bovine feeding. The displaced production of mineral fertilizers and field emissions due to the use of digestate as organic fertilizer was balanced against the avoided use of manure and compost.For all of the envisaged scenarios, the installation of the biogas plant led to reduced impacts on water depletion and aquatic ecotoxicity (thanks mainly to the displaced mineral fertilizer production). However, with the additional animal feed ingredients required to replace digested feedstock in the bovine diets, extra agricultural land was needed in all scenarios. Field emissions from the digestate used as organic fertilizer also had a significant impact on acidification and eutrophication.The choice of displaced marginal technologies has a huge influence on the results, as have the assumptions about the previous uses of the biogas plant inputs. The main finding emerging from this study was that the biogas plant should not use feedstock that is intended for animal feed because their replacement in animal diets involves additional impacts mostly in terms of extra agricultural land. cLCA appears to be a useful instrument for giving decision-makers information on the consequences of introducing new multifunctional systems such as farm-scale biogas plants, provided that the study uses specific local data and identifies displaced reference systems on a case-by-case basis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biorefineries serve to efficiently utilize biomass and their by-products. Algal biorefineries are designed to generate bioproducts for commercial use. Due to the high carbohydrate content of algal biomass, biorefinery to generate biofuels, such as bioethanol, is of great interest. Carrageenan is a predominant polysaccharide hydrocolloid found in red macroalgae and is widely used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. In this study, we report the biorefinery of carrageenan derived from processing of experimental strains of the red macroalgae Kappaphycus alvarezii. Specifically, the chemical composition and enzymatic hydrolysis of the residue produced from carrageenan extraction were evaluated to determine the conditions for efficient generation of carbohydrate bioproducts. Results: The productivity and growth rates of K. alvarezii strains were assessed along with the chemical composition (total carbohydrates, ash, sulfate groups, proteins, insoluble aromatics, galacturonic acid, and lipids) of each strain. Two strains, brown and red, were selected based on their high growth rates and productivity and were treated with 6 % KOH for extraction of carrageenan. The yields of biomass from treatment with 6 % KOH solution of the brown and red strains were 89.3 and 89.5 %, respectively. The yields of carrageenan and its residue were 63.5 and 23 %, respectively, for the brown strain and 60 and 27.8 %, respectively, for the red strain. The residues from the brown and red strains were assessed to detect any potential bioproducts. The galactan, ash, protein, insoluble aromatics, and sulfate groups of the residue were reduced to comparable extents for the two strains. However, KOH treatment did not reduce the content of glucan in the residue from either strain. Glucose was produced by enzymatic hydrolysis for 72 h using both strains. The glucan conversion was 100 % for both strains, and the concentrations of glucose from the brown and red strains were 13.7 and 11.5 g L-1, respectively. The present results highlight the efficiency of generating a key bioproduct from carrageenan residue. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for glucose production using carrageenan residue. Thus, the biorefinery of K. alvarezii can be exploited not only to produce carrageenan, but also to generate glucose for future use in biofuel production. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important sugar and biofuel crop with high polyploid and complex genomes. The Saccharum complex, comprised of Saccharum genus and a few related genera, are important genetic resources for sugarcane breeding. A large amount of natural variation exists within the Saccharum complex. Though understanding their allelic variation has been challenging, it is critical to dissect allelic structure and to identify the alleles controlling important traits in sugarcane. To characterize natural variations in Saccharum complex, a target enrichment sequencing approach was used to assay 12 representative germplasm accessions. In total, 55,946 highly efficient probes were designed based on the sorghum genome and sugarcane unigene set targeting a total of 6 Mb of the sugarcane genome. A pipeline specifically tailored for polyploid sequence variants and genotype calling was established. BWA- mem and sorghum genome approved to be an acceptable aligner and reference for sugarcane target enrichment sequence analysis, respectively. Genetic variations including 1,166,066 non-redundant SNPs, 150,421 InDels, 919 gene copy number variations, and 1,257 gene presence/absence variations were detected. SNPs from three different callers (Samtools, Freebayes, and GATK) were compared and the validation rates were nearly 90%. Based on the SNP loci of each accession and their ploidy levels, 999,258 single dosage SNPs were identified and most loci were estimated as largely homozygotes. An average of 34,397 haplotype blocks for each accession was inferred. The highest divergence time among the Saccharum spp. was estimated as 1.2 million years ago (MYA). Saccharum spp. diverged from Erianthus and Sorghum approximately 5 and 6 MYA, respectively. The target enrichment sequencing approach provided an effective way to discover and catalog natural allelic variation in highly polyploid or heterozygous genomes. © 2016 Song, Yang, Resende, Neves, Todd, Zhang, Comstock and Wang.

AB  - Background: The diverse microbial communities in agricultural biogas fermenters are assumed to be well adapted for the anaerobic transformation of plant biomass to methane. Compared to natural systems, biogas reactors are limited in their hydrolytic potential. The reasons for this are not understood. Results: In this paper, we show that a typical industrial biogas reactor fed with maize silage, cow manure, and chicken manure has relatively lower hydrolysis rates compared to feces samples from herbivores. We provide evidence that on average, 2.5 genes encoding cellulolytic GHs/Mbp were identified in the biogas fermenter compared to 3.8 in the elephant feces and 3.2 in the cow rumen data sets. The ratio of genes coding for cellulolytic GH enzymes affiliated with the Firmicutes versus the Bacteroidetes was 2.8:1 in the biogas fermenter compared to 1:1 in the elephant feces and 1.4:1 in the cow rumen sample. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data indicated that highly transcribed cellulases in the biogas fermenter were four times more often affiliated with the Firmicutes compared to the Bacteroidetes, while an equal distribution of these enzymes was observed in the elephant feces sample. Conclusions: Our data indicate that a relatively lower abundance of bacteria affiliated with the phylum of Bacteroidetes and, to some extent, Fibrobacteres is associated with a decreased richness of predicted lignocellulolytic enzymes in biogas fermenters. This difference can be attributed to a partial lack of genes coding for cellulolytic GH enzymes derived from bacteria which are affiliated with the Fibrobacteres and, especially, the Bacteroidetes. The partial deficiency of these genes implies a potentially important limitation in the biogas fermenter with regard to the initial hydrolysis of biomass. Based on these findings, we speculate that increasing the members of Bacteroidetes and Fibrobacteres in biogas fermenters will most likely result in an increased hydrolytic performance. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Idesia polycarpa, is a valuable oilseed-producing tree of the Flacourtiaceae family that has the potential to fulfill edible oil production and is also a possible biofuel feedstock. The fruit is unique in that it contains both saturated and unsaturated lipids present in pericarp and seed, respectively. However, triglyceride synthesis and storage in tissues Edited by: outside of the seeds has been poorly studied in previous researches. To gain insight into the unique properties of I. polycarpa fruit lipid synthesis, biochemical, and transcriptomic approaches were used to compare the lipid accumulation between pericarp and seed of the fruit. Lipid accumulation rates, final lipid content and composition were significantly different between two tissues. Furthermore, we described the annotated transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression analysis generated from the pericarp and seed tissues. The data allowed the identification of distinct candidate genes and reconstruction of lipid pathways, which may explain the differences of oil synthesis between the two tissues. The results may be useful for engineering alternative pathways for lipid production in non-seed or vegetative tissues. © 2016 Li, Gao, Li, Liu, Wang and Lü.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuels are intended to improve future energy and climate security. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is commonly recommended to stimulate yields but can increase losses of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and other forms of reactive N, including nitrate. We measured soil N2O emissions and nitrate leaching along a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) high resolution N-fertilizer gradient for three years post-establishment. Results revealed an exponential increase in annual N2O emissions that each year became stronger (R 2 &gt; 0.9, P &lt; 0.001) and deviated further from the fixed percentage assumed for IPCC Tier 1 emission factors. Concomitantly, switchgrass yields became less responsive each year to N fertilizer. Nitrate leaching (and calculated indirect N2O emissions) also increased exponentially in response to N inputs, but neither methane (CH4) uptake nor soil organic carbon changed detectably. Overall, N fertilizer inputs at rates greater than crop need curtailed the climate benefit of ethanol production almost two-fold, from a maximum mitigation capacity of -5.71 ±0.22 Mg CO2e ha-1 yr-1 in switchgrass fertilized at 56 kg N ha-1 to only -2.97 ±0.18 Mg CO2e ha-1 yr-1 in switchgrass fertilized at 196 kg N ha-1. Minimizing N fertilizer use will be an important strategy for fully realizing the climate benefits of cellulosic biofuel production. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biofuel production from plant cell walls offers the potential for sustainable and economically attractive alternatives to petroleum-based products. Fuels from cellulosic biomass are particularly promising, but would benefit from lower processing costs. Clostridium thermocellum can rapidly solubilize and ferment cellulosic biomass, making it a promising candidate microorganism for consolidated bioprocessing for biofuel production, but increases in product yield and titer are still needed. Results: Here, we started with an engineered C. thermocellum strain where the central metabolic pathways to products other than ethanol had been deleted. After two stages of adaptive evolution, an evolved strain was selected with improved yield and titer. On chemically defined medium with crystalline cellulose as substrate, the evolved strain produced 22.4 ± 1.4 g/L ethanol from 60 g/L cellulose. The resulting yield was about 0.39 gETOH/gGluc eq, which is 75 % of the maximum theoretical yield. Genome resequencing, proteomics, and biochemical analysis were used to examine differences between the original and evolved strains. Conclusions: A two step selection method successfully improved the ethanol yield and the titer. This evolved strain has the highest ethanol yield and titer reported to date for C. thermocellum, and is an important step in the development of this microbe for industrial applications. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The influence of different starter inocula on the microbial communities in biogas batch reactors fed with fresh maize and maize silage as substrates was investigated. Molecular biological analysis by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that each inoculum bore specific microbial communities with varying predominant phylotypes. Both, bacterial and archaeal DGGE profiles displayed three distinct communities that developed depending on the type of inoculum. Although maize and silage are similar substrates, different communities dominated the lactate-rich silage compared to lactate-free fresh maize. Cluster analysis of DGGE gels showed the communities of the same substrates to be stable with their respective inoculum. Bacteria-specific DGGE analysis revealed a rich diversity with Firmicutes being predominant. The other abundant phylotypes were Bacteroidetes and Synergistetes. Archaea-specific DGGE analysis displayed less diverse community structures, identifying members of the Methanosarcinales as the dominant methanogens present in all the three biogas digesters. In general, the source of inoculum played a significant role in shaping microbial communities. Adaptability of the inoculum to the substrates fed also influenced community compositions which further impacted the rates of biogas production. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper discussed the analysis of the survey on sustainability of bioenergy conducted in the Philippines, India and China. It acquired general perceptions of the people by asking them (a) specific questions about their level of familiarity with bioenergy; (b) relationship of their work to bioenergy; and (c) their opinion on contribution of various feedstock on the economy and impact of bioenergy production on food security. In addition to these questions, we estimated preference weights of various feedstock based on the conjoint choices on bioenergy’s contribution to social stability, social welfare and ecological balance. The estimates revealed significant trade-offs not only among these three dimensions of sustainability but also the relative importance of energy security, food security and ecosystem capacity to other economic, social and environmental objectives. The types of first generation feedstock that are currently used for biofuel production in the respective countries and those that offer alternative household use are perceived as important to the economy and preferred bioenergy feedstock. Based on the results of the study, the preferred role of bioenergy for sustainable development reflects the social and economic concerns in the respective Asian countries, e.g., energy security in China, food security in India, and ecosystem degradation in the Philippines. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The semi-field research on using second-generation biofuel crop Miscanthus x giganteus for restoration of former military site in Kamenetz-Podilsky, Ukraine was carried out during two vegetation seasons. Despite high metal pollution of soil, in particular, by Fe, Mn, Ti, and Zr, no growth inhibition was observed. The concentrations followed pattern soil > roots > stems > leaves. Accumulation of particular metals in roots was different: Fe, Mn and Ti were accumulated rather palpably after the first vegetation season and less tangible after the second one. Cu, Pb and Zn were less accumulative in both vegetation seasons, and for As and Pb the accumulative concentrations were very small. Accumulations in the aboveground parts of the plant in comparison to roots were significantly lower in case of Fe, Ti, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr and even statistically comparable to zero in case of As, Pb and Zr. Calculated translocation ratio of metals in the plant's parts preferably indicated lack of metals' hyper accumulation. Generally, no correlations were observed between concentrations of metals in the soil and in the upper plant's parts. The research confirmed the ability of Miscanthus x giganteus to grow on the military soils predominantly contaminated by metals. © by Josef Trögl 2016.

AB  - The present study assessed the potential for biochemical conversion of energy stored in agricultural waste and residue in Iran. The current status of agricultural residue as a source of bioenergy globally and in Iran was investigated. The total number of publications in this field from 2000 to 2014 was about 4294. Iran ranked 21st with approximately 54 published studies. A total of 87 projects have been devised globally to produce second-generation biofuel through biochemical pathways. There are currently no second-generation biorefineries in Iran and agricultural residue has no significant application. The present study determined the amount and types of sustainable agricultural residue and oil-rich crops and their provincial distribution. Wheat, barley, rice, corn, potatoes, alfalfa, sugarcane, sugar beets, apples, grapes, dates, cotton, soybeans, rapeseed, sesame seeds, olives, sunflowers, safflowers, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts have the greatest potential as agronomic and horticultural crops to produce bioenergy in Iran. A total of 11.33 million tonnes (Mt) of agricultural biomass could be collected for production of bioethanol (3.84 gigaliters (Gl)), biobutanol (1.07 Gl), biogas (3.15 billion cubic meters (BCM)), and biohydrogen (0.90 BCM). Additionally, about 0.35 Gl of biodiesel could be obtained using only 35% of total Iranian oilseed. The potential production capacity of conventional biofuel blends in Iran, environmental and socio-economic impacts including well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the social cost of carbon dioxide reduction are discussed. The cost of emissions could decrease up to 55.83% by utilizing E85 instead of gasoline. The possible application of gaseous biofuel in Iran to produce valuable chemicals and provide required energy for crop cultivation is also studied. The energy recovered from biogas produced by wheat residue could provide energy input for 115.62 and 393.12 thousand hectares of irrigated and rain-fed wheat cultivation in Iran, respectively. The nitrogen requirement for 33.6% of the total wheat cultivation area could be supplied by the ammonia acquired from biohydrogen. A discussion of the logistics of collection and transportation of the biomass and sensitivity analysis are carried out to evaluate the effect of field cover factor, crop yield, and well-to-wheel GHG emission on collectable residue, biofuel production, and GHG emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are widely regarded as the most promising source of green and sustainable fuel for the future. Compared to biofuels from terrestrial crops, the benefits of microalgal biofuels include high lipid content, rapid growth rate, high productivity per unit land area, and the ability to utilize wastewater for growth. In this study, five indigenous microalgae from Taiwan were selected to determine their potential for lipid production, namely Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-01, Tai-03 and Pin-01, as well as Scenedesmus sp. ESP-05 and ESP-07. Tai-03 proved to be the best strain, achieving an oil content and oil productivity of 28.6% and 124.1mg/L/d, respectively. This was attained by inoculating 0.12g/L Tai-03 into BG-11 medium with 25% initial nitrate concentration and LED light intensity of 200μmol/m2/s. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) obtained from the Tai-03 strain consisted mainly of palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, making this microalga a suitable feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. © 2016 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Renewable energy technologies (wind turbines, solar cells, biofuels, etc.) are often referred to as 'clean' or 'green' energy sources, while jobs linked to the field of environmental protection and energy efficiency are referred to as 'green' jobs. The energy efficiency of clean technologies, which is likely to reduce and/or eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, is acknowledged. However, the potential contribution of green technologies and associated practices to ill health and environmental pollution resulting from consumption of energy and raw materials, generation of waste, and the negative impacts related to some life cycle phases of these technologies are discussed. Similarly, a point is made that the green jobs theme is mistakenly oversold because the employment opportunities generated by transitioning to green technologies are not necessarily safe and healthy jobs. Emphasis is put on identifying the hazards associated with these green designs, assessing the risks to the environment and worker health and safety, and either eliminating the hazards or minimizing the risks as essential elements to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green technologies. The perception that it is not always economically possible to consider all risk factors associated with renewable energy technologies at the beginning without hampering their implementation, especially in the poor developing countries, is dismissed. Instead, poor countries are encouraged to start implementing environmentally sound practices while transitioning to green technologies in line with their technological development and overall economic growth. © 2016 by De Gruyter.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuel production is expected to increase in the US, and the targeted establishment of biofuel agriculture in marginal lands would reduce competition between biofuels and food crops. While poorly drained, seasonally saturated lowland landscape positions are marginal for production of row crops and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), it is unclear whether species-diverse tallgrass prairie yield would suffer similarly in saturated lowlands. Prairie yields typically increase as graminoids become more dominant, but it is uncertain whether this trend is due to greater aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) or higher harvest efficiency in graminoids compared to forbs. Belowground biomass, a factor that is important to ecosystem service provisioning, is reduced when switchgrass is grown in saturated lowlands, but it is not known whether the same is true in species-diverse prairie. Our objectives were to assess the effect of topography on yields and live belowground biomass in row crops and prairie, and to determine the mechanisms by which relative graminoid abundance influences tallgrass prairie yield. We measured yield, harvest efficiency, and live belowground biomass in upland and lowland landscape positions within maize silage (Zea mays L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and restored tallgrass prairie. Maize and winter wheat yields were reduced by more than 60% in poorly drained lowlands relative to well-drained uplands, but diverse prairie yields were equivalent in both topographic settings. Prairie yields increased by approximately 45% as the relative abundance of graminoids increased from 5% to 95%. However, this trend was due to higher harvest efficiency of graminoids rather than greater ANPP compared to forbs. In both row crops and prairie, live belowground biomass was similar between upland and lowland locations, indicating consistent biomass nutrient sequestration potential and soil organic matter inputs between topographic positions. While poorly drained, lowland landscape positions are marginal lands for row crops, they appear prime for the cultivation of species-diverse tallgrass prairie for cellulosic biofuel.

AB  - With the aim to utilize deoiled rice bran, an agro-industrial waste, as a feedstock for the co-production of multiple carbohydrases, a fungal strain was isolated which could utilize DORB to co-produce a consortium of cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinase and amylases and was named as Aspergillus niger P-19 after molecular identification. Further, optimization for the co-production of all the enzymes was carried out by one factor at a time approach. Time profile studies of the production of enzymes revealed that 5th day of incubation was best suited for the extraction of enzymes. An initial solid to moisture ratio of 1:1.5 and an inoculum size of 5 × 107 spores gds−1 were found to be optimum for maximum productivities. Enzyme yields were significantly improved with the exogenous supplementation of carbon source, nitrogen source, surfactants and lignocellulosic inducers. This is the first report of its kind where DORB has been utilized for the co-production and co-optimization of eight different enzymes which can have a potential application in biofuel industry as the enzyme preparation could effectively hydrolyze steam pre-treated DORB releasing a total reducing sugars of 356.17 ± 9.58 mg gds−1. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Dedicated energy crops and crop residues will meet herbaceous feedstock demands for the new bioeconomy in the Central and Eastern USA. Perennial warm-season grasses and corn stover are well-suited to the eastern half of the USA and provide opportunities for expanding agricultural operations in the region. A suite of warm-season grasses and associated management practices have been developed by researchers from the Agricultural Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and collaborators associated with USDA Regional Biomass Research Centers. Second generation biofuel feedstocks provide an opportunity to increase the production of transportation fuels from recently fixed plant carbon rather than from fossil fuels. Although there is no “one-size-fits-all” bioenergy feedstock, crop residues like corn (Zea mays L.) stover are the most readily available bioenergy feedstocks. However, on marginally productive cropland, perennial grasses provide a feedstock supply while enhancing ecosystem services. Twenty-five years of research has demonstrated that perennial grasses like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) are profitable and environmentally sustainable on marginally productive cropland in the western Corn Belt and Southeastern USA. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Green algae and cyanobacteria are primary producers with profound impact on food web functioning. Both represent key carbon sources and sinks in the aquatic environment, helping modulate the dissolved organic matter balance and representing a potential biofuel source. Underlying the impact of algae and cyanobacteria on an ecosystem level is their molecular composition. Herein, intact 13C-labelled whole cell suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris and Synechocystis were studied using a variety of 1D and 2D 1H/13C solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic experiments. Solution-state NMR spectroscopy of whole cell suspensions is particularly relevant as it identifies species that are mobile (dissolved or dynamic gels), ‘aquatically available’ and directly contribute to the aquatic carbon pool upon lysis, death or become a readily available food source on consumption. In this study, a wide range of metabolites and structural components were identified within the whole cell suspensions. In addition, significant differences in the lipid/triacylglyceride (TAG) content of green algae and cyanobacteria were confirmed. Mobile species in algae are quite different from those in abundance in ‘classic’ dissolved organic matter (DOM) indicating that if algae are major contributors to DOM, considerable selective preservation of minor components (e.g. sterols) or biotransformation would have to occur. Identifying the metabolites and dissolved components within algal cells by NMR permits future studies of carbon transfer between species and through the food chain, whilst providing a foundation to better understand the role of algae in the formation of DOM and the sequestration/transformation of carbon in aquatic environments. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Sorghum is the fifth most important cereal worldwide and is a major source of agricultural residues in tropical regions. Bioconversion of whole sorghum crop residues comprising stalks, leaves, peduncles and panicles to ethanol has great potential for improving ethanol yield per sorghum crop cultivated, and for sustainable biofuel production. Effective pretreatment of sorghum lignocellulosic biomass is central to the efficiency of subsequent fermentation to ethanol. Previous studies have focused on the bioconversion of sorghum stalks and/or leaves only to bioethanol, but the current study is the first report dealing with whole crop residues. We specifically focused on the impact of Nigerian sorghum cultivation location and cultivar type on the potential ethanol yield from whole sorghum crop residues. Efficient bioconversion of whole sorghum residues to ethanol provides a sustainable route for utilization of crop residues thereby providing a non-food feedstock for industrial-scale bioethanol production. © 2016 The Institute of Brewing & Distilling.

AB  - Marginal-quality water, such as recycled wastewater (RWW), is now commonly used for irrigation in regions with limited freshwater resources. However, the practice can pose a threat to soil conservation due to the high soluble salts content present in such water resources. Long-term sustainability of use therefore requires a sound understanding of the soil salinity distribution and appropriate selection of both crop and irrigation system. Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has been proposed as an ideal candidate for biofuel production in arid and semi-arid regions under RWW irrigation, particularly on account of its high salt tolerance. The present study evaluates the evolution and distribution of soil salt and boron (B) as a potential constraint on the sustainability of a "JCL-RWW" farming system on the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands-Spain) during five years of cultivation under surface drip irrigation (SDI) and sub-surface drip irrigation (SSDI). The results indicate that, under high evaporative demand conditions, SSDI does not appear to offer any advantage over SDI in terms of soil salt distribution. The results indicate that irrigation with RWW has increased boron concentrations by a factor of 7 (soil Typic Torrifluvents; TT) and 5 (soil Typic Haplocambids; TH), respectively, in relation to the control soils. Irrigation with RWW has also led to a rise in soil salinity reached values of 59 and 81 dS m -1 for soil TT and TH, respectively. For soil TT and TH SAR, reached values of 56 and 80 (meq L-1)0.5, respectively as a result of irrigation with RWW. Although salinity does not seem to be a factor limiting crop production, irrigation with RWW can accelerate natural soil salinization processes in regions where desertification is of particular concern. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We advance a conceptual framework to put the debate about food versus fuel in the European Union into perspective. We show that many of the problems identified for the food and bioenergy production in the European Union have been priced via several rules and regulations, including water use, fertilizer and pesticide use, and protection of habitats. Therefore, products produced at lower costs (including environmental costs) require fewer resources and can be considered more environmentally friendly. Our results suggest that, from a resource efficiency point of view, the European Union should consider importing more biofuels and biofuel feedstocks from other countries. © 2016 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Siloxane levels in biogas can jeopardize the warranties of the engines used at the biogas to energy facilities. The chemical structure of siloxanes consists of silicon and oxygen atoms, alternating in position, with hydrocarbon groups attached to the silicon side chain. Siloxanes can be either in cyclic (D) or linear (L) configuration and referred with a letter corresponding to their structure followed by a number corresponding to the number of silicon atoms present. When siloxanes are burned, the hydrocarbon fraction is lost and silicon is converted to silicates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of activated carbon gas samplers for quantitative analysis of siloxanes in biogas samples. Biogas samples were collected from a landfill and an anaerobic digester using multiple carbon sorbent tubes assembled in series. One set of samples was collected for 30 min (sampling 6-L gas), and the second set was collected for 60 min (sampling 12-L gas). Carbon particles were thermally desorbed and analyzed by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that biogas sampling using a single tube would not adequately capture octamethyltrisiloxane (L3), hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6). Even with 4 tubes were used in series, D5 was not captured effectively. The single sorbent tube sampling method was adequate only for capturing trimethylsilanol (TMS) and hexamethyldisiloxane (L2). Affinity of siloxanes for activated carbon decreased with increasing molecular weight. Using multiple carbon sorbent tubes in series can be an appropriate method for developing a standard procedure for determining siloxane levels for low molecular weight siloxanes (up to D3). Appropriate quality assurance and quality control procedures should be developed for adequately quantifying the levels of the higher molecular weight siloxanes in biogas with sorbent tubes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are important precursors to reactions producing tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols. The present work uses a detailed technology-linked NMVOC emission database for India, along with a standard mapping method to measured NMVOC profiles, to develop speciated NMVOC emissions, which are aggregated into multiple chemical mechanisms used in chemical transport models. The fully speciated NMVOC emissions inventory with 423 constituent species, was regrouped into model-ready reactivity classes of the RADM2, SAPRC99 and CB-IV chemical mechanisms, and spatially distributed at 25 × 25 km2 resolution, using source-specific spatial proxies. Emissions were considered from four major sectors, i.e. industry, transport, agriculture and residential and from non-combustion activities (use of solvents and paints). It was found that residential cooking with biomass fuels, followed by agricultural residue burning in fields and on-road transport, were largest contributors to the highest reactivity group of NMVOC emissions from India. The emissions were evaluated using WRF-CAMx simulations, using the SAPRC99 photochemical mechanism, over India for contrasting months of April, July and October 2010. Modelled columnar abundance of NO2, CO and O3 agreed well with satellite observations both in magnitude and spatial distribution, in the three contrasting months. Evaluation of monthly and spatial differences between model predictions and observations indicates the need for further refinement of the spatial distribution of NOX emissions, spatio-temporal distribution of agricultural residue burning emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are just one of a host of bioeconomy initiatives which promise to deliver 'inclusive' sustainable development through innovations in bio-based products and services in the global south. Yet to critics, biofuels are seen as prime drivers in a global 'land grab,' rainforest clearance, and the dispossession of farmers. Responding to these concerns, firms in Madagascar have shifted production away from large plantations to small-scale production of the more 'environmentally-friendly' biofuel crop Jatropha curcas. Using a political ecology lens and building upon critical discourse analysis found in cultural political economy, I analyse perspectives of on the material effects and emerging politics surrounding a case of a British-biofuel start-up firm in the northwest Madagascar. I demonstrate that access to biofuel land and labour is dependent upon the inclusion of Malagasy in rural development projects. However, rather than delivering on the promises of biofuels, jatropha has largely emerged as a failed development strategy. This article examines the unaccounted for power that varied and diverse actors derive by promoting the inclusion of individuals and groups to share in benefits, and the material consequences of private sector development in the global south. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The socio-economic crisis of the past few years has led to a progressive and marked decline in the production of coal power plants in Europe. This situation affects the regions where coal is the main traditional energy source. Energy from forests is considered to be a good alternative to coal. The exploitation of forest biomass in these regions could counteract the negative effects posed by the marked decline in traditional coal mining activities. Given the abundance of forest in Asturias, Spaińs main coal mining area, the present work was conducted on the Central Coal Basin (CCB). This study focuses on the territory of the mining areas within the CCB, known as municipalities. The main goal was to evaluate the existing biomass resources in order to assess its sustainable energy potential and its replicability in other coal mining regions in Europe. The multiscale methodology used considers a combination of mass, energy and costs of the biomass available, to estimate the bioenergy obtainable and the assessment of the techno-economic feasibility of solid biofuel production as a source of alternative energy. A detailed evaluation of forest residues was carried out including the economic and environmental constraints. The average collection efficiency was 43.0% resulting in an estimated biomass total cost of 84.10 €/dry t. Finally, the conclusion was made to locate the Biomass Logistic Centre (BLC) in Oviedo due to its favourable technical, economical and geographical characteristics. The proposed BLC would have a production capacity of 17 dry kt/year of pellets, 8 dry kt/year of wood chips and 3 dry kt/year of briquettes, of which 40% (31 dry kt/year) would be collected within a 50 km radius. Such production would avoid 51 kt/year of CO2 emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The policies of the European Union concerning the development of biofuels can be termed a lock-in. Biofuels were initially hailed as a green, sustainability technology. However evidence to the contrary quickly emerged. The European Commission proposed to alter its policies to accommodate for these effects but met with fierce resistance from a considerable number of member states who have an economic interest in these first generation biofuels. In this paper I argue that such a lock-in might have been avoided if an experimental approach to governance had been adopted. Existing approaches such as anticipation and niche management either do not reduce uncertainty sufficiently or fail to explicitly address conflicts between values motivating political and economic support for new technologies. In this paper, I suggest to apply an experimental framework to the development of sustainable biobased technologies. Such an approach builds on insights from adaptive management and transition management in that it has the stimulation of learning effects at its core. I argue that these learning effects should occur on the actual impacts of new technologies, on the institutionalisation of new technologies and most specifically on the norms and values that underly policies supporting new technologies. This approach can be relevant for other emerging technologies. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Non-renewable sources that will end with time are the largest part of world energy consumption, which emphasizes the necessity to develop renewable sources of energy. This necessity has created opportunities for the use of microalgae as a biofuel. The use of microalgae as a feedstock source for bioethanol production requires high yields of both biomass and carbohydrates. With mixotrophic cultures, wastewater can be used to culture algae. The aim of the study was to increase the carbohydrate content in the microalgae Spirulina with the additions of residues from the ultra and nanofiltration of whey protein. The nutrient deficit in the Zarrouk medium diluted to 20% and the addition of 2.5% of both residue types led to high carbohydrate productivity (60 mg L-1 d-1). With these culture conditions, the increase in carbohydrate production in Spirulina indicated that the conditions were appropriate for use with microalgae as a feedstock in the production of bioethanol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hyper thermal (HT) acid hydrolysis of Kappaphycus alvarezii, a red seaweed, was optimized to 12% (w/v) seaweed slurry content, 180 mM H2SO4 at 140 °C for 5 min. The maximum monosaccharide concentration of 38.3 g/L and 66.7% conversion from total fermentable monosaccharides of 57.6 g/L with 120 g dw/L K. alvarezii slurry were obtained from HT acid hydrolysis and enzymatic saccharification. HT acid hydrolysis at a severity factor of 0.78 efficiently converted the carbohydrates of seaweed to monosaccharides and produced a low concentration of inhibitory compounds. The levels of ethanol production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation with non-adapted and adapted Kluyveromyces marxianus to high concentration of galactose were 6.1 g/L with ethanol yield (YEtOH) of 0.19 at 84 h and 16.0 g/L with YEtOH of 0.42 at 72 h, respectively. Development of the HT acid hydrolysis process and adapted yeast could enhance the overall ethanol fermentation yields of K. alvarezii seaweed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has been attracting considerable attention as being a renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic fuel that can contribute to the solution of some energy issues as it presents potential to help mitigate climate change. The Life Cycle Assessment of biodiesel from soybean oil (transesterification double step process) was carried out herein. A pilot plant was considered, designed to produce 72 L of biodiesel in daily continuous flow, throughout a lifetime of 15 years (8000 annual hours). The materials and equipment utilized in the construction of the plant were considered as well as the energy and substances required for the production of biodiesel. Environmental impact assessment method IPCC 2013 GWP 100a was utilized within the SimaPro software to express the final result in kg CO2-equivalent. The results quantified the CO2 emissions associated with biodiesel production throughout the lifetime of the production plant (15 years), resulting in a total value of 1,441,426.05 kg CO2-eq. (96,095.07 kg CO2-eq. per year), which was equivalent to 4.01 kg CO2-eq. per liter of biodiesel produced. Decrease of environmental loads associated with the production of biodiesel could include improvements on the handling of biomass agriculture and on the technology production of biodiesel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Non-renewable energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and land use of two biobased products and biofuel from oil crops is investigated and compared with products from sugar crops. In a bio-based economy chemicals, materials and energy carriers will be produced from biomass. Next to side streams, also vegetable oils and sugars are expected to become important resources for these products. Application of these resources calls for effective resource use, with minimal environmental impacts. In this paper we study a number of available options and their trade-offs. Use of vegetable oils in a chemical and a resin results in a higher reduction of non- renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions than their use as biodiesel. Furthermore, similar savings in environmental impact per unit of land can be reached by products from either oil or sugar crops as transportation fuel, but the sugar crops, applied in chemicals or bioplastics outcompete the oil crops. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reports on mild acid pretreatment options for the conversion of Agave tequilana leaves into composite sugars for ethanol fermentation. The effect of five different pretreatment conditions (time, temperature and acid concentrations) were assessed in terms of cellulose digestibility, hemicellulose solubilisation and lignin content in leaves of 1.25 years old A. tequilana plants from Rockhampton and 2.5 year plants from Kalamia. Dilute acid pretreatment and enzyme saccharification of A. tequilana leaf bagasse significantly improved total glucose recovery. A recovery of 273 mg/g (70% theoretical) was attained when the bagasse was pretreated with 2.0% H2SO4 for 60 min at 121 °C and saccharified with 6% (w/w) CTec 2. Saccharomyces cerevisiae efficiently fermented crude A. tequilana bagasse and juice hydrolysates within 13 h and 7 h respectively, yielding up to 38.6 g/L and 12.4 g/L. This corresponds to glucose to ethanol conversion rate of 68 and 61% for A. tequilana leaf bagasse and juice, respectively. With further developments, including fermentation of C5 sugars and inulinase saccharification of juices (release of fructose), this process could deliver greater yields, reinforcing its potential as a biofuel feedstock. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The EU is adopting policy measures to promote the use of advanced biofuels for transport made from sustainable sources including wastes and residues. As Member States prepare to implement these policy changes, they will need to understand if they have sufficient resource to meet an advanced biofuel target. This study assesses the availability of agricultural residues, forestry residues, and biogenic wastes that could potentially be used for advanced biofuel production in EU Member States at the present and projected to 2020 and 2030. This analysis incorporates specific information on agricultural, forestry, and waste production, management practices, and environmental risks in each Member State in order to model the amounts of residues needed to preserve soil quality and that are utilized in other industries; we exclude these quantities in order to determine the sustainable biomass potential that can be achieved without significant adverse impacts on the environment or biomass markets. We find that most EU Member States are likely to have more than enough sustainably available feedstock to meet the advanced biofuel requirement, and a majority may have more than 10 times the necessary amount. While this study does not assess economic viability of advanced biofuel production, from a resource perspective, the target appears to be achievable in most Member States. Some countries, including Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, and Slovenia, may need to import either feedstock or advanced biofuel from neighboring countries to meet the target. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the occurrence of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in wastewater sludge and their removal during anaerobic digestion. The significant occurrence of 18 TrOCs in primary sludge was observed. These TrOCs occurred predominantly in the solid phase. Some of these TrOCs (e.g. paracetamol, caffeine, ibuprofen and triclosan) were also found at high concentrations (>10,000 ng/L) in the aqueous phase. The overall removal of TrOCs (from both the aqueous and solid phase) by anaerobic digestion was governed by their molecular structure (e.g. the presence/absence of electron withdrawing/donating functional groups). While an increase in sludge retention time (SRT) of the digester resulted in a small but clearly discernible increase in basic biological performance (e.g. volatile solids removal and biogas production), the impact of SRT on TrOC removal was negligible. The lack of SRT influence on TrOC removal suggests that TrOCs were not the main substrate for anaerobic digestion. © 2016 .

AB  - Sustainable bioenergy crops must contribute not only to the production of renewable energy but also to maintaining or restoring water resource and quality. The aim of this study was to quantify water drainage and nitrate leaching under perennial (Miscanthus × giganteus and switchgrass), “semi-perennial” (fescue and alfalfa) and annual (sorghum and triticale) bioenergy crops managed with two N fertilisation rates. Soil water and mineral N contents were measured twice a year during 7 consecutive years. These measurements were used to initialize the STICS model which simulated in turn the amounts of drained water and nitrate leached below 210 cm. Semi-perennial crops produced less drainage than annual crops (64 vs. 133 mm year−1) despite a similar biomass production. Perennial crops resulted in an intermediate drainage (90 mm year−1) but a greater biomass production. The drainage was negatively correlated with biomass production for perennial and annual crops. Perennial crops exhibited much higher water use efficiency than the other species. Nitrate concentration in drained water was low for all crops, most often less than 20 mg NO3 l−1. It was lower for perennials than other crops, except for miscanthus on the first year of measurement. However, the comparison of model outputs with nitrate concentrations measured in subsoil after 5 years indicated that the peak of nitrate produced after miscanthus establishment was subsequently recovered by the crop in deep layers (below 210 cm). Perennial bioenergy crops have potential for restoring water quality but may decrease groundwater recharge in deep soils or dry climates. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - To avoid food versus fuel conflicts in China, the production of bioenergy crops requires the evaluation of marginal lands under arid and semiarid conditions. We conducted field experiments with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in Northern China. The biomass yield and nutrient (N, P, and K) accumulation of sorghum (leaves and stalks) and switchgrass (aboveground portion) were examined in 2012 and 2013. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content at depths of 0–30 cm was quantified at sorghum, switchgrass, and native grassland sites. The aboveground biomass yield of sorghum averaged 13.9 t ha−1 (14.2 and 13.6 t ha−1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively), while the switchgrass yield had a higher variability (14.8 versus 8.1 t ha−1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively) and averaged 11.5 t ha−1. The removals of N, P, and K averaged 56, 10, and 160 kg ha−1, respectively, for sorghum and 41, 11, and 89 kg ha−1, respectively, for switchgrass. To attain maximum biomass yield with minimum nutrient removal and the lowest transportation costs (due to the moisture content), the switchgrass harvest should be delayed until approximately 160 days after regrowth (DAR) in this region, whereas sorghum, which matures earlier, can be harvested as early as 120 days after sowing (DAS). Earlier harvests would increase the flexibility for large-scale ethanol production facilities. The SOC content within the 0–15-cm layer averaged 15.8 and 11.6 g C kg−1 before and 3 years after the establishment of the switchgrass culture, respectively, although the SOC increased with the culture age. In contrast, the SOC content of the 15–30-cm layer did not differ between the adjacent native grassland and the switchgrass planting. Under sorghum, the SOC content was reduced although it did not differ significantly from that of the native grassland at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. We conclude that high biomass yields can be obtained from the two crops under natural rainfall in the arid and semiarid conditions of Northern China. To address nutrient removal and SOC reduction, the leaves of sorghum should be returned to the field to increase the input of organic materials into the soil and reduce nutrient removal, which enhances soil fertility and sustainable production. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study optimized the net present value (NPV) of profit of various switchgrass-based ethanol supply chains and estimated associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in west Tennessee. Three configurations of feedstock harvesting and storage, including a large round baler system, a large square baler system, and a chopping/densification system, were evaluated. A mixed-integer mathematical programming model incorporating high-resolution spatial data was used to determine the optimal locations and capacities of cellulosic ethanol plants and feedstock preprocessing facilities, and associated feedstock-draw areas by maximizing the NPV of profit over 20 years. The optimized outputs were then used to estimate the GHG emissions produced in the biofuel supply chain (BSC) per year. The study shows that BSC configurations have important implications for the economic and environmental performance of the system. The harvest and storage configurations affect the locations of conversion and preprocessing facilities, and associated feedstock-draw areas, hence impacting the cost and emissions of both feedstock and biofuels transportation. The findings suggest the BSC system that harvests feedstock with forage choppers and utilizes stretch-wrap balers to increase feedstock density has the highest NPV of profit. The BSC system that uses large square balers for harvest and storage emits the lowest amount of GHGs per year. In addition, the sensitivity analysis suggests that biofuel price and scaling factor of facility capital was influential to the economics of BSC systems. The breakeven price of biofuel for the three BSCs was around $0.97 L−1. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - With global increases in the production of cellulosic biomass for fuel, or “biofuel,” concerns over potential negative effects of using land for biofuel production have promoted attention to concepts of agricultural landscape design that sustainably balance tradeoffs between food, fuel, fiber, and conservation. The Energy Independence Security Act (EISA) of 2007 mandates an increase in advanced biofuels to 21 billion gallons in 2022. The southeastern region of the USA has been identified as a contributor to meeting half of this goal. We used a GIS-based approach to estimate the production and N-removal potential of three perennial biofeedstocks planted as conservation buffers (field borders associated with riparian buffers, and grassed waterways) on the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA. Land cover, hydrology, elevation, and soils data were used to identify locations within agricultural landscapes that are most susceptible to runoff, erosion, and nutrient loss. We estimated potential annual biomass production from these areas to be: 2.5–3.5 Tg for giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), 2–8.6 Tg for “Merkeron” napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), and 1.9–7.5 Tg for “Alamo” switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). When production strategies were taken into consideration, we estimated total biomass yield of perennial grasses for the Georgia Coastal Plain at 2.2–9.4 Tg year−1. Using published rates of N removal and ethanol conversion, we calculated the amount of potential N removal by these systems as 8100–51,000 Mg year−1 and ethanol fuel production as 778–3296 Ml year−1 (206 to 871 million gal. US). © 2015, Springer.

AB  - Algal biomass is considered as a promising source of alternative fuel energy given its high yield per land area and other potential benefits. Categorized as an advanced generation biofuel feedstock, microalgae are grown in non-conventional ways through different cultivation systems. A preference of a cultivation system may vary depending on a given scenario and its inherent configuration (strength and weakness). Hence, the usage of a specific cultivation system to sustainably produce algal biofuels depends on various factors. Thus, a multi-criteria approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed for evaluating alternative cultivation systems for sustainable production of algal biofuels. The main criteria considered to evaluate the alternatives based on consultation with a panel of expert and from literature are environmental impact, energy consumption, economic viability, social acceptability, and system robustness. Sub-criteria were identified under each main criterion to further qualify the analysis into relevant sub-factors in the sustainable production of algal biofuels. Three cultivations systems were used as an example to demonstrate the developed decision model using qualitative data and quantitative data. Probabilistic scenarios were analyzed using stochastic approach via Monte Carlo simulation. The results of the stochastic-based AHP showed which cultivation system is preferred for conservative (risk-averse) and optimistic (risk-inclined) scenarios. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The Mozambican state is currently working to relocate 7000 people from the interior of the Limpopo National Park (LNP), itself part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP). As the process began in 2003, this stands out as one of the region's most protracted contemporary conservation-related evictions. I draw from this case to shed light on the increasingly complex spatial dynamics of land and green grabs and, more specifically, demonstrate the importance of zooming out from discrete land acquisitions to examine how their resulting displacements are increasingly shaped by spatial processes at and beyond their borders. In doing so, we begin to see that displacement from the LNP is not a simple case of eviction from a discrete protected area. Rather, it has been provoked by the opening of the international border, hence drawing transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) like the GLTP into the purview of land and green grabs. At the same time, competition over space with an adjacent grab - a sugarcane/ethanol plantation - has severely interfered with relocation, drastically prolonging it. The case, more broadly, sheds light on how conservation, agricultural extraction and climate change mitigation - all forms of land acquisitions that incite dislocation - come together to produce novel patterns of environmental displacement, placing profound pressures on rural communities and their abilities to occupy space and access resources, including labour opportunities. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).

AB  - This paper jointly evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions and economic impacts from producing biofuels in Tanzania. Sequentially-linked models capture natural resource constraints; emissions from land use change; economywide growth linkages; and household poverty. Results indicate that there are economic incentives to convert unused lands to sugarcane-ethanol production, but only grasslands (not forests) have a reasonable carbon payback period. There are also strong socioeconomic reasons to involve smallholders in feedstock production in order to reduce rural poverty, especially since our results indicate that biofuels have little effect on food production. Yet smallholders require more land than large-scale plantations and so face more binding natural resource and emissions constraints. Overall, environmental constraints alter the socioeconomically optimal biofuel strategy for Tanzania by limiting potential poverty reduction. Unlike previous studies, our integrated assessment suggests that a mixed farming system with greater emphasis on large-scale plantations is more appropriate for producing sugarcane-ethanol in Tanzania. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are ecologically important organisms and potential platforms for production of biofuels and useful industrial products. Genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria, especially model organisms such as Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC7002, is a key tool for both basic and applied research. Generation of unmarked mutants, whereby chromosomal alterations are introduced into a strain via insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette (a manipulatable fragment of DNA containing one or more genes), followed by subsequent removal of this cassette using a negative selectable marker, is a particularly powerful technique. Unmarked mutants can be repeatedly genetically manipulated, allowing as many alterations to be introduced into a strain as desired. In addition, the absence of genes encoding antibiotic resistance proteins in the mutated strain is desirable, as it avoids the possibility of 'escape' of antibiotic resistant organisms into the environment. However, detailed methods for repeated rounds of genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria are not well described in the scientific literature. Here we provide a comprehensive description of this technique, which we have successfully used to generate mutants with multiple deletions, single point mutations within a gene of interest and insertion of novel gene cassettes. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - This paper discusses the assessment of various biofuel crop production alternatives on the island of Fuerteventura using Jatropha crops. It adopts an integrated approach by carrying out a multi-criteria assessment with the support of participatory techniques and geographical information systems. Sixteen production alternatives were analyzed for growing Jatropha, and the results suggest that the best alternative involves using typical torrifluvent soils irrigated with recycled urban wastewater using surface drip irrigation covering 100% evapotranspiration. It was also determined that a potential area of 2546 ha could be used for cultivation within a radius of 10 km from a wastewater treatment plant. This level of production would supply 27.56% of the biofuel needs of Fuerteventura, thereby contributing to the 2020 target of the European Commission regarding biofuels for land transport.

AB  - The Shea industry is catching major international attention in recent times because of its socioeconomic value, tremendous potential of ensuring food security as well as its wide-ranging industrial applications. The increased demand for the Shea butter product, which has led to the commercialization of various Shea butter extractive plants without appropriate mechanisms of dealing with the massive spent Shea waste generated, has necessitated the current investigation. Instrumental methods were used to study the suitability of recovering spent Shea waste for reuse in the construction sector towards a cleaner industrial production. The X-rays fluorescence analysis of this waste shows K (2.11 wt.%), Al (0.37 wt.%), Ca (0.36 wt.%), Si (0.35 wt.%) and Mg (0.10 wt.%) as key replacement cations at appreciable levels and a good diversity of inorganic fluxes at trace levels. Infrared and ultimate analyses of spent Shea waste revealed a largely organic materials with well-defined organic functional group bands at 3369 cm-1 2924 cm-1, 2856 cm-1, 1741 cm-1, 1616 cm-1, 1452 cm-1, 1369 cm-1, 1033 cm-1, 756 cm-1 and 640 cm-1. Its pore forming ability was demonstrated via the 76 wt.% reduction in weight at 800 °C firing temperature. The broad differential thermal analysis exothermic peak and the estimated higher heating value of 19.55 MJ/kg shows an excellent biofuel waste. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies revealed the varying flower-like polycrystalline microstructures of this waste. The various characterization studies portrayed spent Shea waste as suitable materials for reuse in improving clay brick making economically. Consequently, the implementation of mechanisms for the widespread reusing of spent Shea waste material towards a cleaner production in the Shea industry is highly recommended. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is easy to predict that in the coming years in Europe biodiesel will play an increasingly important role in the transport sector. The European Commission has set at 10% by 2020 the proportion that biofuels should represent in total fuel used in transport and biodiesel is currently the most widely used biofuel in the European Union. The most common way to produce biodiesel is through transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol; glycerol is the main co-product. Although glycerol has many industrial applications, increased production of biodiesel could make complete market placement of this chemical difficult. In this context, increasing interest is paid towards different methods of biodiesel production that provide alternative co-products. This article offers a "cradle to gate" evaluation of potential environmental impacts caused by an innovative process for the production of DMC-BioD, an alternative biofuel to biodiesel which does not involve the production of glycerol. Transesterification of soybean oil with dimethyl carbonate to obtain DMC-BioD has been modelled with the aid of the Chemical Process Simulation software Aspen HYSYS® that produced the material and energy balances and the preliminary sizing of the process units. Results have been also compared with background information from database on the production of conventional biodiesel from soybean oil and of fossil diesel. The study suggests that DMC-BioD can be an interesting route for the production of biofuels from an environmental point of view. Compared to fossil diesel, GHG (Greenhouse gases) emissions can be decreased, although trade-offs are registered in other environmental categories. In any case, future investigation is needed in order to understand and optimize its environmental profile through the entire life cycle and possibly bring its production to a commercial scale. This preliminary analysis of potential environmental impacts provides useful information to continue the testing and scale-up phases and to improve the environmental performances of the process. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The adoption of energy crops may generate significant benefits from reduced foreign energy dependence, improved rural economies, and achieved environmental goals. Nevertheless, important issues arise, as these crops are strongly competed by other, presumably more standard, uses of farmland and their choice will be restrictive, unless profit becomes a powerful motive for farmers. The abolishment of specific policies supporting first generation biofuels gives rise to the question whether the tactic of bioenergy land use change is just to be abandoned by European farmers. The present paper endeavours to evaluate the reduction in income volatility in the case of the rapeseed energy crop, a cultivation extensively used in biofuels in the European Union, employing the concept of entropy. The results provide a vague picture regarding the limitations in rapeseed income volatility among the European member states. Consequently, the issue of income uncertainties as a determinant of bioenergy cropland demand has been left pending. The innovation of the study lies in the use of entropy concept and the Kapetanios and Shin unit root test in the case of income volatility for energy crops in the European context. The estimation of the random components with the assistance of auto-regressive integrated mean average models may provide a tool for confining income uncertainties with the assistance of other policy schemes, including insurances, within the Common Agricultural Policy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent advances in imaging, laboratory, and field spectroscopy (sometimes referred to as hyperspectral remote sensing) provide a unique opportunity to obtain critical information needed for understanding nitrogen (N) management in crop production systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify wavelength regions and phenological timing useful for the prediction of N status from canopy and leaf spectra. Leaf and canopy spectral data were collected using an ASD FieldSpec FR spectroradiometer (350–2500 nm) at monthly intervals during 2011 and 2012. The crops evaluated in the study were switchgrass ‘Alamo’ (Panicum virgatum L.) and high biomass sorghum ‘Blade 5200’ (Sorghum bicolor) grown to evaluate N applications rates on biomass yield and quality. The optimal wavelengths were determined based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the separation of the N treatments using stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA). The results showed similar canopy and leaf-scale reflectance for high biomass sorghum but not for switchgrass. The wavelengths found to be most important for separating the N treatments were 520–560, 650–690 nm (visible region), and 710–730 nm (red-edge region). Triangular greenness index (TGI) was the most useful index for discriminating the N application rates. The best time for differentiating the different N treatments was 4–6 weeks after planting or 2–4 weeks after N fertilization in high biomass sorghum and within 4 weeks after green-up in switchgrass. In general, the results indicate that spectroscopy is a viable tool that could be used to estimate the biochemical and biophysical characteristics in bioenergy crop production systems. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The development of technologies based on energy renewable sources is increasing worldwide in order to diversify the energy mix and satisfy the rigorous environmental legislation and international agreements to reduce pollutant emission. Considering specific characteristics of biofuels available in Brazil, studies regarding such technologies should be carried out aiming energy mix diversification. Several technologies for power generation from biomass have been presented in the technical literature, and plants with BIGCC (biomass integrated gasification combined cycle) emerge as a major technological innovation. By obtaining a fuel rich in hydrogen from solid biomass gasification, BIGCC presents higher overall process efficiency than direct burning of the solid fuel in conventional boilers. The objective of this paper is to develop a thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium model of a BIGCC configuration for sugarcane bagasse. The model embodies exergetic cost and CO2 emission analyses through the method of CET (carbon exergy tax). An exergetic penalty comparison between the BIGCC technology (with and without CO2 capture and sequestration), a natural gas combined cycle and the traditional steam cycle of sugarcane sector is then presented. It is verified that the BIGCC configuration with CO2 capture and sequestration presents technical and environmental advantages when compared to traditional technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Characteristics of stormwater in industrial areas are evaluated, specifically based on a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant with on-site biomass fuel storage. An evaluation method is developed to combine general methodology applied for stormwater characterisation with the on-site features of the biomass-fired CHP plant. Investigations were carried out through on-site monitoring and laboratory experiments with the defined methodology. Recycled wood chips as biomass fuel currently used in Swedish biomass-fired CHP plants have been used as an example for this study. The impacts of outdoor biomass fuel storage have been analysed for both runoff water quantity and quality. The results indicate that the properties of stored biomass fuels will significantly affect the runoff quantity by its water absorption capability. The overall runoff quality is highly depended on precipitation intensity and the runoff volume from the biomass storage piles, which is influenced by the water retention capacity and leaching ability of biomass fuels. The practical data and information presented in this paper can be used to understand the principal issues and the most important factors for internal control of contamination sources in order to achieve sustainable Energy-Water systems for bioenergy conversion in biomass-fired CHP plants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Among vegetable oils, hazelnut oil (H), because of its high oleic acid content, is an important biofuel resource for use in diesel engines. Microemulsion, which is a viscosity reduction method, is a more practical and less time-consuming method as compared to transesterification, and can be used to blend diesel (D), vegetable oils and higher alcohols such as n-butanol (nB) and 1-pentanol (Pn), which have a promising future as biofuels for diesel engines, which, in return, can increase the biofuel utilization rate in diesel engines. While alcohols are known to have low cetane numbers, it is necessary to keep the cetane number of microemulsion based fuels high enough. Thus, in this work, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) cetane improver was added at 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm concentration to the microemulsions of D (70 vol.%)-H (20 vol.%)-nB (10 vol.%) (DnBH) or Pn (10 vol.%) (DPnH) and the effects of the cetane improver on fuel properties and engine characteristics were investigated in detail. Addition of EHN to DnBH and DPnH microemulsions increased the cetane number by about 13.12% and 12.26%, respectively while it did not have any significant effect on density, kinematic viscosity, cloud point, cold filter plugging point (CFPP) or flash point. The engine tests were performed on a direct-injection, turbocharged diesel engine (TDI) at five engine loads (0%, 30%, 60%, 90% and 100%) at 2200 rpm constant engine speed. As compared to DnBH and DPnH microemulsions, the addition of EHN cetane improver notably decreased brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and increased carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, but had the opposite effects on hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for both microemulsions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As oleaginous microorganisms represent an upcoming novel feedstock for the biotechnological production of lipids or lipid-derived biofuels, we searched for novel, lipid-producing strains in desert soil. This was encouraged by the hypothesis that neutral lipids represent an ideal storage compound, especially under arid conditions, as several animals are known to outlast long periods in absence of drinking water by metabolizing their body fat. Ten lipid-accumulating bacterial strains, affiliated to the genera Bacillus, Cupriavidus, Nocardia, Rhodococcus and Streptomyces, were isolated from arid desert soil due to their ability to synthesize poly(β-hydroxybutyrate), triacylglycerols or wax esters. Particularly two Streptomyces sp. strains and one Rhodococcus sp. strain accumulate significant amounts of TAG under storage conditions under optimized cultivation conditions. Rhodococcus sp. A27 and Streptomyces sp. G49 synthesized approx. 30% (w/w) fatty acids from fructose or cellobiose, respectively, while Streptomyces isolate G25 reached a cellular fatty acid content of nearly 50% (w/w) when cultivated with cellobiose. The stored triacylglycerols were composed of 30-40% branched fatty acids, such as anteiso-pentadecanoic or iso-hexadecanoic acid. To date, this represents by far the highest lipid content described for streptomycetes. A biotechnological production of such lipids using (hemi)cellulose-derived raw material could be used to obtain sustainable biodiesel with a high proportion of branched-chain fatty acids to improve its cold-flow properties and oxidative stability. © 2016.

AB  - The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 were enacted to reduce the U.S. dependency on foreign oil by increasing the use of biofuels. The increased demand for biofuels from corn and soybeans could result in an increase of nitrogen flux if not managed properly. The objectives of this study are to estimate nitrogen flux from energy crop production and to identify the catchment areas with high nitrogen flux. The results show that biofuel production can result in an increase of nitrogen flux to the northern Gulf of Mexico from 270 to 1742 thousand metric tons. Using all cellulosic (hay) ethanol or biodiesel to meet the 2022 mandate is expected to reduce nitrogen flux; however, it requires approximately 25% more land when compared to other scenarios. Producing ethanol from switchgrass rather than hay results in three-times more nitrogen flux, but requires 43% less land. Using corn ethanol for 2022 mandates is expected to have double the nitrogen flux when compared to the EISA-specified 2022 scenario; however, it will require less land area. Shifting the U.S. energy supply from foreign oil to the Midwest cannot occur without economic and environmental impacts, which could potentially lead to more eutrophication and hypoxia. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a dedicated lignocellulosic feedstock for bioenergy production. The SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN (SBP-box)-LIKE transcription factors (SPLs) change plant architecture and vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition significantly, and as such, they are promising candidates for genetic improvement of switchgrass biomass yield. However, the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of SPL genes have yet to be investigated in herbaceous energy crops. Results: We identified 35 full-length SPL genes in the switchgrass genome. The phylogenetic relationship and expression pattern of PvSPLs provided baseline information for their function characterization. Based on the global overview of PvSPLs, we explored the biological function of miR156-targeted PvSPL1 and PvSPL2, which are closely related members of SPL family in switchgrass. Our results showed that PvSPL1 and PvSPL2 acted redundantly to modulate side tiller initiation, whereas they did not affect phase transition and internode initiation. Consistently, overexpression of the miR156-resistant rPvSPL2 in the miR156-overexpressing transgenic plants greatly reduced tiller initiation, but did not rescue the delayed flowering and increased internode numbers. Furthermore, suppression of PvSPL2 activity in switchgrass increased biomass yield and reduced lignin accumulation, which thereby elevated the total amount of solubilized sugars. Conclusions: Our results indicate that different miR156-targeted PvSPL subfamily genes function predominantly in certain biological processes in switchgrass. We suggest that PvSPL2 and its paralogs can be utilized as the valuable targets in molecular breeding of energy crops for developing novel germplasms with high biofuel production. © 2016 Wu et al.

AB  - Responsible Innovation (RI) is a young field of research that has nevertheless had remarkable successes in dissemination within academic and political circles. However, there is relatively little awareness of its limits, blind spots and situations in which it cannot be used for actual innovation trajectories. Without such awareness, there is a risk that RI may get hollowed out and turned into a tool for ‘greenwashing’. To examine RI’s limits, we present a case study on biofuel innovation in Hassan, South India. This case study demonstrates that there are important barriers that may make it difficult to conduct innovation according to RI values. In particular, we highlight the following factors that emerge from our case study and need more attention in order to be included and adequately theorised in the RI literature: material barriers to innovation, engagement with abandoning or reducing existing practices as a consequence of innovation, power differences and dependencies, (un)clear demarcation of responsibilities, strategic behaviour and, lastly, different, diverging and even contradictory interests. We demonstrate that such factors may obstruct the possibility to innovate in a responsible way, leading us to our core observation that RI should be about innovating responsibly–or not innovating at all. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - ABSTRACT: The fact that fossil-based energy sources will run out requires the efficient use of the existing sources and as well as more effective and widespread use of renewable energy sources. The use of organic waste, which has a significant place among renewable energy resources, gains importance in terms of environment and energy optimization in sustainable development models. One of the renewable energy resources is biogas. In the countries where biogas technology is common, energy is produced by processing all kinds of organic waste in the biogas production facilities. Besides energy production, land, water, and air pollution caused by the waste is reduced to minimum. On the other hand, organic waste from the facilities is used as fertilizer in the vegetable production. In this research, biomass potential, which has an important and different place among renewable energy sources in terms of its existing potential and production technologies, is studied. Animal and vegetable-based waste and the equivalent energy potential of the biogas that can be produced out of these wastes have been identified. In this study, the average amount of dry biomass produced in Turkey in a year and the average heating value of the dry biomass have been calculated. In addition, suggestions have been made for taking advantage of the biomass potential efficiently and extensively. Turkey is rich in biomass and has adequate facilities and environmental conditions in terms of the development of this resource. In order to reduce the dependence of Turkey on foreign energy, transition to energy forestry and energy agriculture, development of obtaining biofuel from them and wastes, and biogas obtained from fertilizers, waste and garbage are required to be given importance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This paper provides an analysis of life-cycle assessment (LCA) of Jatropha biodiesel with a view to outline the environmental quality norms of Jatropha biodiesel. The underlying issue is that biofuels need to mitigate the effects of climate change and provide sustainable energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Thus, there is need for empirical evidence on the sustainability of Jatropha biodiesel in order to inform both biofuels policies and development of options for technical intervention to improve the environmental footprint of Jatropha biodiesel. Ten LCAs of Jatropha biodiesel are analyzed in this paper. The paper considers impact categories, which include energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, land-use impact, acidification, and eutrophication. The general trend emerging from this analysis is that although Jatropha biodiesel has positive energy and GHG balances, there are site-specific variances and numerous opportunities for improvement. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The primary goal of this study was to model the soil emissions during camelina and wheat production in a three-year cycle in the Pacific North West region of the United States considering spatial variations in agro-climatic factors. The second goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of regional agro-climatic variations on the life cycle impact of biofuel production from camelina. DNDC (Denitrification-Decomposition) model was used to estimate the soil emissions in different regions, and openLCA software was used to quantify the environmental impacts of camelina biodiesel production in the State of Oregon. The suitable lands for the cropping system were lands with winter wheat-fallow cropping system and rainfall of 20–40 cm. The model was run for 60 years to reach to the soil organic carbon (SOC) equilibrium point. The results from the cycle with the SOC equilibrium were used to conduct life cycle assessment (LCA). Energy allocation method was selected to allocate LCA results based on the energy content of products and co-products. The results showed that the global warming potential of camelina biodiesel produced under two scenarios was significantly different (P-value < 0.01) such that no-tillage practice had lower GHG emissions compared to conventional tillage system. Uncertainty analysis was carried out using Monte Carlo method, and the results showed that there could be up to 23% variation in soil emissions due to variation in air temperature and SOC. The break-even cost for a three-year crop rotation (winter wheat-fallow-camelina) was estimated to be 1715 $/ha/3y; therefore, locations with income equal or more than the break-even cost and low environmental impacts are suitable for the winter wheat-fallow-camelina rotation system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) is an important multipurpose tree valued for oil. In India, plans are underway to bring substantial area under this crop for meeting the biofuel requirements of the country. A study was conducted to develop allometric relationships in Jatropha to predict various biomass-related components (above ground and below ground) using easily measurable attributes, viz. collar diameter, tree height, number of branches, crown diameter, and crown depth. Further, it was aimed to establish the reliability of these relationships using an independent dataset obtained from varied management situations. Destructive sampling was carried out during the rainy season of 2011, when Jatropha plants were eight years old. Highly significant allometric relationships (F-values significant at 1% level) were obtained while predicting various biomass components (above, below, and total) using easily measurable attributes with R2 values ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. Of all the predictors, collar diameter exhibited a highly significant relationship with total dry biomass per plant (R2 = 0.97). The allometric relationships developed were validated with an independent dataset. The allometric relationships developed would serve as valuable tools for estimating total dry biomass production and carbon sequestration with reasonable accuracy in Jatropha systems, as they are proposed to be taken up in substantial area in the years to come. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The success of long-term sustainable biofuel production on agricultural lands is still questionable. To this end, we investigated the effects of crop prices on the changes of agricultural land use for biofuel canola production in three wheat crop management zones in North Dakota. The effects of canola hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) production on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy demand were investigated along with different allocation methods. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) and Alternative Fuel Transportation Optimization Tool (AFTOT) models were used to simulate the life cycle assessment (LCA) inputs for two key stages of the HEFA pathway: cultivation and transportation. From the EPIC model results, the increase in canola price had a significant impact on predicted farmer decisions to displace food crops with energy crops and particularly on resulting changes in soil carbon (C). The LCA results suggested that to increase soil C sequestration, energy canola should be grown in the place of the fallow whenever possible to guarantee the long-term soil C sustainability of canola HEFA. Other possible ways to mitigate the GHG emissions included using anhydrous ammonia as the nitrogen fertilizer for cultivation and H2 integration (use of HEFA coproducts in H2 production) for HEFA conversion. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energy shortage, energy safety, environment pollution and global warming commonly promote the development of biofuels in China. Maize, wheat and rapeseed should be banned gradually as feedstocks. Cassava and sweet sorghum have better environmental benefits for ethanol production and so do jatropha curcas and pistacia chinensis for biodiesel. Evaluation of potential land for the four feedstocks has already been done and they are prior to other sources. Macro polices promote development of fuel ethanol and biodiesel industries. Economic measures including tax cuts, subsidies and compensation mechanisms and sale channels are given to ethanol companies. Rapid development of fuel methanol industry and limited source of feedstocks become the resistance of ethanol industry. Biodiesel can hardly achieve economic supports due to complex sources of feedstocks, variable compositions and different properties. China treats cellulose biomass and microalgae as the best choice for ethanol and biodiesel productions and they are in the research stage. © 2015

AB  - A key question for food, biofuels, and bioproducts production is how agriculture affects the environment, and social and economic development. In Brazil, a large agricultural producer and among the biologically wealthiest of nations, this question is challenging and opinions often clash. The Brazilian parliament and several stakeholders have recently debated the revision of the Forest Act, the most important legal framework for conservation of natural vegetation on Brazilian private agricultural lands. Past decades have shown improvements in the agricultural sector with respect to productivity and efficiency, along with great reductions in deforestation and growth of environmentally certified production. However, the opposing sides in the debate have ignored this progress and instead continue to entrench their respective combative positions. A structured exchange involving nine experts associated with major producer interests (livestock, crops, planted forest, and charcoal) and environmental NGOs was moderated based on a framework that sorted viewpoints into four categories: (i) common ground - compatible interests considered to be high priority for Brazilian sustainable agricultural development; (ii) serving exclusive nature conservation interest; (iii) serving exclusive agricultural production interest; and (iv) mainly serving the purpose of sustaining dispute. We conclude that the majority of actions and expected future trends reflect achievements and ambitions to balance production and conservation, but much public opinion - and in turn decisions in the parliament and government for agriculture and conservation - is shaped by a perceived conflict between these objectives and a debate that has become, at least to some extent, an end in itself. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Oilseeds are integral to the production of biofuels and diversifying rainfed cropping systems in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW). However, there is evidence to suggest greater potential for wind erosion when growing oilseeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations. Little is known concerning the impact of growing oilseeds on the soil surface characteristics that affect erosion. Soil characteristics were examined during the fallow phase of three crop rotations: (i) winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF), (ii) winter wheat-camelina (Camelina sativa L. Grantz)-summer fallow (WW-C-SF), and (iii) winter wheat-safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)-summer fallow (WW-S-SF) at Lind and Ritzville, WA. Crop residue biomass and soil water content, roughness, surface strength, and aggregate size distribution were measured immediately after sowing winter wheat. Camelina and safflower did not affect soil water content, random roughness, penetration resistance, geometric mean diameter, or the erodible fraction, possibly due to the short duration over which the rotations were monitored in this study. Flat residue biomass and cover, however, tended to be greater in the WW-SF rotation. The Revised Wind Erosion Equation suggested that sediment transport could be from 57 to 212% greater for the WW-C-SF or WW-S-SF than the WW-SF rotation due to differences in crop residue characteristics after sowing wheat. These results indicate that crop residue must be carefully managed to minimize the occurrence and intensity of wind erosion from dryland oilseed cropping systems in the PNW. Specifically, no-till management may be required to manage crop residues during the fallow phase of a wheat-oilseed- fallow rotation to control wind erosion. © 2016 Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison WI 53711 USA.

AB  - The article provides insight into the contemporary international bioenergy debate and scrutinizes how the idea of biofuel production as a win-win-win solution to energy insecurity, climate change, and agricultural stagnation came into being, what discursive forces bind such a conceptualization, and where dislocations arise. Based on critical assumptions of discourse theory developed by Laclau and Mouffe, the analysis explores assessments, reports, policy papers, and other central documents from three influential international organizations—the International Energy Agency, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization—that provide an entry point to the global debate on biofuels. We show that the bioenergy concept occupies specific positions and conveys different meanings within the three overlapping discourses of energy, climate, and agriculture. These three discursive areas are further “sutured” around the notion of biofuel production, where a hegemonic thread of the capitalist market economics, fixated on economic growth and presupposing the necessity of cost-effectiveness, results in internal contradictions and dislocations within the win-win-win conceptualization, emptying bioenergy of any content. © 2015 Union for Radical Political Economics.

AB  - Sewage sludge processing is a key issue in water resource recovery facilities due to the inefficacy of conventional treatments to produce high quality biosolids to be safely used in agriculture. Under this framework, the performances of several enhanced stabilization processes, namely ultrasound-pretreated Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion (US+MAD), thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD), thermal-pretreated TAD (TH+TAD) and ultrasound-pretreated inverse Temperature Phased Anaerobic Digestion (US+iTPAD) have been investigated. Such enhanced processes resulted in higher biogas yields and higher destruction of pathogens with respect to conventional MAD process, thus suggesting their feasibility in full-scale implementation perspectives. A procedure for technical-economic comparison of new sludge processing lines against conventional ones (benchmarking) was developed, based on the definition of technical issues (e.g. reliability, complexity, etc.) which are rated for each situation. Moreover, capital and operating costs were estimated. The enhanced processes analyzed in this work showed some potentially critical items, mainly related to energy balance and reagent consumption.

AB  - Development of a productive advanced biofuels economy will require a suite of lignocellulosic feedstocks, including both agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops. This research utilizes precision conservation and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques to model the integration of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial bioenergy crop, into a corn (Zea mays L.)-producing field in Iowa, United States. The impacts of energy crop integration are quantified in terms of productivity, economics, and environmental performance. Management areas identified using a multi-objective optimization method are modeled using the Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) to calculate biomass availability and impacts to soil health, while the Water Quality Index for Agricultural Lands (WQIag) is used to assess the risk to surface water quality. The results show that subfield management zones optimized to reduce economic losses and maximize environmental performance are capable of improving the field's annual rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) gain by 69%, reducing annual soil erosion by 63%, and increasing sustainable biomass availability by 35%. Environmental improvements are valued at US$158 ha-1 (US$64 ac-1), making the integrated management system an effective financial loss mitigation strategy compared to conventional corn production when feedstock prices are greater than US$107 Mg-1 (US$97 tn-1). The results of this work demonstrate that the production of bioenergy crops integrated with commodity row crops can be a tenable means to improve the overall production of a field, improve the profitability of row crop farming, and preserve or improve water and soil resources.

AB  - Previous research predicted that the biofuel-driven expansion of corn (Zea mays L.) area would increase riverine export of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in the Mississippi River Basin. Accurate information about water quality trends in agricultural watersheds is needed to better inform agricultural policy and to help quantify the effectiveness of field and landscape management practices. This study was designed to (1) characterize possible NO3-N trends within the Raccoon River watershed (RRWS) of central Iowa, and (2) explore links between the relative areas planted to corn and soybean (Glycine max) and water quality. We examined NO3-N concentration and loading data from more than 60 main stem river and tributary locations in the RRWS for the period 1999 to 2014. In addition, we assessed the role of climate, crop rotations, and simplified annual N budgets on NO3-N concentrations and loads to show that expansion of corn area has not increased Raccoon River NO3-N levels. Nitrate-N concentrations have not increased as corn area increased 19% and fertilizer N inputs increased 24% since 1999. We conclude that expansion of corn area at the expense of soybean may be affecting water quality. Better management of soybean in a corn-soybean rotation should reduce NO3-N export from the watershed, and reducing throughput of water in this artificially drained system will improve water quality.

AB  - The magnitude and character of the global resource base of fossil fuels is a key determinant of the evolution of the future global energy system and corresponding fossil fuel carbon emissions. What is less well understood is the potential magnitude of impact of the availability of fossil fuels, due to the interaction with biomass energy, on agriculture, land use, ecosystems and therefore carbon emissions from land-use change. This paper explores these links and implications. We show that if oil resources are limited, then the consequently higher price for liquids induces both the use of coal-to-liquids technology deployment, but also enhanced production of bioenergy crops particularly in a business-as-usual scenario. This in turn implies greater pressure to convert unmanaged ecosystems to produce bioenergy, and higher rates of terrestrial carbon emissions from land use. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Heteroxylans are abundant components of plant cell walls and provide important raw materials for the food, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries. A number of studies in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have suggested that the IRREGULAR XYLEM9 (IRX9), IRX10, and IRX14 proteins, as well as their homologs, are involved in xylan synthesis via a Golgi-localized complex termed the xylan synthase complex (XSC). However, both the biochemical and cell biological research lags the genetic and molecular evidence. In this study, we characterized garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) stem xylan biosynthesis genes (AoIRX9, AoIRX9L, AoIRX10, AoIRX14A, and AoIRX14B) by heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. We reconstituted and partially purified an active XSC and showed that three proteins, AoIRX9, AoIRX10, and AoIRX14A, are necessary for xylan xylosyltranferase activity in planta. To better understand the XSC structure and its composition, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis to show the molecular interactions between these three IRX proteins. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we showed that the DxD motifs of AoIRX10 and AoIRX14A are crucial for the catalytic activity. These data provide, to our knowledge, the first lines of biochemical and cell biological evidence that AoIRX9, AoIRX10, and AoIRX14A are core components of a Golgi-localized XSC, each with distinct roles for effective heteroxylan biosynthesis. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Miscanthus is a perennial C4 grass that has recently become an important bioenergy crop. The efficiency of breeding improved Miscanthus biomass cultivars could be greatly increased by marker-assisted selection. Thus, a high-density genetic map is critical to Miscanthus improvement. In this study, a mapping population of 261 F1 progeny was developed from a cross between two diploid M. sinensis cultivars, 'Strictus' and 'Kaskade'. High-density genetic maps for the two parents were produced with 3044 newly developed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, and 138 previously mapped GoldenGate SNPs. The female parent ('Strictus') map spanned 1599 cM, with 1989 SNPs on 19 linkage groups, and an average intermarker spacing of 0.8 cM. The length of the male parent ('Kaskade') map was 1612 cM, with 1821 SNPs, and an average intermarker spacing of 0.9 cM. The utility of the map was confirmed by locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the zebra-striped trait, which was segregating in this population. Three QTL for zebra-striped presence/absence (zb1, zb2 on LG 7, and zb3 on LG 10) and three for zebra-striped intensity (zbi1, zbi2, zbi3 on LGs 7, 10, 3) were identified. Each allele that caused striping was recessive. Incomplete penetrance was observed for each zb QTL, but penetrance was greatest when two or more zb QTL were homozygous for the causative alleles. Similarly, the intensity of striping was greatest when two or more zbi QTL were homozygous for alleles that conferred the trait. Comparative mapping indicated putative correspondence between zb3 and/or zbi2 on LG 10 to previously sequenced genes conferring zebra stripe in maize and rice. These results demonstrate that the new map is useful for identifying marker-trait associations. The mapped markers will become a valuable community resource, facilitating comparisons among studies and the breeding of Miscanthus. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The environmental benefits of a broad-scale adoption of biofuels are critically contingent on what current land uses will be converted for feedstock expansion and how converted land will be managed. We assessed the consequences of land use and land management for the agroindustrial production of sugarcane to the physical, chemical, and biological properties of freshwater systems. We surveyed 16 environmental variables and algae, tadpoles, predatory invertebrates, and fish in lentic water bodies distributed across a gradient in land-use intensity ranging from seasonal Atlantic Forest and cerrado to pastures to sugarcane plantations in SE Brazil, the most important sugarcane-producing region in the world. The gradient in land-use intensity was not only an axis of native habitat loss but also of ecosystem productivity, as indicated by increased conductivity, turbidity, and phytoplankton biomass. Land use had a clear signal on community and metacommunity organization, with converted land being impoverished in biodiversity relative to native habitats. However, frequency of occurrence, density, biomass, and alpha diversity of tadpoles and their predators were not affected by land use. These results suggest that sugarcane fields function as habitat to a fraction of aquatic biodiversity. Within sugarcane fields, larger wetlands surrounded by buffer strips as required by law appeared comparatively buffered against land management practices and housed a disproportional fraction of animal biomass, likely acting as sources of migrants to other water bodies in the landscape. Conversion of pastures to sugarcane fields, suggested as a strategy to reduce competition for land with food production and biodiversity conservation, does not appear to have strong consequences to lentic freshwater systems, provided that wetlands and surrounding buffer strips are preserved. These observations emphasize the importance of enforcement of legislation regulating land use (i.e. the 'Forest Code') and certification systems verifying compliance and rewarding the voluntary adoption of better land management practices. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Agricultural land use to meet the demands of a growing population, changing diets, lifestyles and biofuel production is a significant driver of biodiversity loss. Globally applicable methods are needed to assess biodiversity impacts hidden in internationally traded food items. We used the countryside species area relationship (SAR) model to estimate the mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles species lost (i.e. species 'committed to extinction') due to agricultural land use within each of the 804 terrestrial ecoregion. These species lost estimates were combined with high spatial resolution global maps of crop yields to calculate species lost per ton for 170 crops in 184 countries. Finally, the impacts per ton were linked with the bilateral trade data of crop products between producing and consuming countries from FAO, to calculate the land use biodiversity impacts embodied in international crop trade and consumption. We found that 83% of total species loss is incurred due to agriculture land use devoted for domestic consumption whereas 17% is due to export production. Exports from Indonesia to USA and China embody highest impacts (20 species lost at the regional level each). In general, industrialized countries with high per capita GDP tend to be major net importers of biodiversity impacts from developing tropical countries. Results show that embodied land area is not a good proxy for embodied biodiversity impacts in trade flows, as crops occupying little global area such as sugarcane, palm oil, rubber and coffee have disproportionately high biodiversity impacts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding potential future influence of environmental, economic, and social drivers on land-use and sustainability is critical for guiding strategic decisions that can help nations adapt to change, anticipate opportunities, and cope with surprises. Using the Land-Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, we undertook a comprehensive, detailed, integrated, and quantitative scenario analysis of land-use and sustainability for Australia's agricultural land from 2013-2050, under interacting global change and domestic policies, and considering key uncertainties. We assessed land use competition between multiple land-uses and assessed the sustainability of economic returns and ecosystem services at high spatial (1.1 km grid cells) and temporal (annual) resolution. We found substantial potential for land-use transition from agriculture to carbon plantings, environmental plantings, and biofuels cropping under certain scenarios, with impacts on the sustainability of economic returns and ecosystem services including food/fibre production, emissions abatement, water resource use, biodiversity services, and energy production. However, the type, magnitude, timing, and location of land-use responses and their impacts were highly dependent on scenario parameter assumptions including global outlook and emissions abatement effort, domestic land-use policy settings, land-use change adoption behaviour, productivity growth, and capacity constraints. With strong global abatement incentives complemented by biodiversity-focussed domestic land-use policy, land-use responses can substantially increase and diversify economic returns to land and produce a much wider range of ecosystem services such as emissions abatement, biodiversity, and energy, without major impacts on agricultural production. However, better governance is needed for managing potentially significant water resource impacts. The results have wide-ranging implications for land-use and sustainability policy and governance at global and domestic scales and can inform strategic thinking and decision-making about land-use and sustainability in Australia. A comprehensive and freely available 26 GB data pack (http://doi.org/10.4225/08/5604A2E8A00CC) provides a unique resource for further research. As similarly nuanced transformational change is also possible elsewhere, our template for comprehensive, integrated, quantitative, and high resolution scenario analysis can support other nations in strategic thinking and decision-making to prepare for an uncertain future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We use a mathematical programming model to examine the impacts of simultaneous implementation of two US biofuel and bioenergy policies on commodity markets and spatial distribution of future cellulosic biorefineries. The key findings based on our numerical simulation are: (1) the number and average annual production capacity of cellulosic biofuel refineries depend on the total renewable fuels mandate; (2) the mix of cellulosic biomass feedstock depends on the assumptions about the production costs of energy crops and the amount of cropland that can be used for energy crops, but regardless of the assumptions crop residues are the primary biomass source to meet the demand for biomass for biofuel production and electricity generation; and (3) the biomass production areas would surround either future cellulosic biorefineries or the existing coal-based power plants to reduce the costs of biomass transportation. These findings have important implications for biorefinery investors and provide valuable policy insights for the selection of Biomass Crop Assistance Program project areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel policy is under near constant review at both the federal and state level. For example, as part of on-going implementation of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), the California Air Resources Board has recently designed and is implementing a new cost containment mechanism as part of the compliance credit market embedded within the LCFS. This mechanism was born out of concerns that there may be a shortage of LCFS credits, which could lead to an unpredictable rise in the credit price. In general, it is important to develop appropriate mathematical tools with which to estimate the impact of policy changes on biofuel markets. Motivated by the need for such analyses, a novel regional market model is developed that quantifies several categories of impacts across different regional markets. These market impacts include policy-specific effects of California's LCFS as well as the federal level Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Several scenarios are developed to highlight issues of long term LCFS feasibility; in particular, this work highlights the role that biodiesel/renewable diesel might need to play in order for the goals of the LCFS to be met. We find that biodiesel blending will need to increase dramatically within a short period of time (i.e., by 2016 all diesel fuel would need to be 20% blends) in order to generate enough LCFS credits. Additionally, this model highlights the indirect market linkages between the LCFS/RFS credit markets; certain biofuels can register under both programs and generate both credits. As a result, if attempts in the US Congressional to fully repeal the RFS are successful, it is possible that the LCFS credit price could increase more than 50%. Symmetrically, it is also true that if the LCFS program were eliminated, certain RFS credit markets would also be impacted, but to a lesser extent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work evaluates the environmental performance of using pulp and paper sludge as feedstock for the production of second generation ethanol. An ethanol plant for converting 5400 tons of dry sludge/year was modelled and evaluated using a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment approach. The sludge is a burden for pulp and paper mills that is mainly disposed in landfilling. The studied system allows for the valorisation of the waste, which due to its high polysaccharide content is a valuable feedstock for bioethanol production. Eleven impact categories were analysed and the results showed that enzymatic hydrolysis and neutralisation of the CaCO3 are the environmental hotspots of the system contributing up to 85% to the overall impacts. Two optimisation scenarios were evaluated: (1) using a reduced HCl amount in the neutralisation stage and (2) co-fermentation of xylose and glucose, for maximal ethanol yield. Both scenarios displayed significant environmental impact improvements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to answer the question if and how biofuels can be produced in Mexico without aggravating water scarcity, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and avoiding indirect land-use changes. We analyzed environmental impacts of six potential maize-bioethanol production systems in Mexico on water resources, land use, and GHG emissions by using a life cycle assessment approach. Three irrigated high-input maize systems and three rain-fed low-yield systems were analyzed. Inventory data was acquired by soil sampling and interviews with farmers. For the water footprint, field water balances were modeled using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) AquaCrop Model. For the carbon footprint, the BioGrace tool was used. Based on the results of status-quo analysis, scenarios with improved agricultural management were defined to identify optimization potential. Additionally, the producible amount of biofuels was estimated on a national level. The analyses showed that improving management in rain-fed agriculture offers the best opportunities for biofuel production without compromising regional water availability and without unwanted indirect effects on food prices and GHG emissions. Around 3.4% of Mexican gas consumption could be produced from maize bioethanol in Mexico without the above mentioned unwanted effects. By optimizing green water use in rain-fed maize production, around 3 billion m3 of non-productive soil evaporation would be put into productive use. This is around 10% of the total water extracted from aquifers in Mexico. From this we conclude that unproductive soil evaporation is an underestimated water resource which should be considered in water management. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings from biofuels dramatically depend upon the source of energy displaced and the effects induced outside the energy sector, for instance land-use changes (LUC). Using consequential life-cycle assessment and including LUC effects, this study provides GHG emission factors (EFs) for bioelectricity, biomethane, and bioethanol produced from twenty-four biomasses (from dedicated crops to residues of different origin) under a fossil and a non-fossil energy system. Accounting for numerous variations in the pathways, a total of 554 GHG EFs were quantified. The results showed that, important GHG savings were obtained with residues and seaweed, both under fossil and non-fossil energy systems. For high-yield perennial crops (e.g. willow and Miscanthus), GHG savings were achieved only under fossil energy systems. Biofuels from annual crops and residues that are today used in the feed sector should be discouraged, as LUC GHG emissions exceeded any GHG savings from displacing conventional energy sources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas referred as a 'wonder plant' with low water requirement, which can be cultivated on wastelands in dry tropical conditions to provide oil seeds for biodiesel without competing for prime cropland. However, results from experiments and case studies in semi-arid tropical locations in India indicated that evapotranspiration (ET) demand for Jatropha ranges between 750 and 1000mm under optimal conditions. Jatropha extracted water from soil layer 150cm below with transpiration requirements of 600-800mm with increasing age. The yield potential of current genotypes is low (2-3ton/ha) for realizing the potential of Jatropha cultivation on wastelands subject to limited availability of nutrients and water. Jatropha curcas is drought tolerant, but contrary to belief, it is not a crop that requires less water: in fact, it requires 750-1000mm water to achieve economic production. However, Jatropha curcas demonstrated good potential for enhancing green water use efficiency without adversely affecting the blue water component, and for promoting crop management options facilitating carbon sequestration and nutrient recycling when grown on degraded lands. Improved cultivars of Jatropha curcas with synchronized flowering to enable mechanical harvesting, along with improved land and water management, are needed for harnessing the potential of Jatropha as a commercially viable biofuel crop. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Using biofuel plants to remove metal pollutants is a sustainable approach for phytoremediation. Ricinus communis L. (castor bean) is a bioenergy plant that grows rapidly and has a high biomass; it has been proven to be a potential phytoaccumulator of several metals. Pot experiments with single element or co-contaminated soils were conducted to investigate Cd, Cu and Zn accumulation and their interaction in R. communis L. After growing for four months in soils with the addition of Cd (at rates of 1,5,10,20, and 40 mg/kg), Cu (at rates of 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg), and Zn (at rates of 100,200,400,600, and 800 mg/kg) alone or combined, the dry biomass and the concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Zn in the leaves, stems and roots of the castor bean plants were measured, and the translocation and bioaccumulation factors were calculated. It was found that all of the R. communis grew well and produced high biomass, showing a high tolerance to Cd, Cu and Zn. Our experimental results implied that R. communis showed a high phytoremediation potential for soils contaminated by Cd or Zn while displayed a low uptake of Cu. The copper concentration in R. communis was only slightly influenced by Cd and Zn additions to the soils. The interaction pattern of Cd and Zn showed an antagonistic behavior under low concentrations of the Cd and Zn combined treatment while showed a synergistic behavior under high concentrations of the Cd and Zn combined treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we assess the impact of abolishing biofuel policies (mandates, tax credits, import and export tariffs) on agricultural price levels and price variability as well as some aspects related to global food security. For the analysis we employ a recursive-dynamic agricultural multi-commodity model within a stochastic framework. Results of the 10-years forward looking scenario indicate that the removal of biofuel policies would have a significant effect on price variability of biofuels, but only a marginal impact on the variability of agricultural commodity prices. Without biofuel policies, global biofuel demand would decrease by 25% for ethanol and 32% for biodiesel. Moreover, prices would only moderately decrease for ethanol feedstock commodities like wheat and coarse grains, while prices for biodiesel feedstock commodities, specifically vegetable oils, would be more affected. Due to competing uses of crop production such as feed and industrial use, abolishing biofuel policies would not necessarily lead to an increase in global food security, as food use increases would remain low for most crops and regions. © 2016 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - About 85% of the ashes produced in Sweden originated from the incineration of municipal solid waste and biofuel. The rest comes from the thermal treatment of recycled wood, peat, charcoal and others. About 68% of all ashes annually produced in Sweden are used for constructions on landfills, mainly slopes, roads and embankments, and only 3% for construction of roads and working surfaces outside the landfills (. SCB, 2013). Since waste bottom ash (BA) often has similar properties to crushed bedrock or gravel, it could be used for road constructions to a larger extent. However, the leaching of e.g. Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn can cause a threat to the surrounding environment if the material is used as it is. Carbonation is a commonly used pre-treatment method, yet it is not always sufficient.As leaching from aged ash is often controlled by adsorption to iron oxides, increasing the number of Fe oxide sorption sites can be a way to control the leaching of several critical elements. The importance of iron oxides as sorption sites for metals is known from both mineralogical studies of bottom ash and from the remediation of contaminated soil, where iron is used as an amendment.In this study, zero valent iron (Fe(0)) was added prior to accelerated carbonation in order to increase the number of adsorption sites for metals and thereby reduce leaching. Batch, column and pHstat leaching tests were performed and the leaching behaviour was evaluated with multivariate data analysis. It showed that leaching changed distinctly after the tested treatments, in particular after the combined treatment.Especially, the leaching of Cr and Cu clearly decreased as a result of accelerated carbonation. The combination of accelerated carbonation with Fe(0) addition reduced the leaching of Cr and Cu even further and reduced also the leaching of Mo, Zn, Pb and Cd compared to untreated BA. Compared with only accelerated carbonation, the Fe(0) addition significantly reduced the leaching of Cr, Cu and Mo. The effects of Fe(0) addition can be related to binding of the studied elements to newly formed iron oxides. The effects of Fe(0) addition were often more distinct at pH values between 7 and 9, which indicates that a single treatment with only Fe addition would be less effective and a combined treatment is recommended. The pHstat results showed that accelerated carbonation in combination with Fe(0)0 addition widens the pH range for low solubility of about one unit for several of the studied elements. This indicates that pre-treating the bottom ash with a combination of accelerated carbonation and Fe(0) addition makes the leaching properties of the ash less sensitive to pH changes that may occur during reuse. All in all, the addition of Fe0 in combination with carbonation could be an effective pre-treatment method for decreasing the mobility of potentially harmful components in bottom ash. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The potential of biochar for mitigating climatic impacts of coastal saline bioenergy production is not well established. A full accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) affected by biochar amendment combined with or without nitrogen (N) fertilizer application was examined in an annual coastal reclaimed Jerusalem artichoke bioenergy cropping system. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and net primary production (NPP) using static chamber method. Biochar amendment raised the seasonal RH but without suppressing the NPP during the Jerusalem artichoke cropping season. Soil CH4 emissions were 72% and 80% lower in the biochar amended than unamended plots when combined with N fertilizer application during the Jerusalem artichoke cropping and non-cropping seasons, respectively. The biochar-induced soil N2O mitigation efficiency was weakened by N fertilizer input over the annual cycle. Annual NGHGB and GHGI were negative for all the field treatments and were significantly lower in biochar amended than in unamended soils, suggesting that Jerusalem artichoke cropping system served as a net sink of GHGs due to net ecosystem CO2 and biochar-induced C sequestration exceeding CO2-equivalents released as CH4 and N2O emissions. On average, biochar amendment significantly enhanced GHGs sink capacity by resulting in almost 4-5 folds decrease in annual NGHGB or GHGI when combined with N fertilizer application or not. Therefore, higher biomass gain as potential alternative source of biofuels but lower climatic impacts of bioenergy production would be reconciled by biochar use in southeast coastal China. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) causes a damaging disease in Brassica juncea, an important oilseed and biofuel crop. B. juncea gene TuRBJU 01 is associated with a systemic hypersensitive phenotype in TuMV-infected plants. Plants of TuMV-susceptible parent JM 06006, TuMV-resistant parent Oasis Cl (which carries TuRBJU 01) and F3 progeny plants obtained by crossing them were inoculated with 10 Australian TuMV isolates, most of which were already pathotyped. These were: NSW-1, NSW-5 (pathotype 7), NSW-2, NSW-6 (pathotype 1), WA-Ap, WA-Ap1 (pathotype 8), NSW-3, NSW-4 (new pathotype) and 12.1 and 12.5 (unpathotyped B. napus resistance breaking isolates). JM 06006 plants developed a susceptible phenotype with all isolates while a systemic hypersensitive phenotype resulted with all isolates except NSW-3 in Oasis Cl plants. With seven isolates, the segregation ratios for necrotic: non-necrotic phenotypes obtained in inoculated F3 progeny plants all fitted a 3:1 ratio. However, with isolates 12.5 and 12.1, although pooled test segregation data did not fit a 3:1 ratio, individual test data sometimes did. Thus, TuRBJU 01 was less effective against 12.1 and 12.5, and overcome by NSW-3. Also, phenotypic responses obtained with TuRBJU 01 were unrelated to those of TuMV resistance genes present in B. napus differentials. TuRBJU 01 will be valuable in breeding TuMV-resistant B. juncea cultivars. © 2015, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.

AB  - Recently, research has focused on the biofuel production from local industrial wastes due to the risk of greenhouse emissions derived from land-use change (both directly and indirectly) of conventional feedstock and the social concern about the effect of conventional biofuel production on oil prices and its availability (the so-called food vs. fuel debate). Therefore, with the aim to evaluate the use of biofuels derived from wastes from traditional manufacturing industries in Turkey, biodiesel fuels from leather fat, obtained as a by-product in the leather industry, waste anchovy fish oil, derived from the fish-processing industry, and waste frying cottonseed oil achieved from food industry, have been tested in a three-cylinder DI diesel engine at a steady-state condition. In a previous work, the viability of these fuels was evaluated by analyzing measured and estimated properties and indicators for main diesel emissions, and recommendations were made on their alternative use to conventional biodiesels with the benefit of potentially lower life-cycle greenhouse emissions. The experimental results, which were compared with ULSD operation, demonstrated that the engine performance was not significantly affected, while a substantial change in emissions was observed with the use of biofuels. In general, the emission results reported here are in a similar range to those obtained with the use of conventional biodiesel fuels. Nonetheless, the exact magnitude of these changes depended upon the biodiesel origin. Lubricity of alternative biofuels was also tested, revealing an enormous capacity for protecting the fuel system from wear, in line with conventional biodiesel fuels. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 847–852, 2016. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - The need for renewable energy sources will lead to a considerable expansion in the planting of dedicated fast-growing biomass crops across Europe. These are commonly cultivated as short-rotation coppice (SRC), and currently poplar (Populus spp.) is the most widely planted. In this study, we report the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) measured using eddy covariance technique in an SRC plantation for bioenergy production. Measurements were made during the period 2010-2013, that is, during the first two rotations of the SRC. The overall GHG balance of the 4 years of the study was an emission of 1.90 (±1.37) Mg CO2eq ha-1; this indicated that soil trace gas emissions offset the CO2 uptake by the plantation. CH4 and N2O contributed almost equally to offset the CO2 uptake of -5.28 (±0.67) Mg CO2eq ha-1 with an overall emission of 3.56 (±0.35) Mg CO2eq ha-1 of N2O and of 3.53 (±0.85) Mg CO2eq ha-1 of CH4. N2O emissions mostly occurred during one single peak a few months after the site was converted to SRC; this peak comprised 44% of the total N2O loss during the two rotations. Accurately capturing emission events proved to be critical for deriving correct estimates of the GHG balance. The nitrogen (N) content of the soil and the water table depth were the two drivers that best explained the variability in N2O and CH4, respectively. This study underlines the importance of the 'non-CO2 GHGs' on the overall balance. Further long-term investigations of soil trace gas emissions should monitor the N content and the mineralization rate of the soil, as well as the microbial community, as drivers of the trace gas emissions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - It is commonly recognized that large uncertainties exist in modelled biofuel-induced indirect land-use change, but until now, spatially explicit quantification of such uncertainties by means of error propagation modelling has never been performed. In this study, we demonstrate a general methodology to stochastically calculate direct and indirect land-use change (dLUC and iLUC) caused by an increasing demand for biofuels, with an integrated economic - land-use change model. We use the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, connected to the spatially explicit land-use change model PLUC. We quantify important uncertainties in the modelling chain. Next, dLUC and iLUC projections for Brazil up to 2030 at different spatial scales and the uncertainty herein are assessed. Our results show that cell-based (5 × 5 km2) probabilities of dLUC range from 0 to 0.77, and of iLUC from 0 to 0.43, indicating that it is difficult to project exactly where dLUC and iLUC will occur, with more difficulties for iLUC than for dLUC. At country level, dLUC area can be projected with high certainty, having a coefficient of variation (cv) of only 0.02, while iLUC area is still uncertain, having a cv of 0.72. The latter means that, considering the 95% confidence interval, the iLUC area in Brazil might be 2.4 times as high or as low as the projected mean. Because this confidence interval is so wide that it is likely to straddle any legislation threshold, our opinion is that threshold evaluation for iLUC indicators should not be implemented in legislation. For future studies, we emphasize the need for provision of quantitative uncertainty estimates together with the calculated LUC indicators, to allow users to evaluate the reliability of these indicators and the effects of their uncertainty on the impacts of land-use change, such as greenhouse gas emissions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils are a key sustainability metric of cropping systems. During crop establishment, disruptive land-use change is known to be a critical, but under reported period, for determining GHG emissions. We measured soil N2O emissions and potential environmental drivers of these fluxes from a three-year establishment-phase bioenergy cropping systems experiment replicated in southcentral Wisconsin (ARL) and southwestern Michigan (KBS). Cropping systems treatments were annual monocultures (continuous corn, corn-soybean-canola rotation), perennial monocultures (switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar), and perennial polycultures (native grass mixture, early successional community, and restored prairie) all grown using best management practices specific to the system. Cumulative three-year N2O emissions from annuals were 142% higher than from perennials, with fertilized perennials 190% higher than unfertilized perennials. Emissions ranged from 3.1 to 19.1 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1 for the annuals with continuous corn &gt; corn-soybean-canola rotation and 1.1 to 6.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1 for perennials. Nitrous oxide peak fluxes typically were associated with precipitation events that closely followed fertilization. Bayesian modeling of N2O fluxes based on measured environmental factors explained 33% of variability across all systems. Models trained on single systems performed well in most monocultures (e.g., R2= 0.52 for poplar) but notably worse in polycultures (e.g., R2= 0.17 for early successional, R2= 0.06 for restored prairie), indicating that simulation models that include N2O emissions should be parameterized specific to particular plant communities. Our results indicate that perennial bioenergy crops in their establishment phase emit less N2O than annual crops, especially when not fertilized. These findings should be considered further alongside yield and other metrics contributing to important ecosystem services. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The rational utilization of crop straw as a raw material for natural gas production is of economic significance. In order to increase the efficiency of biogas production from agricultural straw, seasonal restrictions must be overcome. Therefore, the potential for biogas production via anaerobic straw digestion was assessed by exposing fresh, silage, and dry yellow corn straw to cow dung liquid extract as a nitrogen source. The characteristics of anaerobic corn straw digestion were comprehensively evaluated by measuring the pH, gas production, chemical oxygen demand, methane production, and volatile fatty acid content, as well as applying a modified Gompertz model and high-throughput sequencing technology to the resident microbial community. The efficiency of biogas production from fresh straw (433.8 ml/g) was higher than that of production from straw silage and dry yellow straw (46.55 ml/g and 68.75 ml/g, respectively). The cumulative biogas production from fresh straw, silage straw, and dry yellow straw was 365 l-1 g-1 VS, 322 l-1 g-1 VS, and 304 l-1 g-1 VS, respectively, whereas cumulative methane production was 1,426.33%, 1,351.35%, and 1,286.14%, respectively, and potential biogas production was 470.06 ml-1 g-1 VS, 461.73 ml-1 g-1 VS, and 451.76 ml-1 g-1 VS, respectively. Microbial community analysis showed that the corn straw was mainly metabolized by acetate-utilizing methanogens, with Methanosaeta as the dominant archaeal community. These findings provide important guidance to the biogas industry and farmers with respect to rational and efficient utilization of crop straw resources as material for biogas production. © 2016 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - The sterile hybrid grass Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) can produce more than 30 t dry matter/ha/year. This biomass has a range of uses, including animal bedding and a source of heating fuel. The grass provides a wide range of other ecosystem services (ES), including shelter for crops and livestock, a refuge for beneficial arthropods, reptiles and earthworms and is an ideal cellulosic feedstock for liquid biofuels such as renewable (drop-in) diesel. In this study, the effects of different strains of the beneficial fungus Trichoderma on above-and below-ground biomass of Mxg were evaluated in glasshouse and field experiments, the latter on a commercial dairy farm over two years. Other ES benefits of Trichoderma measured in this study included enhanced leaf chlorophyll content as well as increased digestibility of the dried material for livestock. This study shows, for the first time for a biofuel feedstock plant, how Trichoderma can enhance productivity of such plants and complements other recent work on the wide-ranging provision of ES by this plant species.

AB  - Agro-biogas from energy crops and by-products is a renewable energy carrier that can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation. In this context, application of the methodology defined by the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC (RED) was performed in order to estimate the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) associated with an agro-biogas supply chain (SC) in Southern Italy. Doing so enabled calculation of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission saving in order to verify if it is at least equal to 35% compared to the fossil fuel reference system, as specified by the RED. For the assessment, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2006a,b) was integrated with the RED methodology applied following the guidelines reported in COM(2010)11 and updated by SWD(2014)259 and Report EUR 27215 EN (2015). Moreover, primary data were collected with secondary data extrapolated from the Ecoinvent database system. Results showed that the GWP100 associated with electricity production through the biogas plant investigated was equal to 111.58 g CO2eq MJe-1 and so a 40.01% GHG-emission saving was recorded compared to the RED reference. The highest contribution comes from biomass production and, in particular, from crop cultivation due to production of ammonium nitrate in the overall amount used for crop cultivation. Based upon the findings of the study, the GHG saving calculated slightly exceeds the related minimum proposed by the RED: therefore, improvements are needed anyway. In particular, the authors documented that through replacement of ammonium nitrate with urea the GHG-emission saving would increase to almost 68%, thus largely satisfying the RED limit. In addition, the study highlighted that conservation practices, such as NT, can significantly enable reduction of the GHG-emissions coming from agricultural activities. Therefore, those practices should be increasingly adopted for cultivation of energy crops, because the latter significantly contribute to biogas production yield enhancement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Waste activated sludge is a valuable resource containing multiple nutrients, but is currently treated and disposed of as an important source of pollution. In this work, waste activated sludge after ultrasound pretreatment was reused as multiple nutrients for biofuel production. The nutrients trapped in sludge floc were transferred into liquid medium by ultrasonic disintegration during first 30 min, while further increase of pretreatment time only resulted in slight increase of nutrients release. Hydrogen production by Ethanoligenens harbinense B49 from glucose significantly increased with the concentration of ultrasonic sludge, and reached maximum yield of 1.97 mol H2/mol glucose at sludge concentration of 7.75 g volatile suspended solids/l. Without addition of any other chemicals, waste molasses rich in carbohydrate was efficiently turned into hydrogen with yield of 189.34 ml H2/g total sugar by E. harbinense B49 using ultrasonic sludge as nutrients. The results also showed that hydrogen production using pretreated sludge as multiple nutrients was higher than those using standard nutrients. Acetic acid produced by E. harbinense B49 together with the residual nutrients in the liquid medium were further converted into hydrogen (271.36 ml H2/g total sugar) by Rhodopseudomonas faecalis RLD-53 through photo fermentation, while ethanol was the sole end product with yield of 220.26 mg/g total sugar. Thus, pretreated sludge was an efficient nutrients source for biofuel production, which could replace the standard nutrients. This research provided a novel strategy to achieve environmental friendly sludge disposal and simultaneous efficient biofuel recovery from organic waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High percentage (up to 70% energy based) biomass co-gasification tests have been carried out at the 253 MWe coal based Willem-Alexander Centrale (WAC), Buggenum in The Netherlands utilizing steam exploded wood pellets to assess feasibility of scaling up and to address stringent EU emission requirements in the coming decades. This principal article for demonstrating high percentage biomass co-gasification in large scale IGCC power plants, presents the obtained experimental results with a detailed and validated steady state thermodynamic model developed as an aid to assess future plant operations. The validated model is also used to predict plant performance involving 70% co-gasification with two fuel blends of torrefied wood pellets since the desired power output of 230 MWe could not be achieved with steam exploded wood pellets. The model predicts plant performance and process parameters with reasonable accuracy and gives a net power output of 173 MW and a net plant efficiency of about 37.2% with steam exploded wood pellets. A net output of 240 MWe and net plant efficiency of 41.7% is predicted for 70% co-gasification with high lower heating value (LHV) torrefied wood pellets. Exergy analysis indicates largest thermodynamic losses in the gasifier and during combustion, providing additional scope for efficiency enhancement. The demonstration of such a high percentage biomass co-gasification test at a large scale power plant is of vital importance for further development of low emission/carbon neutral power plants. The presented test data also serves as a reliable and prime data source for modeling studies. The validated models could serve as a strong platform to plan real plant operation with various biofuels and carry out studies involving novel technology integration, retrofitting and plant optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine was modified and instrumented in order to control operating conditions and to measure engine parameters and in-cylinder pressure diagrams. Aiming at the comparison of different alternative fuels, an experimental procedure was defined, including cetane number (CN) evaluation and the definition of engine operating quantities in different working points, for fixed levels of compression ratio (CR) and injection advance. An investigation was made considering several blends of methyl-esters of rapeseed oil (RME) and of a mix of vegetable oils (VOME) with conventional diesel oil. The defined experimental procedure was applied to assess CN, engine brake thermal efficiency (bte) and exhaust emissions. Results show that the biodiesel content has a positive influence on soot emissions, with strong reduction, while thermal efficiency and NOX emissions are negatively affected, which can be justified taking into account fuel properties and changes in combustion process. As observed outcomes are generally in line with those presented in literature, the facility proved to be a suitable tool for basic investigations on alternative fuels to be used in specific applications. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Phytoremediation is the most environmental friendly and economical technology for restoring agricultural land contaminated by heavy metals. However, it is a slow process, requiring hundreds to thousands of years to reduce pollutant level to meet soil environmental quality standards for highly contaminated soils. Such a long period makes the practice of phytoremediation nearly impossible without economic revenue from crop production. Miscanthus floridulus (M. floridulus) is characterized by its high dry matter yield and strong vitality. This case study planted M. floridulus on fallow land that was contaminated by 6,000 mg/kg of lead to investigate the feasibility of phytoremediation. The case study results show that lead accumulated primarily in the roots of the M. floridulus. After one year of growing, the average lead content in the roots and shoots was 806.7 and 50.3 mg/kg, respectively. M. floridulus was effective for the phytostabilization of lead-contaminated soil and was a lead-tolerant plant. The cropping produced 22.4 ton/ha/year dry matter weight (shoot part) and removed 1.13 kg/ha/year of lead from the soil. The M. floridulus grown on contaminated fields could be used as biofuels, and each hectare of M. floridulus dry matter could generate 365.1 GJ of thermal energy per year, which is equivalent to the heat energy from combustion of 13.4 tons of hard coal. Furthermore, replacing hard coal with M. floridulus would reduce CO2 emissions by 33.1 ton/ha per year. The yields, Pb-absorption concentrations, and carbon mitigation of M. floridulus may change in subsequent years for different environmental conditions; thus, it needs further planting trials for regionalization. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

AB  - The identification of alternative and sustainable energy sources has been one of the fundamental research goals of the last two decades, and the transport sector plays a key role in this challenge. Electric cars and biofuel fed vehicles may contribute to tackle this formidable issue. According to this perspective, a multi-echelon supply chain is here investigated considering biomass cultivation, transport, conversion into bioethanol or bioelectricity, distribution, and final usage in alternative bifuel (ethanol and petrol) and electric vehicles. Multiperiod and spatially explicit features are introduced in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) modelling framework where economic (in terms of Net Present Value) and environmental (in terms of Greenhouse Gases emissions) objectives are simultaneously taken into account. The first and second generation bioethanol production supply chain is matched with a biopower production supply chain assessing multiple technologies. Both corn grain and stover are considered as biomass sources. In the environmental analysis, the impact on emissions caused by indirect Land Use Change (iLUC) effects is also assessed. Results will show the efficacy of the methodology at providing stakeholders with a quantitative tool to optimise the economic and environmental performance of different supply chain configurations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Production of economically competitive and environmentally sustainable algal biofuel faces technical challenges that are subject to high uncertainties. Here we identify target values for algal productivity and financing conditions required to achieve a biocrude selling price of $5 per gallon and beneficial environmental impacts. A modeling framework-combining process design, techno-economic analysis, life cycle assessment, and uncertainty analysis-was applied to two conversion pathways: (1) "fuel only (HTL)", using hydrothermal liquefaction to produce biocrude, heat and power, and (2) "fuel and feed", using wet extraction to produce biocrude and lipid-extracted algae, which can substitute components of animal and aqua feeds. Our results suggest that with supporting policy incentives, the "fuel and feed" scenario will likely achieve a biocrude selling price of less than $5 per gallon at a productivity of 39 g/m2/day, versus 47 g/m2/day for the "fuel only (HTL)" scenario. Furthermore, if lipid-extracted algae are used to substitute fishmeal, the process has a 50% probability of reaching $5 per gallon with a base case productivity of 23 g/m2/day. Scenarios with improved economics were associated with beneficial environmental impacts for climate change, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion, but not for human health.

AB  - The potential environmental effects of increased U.S. biofuel production often vary depending upon the location and type of land used to produce biofuel feedstocks. However, complete, annual data are generally lacking regarding feedstock production by specific location. Corn is the dominant biofuel feedstock in the U.S., so here we present methods for estimating where bioethanol corn feedstock is grown annually and how much is used by U.S. ethanol biorefineries. We use geospatial software and publicly available data to map locations of biorefineries, estimate their corn feedstock requirements, and estimate the feedstock production locations and quantities. We combined these data and estimates into a Bioethanol Feedstock Geospatial Database (BFGD) for years 2005–2010. We evaluated the performance of the methods by assessing how well the feedstock geospatial model matched our estimates of locally-sourced feedstock demand. On average, the model met approximately 89 percent of the total estimated local feedstock demand across the studied years—within approximately 25-to-40 kilometers of the biorefinery in the majority of cases. We anticipate that these methods could be used for other years and feedstocks, and can be subsequently applied to estimate the environmental footprint of feedstock production. Implications: Methods used to develop the Bioethanol Feedstock Geospatial Database (BFGD) provide a means of estimating the amount and location of U.S. corn harvested for use as U.S. bioethanol feedstock. Such estimates of geospatial feedstock production may be used to evaluate environmental impacts of bioethanol production and to identify conservation priorities. The BFGD is available for 2005–2010, and the methods may be applied to additional years, locations, and potentially other biofuels and feedstocks. © 2016 A&WMA.

AB  - In this study a scenario model is used to examine if foreseen technological developments are capable of reducing CO2 emissions in 2050 to a level consistent with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreements, which aim at maximizing the temperature rise to 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels. The model is based on a detailed global environmentally extended supply–use table (EE SUT) for the year 2000, called EXIOBASE. This global EE SUT allows calculating how the final demand in each region drives activities in production sectors, and hence related CO2 emissions, in each region. Using this SUT framework, three scenarios have been constructed for the year 2050. The first is a business-as-usual scenario (BAU), which takes into account population, economic growth, and efficiency improvements. The second is a techno-scenario (TS), adding feasible and probable climate mitigation technologies to the BAU scenario. The third is the towards-2-degrees scenario (2DS), with a demand shift or growth reduction scenario added to the TS to create a 2 °C scenario. The emission results of the three scenarios are roughly in line with outcomes of typical scenarios from integrated assessment models. Our approach indicates that the 2 °C target seems difficult to reach with advanced CO2 emission reduction technologies alone. Policy relevance The overall outlook in this scenario study is not optimistic. We show that CO2 emissions from steel and cement production and air and sea transport will become dominant in 2050. They are difficult to reduce further. Using biofuels in air and sea transport will probably be problematic due to the fact that agricultural production largely will be needed to feed a rising global population and biofuel use for electricity production grows substantially in 2050. It seems that a more pervasive pressure towards emission reduction is required, also influencing the basic fabric of society in terms of types and volumes of energy use, materials use, and transport. Reducing envisaged growth levels, hence reducing global gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, might be one final contribution needed for moving to the 2 °C target, but is not on political agendas now. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Biofuel research has gained considerable interest in the recent past since these are renewable fuels and are considered environment friendly unlike their conventional counterparts. Microbes play important roles in most aspects of biofuel production particularly hydrolysis of biomass, lipid production, fermentation of sugars and production of advanced biofuels. Methods: In the present review, we have discussed some interesting studies pertaining to strain engineering of microorganisms for improved uptake of multiple sugars, consolidated bioprocessing, production of advanced fuels, and biofuel production in photosynthetic microorganisms. Result: Genetically manipulated microbes for co-consumption of multiple sugars, especially glucose and xylose which are abundantly present in hydrolysate of lignocellulosic biomass, have improved the overall efficiency of the whole process. Besides, some designer microbes have been reported for consolidated bioprocessing that aims at a single-step cellulosic biomass fermentation thus cutting down the cost involved in various processes. There are also interesting reports of engineered microbes capable of producing high titers of advanced fuels such as butanol and isopropanol. Engineered photosynthetic microbes such as microalgae and cyanobacteria are promising sources of enhanced lipid and alcohol production. The ability of photosynthetic microbes to grow in water, thus not competing for arable land, make them suitable for production of sustainable fuel. Conclusion: Biofuels have the potential to completely replace fossil fuels in future but the current production of biofuels is unable to fulfil the global fuel requirement. Microorganisms play an important role in various aspects of biofuel production. Microbial strains have been developed to overcome some of the challenges in biofuel production such as lack of multiple sugar assimilation, intolerance to inhibitors and solvents, and low titer of the products. In spite of all the advancements, more improvement is needed in order to achieve the fuel titers high enough for economically sustainable production. The pace at which this field is advancing, there exist possibilities of synthetic microbes designed with engineered minimal genome to produce desired fuels and chemicals at industrially relevant levels. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The possibility of increased invasiveness in cultivated varieties of native perennial species is a question of interest in biofuel risk assessment. Competitive success is a key factor in the fitness and invasive potential of perennial plants, and thus the large-scale release of high-yielding biomass cultivars warrants empirical comparisons with local conspecifics in the presence of competitors. We evaluated the performance of non-local cultivars and local wild biotypes of the tallgrass species Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass) in competition experiments during two growing seasons in Ohio and Iowa. At each location, we measured growth and reproductive traits (plant height, tiller number, flowering time, aboveground biomass, and seed production) of four non-locally sourced cultivars and two locally collected wild biotypes. Plants were grown in common garden experiments under three types of competition, referred to as none, moderate (with Schizachyrium scoparium), and high (with Bromus inermis). In both states, the two “lowland” cultivars grew taller, flowered later, and produced between 2x and 7.5x more biomass and between 3x and 34x more seeds per plant than local wild biotypes, while the other two cultivars were comparable to wild biotypes in these traits. Competition did not affect relative differences among biotypes, with the exception of shoot number, which was more similar among biotypes under high competition. Insights into functional differences between cultivars and wild biotypes are crucial for developing biomass crops while mitigating the potential for invasiveness. Here, two of the four cultivars generally performed better than wild biotypes, indicating that these biotypes may pose more of a risk in terms of their ability to establish vigorous feral populations in new regions outside of their area of origin. Our results support an ongoing assessment of switchgrass cultivars developed for large-scale planting for biofuels. © 2016 Palik et al.

AB  - Microalgal research has been an area of great interest as microalgae have higher productivities than land plants and can be used for the production of valuable commodities such as biofuel, animal feeds and agricultural fertilizers, among others. To enhance the economic feasibility of algal-based commodities, the growth of microalgae can be coupled to wastewater remediation. The technical feasibility of cultivating Spirulina platensis with fish water for production of algae fertilizers was investigated. The remediation potential of S. platensis was found to be good for ammonia and nitrate removal, but inadequate for nitrite removal. Its specific growth rate of 0.026 h− 1 and the nutrient reduction times compare well with various literature reports. This work provides insight into the potential of algal biomass as agricultural fertilizers, when coupled with aquaculture wastewater remediation. The ability of Spirulina-based fertilizers to enhance plant growth was demonstrated in leafy vegetables such as Arugula (Eruca sativa), Bayam Red (Ameranthus gangeticus) and Pak Choy (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis). The germination of Chinese Cabbage (B. rapa ssp. chinensis) and Kai Lan (Brassica oleracea alboglabra) also improved significantly in terms of seedlings’ dry weight. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Meeting the world's growing energy demand through bioenergy production involves extensive land-use change which could have severe environmental and social impacts. Second generation bioenergy feedstocks offer a possible solution to this problem. They have the potential to reduce land-use conflicts between food and bioenergy production as they can be grown on low quality land not suitable for food production. However, a comprehensive impact assessment that considers multiple ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity is needed to identify the environmentally best feedstock option, as trade-offs are inherent. In this study, we simulate the spatial distribution of short rotation coppices (SRCs) in the landscape of the Mulde watershed in Central Germany by modeling profit-maximizing farmers under different economic and policy-driven scenarios using a spatially explicit economic simulation model. This allows to derive general insights and a mechanistic understanding of regional-scale impacts on multiple ESS in the absence of large-scale implementation. The modeled distribution of SRCs, required to meet the regional demand of combined heat and power (CHP) plants for solid biomass, had little or no effect on the provided ESS. In the policy-driven scenario, placing SRCs on low or high quality soils to provide ecological focus areas, as required within the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, had little effect on ESS. Only a substantial increase in the SRC production area, beyond the regional demand of CHP plants, had a relevant effect, namely a negative impact on food production as well as a positive impact on biodiversity and regulating ESS. Beneficial impacts occurred for single ESS. However, the number of sites with balanced ESS supply hardly increased due to larger shares of SRCs in the landscape. Regression analyses showed that the occurrence of sites with balanced ESS supply was more strongly driven by biophysical factors than by the SRC share in the landscape. This indicates that SRCs negligibly affect trade-offs between individual ESS. Coupling spatially explicit economic simulation models with environmental and ESS assessment models can contribute to a comprehensive impact assessment of bioenergy feedstocks that have not yet been planted. © 2016 Schulze et al.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish sustainably feasible areas for the implementation of anaerobic co-digestion plants for agricultural wastes (cattle/swine slurries and cereal crop wastes). The methodology was based on the use of geographic information systems (GIS), the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and map algebra generated from hedges related to environmental, social and economic constraints. The GIS model obtained was applied to a region of Chile (Bío Bío Region) as a case study showing the energy potential (205 MW-h) of agricultural wastes (swine/cattle manures and cereal crop wastes) and thereby assessing its energy contribution (3.5%) at country level (Chile). From this model, it was possible to spatially identify the influence of each factor (environmental, economic and social) when defining suitable areas for the siting of anaerobic co-digestion plants. In conclusion, GIS-based models establish appropriate areas for the location of anaerobic co-digestion plants in the revaluation of agricultural waste from the production of energy through biogas production. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Soil application of biogas residues (BGRs) is important for closing nutrient cycles. This study examined the efficiency and impact on yields and yield formation of solid-liquid separated residues from biodegradable municipal and industrial wastes (bio-waste) in comparison to complete BGRs, nitrification inhibitor, agricultural BGRs, mineral fertilizer and unfertilized plots as control. The experiment was set up as a randomized block design on silt loam Cambisol. Biogas residues from four biogas plants were evaluated. Plants per m?, ears per plant, grains per ear and thousand grain weight (TGW) were measured at harvest. Fertilization with BGRs resulted in similar biomass yields compared with mineral fertilizer. Mineral fertilizer (71 dt/ha) and plots fertilized with liquid fraction (59-62 dt/ha) indicated a trend to higher yields than solid fraction or complete BGR due to its high ammonia content. Liquid fractions and fraction with nitrification inhibitor induced fewer plants per m? than corresponding solid and complete variants due to a potential phytotoxicity of high NH4 -N concentration during germination. However, barley on plots fertilized with liquid fraction compensated the disadvantages at the beginning during the vegetation period and induced higher grain yields than solid fraction. This was attributable to a higher number of ears per plant and grains per ear. In conclusion, BGRs from biodegradable municipal and industrial wastes can be used for soil fertilization and replace considerable amounts of mineral fertilizer. Our study showed that direct application of the liquid fraction of BGR is the most suitable strategy to achieve highest grain yields. Nevertheless potential phytotoxicity of the high NH4 -N concentration in the liquid fraction should be considered. © 2016 Prays, Kaupenjohann.

AB  - Background: Brown algae are promising feedstocks for biofuel production with inherent advantages of no structural lignin, high growth rate, and no competition for land and fresh water. However, it is difficult for one microorganism to convert all components of brown algae with different oxidoreduction potentials to ethanol. Defluviitalea phaphyphila Alg1 is the first characterized thermophilic bacterium capable of direct utilization of brown algae. Results: Defluviitalea phaphyphila Alg1 can simultaneously utilize mannitol, glucose, and alginate to produce ethanol, and high ethanol yields of 0.47 g/g-mannitol, 0.44 g/g-glucose, and 0.3 g/g-alginate were obtained. A rational redox balance system under obligate anaerobic condition in fermenting brown algae was revealed in D. phaphyphila Alg1 through genome and redox analysis. The excess reducing equivalents produced from mannitol metabolism were equilibrated by oxidizing forces from alginate assimilation. Furthermore, D. phaphyphila Alg1 can directly utilize unpretreated kelp powder, and 10 g/L of ethanol was accumulated within 72 h with an ethanol yield of 0.25 g/g-kelp. Microscopic observation further demonstrated the deconstruction process of brown algae cell by D. phaphyphila Alg1. Conclusions: The integrated biomass deconstruction system of D. phaphyphila Alg1, as well as its high ethanol yield, provided us an excellent alternative for brown algae bioconversion at elevated temperature. © 2016 Ji et al.

AB  - Biotechnological processes based on microalgae cultivation are promising for several industrial applications. Microalgae are photoautotrophic microorganisms and can thus grow by using renewable and inexpensive resources as sunlight, inorganic salts, water and CO2. They can store high amounts of neutral lipids (bioil), carbohydrates (mainly starch), carotenoids (such as lutein, astaxanthin, â-carotene), proteins and other molecules. Productions of lipids and carbohydrates have recently received an increasing interest for biofuel production, while proteins, carotenoids and other minor products are usable as feed additives and nutraceutical compounds. Biofuel production from microalgae is not yet economically sustainable, while there are different industrial plants in the world for the production of high values chemicals as carotenoids. Starch production from microalgae has been investigated mainly for the production of biofuels (e.g. bioethanol) by successive fermentation. However, purified starch can be used for other aims such as the production of bioplastics. Superior plants as corn, potato and wheat are currently used for this purpose. However, there are different environmental and economic issues related to the use of fertile lands and edible plants for these kinds of productions. Microalgae can solve these social and ethical issues because they can grow on nonfertile lands and also reach starch productivity per hectare higher than plants. In this work, the production of starch and carotenoids from Scenedesmus sp. microalgal strain is reported. A two-stage process has been developed in order to reduce operative and investment costs. In the first stage, microalgae are cultivated in photoautotrophic conditions and then, when biomass concentration rises and light becomes a limiting factor for growth, microalgae are transferred to a heterotrophic reactor. In this reactor, microalgae are cultivated by using wastewaters as source of nutrients (mainly organic carbon). Microalgae use organic carbon to synthesize starch and simultaneously reduce the content of pollutants in the wastewater (codepuration). Biomass separated by the culture medium is treated for the extraction of lipids containing different antioxidant carotenoids (such as astaxanthin and lutein) and starch granules as raw material for biopolymers. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Even though landfilling of waste is the least favourable option in the waste management hierarchy, the majority of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many countries is still landfilled. This represents waste of valuable resources and could lead to higher environmental impacts compared to energy recovered by incineration, even if the landfill gas is recovered. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to find out which of the following two options for MSW disposal is more environmentally sustainable: incineration or recovery of biogas from landfills, each producing either electricity or co-generating heat and electricity. The systems are compared on a life cycle basis for two functional units: 'disposal of 1 tonne of MSW' and 'generation of 1 kWh of electricity'. The results indicate that, if both systems are credited for their respective recovered energy and recyclable materials, energy from incineration has much lower impacts than from landfill biogas across all impact categories, except for human toxicity. The impacts of incineration co-generating heat and electricity are negative for nine out of 11 categories as the avoided impacts for the recovered energy and materials are higher than those caused by incineration. By improving the recovery rate of biogas, some impacts of landfilling, such as global warming, depletion of fossil resources, acidification and photochemical smog, would be significantly reduced. However, most impacts of the landfill gas would still be higher than the impacts of incineration, except for global warming and human toxicity. The analysis on the basis of net electricity produced shows that the LCA impacts of electricity from incineration are several times lower in comparison to the impacts of electricity from landfill biogas. Electricity from incineration has significantly lower global warming and several other impacts than electricity from coal and oil but has higher impacts than electricity from natural gas or UK grid. At the UK level, diverting all MSW currently landfilled to incineration with energy recovery would not only avoid the environmental impacts associated with landfilling but, under the current assumptions, would also meet 2.3% of UK's electricity demand and save 2-2.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We measure corn and total agricultural area response to the biofuels boom in the United States from 2006 to 2010. Specifically, we use newly available micro-scale grid cell data to test whether a location's corn and total agricultural cultivation rose in response to the capacity of ethanol refineries in their vicinity. Based on these data, acreage in corn and overall agriculture not only grew in already-cultivated areas but also expanded into previously uncultivated areas. Acreage in corn and total agriculture also correlated with proximity to ethanol plants, though the relationship dampened over the time period. A formal estimation of the link between acreage and ethanol refineries, however, must account for the endogenous location decisions of ethanol plants and areas of corn supply. We present historical evidence to support the use of the US railroad network as a valid instrument for ethanol plant locations. Our estimates show that a location's neighborhood refining capacity exerts strong and significant effects on acreage planted in corn and total agricultural acreage. The largest impacts of ethanol plants were felt in locations where cultivation area was relatively low. This high-resolution evidence of ethanol impacts on local agricultural outcomes can inform researchers and policy-makers concerned with crop diversity, environmental sustainability, and rural economic development. © 2016 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association 2016.

AB  - Past studies have examined the impact of ethanol mandates with a long-run perspective and were thus able to assume away short-run rigidities and some of the specifics of the biofuel mandates. These studies have been of limited use in informing current policy debates because the short- to medium-run reality is one of strong regulatory and infrastructure rigidities that restrict how ethanol can be consumed in the United States. Our objectives in this paper are to provide a more coherent framework than currently exists to model and understand how compliance with ethanol mandates in the short run cannot be met with conventional gasoline blends, how compliance impacts fuel prices and consumer and producer welfare, and also to measure the size of the transfer that occurs between refineries and ethanol producers through the market's Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). In a model calibrated to 2015 data, we find that the effects of increasing ethanol mandates that are physically feasible are close to zero on the retail price of gasoline. This result is robust to different gasoline prices, supply elasticities, and export-demand elasticities. Increased mandates can have a large negative effect on the price of high-level ethanol gasoline blends such as E85 if the mandates are increased to approach consumption capacity. © 2015 The Author 2015.

AB  - Several different barcoding methods of distinguishing species have been advanced, but which method is the best is still controversial. Chlorella is becoming particularly promising in the development of second-generation biofuels. However, the taxonomy of Chlorella-like organisms is easily confused. Here we report a comprehensive barcoding analysis of Chlorella-like species from Chlorella, Chloroidium, Dictyosphaerium and Actinastrum based on rbcL, ITS, tufA and 16S sequences to test the efficiency of traditional barcoding, GMYC, ABGD, PTP, P ID and character-based barcoding methods. First of all, the barcoding results gave new insights into the taxonomic assessment of Chlorella-like organisms studied, including the clear species discrimination and resolution of potentially cryptic species complexes in C. sorokiniana, D. ehrenbergianum and C. Vulgaris. The tufA proved to be the most efficient barcoding locus, which thus could be as potential "specific barcode" for Chlorella-like species. The 16S failed in discriminating most closely related species. The resolution of GMYC, PTP, P ID, ABGD and character-based barcoding methods were variable among rbcL, ITS and tuf A genes. The best resolution for species differentiation appeared in tuf A analysis where GMYC, PTP, ABGD and character-based approaches produced consistent groups while the PTP method over-split the taxa. The character analysis of rbcL, ITS and tufA sequences could clearly distinguish all taxonomic groups respectively, including the potentially cryptic lineages, with many character attributes. Thus, the character-based barcoding provides an attractive complement to coalescent and distance-based barcoding. Our study represents the test that proves the efficiency of multiple DNA barcoding in species discrimination of microalgaes. © 2016 Zou et al.

AB  - Summary Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a CO2 fixation pathway that maximizes water-use efficiency (WUE), compared with the C3/C4 CO2 pathway, which permits CAM plants to adapt to arid environments. The CAM pathway provides excellent opportunities to genetically design plants, especially bioenergy crops, with a high WUE and better photosynthetic performance than C3/C4 in arid environments. The information available on the origin and evolution of CAM is scant, however. Here, we analyzed transcriptomes from 13 orchid species and two existing orchid genomes, covering CAM and C3 plants, with an emphasis on comparing 13 gene families involved in the complete carbon fixation pathway. The dosage of the core photosynthesis-related genes plays no substantial role in the evolution of CAM in orchids; however, CAM may have evolved primarily by changes at the transcription level of key carbon fixation pathway genes. We proposed that in both dark and light, CO2 is primarily fixed and then released through two metabolic pathways via known genes, such as PPC1, PPDK and PPCK. This study reports a comprehensive comparison of carbon fixation pathway genes across different photosynthetic plants, and reveals the importance of the level of expression of key genes in the origin and evolution of CAM. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We investigated the response of microbial community to changes in H2S loading rate in a microaerated desulphurisation system treating biogas from vinasse methanisation. H2S removal efficiency was high, and both COD and DO seemed to be important parameters to biomass activity. DGGE analysis retrieved sequences of sulphide-oxidising bacteria (SOB), such as Thioalkalimicrobium sp. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial community was complex and remained constant throughout the experiment. Most sequences belonged to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and, to a lesser extent, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Synergistetes. Despite the high sulphide removal efficiency, the abundance of the taxa of SOB was low, and was negatively affected by the high sulphide loading rate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An α-neoagarooligosaccharide hydrolase, AgaNash, was purified from Cellvibrio sp. OA-2007, which utilizes agarose as a substrate. The agaNash gene, which encodes AgaNash, was obtained by comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequence of AgaNash with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the full-length OA-2007 genome. The agaNash gene combined with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae signal peptide α-mating factor was transformed into the YPH499 strain of S. cerevisiae to generate YPH499/pTEF-MF-agaNash, and the recombinant yeast was confirmed to produce AgaNash, though it was mainly retained within the recombinant cell. To enhance AgaNash secretion from the cell, the signal peptide was replaced with a combination of the signal peptide and a threonine- and serine-rich tract (T-S region) of the S. diastaticus STA1 gene. The new recombinant yeast, YPH499/pTEF-STA1SP-agaNash, was demonstrated to secrete AgaNash and hydrolyze neoagarobiose with an efficiency of as high as 84%, thereby producing galactose, which is a fermentable sugar for the yeast, and ethanol, at concentrations of up to 1.8 g/L, directly from neoagarobiose. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The addition of biomass to an existing coal-fired boiler has emerged as a prospective option for reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate the problems associated with excess global warming. However, the cost associated with retrofitting an injection system and the unstable combustion hinder the use of this option. Therefore, we propose the use of coal impregnated with glycerol as fuel that can be directly injected into an existing boiler. This is a two-in-one fuel that combines a low-rank coal (LRC) with bio-liquid matter extracted from biomass such as molasses or sugarcane juice. In this study, for the first time, we used glycerol, which is a low value co-product of biodiesel production, as the bio-liquid, because the use of molasses or sugar-cane juice raises food ethical issues. The aim of this study was to investigate the combustion behavior of coal impregnated with glycerol, using experimental and numerical methods. The results showed that the calorific value of coal impregnated with glycerol increased, and the combustibility at low and high temperatures was improved by impregnation of low-rank coal with up to 20% glycerol. We also confirmed that the combustion performance of coal impregnated with glycerol was unaffected and was identical to that of original coal. However, excess glycerol (more than 20%) led to oxygen deficiency near the burner and thermal expansion, which reduced the combustibility. The results of this study therefore suggest that less than 20% glycerol is the optimal condition for low-rank coal impregnated with glycerol. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The veterinary antibiotic doxycycline (DOXY) is today frequently applied in conventional pig husbandry for the control of respiratory diseases. After the treatment, pigs excrete major amounts of DOXY as the unchanged active substance. Thus, DOXY residues were found in liquid manures and digestates of biogas plants at concentrations of mg kg-1 dry weight. In order to assess the impact of field applications of contaminated manures and digestates on the entry of DOXY residues into arable and grassland soils, thorough information about the removal of DOXY during long-term storage of farm fertilizers is required. Since this aspect has been only less investigated for manures but not for digestates, first long-term storage simulation tests were performed at laboratory scale. Within the 170-d incubation periods under strictly anaerobic conditions, doxycycline was removed in liquid pig manure by 61% and in digestate by 76%. The calculated half-lives of 120 d and 91 d thus emphasized the persistence of doxycycline in both matrices. Due to the substance specific properties of DOXY, this removal was caused neither by mineralization, epimerization nor biotransformation. According to the high affinity of DOXY to manure and digestate solids, however, the formation of non-extractable residues has to be taken into account as the predominant concentration determining process. This was indicated by the sequential extraction procedure applied. Hence, these results confirmed that a full removal capacity for doxycycline cannot be reached through the long-term storage of farm fertilizers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - India's biofuel policy is mostly confined to Jatropha based biodiesel, as the demand for diesel in India is five times more than the demand for petrol. The policy seeks to increase the demand for biodiesel to 16.72 million tons by 2017 and encourages 20% blending of biodiesel with other fuels. This is a major challenge as Jatropha is a new perennial crop for the farmers, who see considerable risk and uncertainty in its production, profitability and employment generation. The present study tries to investigate the supply chain network and related problems of the biodiesel industry in North East India. The Jatropha based biodiesel supply chain includes stages like feedstock production, feedstock logistics (collection, storage, and transportation), biodiesel production, biodiesel distribution, and biodiesel end-use. The major challenge in feedstock production stage is to achieve a seed production level sufficient for ensuring a stable supply of biodiesel. Poor seed processing infrastructure is another bottleneck in the Jatropha value chain in NE India. Establishing market for Jatropha by-products is also crucial for sustainability of the industry. Collective efforts from public and private sectors are needed along with increase in the market price of biodiesel, which will motivate the farmers and infuse confidence to continue with Jatropha. © 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] has been suggested as a biofuel feedstock due to its high productivity, low N requirements, and drought tolerance but little data exist on its management in the Midwestern US Corn Belt. In 2005 and 2006 in central Iowa, USA, plots were seeded with ‘Top 76-6’ sweet sorghum on three dates; late May, early June, and late June, at rates of 4.5, 11.2, and 17.9 kg ha−1 with row widths of 20, 38, and 76 cm, and fertilized at either 84 or 168 kg N ha−1 to determine how sweet sorghum yield and plant composition respond to changes in management. Yields were highest when sweet sorghum was planted in 20 cm row widths in late May (26.3 Mg ha−1) or early June (29.0 Mg ha−1). Several plant carbohydrates were affected by seeding date in 2005, but not 2006. Theoretical ethanol yields averaged 10,616 and 11,408 L ha−1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and were highest when sweet sorghum was planted earlier in the season and in narrow rows. In contrast, N fertilization and seeding rate had few impacts on sweet sorghum growth, biomass yield or ethanol potential. Based on these results, sweet sorghum in Iowa should be planted in May or June in 20 cm rows at a low to moderate seeding rate and a low N fertilization rate. © 2015, Society for Sugar Research &#38; Promotion.

AB  - This article aims to analyze not only the limits but also the potentialities of Jatropha curcas as an alternative energy source to the most common energy sources, such as firewood and charcoal, utilized in Northern Ghana. In 2010, a Participatory Rural Appraisal was conducted in seven rural communities in the West Mamprusi District (Northern region, Ghana). In this context, J. curcas plantations were promoted at smallholder scale and 480 ha of decentralized J. curcas plantations has been established, involving 1,200 farmers (0.4 ha of land per farmer). J. curcas was cultivated only on marginal soil, defined as lands unused for at least 2 years. The proposed J. curcas system could potentially replace, in terms of energy content, 21% of firewood or 21.8% of charcoal monthly used by households, with comparable costs and time , respect to the traditional energy sources. © 2016 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The paper provides empirical evidence on emerging on-farm renewable energy enterprises in a post-communist space, namely in the Czech Republic. In addition to exploring farmers' individual motivations to adopt activities related to renewable energy production (biofuel crops growing, biomass production, operation of anaerobic digestion (AD) plants, and implementation of solar and wind energy projects), the study focuses on analysing regional and inter-firm variances in the level and types of adopted activities. A considerable discrepancy between stated personal attitudes of farmers (supporting the traditional view that farmers should only produce food) and actual practice of farms (dealing with renewable energy production for economic reasons) was detected. The extent and types of energy activities proved to be influenced both by geographical conditions and types of farm. While there are significant differences between the studied districts with different climatic and geographic conditions in the type and extent of energy crops and biomass cultivation, the expansion of AD plants and solar power systems was observed the same in both areas. The adoption of energy activities is positively correlated with company size and area of cultivated land, and negatively correlated with the degree of focus on livestock production. While growing biofuel crops is typical for large and medium-sized enterprises, individual farmers and small enterprises with less land area are more likely to produce biomass for combustion and use own grounds and roofs for implementing solar systems. Finally, the most common four types of currently adopted multipath renewable energy enterprises were identified. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thailand is Southeast Asia's largest promoter of biofuels. Although, Thailand promotes the use of biofuels, it has yet to achieve its policy targets. This paper focuses on the first generation biofuel development in Thailand and examines the perceptions of seven stakeholder groups to guide further policy development. These stakeholders were feedstock producers, biofuel producers, government agencies, car manufacturers, oil companies, non-profit organizations and end users. It combines a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework with an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework and a TOWS Matrix for analysis of stakeholder's perceptions to propose priorities for policy development. Five policies were of high priority for development of biofuel. These are: (1) promoting biofuel production and use in long term through government policies, (2) revising government regulations to allow sale of biofuel products to other domestic industries while keeping retail prices of blended biofuels below those of regular ethanol and biodiesel, (3) improving farm management and promoting contract farming, (4) expanding cultivation area and yield without affecting food production and environmental sustainability, and (5) balancing biofuel feedstock use between the food and energy industries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new technology for pre-treating source-separated organic household waste prior to anaerobic digestion was assessed, and its performance was compared to existing alternative pre-treatment technologies. This pre-treatment technology is based on waste pulping with water, using a specially developed screw mechanism. The pre-treatment technology rejects more than 95% (wet weight) of non-biodegradable impurities in waste collected from households and generates biopulp ready for anaerobic digestion. Overall, 84-99% of biodegradable material (on a dry weight basis) in the waste was recovered in the biopulp. The biochemical methane potential for the biopulp was 469 ± 7 mL CH4/g ash-free mass. Moreover, all Danish and European Union requirements regarding the content of hazardous substances in biomass intended for land application were fulfilled. Compared to other pre-treatment alternatives, the screw-pulping technology showed higher biodegradable material recovery, lower electricity consumption and comparable water consumption. The higher material recovery achieved with the technology was associated with greater transfer of nutrients (N and P), carbon (total and biogenic) but also heavy metals (except Pb) to the produced biomass. The data generated in this study could be used for the environmental assessment of the technology and thus help in selecting the best pre-treatment technology for source separated organic household waste. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Canola (Brassica napus) is an oil-seed crop that is adapted to the northern High Plains of the USA and is considered a viable rotational and biofuel crop. However, decreased ground water allocations have necessitated determining the impact of limited irrigation on canola productivity. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of a range of irrigation from none to fully irrigated on yield, oil content, soil water changes and water productivity of spring canola. The study was conducted for four growing seasons at three locations in western Nebraska. Two sites had sandy soils whereas the other was a silt loam. Glyphosate tolerant canola was planted late March to early April. Cumulative irrigation treatments were 0, 100, 200, and 300 mm of water with the highest rate adjusted to be non-ET limiting. Canola extracted soil water from depths greater than 1.2 m in both fine textured and sandy soils making it a good alternative for deficit irrigation. Canola responded well to irrigation during dry years but showed little response in above average precipitation years. A water use efficiency of 7.6 kg mm-1 with a threshold of 123 mm was observed. Canola seed yield ranged from 440 to 3280 kg ha-1 with 165 and 582 mm of cumulative ET. During drier years, canola exhibited peak values in water use at 8-9 weeks after planting. Deficit irrigation reduced ET and yield and hastened maturity during drier years. Oil content was increased by irrigation during drier years with no effect shown when precipitation was above average. Oil content ranged from 30 to 50% depending on year and irrigation level. The water response provided benefits of not only higher yield, but also higher oil content which makes deficit irrigated canola an attractive alternative production and biofuel crop for this region. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Replacing pastures (PA) with sugarcane (SG) has been deemed an agronomically feasible strategy for sugarcane expansion in Brazil. However, there are some uncertainties about the environmental impacts regarding this land use change (LUC), mainly related to soil organic matter (SOM), a key factor of environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol. LUC-related losses of SOM can overcome the C savings from biofuels. The molecular composition of SOM was evaluated to understand the C dynamics regarding LUC from PA to SG, using native vegetation (NV) as reference. Our study area was located in the south-central region of Brazil. Soil sampling was performed at three depths (0-0.1 m, 0.2-0.3 m and 0.9-1 m) in three representative sites with known LUC history and management practice since 1970. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was chosen to study SOM chemistry. Content and isotopic composition of soil organic C and N were also determined. The LUC caused decreases on C and N contents and on δ13C isotopic values. Depth was the major factor that influenced SOM composition, while the influence of LUC was mainly evident in surface soils and diminished rapidly with depth. The main difference in SOM composition undergoing the conversion PA-SG was a higher contribution from compounds associated to fresh litter inputs. The high contribution from fresh litter, having a relatively low mean residence time and increasing decomposition rates, is probably a major factor that drives C losses in areas undergoing sugarcane expansion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the fate and effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its metabolites during thermophilic anaerobic digestion of cow manure. OTC-medicated and non-medicated digesters were operated at 55 °C with different volatile solids (VS) concentrations (4% and 6%) and mixing rates (90 and 120 rpm). OTC and its metabolites were measured by HPLC and LC/MS/MS, respectively. Microbial community dynamics were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR (qPCR). Approximately 2. mg/L initial OTC concentration caused 10-30% inhibition on biogas production and higher inhibition was observed as mixing rate increased. DGGE results indicated that OTC caused a shift in bacterial community structure and several species became dominant with time. Archaeal community decreased throughout the digestion period. RNA based qPCR analyses showed that gene copy numbers of bacteria and Methanomicrobiales declined in all digesters whereas gene copy numbers of Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales increased in high mixing rate digesters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae may be fermented to produce hydrogen. However micro-algae (such as Arthrospira platensis) are rich in proteins and have a low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, which is not ideal for hydrogen fermentation. Co-fermentation with macro-algae (such as Laminaria digitata), which are rich in carbohydrates with a high (C/N) ratio, improves the performance of hydrogen production. Algal biomass, pre-treated with 2.5% dilute H2SO4 at 135°C for 15min, effected a total yield of carbohydrate monomers (CMs) of 0.268 g/g volatile solids (VS). The CMs were dominating by glucose and mannitol and most (ca. 95%) were consumed by anaerobic fermentative micro-organisms during subsequent fermentation. An optimal specific hydrogen yield (SHY) of 85.0 mL/g VS was obtained at an algal C/N ratio of 26.2 and an algal concentration of 20 g VS/L. The overall energy conversion efficiency increased from 31.3% to 54.5% with decreasing algal concentration from 40 to 5 VS g/L. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Globally, the rate of land-use change (LUC) is increasing rapidly to support biofuel feedstock production. In Brazil, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion to produce ethanol is displacing degraded pastures. Intensive mechanization for sugarcane production, could impact soil physical quality in these areas. We evaluated a typical LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) on soil physical quality at three sites in the central-southern region of Brazil. The soil physical properties evaluated through on-farm and laboratory soil analyses were: bulk density, degree of compactness, macroporosity, microporosity and total porosity, water-filled pore space, indexes of soil water storage and aeration capacity, soil resistance to penetration, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and stability structural index. Calculations of mean weight diameter for the soil aggregates and soil physical quality ratings from a visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) were also included in this study. From those data we defined a minimum dataset for calculating an additive soil physical quality index (SPQI). Long-term conversion from native ecosystems to pasture increased soil compaction (i.e., higher bulk density, degree of compactness and resistance to penetration values), decreased aeration porosity and water hydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-filled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI, the soil's capacity to perform its physical functions decreased from 90% under native vegetation to 73% under pasture. Land-use change from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation, in which soil function was 68 and 56% of capacity. Overall, soil physical quality decreased under sugarcane fields, due to decreases in soil porosity, aeration and water hydraulic conductivity as well as increases in soil penetration resistance, structural degradation and erosion risk. Tillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting (~ 5 years) had a short-term positive effect on soil physical quality, although over time it further decreased the resistance to erosion and structural degradation. Therefore, to convert degraded pasture to sugarcane in a sustainable manner, the soils should be managed in ways that increase the soil organic matter and minimize compaction. These actions are needed to prevent further soil physical quality degradation and to improve both economic and environmental sustainability of sugarcane ethanol production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A novel mesophilic anaerobic digestion process with detoxification-treated coconut shell pyroligneous was established, exhibiting an effective advantage in biogas production. The pyroligneous collected contained 166.2 g l−1 acetic acid, indicating great potential for biogas production. Detoxification was an effective way of simultaneously enriching biodegradable ingredients and removing inhibitors (mainly as phenols and organic acids) for digestion process. The digestion process lasted 96 h and fermentation characteristics (chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal ratio, volatile fatty acid (VFA) consumptions, pH, total gas, methane yield, and phenol removal efficiency) were measured. The experiments successfully explored the optimum detoxification parameters, oxidized with 10 % H2O2 followed by overliming, and demonstrated 89.3 % COD removal, 91.4 % methane content, 0.305 LCH4/g COD removed CH4 yield, and 88.81 % phenol removal ratio. This study provided clues to overcome the negative effects of inhibitors in pyroligneous on biogas production. The findings could contribute to significant process in detoxified pretreatment of pyroligneous and develop an economically feasible technology for treating pyroligneous after producing charcoal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article focuses on the saving potential of butanol as regards greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is known that butanol can be used as a biofuel to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from transport and that butanol may overcome blend wall limitations better than ethanol. However, the GHG emissions of butanol are not well known. The study is based on two case studies: corn butanol production in the USA and sugarcane butanol production in Brazil. Results obtained for GHG emissions show 79-122 gCO2-eq/MJ for corn butanol and -55-18 gCO2-eq/MJ for sugarcane butanol. Our results suggest that in the cases studied, producing butanol from corn (with the current cultivation and process practices) does not lead to GHG emission savings. On the other hand, producing butanol from sugarcane seems to have potential for GHG emission reductions in certain conditions. We highlight the differences between these two production chains and discuss how GHG emissions from these biofuel chains could be reduced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses the oil palm expansion in the State of Pará, located in the Brazilian Amazon. It focuses on land use change aspects put in perspective with the sustainability criteria for biofuels of the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The study shows that palm oil production for energy purposes appears very promising in Brazil. In parallel to local targets, the mandatory European biofuel targets represent an important market potential for the country. It seems too early to know whether the export of palm oil biodiesel from Brazil to Europe will be significant or not. However, it is likely that palm oil exports for biodiesel production in Europe occur in the coming years. Although the RED includes some essential conditions for sustainable production of biofuels, we argue that the values imposed for calculating carbon stocks do not reflect diversity of pastureland where oil palm expansion occurs in the Brazilian Amazon. The use of certain land areas authorised within the RED may also represent a significant limit in terms of biodiversity protection. This study provides new insights that may be used to improve life cycle assessment of biodiesel from palm oil in order to avoid unintended policy consequences. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - LanzaTech has developed novel microbial bioreactor systems capable of direct gas fermentation to produce ethanol from carbon-containing gases. In this study, a life-cycle assessment method is used to quantify the global warming potential of several scenarios for producing renewable ethanol with the LanzaTech process. Scenarios considering ethanol produced from steel mill waste gases or biomass (corn stover, forest residue, or switchgrass, via gasification) have been considered, using input data from peer-reviewed literature, government reports, life cycle inventory databases, and LanzaTech process engineering estimates. Using standardized life-cycle assessment methods, ethanol produced via LanzaTech fermentation appears to result in greenhouse gas emissions that are at least 60% lower than that of conventional fossil gasoline, with biomass-based ethanol achieving close to 90% emission reductions. Results indicate that the LanzaTech gas fermentation technology can be a viable alternative for producing next-generation biofuels that satisfy United States Renewable Fuels Standard policies concerning fuels with a reduced greenhouse gas emissions footprint. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Few studies have addressed the terraces adjacent to the Tana River and delta. In May 2012 a survey assessed the woody vegetation of the terraces in anticipation of their conversion to a biofuel farm. The 64 000 hectares targeted by Bedford Biofuels for clearing for Jatropha curcas would have released over 1 million Mg of carbon at a social cost of the order of US$36 million. The lease agreement set the payment to the communities at US$0.75 per hectare per year, i.e. about US$100 000 annually. The intact terraces are a resource for famine food, fodder, traditional medicine for humans and livestock, firewood, fencing and housing, but are especially important for pastoralist communities at the beginning of the dry season when waiting for the deltaic floodplain pastures to become accessible. They are also important migratory routes for wildlife, including elephants, dispersing to and from the Tsavo ecosystem. It is unlikely that the communities would have derived substantial benefits from conversion. Maintaining and even improving the carbon storage on these semi-arid lands would therefore be a better option, especially if compensation was available through the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme. The biofuel company has since abandoned the project. © 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - The development of energy crops can provide environmental benefits and may represent an opportunity to improve agriculture in areas considered at low productivity. In this work, we studied the energy potential of two species (Brassica carinata A. Braun and Cynara cardunculus L.) and their seed oil productivity under different growth conditions. Furthermore, the biodiesel from the oil extracted from the seeds of these species was produced and analysed in term of utilisation as fuels in compression ignition engines. In particular, the spray penetration and shape ratio were measured in a constant-volume chamber and compared with the results obtained with a standard diesel fuel. These results were obtained using a standard common rail injection system at different injection pressure, injection duration, and constant-volume chamber pressure. © S. De Domenico et al.

AB  - Brassicaceae are promising oil feedstock for cultivation in centralsouthern Italy. Therefore, a two-year investigation on Brassica carinata A. Braun (cv. CT 204) was carried out in three sites of Apulia region [Site 1, Alberobello - Murgia foreland; Site 2, Troia (Foggia) - Daunian sub-Apennines; Site 3, Monteroni (Lecce) - Area of Salento], and in one site of Basilicata region (Site 4, Hill of Matera). The aim was to identify site-specific management practices [by comparing minimum vs conventional tillage, low sowing density vs high sowing density; different levels of nitrogen (N) supply and organic fertilisers] in the four different marginal areas, to achieve optimum yield performance for biodiesel prospective production. The crop showed a good adaptability in the study sites, and the highest N level positively influenced the yield performance in Sites 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, the reduction of mechanical operations (minimum tillage) did not negatively influence crop production and seed oil content. The highest density of sowing tested determined the best crop performance in Site 3, particularly showing the maximum seed oil content with the lowest N supply. Finally, in Site 4 the compost mixed with mineral N fertiliser as well as the sewage sludge from urban wastewater determined productive results comparable to those obtained with mineral fertiliser, evidencing that organic fertilisers could (partially or completely) substitute the mineral one for this crop in the study site. On the whole, seed yield and oil content showed a potential for biodiesel production of Brassica carinata cultivated with site-specific agronomic techniques in four different marginal areas of Southern Italy, suggesting it can be likely achieved the crop environmental adaptation. © F.

AB  - This paper addresses the strategic planning of an IBSC (integrated biofuel supply chain) using total annualized cost and total life cycle GHG (green house gas) emissions as economic and environmental criteria respectively. The IBSC for an extended planning horizon H (e.g. 10 years) is considered and horizon H is further subdivided into a set of discrete time intervals. For each of these subintervals the diesel and the biodiesel fuel consumption can be varied according to a predetermined value. A mixed-integer linear programming model of biodiesel production that takes into account infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, size and location of biorefineries using the available biomass and carbon tax data is proposed. An important aspect of the proposed model is the inclusion of crop rotation conditions to assure the supply of biological feedstock. The price of biodiesel and any byproducts produced are included in the model. Inputs to the model are the quantity of biological feedstock, the cost of biomass transportation, as well as inventory and processing costs. The proposed model is illustrated in Part 2 of this work with an example of Bulgarian economy for planning period 2010 to 2020 when the objectives of the Renewable Energy Directive 28/2009/EC will be achieved. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We apply a land surface model to evaluate the interplay between potential bioenergy grass (Miscanthus, Cave-in-Rock, and Alamo) production, water quantity, and nitrogen leaching (NL) in the Central and Eastern U.S. Water use intensity tends to be lower where grass yields are modeled to be high, for example in the Midwest for Miscanthus and Cave-in-Rock and the upper southeastern U.S. for Alamo. However, most of these regions are already occupied by crops and forests and substitution of these biome types for ethanol production implies trade-offs. In general, growing Miscanthus consumes more water, Alamo consumes less water, and Cave-in-Rock consumes approximately the same amount of water as existing vegetation. Bioenergy grasses can maintain high productivity over time, even in water limited regions, because their roots can grow deeper and extract the water from the deep, moist soil layers. However, this may not hold where there are frequent and intense drought events, particularly in regions with shallow soil depths. One advantage of bioenergy grasses is that they mitigate nitrogen leaching relative to row crops and herbaceous plants when grown without applying N fertilizer; and bioenergy grasses, especially Miscanthus, generally require less N fertilizer application than row crops and herbaceous plants. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Interest in biobased products has been motivated, in part, by the claim that these products have lower life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than their fossil counterparts. This study investigates GHG emissions from U.S. production of three important biobased polymer families: polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and bioethylene-based plastics. The model incorporates uncertainty into the life cycle emission estimates using Monte Carlo simulation. Results present a range of scenarios for feedstock choice (corn or switchgrass), treatment of coproducts, data sources, end of life assumptions, and displaced fossil polymer. Switchgrass pathways generally have lower emissions than corn pathways, and can even generate negative cradle-to-gate emissions if unfermented residues are used to coproduce energy. PHB (from either feedstock) is unlikely to have lower emissions than fossil polymers once end of life emissions are included. PLA generally has the lowest emissions when compared to high emission fossil polymers, such as polystyrene (mean GHG savings up to 1.4 kg CO2e/kg corn PLA and 2.9 kg CO2e/kg switchgrass PLA). In contrast, bioethylene is likely to achieve the greater emission reduction for ethylene intensive polymers, like polyethylene (mean GHG savings up to 0.60 kg CO2e/kg corn polyethylene and 3.4 kg CO2e/kg switchgrass polyethylene). © 2016 American Chemical Society.

The agronomic characteristics of the digestates can promote plant growth and soil properties after digestate fertilization but also harmful effects can arise due to digestate quality, e.g. pH, organic matter and heavy metal content. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences and similarities in agronomic characteristics and the value of five urban waste digestates from different biogas plants treating either food waste, organic fraction of organic solid waste or a mixture of waste-activated sludge and vegetable waste. The digestate agronomic characteristics were studied with chemical analyses and the availability of nutrients was also assessed with growth experiments and soil mineralization tests. All studied urban digestates produced 5-30% higher ryegrass yields compared to a control mineral fertilizer with a similar inorganic nitrogen concentration, while the feedstock source affected the agronomic value. Food waste and organic fraction of municipal solid waste digestates were characterized by high agronomic value due to the availability of nutrients and low heavy metal load. Waste-activated sludge as part of the feedstock mixture, however, increased the heavy metal content and reduced nitrogen availability to the plant, thus reducing the fertilizer value of the digestate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Releases of C60 fullerenes to the environment will increase with the growth of nanotechnology. Assessing the potential risks of manufactured C60 requires an understanding of how its prevalence in the environment compares to that of natural and incidental C60. This work describes the characterization of incidental C60 present in aerosols generated by combustion of five common fuels: coal, firewood, diesel, gasoline, and propane. C60 was found in exhaust generated by all five fuels; the highest concentrations in terms of mass of C60 per mass of particulate matter were associated with diesel and coal. Individual aerosols from these combustion processes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. No relationship was found between C60 content and either the separation of graphitic layers (lamellae) within the particles, nor the curvature of those lamellae. Estimated global emissions of incidental C60 to the atmosphere from coal and diesel combustion range from 1.6 to 6.3tyr-1, depending upon combustion conditions. These emissions may be similar in magnitude to the total amount of manufactured C60 produced on an annual basis. Consequent loading of incidental C60 to the environment may be several orders of magnitude higher than has previously been modeled for manufactured C60. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, has become a model for studying lipid metabolism and its triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis pathway makes it an ideal target for metabolic engineering to improve lipid productivity. However, the genetic background and metabolic networks of fatty acid biosynthesis in diatoms are not well understood. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) is the critical enzyme that catalyzes the first step of TAG formation. So far, characterization of GPAT in marine microalgae has not been reported, especially at the level of comprehensive sequence-structure and functional analysis. Results: A GPAT was cloned from P. tricornutum and overexpressed in P. tricornutum. Volumes of oil bodies were produced and the neutral lipid content was increased by twofold determined by Nile red fluorescence staining. Fatty acid composition was analyzed by GC-MS, which showed significantly higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids compared to wild type. Conclusion: These results suggested that the identified GPAT could upregulate TAG biosynthesis in P. tricornutum. Moreover, this study offers insight into the lipid metabolism of diatoms and supports the role of microalgal strains for biofuels production. © 2016 Niu et al.

AB  - This research was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using the bioenergy crop Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) as vegetation and mineral wastes for filling in constructed wetlands (CWs) designed for the removal of nutrients from wastewater. Four horizontal subsurface flow pilot-scale CWs were monitored during one year: Two filled with fragmented limestone and two with clay brick fragments, two planted and two unplanted controls. Sugarcane stalk height, diameter and foliar area were evaluated during the plant-cane cycle along with total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies from the wastewater. Sugarcane biomass production was 107 ton/ha for the brick fragments filled CW and 67 ton/ha for the fragmented limestone filled CW. Planted CWs show better nutrient removal efficiencies than the unplanted. Planted CW filled with brick fragments show average efficiencies of 77% ± 4% for TP and 60% ± 12% for TN, and planted CW filled with fragmented limestone 68% ± 3% for TP and 58% ± 7% for TN. Results showed that the use of sugarcane as CW vegetation is a viable alternative to produce a bioethanol raw-material without the use of arable land and irrigation water, while it maintains the wastewater treatment capabilities of CWs. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - The production of biofuel from microalgae has been an area of great interest as microalgae have higher productivities than land plants, and certain species have high lipid constituents which are the major feedstock for biodiesel production. One way to enhance the economic feasibility of algal-based biofuel is to couple it with waste remediation. This study investigated the technical feasibility of cultivating Chlorella sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. with fish water for biofuel production. The remediation potential of Chlorella sp. was found to be higher but the lipid yield is lower, when compared to Nannochloropsis sp. Lipid productivities were found to be similar for both types of algae at 1.1-1.3 mg L-1h-1. The fatty acid profiles of the obtained lipids were found suitable for biofuel production, and the calorific values were high at 30-32 MJ/kg. The results provide insights into lipid production in Chlorella sp. and Nannochloropsis sp., when coupled with waste remediation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The terrestrial biosphere can release or absorb the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and therefore has an important role in regulating atmospheric composition and climate. Anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, agriculture and waste management have altered terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes, and the resulting increases in methane and nitrous oxide emissions in particular can contribute to climate change. The terrestrial biogenic fluxes of individual greenhouse gases have been studied extensively, but the net biogenic greenhouse gas balance resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system remains uncertain. Here we use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of local flux measurements, and process-based modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversions) approaches to quantify the global net biogenic greenhouse gas balance between 1981 and 2010 resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system. We find that the cumulative warming capacity of concurrent biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions is a factor of about two larger than the cooling effect resulting from the global land carbon dioxide uptake from 2001 to 2010. This results in a net positive cumulative impact of the three greenhouse gases on the planetary energy budget, with a best estimate (in petagrams of CO 2 equivalent per year) of 3.9 ± 3.8 (top down) and 5.4 ± 4.8 (bottom up) based on the GWP100 metric (global warming potential on a 100-year time horizon). Our findings suggest that a reduction in agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions, particularly in Southern Asia, may help mitigate climate change.

AB  - Background: Development of more sustainable biofuel production processes is ongoing, and technology to run these processes at a high dry matter content, also called high-gravity conditions, is one option. This paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of such a technology currently in development for the production of bio-ethanol from spruce wood chips. Results: The cradle-to-gate LCA used lab results from a set of 30 experiments (or process configurations) in which the main process variable was the detoxification strategy applied to the pretreated feedstock material. The results of the assessment show that a process configuration, in which washing of the pretreated slurry is the detoxification strategy, leads to the lowest environmental impact of the process. Enzyme production and use are the main contributors to the environmental impact in all process configurations, and strategies to significantly reduce this contribution are enzyme recycling and on-site enzyme production. Furthermore, a strong linear correlation between the ethanol yield of a configuration and its environmental impact is demonstrated, and the selected environmental impacts show a very strong cross-correlation (r2 &gt; 0.9 in all cases) which may be used to reduce the number of impact categories considered from four to one (in this case, global warming potential). Lastly, a comparison with results of an LCA of ethanol production under high-gravity conditions using wheat straw shows that the environmental performance does not significantly differ when using spruce wood chips. For this comparison, it is shown that eutrophication potential also needs to be considered due to the fertilizer use in wheat cultivation. Conclusions: The LCA points out the environmental hotspots in the ethanol production process, and thus provides input to the further development of the high-gravity technology. Reducing the number of impact categories based only on cross-correlations should be done with caution. Knowledge of the analyzed system provides further input to the choice of impact categories. © 2016 Janssen et al.

AB  - Recent energy security strategies, investment opportunities and energy policies have led to an escalation in biofuel consumption at the expenses of food crops and pastureland. To evaluate the important impacts of biofuels on food security, the food-energy nexus needs to be investigated in the context of its linkages with the overall human appropriation of land and water resources. Here we provide a global assessment of biofuel crop production, reconstruct global patterns of biofuel crop/oil trade and determine the associated displacement of water and land use. We find that bioethanol is mostly produced with domestic crops while 36% of biodiesel consumption relies on international trade, mainly from Southeast Asia. Altogether, biofuels rely on about 2-3% of the global water and land used for agriculture, which could feed about 30% of the malnourished population. We evaluate the food-energy tradeoff and the impact an increased reliance on biofuel would have on the number of people the planet can feed.

AB  - Environmental policy increasingly resorts to market-based instruments in order to meet sustainability objectives. The ‘carbon market’ instituted by the European Emissions Trading directive from 2003 is a canonical example, which has been described, and critiqued, as a delegation of policy objectives to market exchanges. In this paper, we examine the complex ways in which the operationalization of policy objectives and the organization of markets are intertwined, focusing on two other examples of European environmental regulation. The first one is the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive from 1996, which defined the ‘best available techniques’ to curb emissions in air, water and soil. The second one is the Renewable Energy Directive from 2009, which introduced criteria for the definition of the sustainability of biofuels. Through the analysis of the design and implementation of these two directives, we identify a central concern for the coexistence of various objects, and various initiatives undertaken by European institutions, member states and private actors. We use the notion of coexistence to describe a European political and economic ordering that is inherently hybrid, and cannot be reduced to a mere delegation of policy objectives to the market, or a legal constraint imposed on all European actors. It grounds its political legitimacy and economic rationality on the distribution of roles and responsibilities across public and private actors, and on the ability to ‘keep things different’ according to local variabilities. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The environmental performance of biofuels is often assessed comparing multiple feedstocks while implications of different co-product processing options are neglected. This study presents a life cycle assessment of several co-product processing concepts of wheat- and sugar beet-based ethanol production in Germany. Inventory data are first-hand industry data presenting state-of-the-art plants. The methodology defined by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is applied. The cradle-to-gate investigation shows that the co-production of fodder results in lowest impacts allocated to ethanol: 37 g CO2-eq. per MJ of ethanol from sugar beets. Total impacts are lower in case of beet-based ethanol in impact categories which are dominated by emissions from cultivation, such as eutrophication and acidification. Biogas co-production results in lowest total emissions but in higher emissions allocated to ethanol. A sensitivity analysis shows how certain assumptions, such as using a different energy carrier, grain drying, etc., influence these results. Results indicate that the environmental impacts of different co-product processing concepts differ. Consequently, special attention should be given to this aspect when the environmental impacts of biofuels are compared. It is furthermore advised to apply a method accounting for the utility and benefits of co-products when allocating emissions, as opposed to RED methodology. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Over the last decade, the number of decentralized farm biogas plants has increased significantly in the EU. This development leads not only to an increasing amount of biogas produced, but also to a higher amount of digestate obtained.One of the most attractive options to manage the digestate is to apply it as biofertiliser to the soil, because this gives the opportunity of recovering the nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, and of attenuating the loss of organic matter suffered by soils under agricultural exploitation.Studies have claimed that digestates can present a residual biodegradability, and contain complex organic elements, salts or pathogenic bacteria that can damage terrestrial organisms. However few ecotoxicological studies have been performed to evaluate the ecological impact of digestate application on soil.In this study, the use of digestate as biofertiliser in agriculture was assessed by a battery of ecotoxicological tests considering the potential pollutants present in the digestate as a whole by using the "matrix-based" approach (also known as "whole effluent toxicity" for eluates or wastewater effluents). The direct and indirect tests included plant bioassays with Lepidium sativum, earthworm bioassays with Eisenia fetida, aquatic organisms (Artemia sp. and Daphnia magna) and luminescent bacteria bioassays (Vibrio fischeri).Direct tests occurred to be more sensitive than indirect tests. The earthworm bioassays did not show serious negative effects for concentrations up to 15% (dry weight/dry weight percent, w/w dm) and the plant bioassays showed no negative effect, but rather a positive one for concentrations lower than 20% (w/w dm), which encourages the use of digestate as a biofertiliser in agriculture provided that proper concentrations are used. The indirect tests, on the eluate, with the using aquatic organisms and luminescent bacteria showed an LC50 value of 13.61% volume/volume percent, v/v) for D. magna and no toxicity for Artemia sp. and V. fischeri.The ecotoxicological parameters obtained from the experimental activity have been analyzed so that they could serve in both ecological risk assessment (ERA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the risks and impacts of using digestate as a biofertiliser in agriculture. An interim effect factor of 1.17E-3 m3/kg-in-soil is advocated and can be used in life cycle impact assessment modelling of terrestrial ecotoxicity. A predicted non effect concentration for soil organisms was defined at 341 mg-digestate/kg-soil and can be used for the dose-response assessment step in ERA. Although these values are recommended for use in ERA and LCA applications, it should be stressed that they underlie important uncertainties, which should be reduced by increasing the number of toxicological tests, in particular of chronic studies conducted at different trophic levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluates uncertainties in the techno-economic analysis of transportation fuel production from biomass gasification and mixed alcohol synthesis. Two scenarios are considered: a state-of-technology scenario and a target scenario with projected technological advances. Uncertainties of more than 10parameters are investigated. The probability distributions of these parameters are estimated based on historical price data and experimental data. Data samples generated from the corresponding distribution are then utilized to run a MonteCarlo simulation. The results yield minimum fuel-selling prices of $1.85L-1 with a standard deviation of 0.13 for the state-of-technology scenario and $1.14L-1 with a standard deviation of 0.11 for the target scenario, respectively. The feedstock price and internal rate of return (IRR) have significant impacts on the minimum fuel-selling price in both scenarios. These findings are indicative of the reduction in biofuel cost and uncertainty achievable with increasing technology maturity. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Peat is commonly known as a biofuel but it also has other more or less traditional uses, for example in folk medicine, building materials, or preservation of foods. Several studies suggest that the main composers of peat lands, Sphagnum mosses, may also have potential for a variety of other value-added products. Typically, those are related to the antibacterial and other preservative properties of Sphagnum, or to their high water adsorption ability. Molecular level applications, however, are still rarely reported. This might owe to the complex chemistry of Sphagnum and lacking cost-efficient technologies for the isolation of components of interest. In this literature survey, the structural and chemical properties of Sphagnum are reviewed together with their suggested uses. This is expected to facilitate new efforts to find commercially feasible applications for these extraordinary plants. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol made from cellulosic biomass is a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based liquid transportation fuels. One of the major challenges to cost effectiveness of cellulosic ethanol manufacturing is low density of raw cellulosic biomass that causes high costs of biomass transportation and storage. Pelleting can significantly increase biomass density,resulting in reducing the transportation and storage costs. Ring-die pelleting, a traditional pelleting method, generally involves high-temperature steam and high pressure, and often use binder materials. Ultrasonic vibration-assisted (UV-A) pelleting is a new pelleting method without using high-temperature steam, high pressure, and binder materials. This paper reports an experimental study to compare pellet quality (density and durability), sugar yield, temperature, energy consumption, microstructure of corn stover processed by UV-A pelleting and ring-die pelleting with two level of sieve size (3.2 and 9.5 mm). Results showed that pellets produced by UV-A pelleting had comparable density, durability, and sugar yield as those produced by ring-die pelleting. UV-A pelleting required higher energy consumption than ring-die pelleting and produced higher temperature than ring-die pelleting. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Rural landscapes face changing climate, shifting development pressure, and loss of agricultural land. Perennial bioenergy crops grown on existing agricultural land may provide an opportunity to conserve rural landscapes while addressing increased demand for biofuels. However, increased bioenergy production and changing land use raise concerns for tradeoffs within the food-energy-environment trilemma. Heterogeneity of climate, soils, and land use complicate assessment of bioenergy potential in complex landscapes, creating challenges to evaluating future tradeoffs. The hypothesis addressed herein is that perennial bioenergy production can provide an opportunity to avoid agricultural land conversion to development. Using a process-based crop model, we assessed potential bioenergy crop growth through 2100 in a southern Appalachian Mountain region and asked: (1) how mean annual yield differed among three crops (switchgrass Panicum virgatum, giant miscanthus Miscanthus x giganteus, and hybrid poplar Populus x sp.) under current climate and climate change scenarios resulting from moderate and very high greenhouse gas emissions; (2) how maximum landscape yield, spatial allocation of crops, and bioenergy hotspots (areas with highest potential yield) varied among climate scenarios; and (3) how bioenergy hotspots overlapped with current crop production or lands with high development pressure. Under both climate change scenarios, mean annual yield of perennial grasses decreased (-4% to -39%), but yield of hybrid poplar increased (+8% to +20%) which suggests that a switch to woody crops would maximize bioenergy crop production. In total, maximum landscape yield increased by up to 90 000 Mg/yr (6%) in the 21st century due to increased poplar production. Bioenergy hotspots (&gt;18 Mg·ha-1·yr-1) consistently overlapped with high suburban/exurban development likelihood and existing row crop production. If bioenergy production is constrained to marginal (non-crop) lands, landscape yield decreased by 27%. The removal of lands with high development probability from crop production resulted in losses of up to 670 000 Mg/yr (40%). This study demonstrated that tradeoffs among bioenergy production, crop production, and exurban expansion in a mountainous changing rural landscape vary spatially with climate change over time. If markets develop, bioenergy crops could potentially counter losses of agricultural land to development. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - There is considerable year-to-year variability in the supply of cellulosic biomass used in the production of cellulosic biofuels, yet strategies to mitigate these variations in biofuel development are not well understood. Biorefineries and farmers venturing into the cellulosic biofuel industry will require biomass supply and contracting strategies that can minimize the impact of these large variations. Some studies have proposed biomass pre-treatment and storage to address biomass supply variations. Other studies have used transportation modeling approaches to manage supply variations and select the optimal location of a cellulosic biorefinery. However, storage, pre-treatment, and similar engineering approaches lead to higher costs and have other limitations such as additional infrastructural requirements. There is a gap in understanding how contracting strategies between biorefineries and the biomass suppliers (farmers) can reduce the risks with biomass supply variations. In this study, the contracting structure between biorefineries and biomass suppliers is studied under different market structures for the US Corn Belt. A theoretical framework is then developed to use contracting strategies for mitigating the impact of biomass supply variations. First, the trade-offs between intricately linked components of biomass cost, such as biomass transport, biomass price (incentive) to suppliers, variation in biomass supply, biorefinery size, and alternative feedstock availability are examined. Next, an optimal contracting structure is developed between biorefineries and biomass suppliers using game theoretic analysis. Results show that both the impact of biomass supply variations and the overall biomass cost can be significantly reduced through the use of the optimal contracting strategy between biorefineries and suppliers. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The world is in front of deteriorating liquid fuel reserves at a time when energy demand is exploding. The requirement of energy is growing constantly due to the upturn in population mass and industrial development. Currently, the persistent use of petroleum-based fuels is considered as unsustainable because of the running down supplies and the involvement of these fuels in the addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leading to intensification of global warming. As supply diminishes and expenditures increases, countries will be compelled to employ substitute energy sources e.g. natural gas, coal, hydro electrical and nuclear. In order to accomplish a safe and sound energy source that does not cause ecological destruction, renewable energy sources must be discovered and favorable technologies needs to be established with the passage of time. Biofuel derived from microalgae has the capability for high volume and economical production. It can be carbon unbiased and manufactured intensively on non-agricultural land. The superiority of the fuel product is as good as to petroleum diesel that can be incorporated with negligible change into the current fuel set-up. The use of microalgae as a prospective feedstock source for biofuel production offers many global environmental and socio-economic advantages, namely faster growth rates, high biomass and lipid production. In the past decades, wide-scale screening of naturally occurring algal strains have been done all over the world. This paper analyses the existing position of various microalgae species for biofuel production as well as its comparison with other available feedstocks.

AB  - Genes encoding enzymes involved in the lignin biosynthesis through phenylpropanoid pathway were not only associated with the lignin content, but also related to the abiotic stress resistances. As far as the production of liquid biofuels and cultivation within the marginal land are concerned, switchgrass could be the better candidate to determine the relationship between lower lignin content and physiological function under stress. Caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is a key enzyme for the methylation reaction of lignin biosynthesis. For this purpose, we cloned a CCoAOMT gene from switchgrass and identified its expression patterns under abiotic stresses. The full-length CCoAOMT gene, designated PvCCoAOMT (GenBank accession no. KF041775), was 1005-bp in length, has an opening reading frame of 777 nucleotides encoding a 258-amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of PvCCoAOMT shared a high degree of similarity (up to 98%) with CCoAOMTs from Panicum virgatum allele (BAO20881), Sorghum bicolor (XP002436550) and Zea mays (NP001131288). Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the significant upregulation of PvCCoAOMT was observed in stem tissues at a later stage (24 h) after drought treatment, with the transcript level increasing 33-fold compared that of the controls. Moderate and insignificant inductions of PvCCoAOMT were also observed in both stems and leaves during the later stages after cold (48 h in stems, 12 h in leaves) and mechanical wounding (48 h in stems, 12 h in leaves) treatments, respectively. Our results showed the different expression patterns of PvCCoAOMT in drought, cold and mechanical wounding stresses. PvCCoAOMT can be highly induced by drought and cold stresses, which indicates that it may play a role in plant abiotic stress resistance, particularly in the regulation of drought and cold resistance. © 2016 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Logging residues, which refer to the unused portions of trees cut during logging, are important sources of biomass for the emerging biofuel industry and are critical feedstocks for the first-type biofuel facilities (e.g., corn-ethanol facilities). Logging residues are under-utilized sources of biomass for energetic purposes. To support the scaling-up of the bioenergy industry, it is essential to design cost-effective biofuel supply chains that not only minimize costs, but also consider the biomass quality characteristics. The biomass quality is heavily dependent upon the moisture and the ash contents. Ignoring the biomass quality characteristics and its intrinsic costs may yield substantial economic losses that will only be discovered after operations at a biorefinery have begun. This paper proposes a novel bioenergy supply chain network design model that minimizes operational costs and includes the biomass quality-related costs. The proposed model is unique in the sense that it supports decisions where quality is not unrealistically assumed to be perfect. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proven by assessing a case study in the state of Tennessee, USA. The results demonstrate that the ash and moisture contents of logging residues affect the performance of the supply chain (in monetary terms). Higher-than-target moisture and ash contents incur in additional quality-related costs. The quality-related costs in the optimal solution (with final ash content of 1% and final moisture of 50%) account for 27% of overall supply chain cost. Based on the numeral experimentation, the total supply chain cost increased 7%, on average, for each additional percent in the final ash content. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Plant and algal oils are some of the most energy-dense renewable compounds provided by nature. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the major constituent of plant oils, which can be converted into fatty acid methyl esters commonly known as biodiesel. As one of the most efficient producers of TAGs, photosynthetic microalgae have attracted substantial interest for renewable fuel production. Currently, the big challenge of microalgae based TAGs for biofuels is their high cost compared to fossil fuels. A conundrum is that microalgae accumulate large amounts of TAGs only during stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation and temperature stress, which inevitably will inhibit growth. Thus, a better understanding of why and how microalgae induce TAG biosynthesis under stress conditions would allow the development of engineered microalgae with increased TAG production during conditions optimal for growth. Land plants also synthesize TAGs during stresses and we will compare new findings on environmental stress-induced TAG accumulation in plants and microalgae especially in the well-characterized model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and a biotechnologically relevant genus Nannochloropsis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Increasing demand for biofuel has intensified land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion in Brazil. Assessments of soil quality (SQ) response to this LUC are essential for quantifying and monitoring sustainability of sugarcane production over time. Since there is not a universal methodology for assessing SQ, we conducted a field-study at three sites within the largest sugarcane-producing region of Brazil to develop a SQ index (SQI). The most common LUC scenario (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) was evaluated using six SQI strategies with varying complexities. Thirty eight soil indicators were included in the total dataset. Two minimum datasets were selected: one using principal component analysis (7 indicators) and the other based on expert opinion (5 indicators). Non-linear scoring curves were used to interpret the indicator values. Weighted and non-weighted additive methods were used to combine individual indicator scores into an overall SQI. Long-term conversion from native vegetation to extensive pasture significantly decreased overall SQ. In contrast, conversion from pasture to sugarcane had no significant impact on overall SQ at the regional scale, but site-specific responses were found. In general, sugarcane production improved chemical attributes (i.e., higher macronutrient levels and lower soil acidity); however it has negative effects on physical and biological attributes (i.e., higher soil compaction and structural degradation as well as lower soil organic carbon (SOC), abundance and diversity of macrofauna and microbial activity). Overall, we found that simple, user-friendly strategies were as effective as more complex ones for identifying SQ changes. Therefore, as a protocol for SQ assessments in Brazilian sugarcane areas, we recommend using a small number of indicators (e.g., pH, P, K, Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure -VESS scores and SOC concentration) and proportional weighting to reflect chemical, physical and biological processes within the soil. Our SQ evaluations also suggest that current approaches for expanding Brazilian sugarcane production by converting degraded pasture land to cropland can be a sustainable strategy for meeting increasing biofuel demand. However, management practices that alleviate negative impacts on soil physical and biological indicators must be prioritized within sugarcane producing areas to prevent unintentional SQ degradation over time.

AB  - Deconstruction of the cellulose in plant cell walls is critical for carbon flow through ecosystems and for the production of sustainable cellulosic biofuels. Our understanding of cellulose deconstruction is largely limited to the study of microbes in isolation, but in nature, this process is driven by microbes within complex communities. In Neotropical forests, microbes in leaf-cutter ant refuse dumps are important for carbon turnover. These dumps consist of decaying plant material and a diverse bacterial community, as shown here by electron microscopy. To study the portion of the community capable of cellulose degradation, we performed enrichments on cellulose using material from five Atta colombica refuse dumps. The ability of enriched communities to degrade cellulose varied significantly across refuse dumps. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of enriched samples identified that the community structure correlated with refuse dump and with degradation ability. Overall, samples were dominated by Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria. Half of abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across samples were classified within genera containing known cellulose degraders, including Acidovorax, the most abundant OTU detected across samples, which was positively correlated with cellulolytic ability. A representative Acidovorax strain was isolated, but did not grow on cellulose alone. Phenotypic and compositional analyses of enrichment cultures, such as those presented here, help link community composition with cellulolytic ability and provide insight into the complexity of community-based cellulose degradation. © 2016 Lewin et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were detected in two mesophilic German biogas plants (BGPs) using selective pre-enrichment methods combined with cultivation on CHROMagar media and antibiotic resistance gene screening. Genetic fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed the presence of enterococci isolated by the VRE selective cultivation (67 isolates) in input and output samples of BGPs. In contrast, MRS (44 isolates) were detected in input, but in none of the output samples. Enterococcus isolates showed highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (> 99.8%) to E. lemanii, E. casseliflavus/E. gallinarium or E. devriesei/E. pseudoavium/E. viikkiensis and carried vanA, vanB and/or vanC1 genes. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis VRE were not detected, but isolates closely related to those species (> 99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) were detected by the MRS selective cultivation methods. Staphylococcus isolates shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (> 99.9%) with S. haemolyticus, S. lentus and S. sciuri and carried mecA genes. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were not detected. In summary, manure from livestock husbandry contained both, VRE and MRS. VRE were also detected in output samples, indicating that enterococci with vancomycin resistance genes could be release into the environment by the application of BGP output material as biofertilizers. © FEMS 2016.

AB  - A comparative study was carried out on the growth characteristics of 33 strains of 12 species belonging to genera Acutodesmus (7), Botryococcus (1), Chlorella (5), Chloroidium (2), Desmodesmus (8), Euglena (2), Monoraphidium (2), and Parachlorella (6) from the Microalgae Culture Collection of the Institute of Botany, NAS of Ukraine (IBASU-A). All high biomass-producing strains considered as promising candidates for biofuel production demonstrated active growth (high maximum cell concentration, specific growth rate and productivity). The most promising strains included Acutodesmus dimorphus IBASU-A 251, 252, Desmodesmus magnus IBASU-A 401, D. multivariabilis var. turskensis IBASU-A 398, Chlorella vulgaris IBASU-A 189, 192, and Parachlorella kessleri IBASU-A 444. Their productivity varied from 0.58 g d.w. l-1 to 1.6 g d.w. l-1 per day. In general, the cultivation of these strains is considered both as a potential bioresource of feedstock for biodiesel production and other industrial demands. © Faculty of Oceanography and Geography, University of Gdañsk, Poland.

AB  - Farmers' adoption of cellulosic biofuel feedstock enterprises plays an important role in the future of agriculture and the renewable fuels \industry. However, no set markets currently exist for bioenergy feedstocks outside of very localized geographic locations and farmers may be reluctant to produce the feedstocks without contracts that help mitigate uncertainty and risk. This study examines farmers' willingness to grow switchgrass under contract using a stated choice approach. Data were collected using an enumerated survey of Kansas farmers and analyzed using latent class logistic regression models. Farmers whose primary enterprise is livestock are less inclined to grow switchgrass. Shorter contracts, greater harvest flexibility, crop insurance, and cost-share assistance increase the likelihood that farmers will grow switchgrass for bioenergy production. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines the interrelationship between biofuel consumption and production and several national-scale indicators of socioeconomic and environmental sustainability by using the functional form of the Solow growth model. Panel data ranging from 2000 to 2013 has been used for 12 distinct countries by employing the Panel Generalized Method of Moments (PGMM) technique. The results show that growth factors have a positive impact on biofuel consumption while environmental indicators increase along with the increasing use of biofuels. Potential habitant areas (represented by the forest indicators) are influenced by biofuel consumption. More specifically, as biofuels decrease the arable land in hectares, it also decreases the rate of forest depletion. The results show that GDP per unit of energy used and the amount of forest area are significantly correlated with higher biofuel production while the labor force participation rate significantly decreases biofuel production in the region. There is a significant and negative relationship between net forest depletion and biofuel production. The cause and effect relationship between the variables is estimated through the panel causality Wald exogeniety test. The results indicate a unidirectional causality running from GDP per capita to biofuel consumption and from biofuel consumption to fossil fuel energy consumption. While there is bidirectional causality between GDP per capita and biofuel production in the region, the results emphasize the role of biofuel consumption and production in devising strong policy options for escalating economic growth, a carbon-free economy, and the preservation of biodiversity in a region. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Landfill gas (with methane content of 35-55%) adds significantly to global warming if released to the atmosphere. Under the EU Landfill Directive, all landfill sites are obliged to collect this gas if supplied with biodegradable municipal waste. Landfill gas (LFG) can be (i) flared, (ii) combusted to produce electricity, or (iii) upgraded to biomethane. The last scenario is of special interest. In the USA, LFG is now classified as a cellulosic biofuel; in the EU, there is a mandatory target of 10% share of renewables in transport by 2020. A significant challenge for upgrading LFG to biomethane is the high nitrogen content resulting from negative pressure in the landfill. Cost analyses were conducted to compare three technology solutions for LFG upgrading with accessible LFG flow of 250-500 m3/h. If injection to the transmission grid is considered, then a single-step pressure swing adsorption (PSA) system may be viable. The optimal solution suggested is an on-site service station; the cost of this system (including propane addition and service station) was assessed as e0.84/mn 3 LFG biomethane. This required a subsidy of e0.55/mn 3; this is available in Ireland under the Biofuel Obligation Certificate scheme. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Evaluating biofuel crop yield and its spatial variability on a field scale is important for determining the proper bioenergy crops suitable for specific lands. Within field spatial variability of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), native prairie mix, and corn (Zea mays L.) biomass yield and its relation to soil properties were investigated in 2011 and 2012 at two farms in southwestern Michigan. At all sites and years, the order of biomass yields was corn > switchgrass > native prairie, which was consistent with fertilization rates of the crops. Short stand age of the perennial grass also contributed to the relatively lower yield. At both sites, switchgrass yield was not significantly different between 2011 and 2012, while corn yield was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2011. For switchgrass, within-field variation was found considerably larger than the variation between years or between sites, while the variation between years or sites were comparable or greater than the within field variation for corn or native prairie. Two factors extracted from partial least square regressions (PLSRs) between biomass yield with soil and topographic variables could explain the majority of within field spatial variation for most of the fields in the study. Weight values of predictor variables from PLSRs were found strongly correlated between the 2 yr for a given crop at the same site with correlation coefficients from 0.65 to 0.89, as well as between switchgrass and native prairie at a given site. © 2016 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - The sustainable biorefinery will only be realised with a focus on optimal combinations of feedstock-process technologies-products. For many years, industry has been looking to add value to the by-products of commercial agriculture, forestry and processing. More recently, as concerns about climate change have increased around the globe, the use of biomass as a carbon saving feedstock (compared to fossil feedstock) has led to the implementation of policies to encourage its use for bioenergy, biofuels and bio-based products. As biomass conversion technologies become reality at the commercial scale for a range of diverse end products, the need to establish bespoke biomass supply chains also becomes a reality and industrial developers will face many business-critical decisions on the sourcing of biomass and location of conversion plants (biorefineries). The research presented here, aims to address these issues through the development of a comprehensive database to aid biomass sourcing and conversion decision-making. The database covers origin, logistics, technical suitability (in this case for a proprietary organosolv pre-treatment process) and policy and other risk attributes of the system. The development of key criteria required by the business community to develop biomass supply chains for specific requirements is discussed. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-feed biorefinery design (MPB10) as a solution for producing bioethanol from lignocellulosic residues and simultaneously treating agro-industrial wastes (cheese whey and tequila vinasses). MPB10 exhibits a higher process complexity than simpler conventional lignocellulosic biofuel biorefineries. However, the design increases the overall energy productivity and achieves similar environmental and economic sustainability values than a single-feedstock biorefinery producing lignocellulosic ethanol and electricity (SPB). According to the bi-dimensional sustainability method employed in this work, the most important sustainability indicators were the End-use Energy Ratio (EER) for the environmental domain and Yield together with Total Production Cost (TPC) per energy unit produced for the economic domain. MPB10 scored 6% and 18% higher values for the first two indicators than its SPB counterpart with the added benefit of solving a severe environmental pollution problem. Nevertheless, MPB10 TPC per energy-unit and per litre of bioethanol are 6% and 30% higher than SPB, respectively. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The increased use of forest and wood residues for the production of bioenergy, biofuels, and other bioproducts is essential to enhance the economic performance of forest products industries and reduce environmental impacts. Bi-objective optimization models have been developed recently to support the optimum design of either bioenergy or biofuels supply chains considering economic as well as environmental impacts. In an integrated bioenergy and biofuels supply chain where biofuel producers are also users of the generated energy, the energy flows among co-located supply chain entities affect the environmental and economic objective functions and consequently the optimal design of the supply chain, therefore, the energy flows have to be considered in the optimization model. This type of bi-objective problem has not been modeled in previous studies. In this paper, a bi-objective biorefinery supply chain optimization model for the production of bioenergy and biofuels using forest and wood residues is developed. The model considers energy flows among co-located technologies and is formulated as a multi-period mixed integer program (MIP) that calculates the net present value (NPV) and the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings associated with the biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated through a case study in British Columbia, Canada. © 2015 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Small-scale Jatropha cultivation and biodiesel production have the potential of contributing to local development, energy security, and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. In recent years however, the GHG mitigation potential of biofuel crops is heavily disputed due to the occurrence of a carbon debt, caused by CO2 emissions from biomass and soil after land-use change (LUC). Most published carbon footprint studies of Jatropha report modeled results based on a very limited database. In particular, little empirical data exist on the effects of Jatropha on biomass and soil C stocks. In this study, we used field data to quantify these C pools in three land uses in Mali, that is, Jatropha plantations, annual cropland, and fallow land, to estimate both the Jatropha C debt and its C sequestration potential. Four-year-old Jatropha plantations hold on average 2.3 Mg C ha-1 in their above- and belowground woody biomass, which is considerably lower compared to results from other regions. This can be explained by the adverse growing conditions and poor local management. No significant soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration could be demonstrated after 4 years of cultivation. While the conversion of cropland to Jatropha does not entail significant C losses, the replacement of fallow land results in an average C debt of 34.7 Mg C ha-1, mainly caused by biomass removal (73%). Retaining native savannah woodland trees on the field during LUC and improved crop management focusing on SOC conservation can play an important role in reducing Jatropha's C debt. Although planting Jatropha on degraded, carbon-poor cropland results in a limited C debt, the low biomass production, and seed yield attained on these lands reduce Jatropha's potential to sequester C and replace fossil fuels. Therefore, future research should mainly focus on increasing Jatropha's crop productivity in these degraded lands. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Agro-economic modeling studies have shown that indirect land-use change (iLUC) emissions of first-generation biofuels can be significant, reducing or eliminating the climate change mitigating potential of these fuels. Recognizing this, proposed amendments to the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) would require reporting iLUC emissions of biofuels. The objective of this paper was to provide additional evidence of the iLUC emissions of oilseed rape (OSR) biodiesel using a noneconomic modeling approach called the causal descriptive (CD) model. The CD model originally developed by E4tech (A Causal Descriptive Approach to Modelling the GHG Emissions Associated with the Indirect Land Use Impacts of Biofuels, 2010, E4tech, London, UK) is one of the first noneconomic modeling approaches used for estimating indirect land-use change (iLUC). Using the E4tech CD modeling framework, we refine assumptions for key parameters such as yields in marginal land, displacement of OSR oil by palm oil, land availability for OSR expansion in the EU, imports of OSR from Canada and Ukraine, and palm oil expansion on peatland and thereby estimate iLUC GHG emissions for a likely scenario (Central Scenario). We find GHG emissions of OSR biodiesel to be 57 g CO2 eq./MJ for the Central Scenario. To capture the possible range of iLUC GHG emissions, we calculate iLUC GHG emissions by changing assumptions for the Central Scenario and land-use emission factors. We find that GHG emissions of OSR biodiesel may vary from 18 to 101 CO2 eq./MJ. The results provide additional evidence supporting the previous conclusions derived from agro-economic modeling studies that iLUC emissions of food-based biofuels can be expected to be significant compared to potential savings. Hence, to achieve meaningful GHG reductions from biofuel use and avoid policy failure, it is important that the EU should take concrete policy action to target support for biofuels toward those with the lowest expected iLUC emissions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate whether chilling tolerance of C4 photosynthesis in Miscanthus can be transferred to sugarcane by hybridization. Net leaf CO2 uptake (Asat) and the maximum operating efficiency of photosystem II (ФPSII) were measured in warm conditions (25 °C/20 °C), and then during and following a chilling treatment of 10 °C/5 °C for 11 day in controlled environment chambers. Two of three hybrids (miscanes), 'US 84-1058' and 'US 87-1019', did not differ significantly from the chilling tolerant M. ×giganteus 'Illinois' (Mxg), for Asat, and ΦPSII measured during chilling. For Mxg grown at 10 °C/5 °C for 11 days, Asat was 4.4 μmol m-2 s-1, while for miscane 'US 84-1058' and 'US 87-1019', Asat was 5.7 and 3.5 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively. Miscanes 'US 84-1058' and 'US 87-1019' and Mxg had significantly higher rates of Asat during chilling than three tested sugarcanes. A third miscane showed lower rates than Mxg during chilling, but recovered to higher rates than sugarcane upon return to warm conditions. Chilling tolerance of 'US 84-1058' was further confirmed under autumn field conditions in southern Illinois. The selected chilling tolerant miscanes have particular value for biomass feedstock and biofuel production and at the same time they can be a starting point for extending sugarcane's range to colder climates. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The production and use of biofuels have increased rapidly in recent decades. Bioethanol derived from sugarcane has become a promising alternative to fossil fuel for use in automotive vehicles. The 'savings' calculated from the carbon footprint of this energy source still generates many questions related to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from sugarcane cultivation. We quantified N2O emissions from soil covered with different amounts of sugarcane straw and determined the direct N2O emission factors of nitrogen fertilizers (applied at the planting furrows and in the topdressing) and the by-products of sugarcane processing (filter cake and vinasse) applied to sugarcane fields. The results showed that the presence of different amounts of sugarcane straw did not change N2O emissions relative to bare soil (control). N-fertilizer increased N2O emissions from the soil, especially when urea was used, both at the planting furrow (plant cane) and during the regrowth process (ratoon cane) in relation to ammonium nitrate. The emission factor for N-fertilizer was 0.46 ± 0.33%. The field application of filter cake and vinasse favored N2O emissions from the soil, the emission factor for vinasse was 0.65 ± 0.29%, while filter cake had a lower emission factor of 0.13 ± 0.04%. The experimentally obtained N2O emission factors associated with sugarcane cultivation, specific to the major sugarcane production region of the Brazil, were lower than those considered by the IPCC. Thus, the results of this study should contribute to bioethanol carbon footprint calculations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study models and quantifies spatially referenced probability distributions of corn residue cost and assesses their influence on comparative advantages of different areas of the Corn Belt to attract biofuel plants. Results suggest that irrigated areas of the Corn Belt, despite their relatively low planting density, may result more attractive than some of their rainfed counterparts in the eastern Corn Belt due to low risk in feedstock cost resulting from stability of yields. Therefore, agricultural districts in the Great Plains of the US may not need to pay high subsidies to compete with those in the eastern Corn Belt to attract biofuel firms. Policy restrictions on irrigation due to concerns over groundwater depletion may, however, diminish the relative comparative advantage of the irrigated Corn Belt for biofuel production. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A reason for much pessimism about the environmental benefits of today's biofuels, essentially corn and sugarcane ethanol, is the so-called indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions associated with expanding biofuel production. While there exist several simulation-based estimates of indirect emissions, the empirical basis underlying key input parameters to such simulations is not beyond doubt, while empirical verification of indirect emissions is hard. Regardless, regulators have adopted global warming intensity ratings for biofuels based on those simulations and in some case are holding regulated firms accountable for (some forms of) leakage. Suffice to say that both the estimates of and the approach to regulating leakage are controversial. The objective of this study is therefore to review a wider economic in order to identify a broader set of policy options for mitigating emissions leakage. We find that controlling leakage by affixing responsibility to regulated firms lacks support in the broader literature, which emphasizes alternative approaches. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We present the first assessment of the impact of land use change (LUC) to second-generation (2G) bioenergy crops on ecosystem services (ES) resolved spatially for Great Britain (GB). A systematic approach was used to assess available evidence on the impacts of LUC from arable, semi-improved grassland or woodland/forest, to 2G bioenergy crops, for which a quantitative 'threat matrix' was developed. The threat matrix was used to estimate potential impacts of transitions to either Miscanthus, short-rotation coppice (SRC, willow and poplar) or short-rotation forestry (SRF). The ES effects were found to be largely dependent on previous land uses rather than the choice of 2G crop when assessing the technical potential of available biomass with a transition from arable crops resulting in the most positive effect on ES. Combining these data with constraint masks and available land for SRC and Miscanthus (SRF omitted from this stage due to lack of data), south-west and north-west England were identified as areas where Miscanthus and SRC could be grown, respectively, with favourable combinations of economic viability, carbon sequestration, high yield and positive ES benefits. This study also suggests that not all prospective planting of Miscanthus and SRC can be allocated to agricultural land class (ALC) ALC 3 and ALC 4 and suitable areas of ALC 5 are only minimally available. Beneficial impacts were found on 146 583 and 71 890 ha when planting Miscanthus or SRC, respectively, under baseline planting conditions rising to 293 247 and 91 318 ha, respectively, under 2020 planting scenarios. The results provide an insight into the interplay between land availability, original land uses, bioenergy crop type and yield in determining overall positive or negative impacts of bioenergy cropping on ecosystems services and go some way towards developing a framework for quantifying wider ES impacts of this important LUC. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Because soil microbes drive many of the processes underpinning ecosystem services provided by soils, understanding how cropping systems affect soil microbial communities is important for productive and sustainable management. We characterized and compared soil microbial communities under restored prairie and three potential cellulosic biomass crops (corn, switchgrass, and mixed prairie grasses) in two spatial experimental designs - side-by-side plots where plant communities were in their second year since establishment (i.e., intensive sites) and regionally distributed fields where plant communities had been in place for at least 10 years (i.e., extensive sites). We assessed microbial community structure and composition using lipid analysis, pyrosequencing of rRNA genes (targeting fungi, bacteria, archaea, and lower eukaryotes), and targeted metagenomics of nifH genes. For the more recently established intensive sites, soil type was more important than plant community in determining microbial community structure, while plant community was the more important driver of soil microbial communities for the older extensive sites where microbial communities under corn were clearly differentiated from those under switchgrass and restored prairie. Bacterial and fungal biomasses, especially biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, were higher under perennial grasses and restored prairie, suggesting a more active carbon pool and greater microbial processing potential, which should be beneficial for plant acquisition and ecosystem retention of carbon, water, and nutrients. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy crops are expected to provide biomass to replace fossil resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are of primary importance. The aim of this study was to measure changes in SOC stocks in bioenergy cropping systems comparing perennial (Miscanthus × giganteus and switchgrass), semi-perennial (fescue and alfalfa), and annual (sorghum and triticale) crops, all established after arable crops. The soil was sampled at the start of the experiment and 5 or 6 years later. SOC stocks were calculated at equivalent soil mass, and δ13C measurements were used to calculate changes in new and old SOC stocks. Crop residues found in soil at the time of SOC measurements represented 3.5-7.2 t C ha-1 under perennial crops vs. 0.1-0.6 t C ha-1 for the other crops. During the 5-year period, SOC concentrations under perennial crops increased in the surface layer (0-5 cm) and slightly declined in the lower layers. Changes in δ13C showed that C inputs were mainly located in the 0-18 cm layer. In contrast, SOC concentrations increased over time under semi-perennial crops throughout the old ploughed layer (ca. 0-33 cm). SOC stocks in the old ploughed layer increased significantly over time under semi-perennials with a mean increase of 0.93 ± 0.28 t C ha-1 yr-1, whereas no change occurred under perennial or annual crops. New SOC accumulation was higher for semi-perennial than for perennial crops (1.50 vs. 0.58 t C ha-1 yr-1, respectively), indicating that the SOC change was due to a variation in C input rather than a change in mineralization rate. Nitrogen fertilization rate had no significant effect on SOC stocks. This study highlights the interest of comparing SOC changes over time for various cropping systems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Analysis of commodity chains has provided important insights on how power, resource and market access mediate the distribution of benefits and risks. Given this analytical potential, Commodity Chain Analysis (CCA) is now being applied to the study of biofuels and carbon markets to gain systematic insight into the circumstances, relationships and transformations involved in their production and exchange. By building on and adapting this approach to three distinct case studies (biofuels in Madagascar and forest carbon in Cambodia and Laos), this article contributes new insights on the emergence of value within market environmentalism. The analysis highlights methodological challenges in applying CCA to commodified forms of nature, and the significance of knowledge and value negotiations. All three cases illustrate that it remains highly uncertain whether or not market exchange can ultimately be realized. As in the case of traditional commodities, pre-existing conditions of power and access shape modes of production and network configuration. Parallel and intersecting commodity networks (e.g. for land and timber) also require us to think beyond the traditional single-commodity focus. Thus, the authors call for an expanded analytical focus in applying CCA to non-material 'green' commodities which places greater emphasis on value negotiations and connections within new 'commodity frontiers'. © 2016 International Institute of Social Studies.

AB  - Economic, agronomic, and biophysical drivers affect global land use, so all three influences need to be considered in evaluating economically optimal allocations of the world’s land resources. A dynamic, forward-looking optimization framework applied over the course of the coming century shows that although some deforestation is optimal in the near term, in the absence of climate change regulation, the desirability of further deforestation is eliminated by mid-century. Although adverse productivity shocks from climate change have a modest effect on global land use, such shocks combined with rapid growth in energy prices lead to significant deforestation and higher greenhouse gas emissions than in the baseline. Imposition of a global greenhouse gas emissions constraint further heightens the competition for land, as fertilizer use declines and land-based mitigation strategies expand. However, anticipation of the constraint largely dilutes its environmental effectiveness, as deforestation accelerates prior to imposition of the target. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Growing food crops for biofuel on productive agricultural lands may become less viable as requirements to feed a growing human population increase. This has increased interest in growing cellulosic biofuel feedstocks on marginal lands. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a warm-season perennial, is a viable bioenergy crop candidate because it produces high yields on marginal lands under low fertility conditions. In other studies, switchgrass dry matter (DM) yields on marginal croplands varied from 5.0 to 10.0 Mg ha−1 annually. West Virginia contains immense areas of reclaimed surface mined lands that could support a switchgrass-based biofuel industry, but yield data on these lands are lacking. Field experiments were established in 2008 to determine yields of three switchgrass cultivars on two West Virginia mine sites. One site reclaimed with topsoil and municipal sludge produced biomass yields of 19.0 Mg DM ha−1 for Cave-in-Rock switchgrass after the sixth year, almost double the varieties Shawnee and Carthage, at 10.0 and 5.7 Mg ha−1, respectively. Switchgrass yields on another site with no topsoil were 1.0 Mg ha−1 after the sixth year, with little variation among cultivars. A second experiment was conducted at two other mine sites with a layer of topsoil over gray overburden. Cave-in-Rock was seeded with fertilizer applications of 0, 34, and 68 kg N-P2O5-K2O ha−1. After the third year, the no fertilizer treatment averaged biomass yields of 0.3 Mg ha−1, while responses to the other two rates averaged 1.1 and 2.0 Mg ha−1, respectively. Fertilization significantly increased yields on reclaimed mine soils. Where mine soil fertility was good, yields were similar to those reported on agricultural soils in the Northeastern USA. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a warm-season perennial grass, is an important bioenergy crop candidate because it produces high biomass yields on marginal lands and on reclaimed surface mined sites. In companion studies, dry matter (DM) yields for Cave-in-Rock, Shawnee, and Carthage cultivars varied from 4.2 to 13.0 Mg ha−1averaged over 6 years at the reclaimed Hampshire site, and fertilization increased yields of Cave-in-Rock at Black Castle and Coal Mac sites from 0.3 to 2 Mg ha−1 during the first 3 years. The objective of these experiments was to compare the impacts of cultivar and soil amendments on biomass quality and theoretical ethanol production of switchgrass grown on surface mines with differing soil characteristics. Biomass quality was determined for fiber, ash, lignin, digestibility, and carbohydrate contents via near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and carbohydrates were used to calculate theoretical ethanol yield (TEY; L Mg−1) and multiplied by biomass yield to calculate theoretical ethanol production (TEP; L ha−1). Cultivars at the Hampshire site did not differ in TEY and ranged from 426 to 457 L Mg−1. Theoretical ethanol production from Cave-in-Rock at Hampshire was 7350 L ha−1, which was higher than other cultivars because of its greater biomass production. This TEP was higher than in other studies which predicted 4000 to 5000 L ha−1. At the Black Castle and Coal Mac sites, fertilizer applications slightly affected biomass quality of switchgrass and TEY, but provided greater TEP as a function of increased yield. Similar to other findings, total switchgrass biomass production has more impact than compositional differences on TEP, so maximizing biomass production is critical for maximizing potential biofuel production. With appropriate soil substrates, fertilization, planning, and management, large areas of reclaimed surface mines can be converted to switchgrass stands to produce high biomass quality and yields to support a bioethanol industry. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - A biorefinery may produce multiple fuels from more than one feedstock. The ability of these fuels to qualify as one of the four types of biofuels under the US Renewable Fuel Standard and to achieve a low carbon intensity score under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard can be strongly influenced by the approach taken to their life cycle analysis (LCA). For example, in facilities that may co-produce corn grain and corn stover ethanol, the ethanol production processes can share the combined heat and power (CHP) that is produced from the lignin and liquid residues from stover ethanol production. We examine different LCA approaches to corn grain and stover ethanol production considering different approaches to CHP treatment. In the baseline scenario, CHP meets the energy demands of stover ethanol production first, with additional heat and electricity generated sent to grain ethanol production. The resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for grain and stover ethanol are 57 and 25 g-CO2eq/MJ, respectively, corresponding to a 40 and 74 % reduction compared to the GHG emissions of gasoline. We illustrate that emissions depend on allocation of burdens of CHP production and corn farming, along with the facility capacities. Co-product handling techniques can strongly influence LCA results and should therefore be transparently documented. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - This article proposes a fundamental methodological shift in the modelling of policy interventions for sustainability transitions in order to account for complexity (e.g. self-reinforcing mechanisms, such as technology lock-ins, arising from multi-agent interactions) and agent heterogeneity (e.g. differences in consumer and investment behaviour arising from income stratification). We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative, optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual influences among agents (multi-agent interactions) and capture related self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3) interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and (4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology is subsequently discussed by reference to four specific applications relating to each of the above areas: the diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. In conclusion, the article calls for a fundamental methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with that of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the impact of sustainability policies. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - In the United States and elsewhere, climate change, peak oil, and other political and socioeconomic factors have spurred the development of alternate energy sources. Biofuels, derived from living organisms rather than petroleum-laden rock, are the focus of current energy research. To better understand the future composition and sustainability of biofuels within the U.S. energy portfolio the authors conducted an environmental scanning methodology and futures analysis. The authors developed a model representing the relationships between many important economic, environmental, political, and social factors to illuminate potential future trends in cellulosic and algal biofuel over the next twenty years. This innovative, flexible approach compared the sustainability of biofuel sources in many areas over time. The resulting analysis identifies environmental degradation as the most influential adverse factor. The environmental scanning exercise suggests that cellulosic biofuel may be a more sustainable option than algal biofuel under the model's assumptions. This analysis yields insightful trends that predict the sustainability of two biofuel sources over the next twenty years in relation to other important socio-politico-economic factors. In the future, this methodology can be applied to other biofuel sources and energy problems. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Co-digestion of swine manure and crude glycerine from biodiesel production has been successfully attempted by many authors reporting substantial increments in biogas production. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been questioned recently. The addition of glycerol may cause an improvement in biogas production but at the expense of disturbing the degradation of manure. In the present paper, the organic transformations undergone in the anaerobic digestion of pig manure at increasing amounts of glycerine (2-8 % (v/v)) were analysed using spectroscopy techniques (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)). An increase in biogas production was observed with the addition of glycerine up to 8 %, resulting in a volumetric production of methane per litre of reactor (Lr) of 1.4 L CH4/Lr d. However, the subsequent failure of the system was observed at this glycerine content due to the inhibitory effect caused by high H2S concentration and foam formation. FTIR and 1H NMR analysis performed on digestate samples showed that the addition of the co-substrate also caused the preferential degradation of glycerine and accumulation of proteins and aliphatic compounds. A post-stabilisation stage was necessary to complete the degradation process. Modifications in organic matter continued under this last stage although in the previous digestion period, a competition for substrate between sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogens was observed. © 2016 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Leaves of fast-growing, woody bioenergy crops often emit volatile organic compounds (VOC). Some reactive VOC (especially isoprene) play a key role in climate forcing and may negatively affect local air quality. We monitored the seasonal exchange of VOC using the eddy covariance technique in a 'coppiced' poplar plantation. The complex interactions of VOC fluxes with climatic and physiological variables were also explored by using an artificial neural network (Self Organizing Map). Isoprene and methanol were the most abundant VOC emitted by the plantation. Rapid development of the canopy (and thus of the leaf area index, LAI) was associated with high methanol emissions and high rates of gross primary production (GPP) since the beginning of the growing season, while the onset of isoprene emission was delayed. The highest emissions of isoprene, and of isoprene photo-oxidation products (Methyl Vinyl Ketone and Methacrolein, iox), occurred on the hottest and sunniest days, when GPP and evapotranspiration were highest, and formaldehyde was significantly deposited. Canopy senescence enhanced the exchange of oxygenated VOC. The accuracy of methanol and isoprene emission simulations with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature increased by applying a function to modify their basal emission factors, accounting for seasonality of GPP or LAI. • Some reactive volatile organic compounds (VOC) (especially isoprene) emitted in the atmosphere from leaves of widespread fast-growing woody bioenergy crops play a key role in climate forcing and local air quality. • Eddy covariance VOC emission and deposition fluxes were monitored in a 'coppiced' poplar plantation during an entire growing season, and their complex interactions with climatic and physiological variables also including canopy structural traits were explored by using the Self-organizing Map. • Rapid development of a canopy (and thus of leaf area index, LAI) was associated with high methanol emissions and high rates of gross primary production (GPP) since the beginning of the growing season, while the onset of isoprene emission was delayed. • The highest emissions of isoprene, and of isoprene photooxidation products (methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, iox) occurred on the hottest and sunniest days, when also GPP and evapotranspiration were highest and formaldehyde was significantly deposited. • The accuracy of methanol and isoprene emission simulations with the MEGAN model increased by applying a function to modify their basal emission factors, accounting for seasonality of GPP or LAI. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The invasive species Eupatorium adenophorum is known to influence stand structure and wildfire the hazard in forests. In the current work, we quantitatively examined fire effects in invaded and uninvaded plots in southwestern Sichuan Province, China, with five different forest sites that had different types of dominant species: Pinus yunnanensis, P. yunnanensis–Quercus spp., Keteleeria fortunei, K. fortunei–Quercus spp., and Eucalyptus robusta. We compared the fuel chemistry (moisture, ash, heat value, and ignition point) and fire severity (flame length, fire intensity) under three burning conditions between the invaded and uninvaded plots in each forest sites, and then analyzed the results using multivariate response permutation procedures (MRPP). The burning conditions included: low (fine fuel moisture of 15 % and 5 km/h windspeed), moderate (fine fuel moisture of 10 % and 15 km/h windspeed), and extreme (fine fuel moisture of 5 % and 30 km/h windspeed). With all five sites, the fire severity and fuel loads were clearly significantly higher at the invaded sites. Fire severity was also intensified in the invaded coniferous sites compared to their mixed forest sites. These results indicate that biological invasions may increase the surface fire severity, perhaps through an increase in the heat value, and fuel loads, while reducing the moisture, ash, and ignition point of the understory herbaceous. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The implications of using co-products from the supply chains of human food and biofuels in pig diets for the environmental impacts of Canadian pig systems were examined using Life Cycle Assessment. The functional unit was 1 kg expected carcass weight (ECW) and environmental impacts were calculated as: Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Global Warming Potential (GWP), Nonrenewable Energy Use (NRE) and Nonrenewable Resource Use (NRRU). Maximum inclusion limits which would not negatively affect animal performance were defined for: meat meal (55), bakery meal (87), corn DDGS (261) and wheat shorts (291) (numbers in brackets represent average across all feeding phases in g/kg as fed). Nutritionally equivalent grower/finisher (G/F) diets containing maximum inclusions of these co-products were formulated individually. These diets were compared to a simple control diet based on corn and soya meal using 1000 parallel Monte-Carlo simulations. The maximum inclusion of meat meal reduced NRRU and NRE per kg ECW by 9% and 8% compared to the control (P < 0.001), EP and AP increased by 10% and 7% (P < 0.001), with no significant change in GWP. Maximum inclusion of bakery meal was found to reduce all environmental impacts for all categories modelled by <5% (P < 0.001). Maximum inclusion of corn DDGS in the G/F diets resulted in relatively large increases in NRRU (56%), NRE (48%) and GWP (16%) (all P < 0.001). The maximum corn DDGS diet caused a mean reduction of <1% in AP (P = 0.01) and did not significantly alter EP. Maximum inclusion of wheat shorts reduced GWP, NRE and NRRE by >10% (P < 0.001) but did not significantly alter EP or AP. The environmental impact implications for pig farming systems of high inclusion levels of co-products in G/F diets formulated for economic goals (i.e. least cost per kg live weight gain), were also modelled for the first time. Four further G/F diets were formulated on a least cost basis at 100%, 97.5%, 95% and 92.5% of the energy density required for maximum feed efficiency. Minimum nutrient to net energy ratios were defined in the formulation rules to ensure the first limiting resource of all diets for growth was energy. The least energy dense diet contained the highest level of co-products (294 g/kg as fed) and the most energy dense diet contained the least (108 g/kg as fed). The least energy dense diet reduced NRE and NRRU by 9% (P < 0.001) and GWP by 4% (P = 0.018) when compared to the diet designed for maximum feed efficiency, but increased AP and EP by <1% (P < 0.001). The other two intermediate levels of energy density followed the same pattern but the effects were not linear. The increased inclusion of co-products in G/F diets formulated for economic goals can produce environmental impact reductions for some environmental impact categories in pig farming systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Here we report recombinant expression and activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGA1 functioning in parallel with the native Nannochloropsis salina genes. Expression of DGA1 shifted the chain length distribution of fatty acids produced and reflected an oleoyl-CoA substrate preference. Effect on the total FAME content was moderate and elevated by a maximum of 38%. Expression of the DGA1 transgene varied throughout the culture life cycle and evidence of growth dependent environmental silencing of the transgene was observed. This is to our knowledge the first example of silencing and subsequent resetting in a transgenic microalga. Results from this study add valuable insights into the efficacy of algal genetic engineering and use of these microorganisms as bio-platforms for chemical manufacture. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other green algae have potential for generating biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and other commercially valuable products. This potential could be improved by increasing the rate of growth and biomass accumulation. Overexpression of cyanobacterial fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cyanoFBPase-II), an enzyme that catalyzes an irreversible step in the Calvin cycle, improves growth and biomass accumulation in higher plants, so we set out to determine if overexpression of Chlamydomonas FBPase (CrFBPase) has the same effect in C. reinhardtii by using a chloroplast expression system. To this end, we generated a chloroplast expression vector that includes the C. reinhardtii FBP1 coding region synthesized with C. reinhardtii chloroplast codon-bias, flanked with psbD and psbA 5' and 3' regulatory sequences, respectively, and obtained transformants that integrated the vector properly into the chloroplast genome. CpFBP1 transformants accumulated increased levels of CrFBPase protein and extracts contained ~1.4-fold-increased levels of FBPase enzyme activity compared to the wild type strain. Surprisingly, we found that under photoautotrophic growth conditions and/or with elevated CO2 levels, this 40% elevation in FBPase activity had a negative effect overall on growth rate and biomass production. These results suggest that unlike the situation in higher plants, FBPase probably does not catalyze a rate-limiting step in the C. reinhardtii Calvin cycle. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the flammability of species in fire-prone or fire-dependent ecosystems is necessary for modeling and predicting ecosystem dynamics. Wiregrass (Aristida stricta syn. A. beyrichiana), a keystone perennial bunchgrass, is a dominant groundcover species in southeastern United States pine savannas. Although wiregrass flammability as a driver of pine savanna fire regimes is a fundamental paradigm in pine savanna dynamics, no studies have quantified its fuel structure and flammability at the individual bunchgrass level. We studied wiregrass flammability at the Aiken Gopher Tortoise Heritage Preserve in Aiken County, South Carolina, USA. We linked tussock fuel structure characteristics (total biomass, live:dead biomass, mass of perched litter and pine needles, moisture content, and bulk density) to flammability (flaming duration, smoldering duration, and flame length). Flame length was strongly and positively related to wiregrass biomass. Pine needles and other litter fuels perched on wiregrass tussocks were not related to flame length, but increased the duration of flaming and smoldering. Within the ranges evaluated, neither fire weather (relative humidity, wind speed, and air temperature) nor fuel moisture significantly affected tussock flammability. Our results indicate that different fuel structural properties drive separate aspects of wiregrass flammability. Together with litter from pines and other groundcover shrubs and trees, wiregrass modifies fire behavior locally, potentially influencing ecosystem dynamics at larger scales. These results have strong implications for southeastern pine savannas and more broadly where grass-dominated vegetation influences fire regimes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Effluent sludge from an anaerobic digester was used as a source of nitrogen, phosphate, sulfur, and other nutrients in the culture medium of ethanol production by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several pretreatments (mechanical, chemical, thermal, and thermo-chemical) were performed on the anaerobic digested sludge (ADS) to make the nutrients accessible to the yeast cells. Preliminary experiments revealed that S. cerevisiae is not able to assimilate the carbon content of the ADS. However, when glucose was added to the medium, ethanol production was observed. The yield of ethanol using untreated ADS was only 10 % of the theoretical yield, but alkaline pretreatment improved it up to 43 %. By separating the hydrolysate of alkaline-treated ADS from the suspended solids, the ethanol yield from the supernatant was further improved up to 65 % of theoretical yield. Alkaline-treated ADS exhibited competitive performance with the mixture of yeast extract and mineral salts in ethanol fermentation. © 2015, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - This paper uses a socio-technical approach to explore why the transition towards modern bioenergy has achieved success in some segments and/or countries but not in others. We reflect on the availability of initial socio-technical resources in the form of established platforms, policy motivations, and the roles of different stakeholders. We analyse how socio-technical networks evolved over time in response to enabling policies and interest groups as well as opposition groups in four different bioenergy segments: solid biomass for district heating in Sweden, charcoal for iron and steel industry in Brazil, and ethanol for transport in both countries. The Swedish and Brazilian experiences illustrate the importance of coordinating policies between local and national levels and across sectors in order to advance modern bioenergy platforms. The focus on Sweden - an EU and global bioenergy pioneer - along with Brazil - a recognised global biofuels leader - helps to illustrate the linkages to regional and global markets that are important for European energy transitions. The analysis also emphasizes the need to look beyond the energy sector, considering actors and stakeholders' interests at large, as well as broad boundaries for socio-technical regimes. Our analysis draws on the established literature concerning socio-technical transitions, innovation systems and systems approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assessed the management of the organic household waste in the Danish-German border region and points out major differences between the systems and their potential effects on the environment using life cycle assessment (LCA). The treatment of organic waste from households in the Danish-German border region is very different on each side of the border; the Danish region only uses incineration for the treatment of organic household waste while the German region includes combined biogas production and composting, mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) and incineration. Data on all parts of the organic waste treatment was collected including waste composition data and data from treatment facilities and their respective energy systems. Based on that the organic waste management systems in the border region were modelled using the EASETECH waste management LCA-model. The main output is a life cycle assessment showing large differences in the environmental performance of the two different regions with the Danish region performing better in 10 out of 14 impact categories. Furthermore, the importance of the substituted district heating systems was investigated showing an impact up to 34% of the entire system for one impact category and showing large difference between each heating system substituted, e.g. in "Global Warming" the impact was from -16 to -1.1 milli person equivalent/tonne treated waste from substitution of centralised hard coal and decentralised natural gas, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The EU has increasingly turned to PTAs (Preferential Trade Agreements) to spread environmental norms internationally. We argue that the rationale for this strategy is to be found in the tensions between the rigidity of the domestic dynamics of positive integration in the EU and the increased bindingness of WTO negative integration commitments. Consensual decision-making procedures in the EU both drive the stringency of environmental regulation and make it resistant to change. When such environmental standards are challenged in the WTO, incentives arise for the EU to push for international environmental rules that can grant immunity from WTO legal challenges. When changing WTO rules is not an option, PTAs become a valid alternative. We illustrate the plausibility of our argument through an in-depth case study of the EU's attempt to include provisions defining environmental sustainability criteria for the production of biofuels in the ongoing negotiations for a PTA with Malaysia. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Syngas fermentation is an anaerobic bioprocess that could become industrially relevant as a biorefinery platform for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. An important prerequisite for commercialization is adequate performance of the biocatalyst (i.e., sufficiently high production rate, titer, selectivity, yield, and stability of the fermentation). Here, we compared the performance of three potential candidate Clostridium strains in syngas-to-ethanol conversion: Clostridium ljungdahlii PETC, C. ljungdahlii ERI-2, and Clostridium autoethanogenum JA1-1. Experiments were conducted in a two-stage, continuously fed syngas-fermentation system that had been optimized for stable ethanol production. The two C. ljungdahlii strains performed similar to each other but different from C. autoethanogenum. When the pH value was lowered from 5.5 to 4.5 to induce solventogenesis, the cell-specific carbon monoxide and hydrogen consumption (similar rate for all strains at pH 5.5), severely decreased in JA1-1, but hardly in PETC and ERI-2. Ethanol production in strains PETC and ERI-2 remained relatively stable while the rate of acetate production decreased, resulting in a high ethanol/acetate ratio, but lower overall productivities. With JA1-1, lowering the pH severely lowered rates of both ethanol and acetate production; and as a consequence, no pronounced shift to solventogenesis was observed. The highest overall ethanol production rate of 0.301g·L-1·h-1 was achieved with PETC at pH 4.5 with a corresponding 19g/L (1.9%w/v) ethanol concentration and a 5.5:1 ethanol/acetate molar ratio. A comparison of the genes relevant for ethanol metabolism revealed differences between C. ljungdahlii and C. autoethanogenum that, however, did not conclusively explain the different phenotypes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper aims at estimating the perennial crop potential regarding uses like bio-fuels instead of food or feed ones. A perennial yearly harvested crop, namely the miscanthus, is integrated in the European agricultural supply AROPAj model. That requires the knowledge of its yield growth function, with a yield potential over time statistically adjusted to the yield of traditional crops. This allows us to estimate the cycle length, the average yearly yield and the discounted cost through the Faustmann rule adapted to the case of a perennial yearly harvested crop. The analysis covers a large part of the European Union and provides a land use change assessment estimated when the miscanthus yield potential varies. We show that the cellulosic biofuels compete with food and feed production as well, by the way of complex interactions and trades-off between marketed concentrates and on-farm consumed crops related to animal breeding. The "food, feed and fuels" analysis is widened by a spatial downscaling analysis applied to a series of French regions which differ in terms of farming systems. At the European scale, cereals and oilseeds areas are relatively more affected when miscanthus reaches high levels of performance. In spite of livestock inertia, there is a significant change in terms of feed share between on-farm consumed cereals and marketed concentrates. Regarding greenhouse gas emissions, an increasing miscanthus yield potential leads to a considerable decrease in N2O losses and to a slight abatement of CH4 emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sequential anaerobic-aerobic digestion has been demonstrated to be effective for enhanced sludge stabilization, in terms of increased solid reduction and improvement of sludge dewaterability. In this study, we propose a modified version of the sequential anaerobic-aerobic digestion process by operating the aerobic step under mesophilic conditions (T = 37 °C), in order to improve the aerobic degradation kinetics of soluble and particulate chemical oxygen demand (COD). Process performance has been assessed in terms of "classical parameters" such as volatile solids (VS) removal, biogas production, COD removal, nitrogen species, and polysaccharide and protein fate. The aerobic step was operated under intermittent aeration to achieve nitrogen removal. Aerobic mesophilic conditions consistently increased VS removal, providing 32% additional removal vs. 20% at 20. °C. Similar results were obtained for nitrogen removal, increasing from 64% up to 99% at the higher temperature. Improved sludge dewaterability was also observed with a capillary suction time decrease of ~. 50% during the mesophilic aerobic step. This finding may be attributable to the decreased protein content in the aerobic digested sludge. The post-aerobic digestion exerted a positive effect on the reduction of microbial indicators while no consistent improvement of hygienization related to the increased temperature was observed. The techno-economic analysis of the proposed digestion layout showed a net cost saving for sludge disposal estimated in the range of 28-35% in comparison to the single-phase anaerobic digestion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To improve world energy security, lignocellulosic substrates are being used to generate inexpensive renewable biofuel. Pretreatment of these biomasses is pre-requisite to obtain fermentable sugar for production of ethanol. Crystallinity, degree of polymerization, particle size, and accessible surface area of biomass often limits decrystallization of cellulose and depolymerization of hemicellulose during pretreatment. Various pretreatment technologies employed to diverse biomasses, their mechanism of action, feasibility and practicability for production of bioethanol and other bio-based products has been compared in this article. Intelligent combinatorial pretreatment approaches such as microwave-acid-alkali, ultrasound-surfactant, supercritical carbon dioxide and hot water-acid have been applied to increase sugar yield from a wide variety of feedstocks such as sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane top, corn stover, and switchgrass. Biological pretreatment using white, brown and soft rot fungi are attractive in terms of being cost effective, low energy requiring, and eco-friendly. Emphasis to optimize integrated biorefining processes, delineate pretreatment chemistries and their impact on cellulosic biomass to obtain greater yield of fuels and co-products are the highlights of this article. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The present study describes a simple process for recovering a stream of products sequentially including bioethanol from the fresh biomass of the red seaweed Gracilaria corticata. From processing of 100 g fresh biomass (~12.2 g dry), 166 ± 3 μg/g R-phycoerythrin, 126 ± 4 μg/g R-phycocyanin can be realized on fresh weight basis, and 1.41 ± 0.03% crude lipid, 22.45 ± 0.53% agar, 12.39 ± 0.85% soil conditioner, 2.89 ± 0.04% bioethanol on dry weight basis along with 318 ± 3 ml of mineral rich liquid with possible fertilizer applications. The advantages of this process are complete utilization of feedstock without compromising the yield and quality of products, reusability of solvents and no solid waste. Further, the products recovered from one ton fresh biomass were found to have an estimated market value of USD 1051 while processing cost including raw material as 241 USD, a fourfold value addition of feedstock. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study modeled full scale application of thermobarical hydrolysis of less degradable feedstock for biomethanation was assessed in terms of energy balance, greenhouse gas emissions, and economy. Data were provided whether the substitution of maize silage as feedstock for biogas production by pretreated cattle wastes is beneficial in full-scale application or not.A model device for thermobarical treatment has been suggested for and theoretically integrated in a biogas plant. The assessment considered the replacement of maize silage as feedstock with liquid and/or solid cattle waste (feces, litter, and feed residues from animal husbandry of high-performance dairy cattle, dry cows, and heifers). The integration of thermobarical pretreatment is beneficial for raw material with high contents of organic dry matter and ligno-cellulose: Solid cattle waste revealed very short payback times, e.g. 9 months for energy, 3 months for greenhouse gases, and 3 years 3 months for economic amortization, whereas, in contrast, liquid cattle waste did not perform positive replacement effects in this analysis. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Utilization of sewage sludge seems to be an attractive option for fertilization of bioenergy crops; therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of municipal sewage sludge on yields and bioenergy feedstock characteristics of Miscanthus×giganteus (Greef et Deu.). In a six-year field experiment, located on loamy clay, five doses of sludge (0, 10, 20, 40, 60MgDMha-1), two methods of plantation establishment (by rhizome divisions and micropropagation), and three dates of biomass harvesting (autumn, winter, spring) were tested in order to determine which one should be recommended in cultivation of this species.Dry matter yields of giant miscanthus increased each year and exceeded 25Mgha-1 in an optimized system within this study. It was found out that application of lower doses of sludge (10-20MgDMha-1), resulted in obtaining the highest yield of biomass. On the other hand, the content, uptake and bioaccumulation factor of macronutrients contained in the sludge increased along with increasing dose of applied biosolids. M. giganteus biomass was characterized by favorable parameters: net and gross calorific values were in the range of 16.2-16.8MJkg-1 and 17.7-18.2MJkg-1, respectively. The highest energy value of biomass yield was obtained in the case of rhizomes used for plantation establishment, especially in the treatments with 20MgDMha-1 of sludge application. Spring harvest improved quality of biomass for thermochemical conversion, but at the same time significantly (by 22%) reduced yields, whereas winter harvest resulted in biomass loss without its quality amelioration compared to the autumn one. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - European Union (EU) policymakers have persistently supported first-generation biofuels despite the clearly emerging picture of small or even negative green house gas mitigation effects. This leads to the conclusion that support is driven by other objectives, for example income effects. Against this background, the main objective of this article is to analyse the income effects of abolishing biofuel policies, as well as to explore the link between these effects and lobbying decisions taken by farmers' associations representing different groups of German farmers. Income effects are estimated for different farm types and regions, and differences between farm net value added and family farm income are analysed. To understand the link between income effects and lobbying decisions, our quantitative results are compared with the biofuel policy positions of different farmers' associations. Our results suggest that, in the long run, average income effects are small, especially if the ownership of production factors is accounted for in the income calculation. Many farms show losses if biofuel support is abolished, but others even benefit from lower rental costs and experience positive income effects. Farmers' associations seem to be able to well assess the income effects of EU biofuel policy for different types of farms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate a combined bioethanol and biomethane production from wheat straw applying process network synthesis for maximised energy yield per ton lignocellulosic biomass input. Experimental results in combination with literature data were implemented in process synthesis software for energy optimisation. Wheat straw was steam exploded at different pretreatment conditions on laboratory scale. Glucose and ethanol yields as well as specific biogas yields of different solid and liquid fractions were determined via batch-experiments. Preferable pretreatment conditions differ between biogas and bioethanol production. The optimal process configuration was found to consist of direct biogas production from steam explosion pretreated straw at 170 °C for 20 min combined with bioethanol production from straw pretreated at 200 °C for 20 min. This process results in a purified methane yield of 7892 MJ and a purified ethanol yield of 964 MJ per ton untreated straw input. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of producing sustainable liquid biofuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass remains high on the sustainability agenda, but is challenged by the costs of producing fermentable sugars from these materials. Sugars from plant biomass can be fermented to alcohols or even alkanes, creating a liquid fuel in which carbon released on combustion is balanced by its photosynthetic capture. Large amounts of sugar are present in the woody, nonfood parts of crops and could be used for fuel production without compromising global food security. However, the sugar in woody biomass is locked up in the complex and recalcitrant lignocellulosic plant cell wall, making it difficult and expensive to extract. In this paper, we review what is known about the major polymeric components of woody plant biomass, with an emphasis on the molecular interactions that contribute to its recalcitrance to enzymatic digestion. In addition, we review the extensive research that has been carried out in order to understand and reduce lignocellulose recalcitrance and enable more cost-effective production of fuel from woody plant biomass. © 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a theoretical model by which to demonstrate how taxes and subsidies work as external factors to substitute fossil fuel by a forest-based biofuel. For biofuels, this study predominantly considers solid-form biomass that generates electricity; for fossil fuels, it considers coal. The model results explicated with three states by using various numeric values taken from the literature. Three states are as follows: a situation without a tax and subsidy, a situation with a biofuel subsidy, and a situation with a biofuel subsidy and a fossil fuel tax. The results of the first state exemplify current fuel market situation; those of the second indicate that the aggregate demand for biofuel has shifted upwards by around 15 % and that substitution has increased by around 18 % due to biofuel subsidies being offered. Under the third state, aggregate biofuel demand has shifted upwards by around 19 %, reduced the demand for fossil fuels by around 13 %, and increased substitution by around 31 %. This state relates to a greater sense of social welfare than other two states. It is conceivable that the joint application of taxes and subsidies will succour biofuel to supplant fossil fuel in the near future. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Land use and land cover changes impact climate and air quality by altering the exchange of trace gases between the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Large-scale tree mortality that is projected to occur across the United States as a result of insect and disease may therefore have unexplored consequences for tropospheric chemistry. We develop a land use module for the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to facilitate simulations involving changes to the land surface, and to improve consistency across land-Atmosphere exchange processes. The model is used to test the impact of projected national-scale tree mortality risk through 2027 estimated by the 2012 USDA Forest Service National Insect and Disease Risk Assessment. Changes in biogenic emissions alone decrease monthly mean O3 by up to 0.4g¯ppb, but reductions in deposition velocity compensate or exceed the effects of emissions yielding a net increase in O3 of more than 1g¯ppb in some areas. The O3 response to the projected change in emissions is affected by the ratio of baseline NO<i>x</i>g¯:g¯VOC concentrations, suggesting that in addition to the degree of land cover change, tree mortality impacts depend on whether a region is NO<i>x</i>-limited or NO<i>x</i>-saturated. Consequently, air quality (as diagnosed by the number of days that 8g¯h average O3 exceeds 70g¯ppb) improves in polluted environments where changes in emissions are more important than changes to dry deposition, but worsens in clean environments where changes to dry deposition are the more important term. The influence of changes in dry deposition demonstrated here underscores the need to evaluate treatments of this physical process in models. Biogenic secondary organic aerosol loadings are significantly affected across the US, decreasing by 5-10g¯% across many regions, and by more than 25g¯% locally. Tree mortality could therefore impact background aerosol loadings by between 0.5 and 2g¯μgg¯mg'3. Changes to reactive nitrogen oxide abundance and partitioning are also locally important. The regional effects simulated here are similar in magnitude to other scenarios that consider future biofuel cropping or natural succession, further demonstrating that biosphere-Atmosphere exchange should be considered when predicting future air quality and climate. We point to important uncertainties and further development that should be addressed for a more robust understanding of land cover change feedbacks. © Author(s) 2016. CC Attribution 3.0 License.

AB  - Background: Polysaccharides comprising plant biomass are potential resources for conversion to fuels and chemicals. These polysaccharides include xylans derived from the hemicellulose of hardwoods and grasses, soluble β-glucans from cereals and starch as the primary form of energy storage in plants. Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 (Pjdr2) has evolved a system for bioprocessing xylans. The central component of this xylan utilization system is a multimodular glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) endoxylanase with carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) for binding xylans and surface layer homology (SLH) domains for cell surface anchoring. These attributes allow efficient utilization of xylans by generating oligosaccharides proximal to the cell surface for rapid assimilation. Coordinate expression of genes in response to growth on xylans has identified regulons contributing to depolymerization, importation of oligosaccharides and intracellular processing to generate xylose as well as arabinose and methylglucuronate. The genome of Pjdr2 encodes several other putative surface anchored multimodular enzymes including those for utilization of β-1,3/1,4 mixed linkage soluble glucan and starch. Results: To further define polysaccharide utilization systems in Pjdr2, its transcriptome has been determined by RNA sequencing following growth on barley-derived soluble β-glucan, starch, cellobiose, maltose, glucose, xylose and arabinose. The putative function of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, ABC transporters, and glycoside hydrolases belonging to the corresponding substrate responsive regulon were deduced by their coordinate expression and locations in the genome. These results are compared to observations from the previously defined xylan utilization systems in Pjdr2. The findings from this study show that Pjdr2 efficiently utilizes these glucans in a manner similar to xylans. From transcriptomic and genomic analyses we infer a common strategy evolved by Pjdr2 for efficient bioprocessing of polysaccharides. Conclusions: The barley β-glucan and starch utilization systems in Pjdr2 include extracellular glycoside hydrolases bearing CBM and SLH domains for depolymerization of these polysaccharides. Overlapping regulation observed during growth on these polysaccharides suggests they are preferentially utilized in the order of starch before xylan before barley β-glucan. These systems defined in Pjdr2 may serve as a paradigm for developing biocatalysts for efficient bioprocessing of plant biomass to targeted biofuels and chemicals. © 2016 Sawhney et al.

AB  - The environmental impacts of biofuel production are one of the striking areas for policy debate in the academic and research arena since last few decades. This study empirically measured the environmental impacts of biofuel production in the panel of six largest regions of the World including East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa (MENA), South Asia, and Sub Saharan African region, over the period of 1990-2013. The study used number of promising indicators for socioeconomic and environmental indicators coupled with the biofuels production that have a considerable impact on the climate change, agricultural land, water productivity, natural resources and biodiversity across the globe. The results show that production of biofuels exuberate the Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in East Asia & Pacific region, Latin America & Caribbean region, South Asia, and Sub Saharan African region, while in Europe & Central Asia, biofuels production significantly lessen the amount of HCFCs in the region. The results of aggregated World panel data signify the positive relationship between biofuels production and climate change during the study time period. The positive influence of biofuels production on agricultural land traced out in the East Asia & Pacific region, and MENA region, however, the result is inverted in the Latin America & Caribbean region. The production of biofuel intensify the water productivity in the East Asia & Pacific, South Asia, and Sub Saharan African region, while this result is evaporated in the Latin America & Caribbean, MENA, and World's aggregated region. The results are mixed in order to evaluate the impact of biofuels production on natural resource depletion, as biofuels production significantly decreases the natural resource depletion in the East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, and World's aggregated region, while in the South Asia, and Sub Saharan African region, biofuels production significantly associated with the natural resource depletion. Finally, Biofuels production sustained the biodiversity in the East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, South Asia, and World's aggregated region, while the results are reversed in Europe & Central Asia and Sub-Saharan African region. The results of the study raise the serious concerns on the 'Kyoto protocol' which promote to expand the biofuels to ensure the environmental sustainability, as biofuels production on agricultural land jeopardy for climate change, water resources, natural resources, and biodiversity across the globe. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Anoxygenic phototrophs, like Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can convert light energy and electrons from organic waste into H2 gas, a potential biofuel. During phototrophic growth on organic compounds, the CO2-fixing Calvin cycle competes against H2 production for electrons. Here we address why genetically disrupting the CO2-fixing enzyme, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), increases the H2 yield but not the specific H2 production rate. We hypothesized that remaining upstream phosphoribulokinase (PRK) activity negatively impacts growth and thereby the specific H2 production rate, likely due to the accumulation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the substrate for Rubisco. In agreement with our hypothesis, deletion of PRK resulted in proportional increases to both the H2 yield and the specific production rate. Thus, even though Rubsico is traditionally a more common target to eliminate Calvin cycle activity we propose PRK as a favorable alternative to avoid undesirable pleiotropic effects.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of government regulation on farmland use to balance food and energy production in a competitive biofuel supply chain design framework. We propose a Stackelberg-Nash game model with a direct land-use constraint that captures farmland, food, and fuel market equilibrium. To provide farmers with incentives to comply with the land-use regulation, we implement the land-use constraint through a cap-and-trade mechanism which we show attains equivalent land-use patterns. We further prove the existence of optimal solutions of the two equivalent discretely constrained mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (DC-MPEC) models. Two adaptive "relax-and-tighten" schemes, integrality and Lagrangian duality based relaxation, are proposed to handle the binary variables in a mixed integer formulation of the models. The proposed methodology is tested in a case study for the State of Illinois. The computational results demonstrate the superiority of our customized algorithms to publicly available solvers for solving problems with realistic sizes. Finally, the efficiency of the cap-and-trade mechanism is demonstrated through comparisons of scenarios with and without regulation as well as a sensitivity analysis on the cap-and-trade level. The cap-and-trade policy is found to effectively reduce biomass farmland use and profits of the biofuel industry. It may have different impacts on social welfare depending on problem settings and market parameters. Cap-and-trade levels also affect system behavior and thus should be carefully selected. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) with in the International Federation of Operational Research Societies(IFORS).

AB  - The current fascination with algal biofuel production stems from a high lipid biosynthetic capacity and little conflict with land plant cultivation. However, the mechanisms which enable algae to accumulate massive oil remain elusive. An enzyme for triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, CrDGTT2, can produce a large amount of TAG when expressed in yeast or higher plants, suggesting a unique ability of CrDGTT2 to enhance oil production in a heterologous system. Here, we performed metabolic engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by taking advantage of CrDGTT2. We suppressed membrane phospholipid biosynthesis at the log phase by mutating OPI3, enhanced TAG biosynthetic pathway at the stationary phase by overexpressing PAH1 and CrDGTT2, and suppressed TAG hydrolysis on growth resumption from the stationary phase by knocking out DGK1. The resulting engineered yeast cells accumulated about 70-fold of TAG compared with wild type cells. Moreover, TAG production was sustainable. Our results demonstrated the enhanced and sustainable TAG production in the yeast synthetic platform. © 2016 Hung, Kanehara and Nakamura.

AB  - This study analyses the sustainability of fuel ethanol production from cane molasses in Indonesia. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to evaluate the net emissions (climate change impact) and energy inputs (resource consumption) in the production chain. The lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production and use of ethanol are estimated at 29 gCO2eq per MJ of ethanol produced which is a 67% reduction in comparison to gasoline emissions. Net Energy Value (NEV) and Net Renewable Energy Value (NREV) are -7 MJ/l and 17.7 MJ/l, while the energy yield ratio (ER) is 6.1. Economic allocation is chosen for dividing environmental burdens and resource consumption between sugar (i.e. main product) and molasses (i.e. co-product used for fuel production). Sensitivity analysis of various parameters is performed. The emissions and energy values are highly sensitive to sugarcane yield, ethanol yield, and the price of molasses. The use of sugarcane biomass residues (bagasse/trash) for efficient cogeneration, and different waste management options for the treatment of spent wash (effluent of distilleries) are also explored. Surplus bioelectricity generation in the efficient cogeneration plant, biogas recovery from wastewater treatment plant, and their use for fossil fuel substitution can help improve energy and environmental gains. The study also compares important results with other relevant international studies and discusses issues related to land use change (LUC) impact. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the current interest in cellulosic biofuel feedstocks, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) research has increased in North America over the past decades. However, implications of large-scale switchgrass production on local and regional water budgets are largely unknown. We conducted eddy covariance measurements over a large (60ha) commercial switchgrass field in Southern Ontario, Canada, to determine evapotranspiration and energy fluxes during the sixth (2012) and seventh (2013) year since establishment of switchgrass. Annual total evapotranspiration was slightly smaller in the wet year of 2013 compared to the dry year of 2012 (562±12 and 598±9mm, respectively; error estimate based on gap filling error). Canopy conductance was larger in the wet year (11.2±1.5 mms-1 in 2013; average±standard error) than in the dry year (7.7±0.9mms-1 in 2012), which suggests that switchgrass regulated stomatal opening to reduce water loss. Although this regulation reduced atmospheric CO2 fixation, it did not result in yield reduction. Water use efficiency of harvested dry matter was larger in 2012 compared to 2013 (1.82±0.12 and 1.40±0.11 g DM(kgH2O)-1, respectively; error estimates based on Gaussian error propagation). Water use efficiency based on gross ecosystem production (EWUE) in 2013 was 14.0±0.6gCO2(kg H2O)-1, compared to 13.3±0.3gCO2(kg H2O)-1 in 2012 (error estimates based on Gaussian error propagation). Daily, monthly, and seasonal EWUE showed a trend to lower values in the dry year of 2012 compared to 2013. These results indicate that the switchgrass crop was able to reduce the water cost of aboveground biomass in the dry year by relocating carbon from belowground structures, but it fixed more atmospheric carbon per unit water evapotranspired in the wet year. Our findings show that mature switchgrass has the potential to withstand the impact of moderate drought or dry conditions. However, the impact of repeated drought and prolonged dry conditions on switchgrass and implications for regional water budgets are not clear yet. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) residues and perennial C4 grasses are two Midwest bioenergy feedstock candidates due to their compatibility with agricultural infrastructure and potential for ecosystem service delivery. We validated the ecosystem process model AGRO-BGC by comparing model estimates with empirical observations from corn and perennial C4 grass systems across Wisconsin and Illinois under no-tillage, nitrogen fertilized, and unfertilized management. Validation parameters included soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (N) to 1.2m, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and leaf area index (LAI). We parameterized AGRO-BGC to represent ecophysiological characteristics of corn and perennial prairie grasses, and constructed scenarios to represent corresponding edaphic, climate, and management conditions. Unfertilized annual model estimates had normalized mean average errors relative to field measurements of 0.3, 23, and 4tha-1 for ANPP, SOC, and N, respectively. Fertilized simulations erred from observations by 0.6, 29, 5tha-1 for ANPP, SOC, and N, respectively.We also estimated long-term implications of varying residue removal rates on SOC. Model estimates compared to field data tested the hypothesis that long-term increased residue removal decreases SOC. Field observations showed 0.17, 0.09, and a -0.17tCha-1yr-1 change for control, harvest, and bare grass residue removal treatments, respectively. Simulated SOC loss was greatest for the most intensive residue removal scenarios (-0.48 and -0.68tCha-1yr-1 for corn and grass, respectively), compared to no-harvest scenarios that increased SOC by 0.05tCha-1yr-1 for both corn and grass. AGRO-BGC estimated a 0.07tCha-1yr-1 loss under corn residue harvest, while estimating 0.09tCha-1yr-1 loss for grass. Results suggest long-term increased corn and grass residue harvest (beyond grain) for biofuel feedstock will decrease SOC and soil productivity by approximately 15% in corn and 21% in grass systems over 47 years. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Amylase is one of the earliest characterized enzymes and has many applications in clinical and industrial settings. In biotechnological industries, the amylase activity is enhanced through modifying amylase structure and through cloning and expressing targeted amylases in different species. It is important to understand how engineered amylases can survive from generation to generation. This study used phylogenetic and statistical approaches to explore general patterns of amylases evolution, including 3118 a-amylases and 280 b-amylases from archaea, eukaryota and bacteria with fully documented taxonomic lineage. First, the phylogenetic tree was created to analyze the evolution of amylases with focus on individual amylases used in biofuel industry. Second, the average pairwise p-distance was computed for each kingdom, phylum, class, order, family and genus, and its diversity implies multitime and multi-clan evolution. Finally, the variance was further partitioned into inter-clan variance and intra-clan variance for each taxonomic group, and they represent horizontal and vertical gene transfer. Theoretically, the results show a full picture on the evolution of amylases in manners of vertical and horizontal gene transfer, and multitime and multi-clan evolution as well. Practically, this study provides the information on the surviving chance of desired amylase in a given taxonomic group, which may potentially enhance the successful rate of cloning and expression of amylase gene in different species. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Increasing fuel prices, concern about climate change and future energy security have led to tremendous global interest in the use of liquid biofuels in the transport sector which, in turn, has driven large-scale land acquisitions in developing countries for biofuel feedstock production. However, regardless of the vast nature of reported land deals and widespread concern about their potential negative consequences, implementation of most of the reported biofuel land deals in Ethiopia has not yet happened. Using a case study of large-scale jatropha plantation in Ethiopia, this paper examines the main causes underpinning the disappointing agronomic performance and finally termination of large-scale jatropha plantations. Although it has been argued that jatropha can be commercially grown well on marginal land without irrigation, this study indicates that moisture stress was the key factor in the failure of many large-scale jatropha plantations in Ethiopia. Furthermore, the use of untested planting material and conflict with local communities over the land were other important factors that contributed to termination of jatropha projects. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - This article connects the science of sustainability theory with applied aspects of sustainability deployment. A suite of 35 sustainability indicators spanning 12 environmental and socioeconomic categories has been proposed for comparing the sustainability of bioenergy production systems across different feedstock types and locations. Information on sustainability indicators and associated measurements for the feedstock production and logistics portions of the biofuel supply chain was available from a recent demonstration-scale switchgrass-to-ethanol production system located in East Tennessee. Knowledge pertaining to the available indicators was distributed within a hierarchical decision tree framework to generate an assessment of the overall sustainability of this no-till switchgrass production system relative to two alternative business-as-usual scenarios of unmanaged pasture and tilled corn production. The relative contributions of the social, economic, and environmental information were determined for the overall trajectory of this bioenergy system's sustainability under each scenario. The results show that, within this East Tennessee context, switchgrass production is an attractive option for improving environmental and social sustainability trajectories without adverse economic impacts, which can lead to enhanced sustainability overall. Although external trade does not yet exist for this switchgrass commodity, our economic modeling indicates that switchgrass production can still be beneficial to the counties surrounding the biorefinery in terms of dollars earned and jobs created. The opportunity to use inactive equipment and laborers is a potential benefit captured indirectly by the sustainability evaluation framework. Given the early stage of cellulosic ethanol production, it is currently difficult to determine quantitative values for all 35 proposed sustainability indicators across the entire biofuel supply chain. This case study demonstrates that integration of qualitative sustainability indicator ratings may increase holistic understanding of a bioenergy system in the absence of complete information.

AB  - Non-polar and polar solvents as well as their mixtures were tested for the extraction of microalgae lipids and thus, to evaluate their effect on total and esterifiable lipids extraction yields with potential to be converted to biodiesel. The obtained results show an increase in lipids and esterifiable lipids extraction yields when non-polar and polar solvent mixtures were used. The higher esterifiable lipids extraction yield was 19.2% wt (based on dry biomass) using a chloroform–methanol mixture (75% v/v of methanol), corresponding to a 98.9% wt esterifiable lipids extraction. In addition, esterifiable lipids extraction yield of 18.9% wt (based on dry biomass) was obtained when a petroleum ether–methanol mixture (75% v/v of methanol) was used, corresponding to a 96.9% wt esterifiable lipids extraction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The water-energy nexus has increasingly been recognized as one of the key factors underlying the sustainability and security of future water and energy supply. An improved understanding of this issue is required to guide political decision-making on the choice of technologies that can better lead towards water-energy efficient scenarios. One of the biggest challenges relies on the reduction of uncertainties over selected variables, and the analysis of trends and interrelations that may have an impact on the future of water and energy security. This paper presents the results of a Delphi study on prospective and future trends of the water-energy nexus and energy technologies. Based on the opinion and contributions of experts on the topic from different backgrounds, institutions and disciplines, the results indicate the importance of technology innovation and transfer as the main conditioning factors to achieve energy and water security. In terms of energy, biofuels and shale gas are perceived to have the highest potential impacts on water quantity and especially on water quality. Thus their evolution will be influential for future water and environmental security. Biofuels in particular, together with the rising demands for food, have the highest prospects for an increase in agricultural water withdrawals. © IWA Publishing 2016.

AB  - Temperature is a crucial factor that significantly influences the microbial activity and so the methanation performance of an anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Therefore, how to control the operating temperature for optimal activity of the microbes involved is a key to stable AD. This study examined the response of a continuous anaerobic reactor to a series of temperature shifts over a wide range of 35-65 °C using a dairy-processing byproduct as model wastewater. During the long-term experiment for approximately 16 months, the reactor was subjected to stepwise temperature increases by 5 °C at a fixed HRT of 15 days. The reactor showed stable performance within the temperature range of 35-45 °C, with the methane production rate and yield being maximum at 45 °C (18% and 26% greater, respectively, than at 35 °C). However, the subsequent increase to 50 °C induced a sudden performance deterioration with a complete cessation of methane recovery, indicating that the temperature range between 45 °C and 50 °C had a critical impact on the transition of the reactor's methanogenic activity from mesophilic to thermophilic. This serious process perturbation was associated with a severe restructuring of the reactor microbial community structure, particularly of methanogens, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Once restored by interrupted feeding for about two months, the reactor maintained fairly stable performance under thermophilic conditions until it was upset again at 65 °C. Interestingly, in contrast to most previous reports, hydrogenotrophs largely dominated the methanogen community at mesophilic temperatures while acetotrophs emerged as a major group at thermophilic temperature. This implies that the primary methanogenesis route of the reactor shifted from hydrogen- to acetate-utilizing pathways with the temperature shifts from mesophilic to thermophilic temperatures. Our observations suggest that a mesophilic digester may not need to be cooled at up to 45 °C in case of undesired temperature rise, for example, by excessive self-heating, which offers a possibility to reduce operating costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is being established as a standard technology to recover some of the energy contained in the sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as biogas, allowing an economy in electricity and heating and a decrease in climate gas emission. The purpose of this study was to quantify the contributions to the total environmental impact of the plant using life cycle assessment methodology. In this work, data from real operation during 2012 of a municipal WWTP were utilized as the basis to determine the impact of including AD in the process. The climate change human health was the most important impact category when AD was included in the treatment (Scenario 1), especially due to fossil carbon dioxide emissions. Without AD (Scenario 2), increased emissions of greenhouse gases, mostly derived from the use of electricity, provoked a rise in the climate change categories. Biogas utilization was able to provide 47% of the energy required in the WWTP in Scenario 1. Results obtained make Scenario 1 the better environmental choice by far, mainly due to the use of the digested sludge as fertilizer. © 2016 IWA Publishing.

AB  - Perennial cellulosic feedstocks may have potential to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by offsetting fossil fuels. However, this potential depends on meeting a number of important criteria involving land cover change, including avoiding displacement of agricultural production, not reducing uncultivated natural lands that provide biodiversity habitat and other valued ecosystem services, and avoiding the carbon debt (the amount of time needed to repay the initial carbon loss) that accompanies displacing natural lands. It is unclear whether recent agricultural expansion in the United States competes with lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstocks. Here, we evaluate how recent land cover change (2008-2013) has affected the availability of lands potentially suited for bioenergy feedstock production in the U.S. Lake States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan) and its impact on other natural ecosystems. The region is potentially well suited for a diversity of bioenergy production systems, both grasses and woody biomass, due to the widespread forest economy in the north and agricultural economy in the south. Based on remotelysensed data, our results show that between 2008 and 2013, 836,000 ha of non-agricultural open lands were already converted to agricultural uses in the Lake States, a loss of nearly 37%. The greatest relative changes occurred in the southern half that includes some of the most diverse cultivable lands in the country. We use transition diagrams to reveal gross changes that can be obscured if only net change is considered. Our results indicate that expansion of row crops (corn, soybean) was responsible for the majority of open land loss. Even if recently lost open lands were brought into perennial feedstock production, there would a substantial carbon debt. This reduction in open land availability for biomass production is closing the window of opportunity to establish a sustainable cellulosic feedstock economy in the Lake States as mandated by current Federal policy, incurring a substantial GHG debt, and displacing a range of other natural ecosystems and their services. © 2016 Mladenoff et al.

AB  - Wheat is an important commodity in Europe. With a production of 133 million tonnes per year and annual import and export accounting for 6.3 and 5.3 billion US$, respectively, wheat is the most important cereal in Europe. Wheat cultivation further feeds into a wide variety of products ranging from bread, over imitation meat, to biofuels and bio-based materials. Therefore, it is desirable to have a synthetic life cycle assessment (LCA) of the impacts of an average kilogram (kg) of wheat produced in Europe. This article aims to provide such a synthesis using two strategies. In the first strategy, we give an overview of published LCA impacts of wheat production. A second strategy is a meta-analysis in which a re-evaluation is made of 20 available life cycle inventories representing cases in 11 different European countries. Based on the production shares of these countries in the total European production, weighted average impacts are calculated. These weighted averages of the re-evaluated inventories show that an average kg of wheat grain produced in Europe demands 3.25 megajoules of nonrenewable, fossil energy, emits 0.61 to 0.65 kg carbon dioxide equivalents, triggers terrestrial acidification of 4.94 to 6.51 grams (g) sulphur dioxide equivalents, freshwater eutrophication of 0.08 to 0.09 g phosphorous equivalents, marine eutrophication of 4.97 to 7.60 g nitrogen equivalents, and occupies 1.63 square meter years of agricultural land. The re-evaluation of studies results in similar impacts as the mere reviewing of energy demands and global warming potentials. Given the many applications of wheat, the presented meta-analysis is interesting to evaluate the average and range of environmental performance of wheat production in Europe, but is also useful as an input in assessing impacts of wheat-based products. © 2016, Yale University.

AB  - Secure access to energy and food are two of the challenges facing the Northeast region of the United States. Traditional biofuel feedstocks, such as corn and oil seed, are able to satisfy energy requirements. However, they compete with food production for desirable land and water resources and, in any case, are not likely to exploit the region's current comparative advantages. This study investigates a potential solution to the energy security problem in the Northeast: biofuel from advanced feedstock in the form of net forest growth and woody wastes, of which the region has abundant endowments. The federal government has committed to requiring 79.5 billion liters (BL) of advanced biofuel production annually by 2022. We evaluate both the physical capacity for its production and its cost competitiveness using an input-output model of consumption, production, and trade in the 13-state region. The model minimizes resource use required to satisfy given consumer demand using alternative technological options and subject to resource constraints. We compile data from the technical literature quantifying state-level biofuel feedstock endowments and the technological requirements for cellulosic ethanol production. We find that exploiting the region's endowment of cellulosic feedstock requires either making the price of biofuels competitive with gasoline through subsidies or restricting imports of gasoline. Based on this initial investigation, we conclude that the region can produce significant amounts of advanced biofuel, up to 20.28 BL of cellulosic ethanol per year, which could displace nearly 12.5% of the gasoline that is now devoted to motorized transport in the region. © 2015 Yale University.

AB  - This study explores the bio-ethanol innovation system in Taiwan from the perspective of a technology innovation system (TIS). Taiwan is a newly industrialized country and is not currently a main producer of bio-ethanol. This study analyzes the evolution of bio-ethanol innovation system in Taiwan and places a particular emphasis on challenges that present policies face in the context of potential long-term bio-ethanol development. Through an evaluation of the consistency of the present research, technology, development and innovation (RTDI) policies as well as the influence of these policies on the functional dynamics of bio-ethanol innovation system, mechanisms prohibiting the system from flourishing are determined. It is suggested that the production of bio-ethanol in Taiwan would be achieved if the government: (1) fixes long-term targets for both domestic bio-ethanol development and emission reduction; and (2) comprehensively designs a set of interrelated RTDI policies in accordance with the functional pattern of the bio-ethanol innovation system and consistently implements these policies. If such measures were implemented, it is considered that the bio-ethanol innovation system in Taiwan would flourish. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Due to opportunities for economic and social development in the biofuels market, improvement to the supply chain has become a relevant matter. In agro-industrial supply chains, procurement costs are highly relevant. Since sugarcane is a high performance raw material for ethanol production, this paper proposes a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model for cost optimization for harvesting, loading and transportation operations. The model determines the quantity of machines and workers to meet the biofuel plant requirements. Costs of resources for harvesting and loading as well as transportation costs from the land parcel to the production plant are minimized. Also, the model calculates the cost of penalties for shortages (unmet demand) and the cost of equipment idle time. The implementation of the model in a Peruvian biofuels company, showed a cost reduction of around 11% when compared to the current costs. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The rule of thumb in literature is that 20% of biodiesel is the most acceptable blend ratio in alternative fuel blends. This work focuses on in-depth mathematical optimization analyses of ternary blends of diesel-butanol-vegetable oil (cotton oil), based on engine operating parameters using RSM (response surface methodology). It is critical to achieve the maximum power and torque for customers while keeping the emissions low enough due to government regulations and certifications. Thus, three optimization studies were conducted at 2200 rpm, which corresponds to the maximum brake torque, and engine emissions were fixed at a maximum possible value based on emission standards, for all three studies. In order to understand the impact of other engine parameters on the blend ratio, as well, various combinations of BTE (brake thermal efficiency), maximum brake power, maximum brake torque, BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) were fixed, which correspond to Opt-(optimization 1) (BTE and exhaust emissions), optimization 2 (BTE, brake power and exhaust emissions), and optimization 3 (BTE, brake power, brake torque, BSFC, BMEP and exhaust emissions). Optimization studies used experimentally determined emissions and performance data of a diesel engine based on 7 different concentrations of diesel-butanol-cotton oil blends. Optimum values of the blends corresponding to the optimization studies were mathematically determined as Opt-(optimization 1) (61.7 vol.% diesel, 34.75 vol.% butanol, 3.55 vol.% cotton oil), Opt-(optimization 2) (64.5 vol.% diesel, 28.7 vol.% butanol, 6.8 vol.% cotton oil), and Opt-(optimization 3) (65.5 vol.% diesel, 23.1 vol.% butanol, 11.4 vol.% cotton oil). When compared to diesel, BSFCs of Opt-1, Opt-and Opt-blends at 2200 rpm increased 41.57, 33.87 and 24.53%, respectively. In terms of basic exhaust gas emissions, optimum fuel blends decreased NOx (oxides of nitrogen), CO (carbon monoxide) and HC (hydrocarbon) emissions as compared to diesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper is a perspective paper, which investigates whether the water footprint (WF) concept addresses the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus. First, the nexus links between (1) the planetary boundary freshwater resources (green and blue water resources) and (2) food security, energy security, blue water supply security and water for environmental flows/water for other ecosystem services (ES) are analysed and graphically presented. Second, the WF concept is concisely discussed. Third, with respect to the nexus, global water resources (green and blue) availability and use are discussed and graphically presented with an indication of quantities obtained from the literature. It is shown which of these water uses are represented in WF accounting. This evaluation shows that general water management and WF studies only account for the water uses agriculture, industry and domestic water. Important water uses are however generally not identified as separate entities or even included, i.e. green and blue water resources for aquaculture, wild foods, biofuels, hydroelectric cooling, hydropower, recreation/tourism, forestry (for energy and other biomass uses) and navigation. Fourth, therefore a list of essential separate components to be included within WF accounting is presented. The latter would be more coherent with the water-food-energy-ecosystem nexus and provide valuable extra information and statistics. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The topic of carbon sequestration in plants has received much attention recently due to concerns about global climate change, which is being exacerbated by deforestation. In the early days of the global bioenergy boom, the private sector and non-government organizations enthusiastically promoted the planting of Jatropha curcas L. as a key candidate shrub species for the production of bioenergy in West Africa. This study investigates the aboveground biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of J. curcas, which is already widely cultivated for the production of oil seeds, biodiesel and biokerosene. The specific objective is to use a destructive method to develop allometric prediction equations of the aboveground biomass production of J. curcas plantations. 38 J. curcas shrubs were harvested and weighed in order to estimate biomass production. These data were used to develop allometric equations for the estimation of wood, leaf and total aboveground biomass production. The best-fit models found for estimating shrub component biomass and total aboveground biomass production were of the power form. All of the regression equations relating the prediction of leaf biomass, wood biomass and total aboveground biomass with J. curcas diameter at 20 cm above the ground (D) were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) and also presented the highest goodness of fit (high R2). The aboveground biomass carbon content was estimated using the ash method. Carbon content in leaves and wood was, respectively, 48 and 54 %. The current established allometric equations can be helpful to provide a rapid estimation of the aboveground biomass and C stock for J. curcas biofuel projects in semi-arid conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - While national figures of land availability are used to justify accepting large-scale land investors, not very much is known about the local level realities of land availability. By combining remotely sensed data with fieldwork, system dynamics modelling and qualitative research methods, we examine local level realities of land use and availability in the Malen Chiefdom of Southern Sierra Leone. Here, local communities are experiencing the outcomes of large-scale investments in oil palm for biodiesel and other industrial purposes by the SOCFIN Agricultural Company. We find that beyond agricultural production, there are other land uses that are vital for the socio-cultural, economic and environmental realities of communities. The Company does not respect engagements promised to local people to set aside buffer zones around living areas to serve as biodiversity corridors. Local communities are severely deprived of agricultural land and other land resources. The operations of SOCFIN do not take account of present or future land needs of local people. A baseline requirement of food crop land should be set aside for each community, to ensure the attainment of food security in communities affected by land acquisitions. Such baseline requirement should be augmented with local level needs assessments to meet new demand for cropland necessitated by changing demography. This model of land planning can be applied to other land use and additional engagements of large-scale land investors. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Aims: Biochar is a carbon-rich product obtained from the pyrolysis of organic materials. Its use, combined with fertilizers, can modify soil properties and affect root morphology and functioning. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of biochar and fertilizer addition on root development and morphology. Methods: Durum wheat was pot-grown for 2 months using two types of biochar (produced from wheat straw and olive-tree pruning) applied at four rates (0, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 % w/w) and combined with three fertilization levels (0, 40 %-low and 100 %-complete). Results: Biochar addition at high rates increased the specific root length and decreased both root diameter and root tissue mass density, indicating a fine root proliferation, regardless of the fertilization level. This may have favoured the resource acquisition by increasing biochar-root interactions, soil exploration and the fertilizer efficacy. Biochar addition reduced N and Mn availability but increased P availability, which also influenced root growth. Conclusions: Changes in root morphology may therefore serve as an important indicator of soil changes induced by biochar and its study can contribute to a better understanding of the effects of the combined application of biochar and fertilizers on plant growth. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Literature values for glucose release from corn stover are highly variable which would likely result in tremendous variability in bio-refinery ethanol yield from corn stover feedstock. A relatively recent change in United States corn genetics is the inclusion of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) trait, which now accounts for three-fourths of all US planted corn acreage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of corn grain yield, inclusion of the Bt trait, and location environment on corn stover quality for subsequent ethanol conversion. Two hybrid pairs (each having a Bt and non-Bt near-isoline) were analyzed giving a total of 4 hybrids. In 2010 and 2011, field plots were located in Michigan at four latitudinal differing locations in four replicated plots at each location. Stover composition and enzymatic digestibility was analyzed and estimated ethanol yield (g g-1) was calculated based on hydrolyzable glucan and xylan levels. Analysis showed that there were no significant differences in total glucose or xylose levels nor in enzymatically hydrolyzable glucan and xylan concentrations between Bt corn stover and the non-Bt stover isolines. Regression analyses between corn grain yield (Mg ha-1) and corn stover ethanol yield (g g-1) showed an inverse relationship indicative of a photosynthate source-sink relationship. Nevertheless, the quantity of stover produced was found to be more critical than the quality of stover produced in maximizing potential stover ethanol yield on a land area basis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The oil palm is currently a major source of oil used worldwide for biofuel production and food. In Brazil, it is grown in high rainfall and high temperature regions. The high cost of this oil crop in the Brazilian Amazonia, combined with environmental and land ownership issues and the occurrence of diseases, has aroused considerable interest in growing it in other regions of the country, including the Savanna (Cerrado) Biome. This study aimed to evaluate, for 1 year, the fruit bunch, the oil yield, and other parameters of two oil palm cultivars (BRS C1001 and BRS C2501) under the typical Savanna conditions in the Federal District, Brazil. Differences between these cultivars were observed in some parameters evaluated throughout the year (p < 0.05). The oil yield/bunch ranged from 25 to 32 and 29 to 36 % for BRS C2501 and BRS C1001 cultivars, respectively and similar to those obtained for the same cultivars in the Brazilian Amazonia and for other genotypes in Indonesia, Sumatra, and Malaysia. Both cultivars proved to be promising in terms of oil yield in a trail carried out at 1000 m of altitude under irrigation at Cerrado Biome in Brazil. © 2015 AOCS.

AB  - Agricultural land use is increasingly changing due to different anthropogenic activities. A combination of economic, socio-political, and cultural factors exerts a direct impact on agricultural changes. This study aims to illustrate how stakeholders and policymakers can take advantage of a web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), namely SmartScape™ to either test existing crop change policies or produce effective crop change decisions using tradeoff analysis. We addressed the consequences of two common crop change scenarios for Dane county in Wisconsin, United States, (a) replacing perennial energy crops with annual energy crops and (b) replacing annual energy crops with perennial energy crops. The results suggested that converting areas under grass and alfalfa production that were located on high quality soil and flat slope to corn promoted a net-income and availability of gross biofuel. Additionally, the model outcome proposed that converting areas under corn and soy production that were located on high slope to grass promoted net-energy, phosphorus loading, soil loss, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emission, grassland bird habitat, pollinator abundance, and biocontrol. Therefore, SmartScape™ can assist strategic crop change policy by comparing the tradeoff among ecosystem services to ensure that crop change policies have outcomes that are agreeable to a diversity of policymakers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Facing a huge fiscal burden due to imports of its entire petroleum demand in the face of ample supply of agricultural land to produce biofuels, Zambia has recently introduced a biofuel mandate. However, a number of questions, particularly those related to the economics of biofuels, have not been fully investigated yet. Using an empirical model, this study analyzes the economics of meeting the biodiesel mandate using soybean oil. The study finds that meeting the biodiesel mandate would reduce social welfare, mainly because of the welfare loss to fuel consumers and net reduction in foreign exchange earnings due to soybean oil imports. However, if Zambia increases its domestic soybean supply, as well as oil yield, soybean-based biodiesel is likely to be welfare-beneficial. The country's welfare is found to be the highest under expanded soybean production and its domestic processing but with no biodiesel mandate. © 2016.

AB  - Brazil is a major producer of liquid biofuels. To achieve these production levels, energy crops require the use of fertilizers, and to put pressure on the nitrogen fertilizer domestic market. This contributes to an increasing level of imports and trade deficits in the chemical industry. The main raw material for the production of urea is natural gas, which is also imported. Therefore, the expansion of energy supply via biofuels occurs through an increasing trade deficit either of urea or of natural gas. This highlights the debate about the impact of the expansion of such energy crops and the priority in the use of the natural gas domestically produced. Findings show that Brazil will stay a major importer of urea. Urea consumption associated with the production of biofuels has sufficient magnitude to justify an expansion of production capacity through a greenfield facility. However, the analysis of natural gas break-even price indicates that the project is not feasible, under a private investor logic. Even under the country strategic perspective (energy security versus trade deficits), being importer of urea is less risky (in terms of volume and prices) than being importer of fuels (natural gas as feedstock, or gasoline and diesel that are replaced by biofuels). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite widespread global efforts to promote clean cookstoves to achieve improvements in air and forest quality, and to reduce global climate change, surprisingly little is known about the degree to which these actually reduce biomass fuel consumption in real-world settings. Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cookstoves - most of which are LPG stoves - on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use. Our results suggest that using a clean cookstove is associated with daily reductions of about 4.5. kg of biomass fuel, 160 fewer minutes cooking on traditional stoves, and 105 fewer minutes collecting biomass fuels. These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports. Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains. We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socio-economic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies. Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The four-year-lasting field experiment located on loamy clay aimed at determination of yielding and biofuel characteristics of reed canary grass 'Bamse' variety cultivated at different doses of municipal sewage sludge (0, 10, 20, 40, 60 Mg ha-1 DM). In the experiment, three frequencies of energy feedstock harvesting were used: a one-harvest management system (in autumn), a two-cut regime (in spring and autumn), and a three-cut regime (in spring, summer, and autumn) in order to determine which of them has the best advantage of yielding potential obtained at application of sewage sludge.It was found out that application of 40 Mg ha-1 DM of sludge resulted in the highest yield of biomass. The content and bioaccumulation index of macronutrients in plants increased along with the increasing dose of applied sewage sludge, reaching the maximum at 60 Mg ha-1 DM. Biomass was characterized by favourable parameters: net calorific value in the range of 15.2-16.1 MJ kg-1 as well as low ash (5.5%-7%) and sulphur (0.11%-0.24%) mass fractions. The most favourable was the single harvesting run in late autumn as well as the two-cut regime. In the cultivation of reed canary grass for energy purposes, excessive amounts of swaths of biomass should be avoided in order to prolong plant growth on the field, increase accumulation of dry matter, lower the moisture content, and at the same time reduce the mineral content. Application of increasing doses of sewage sludge positively affected soil physico-chemical properties as well. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the study was focused on extraction of fleshing oil from limed fleshings with different neutralization process by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) followed by solvent extraction. The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from limed fleshing oil by two stage process has also been investigated. The central composite design (CCD) was used to study the effect of process variables viz., amount of flesh, particle size and time of fleshing oil extraction. The maximum yield of fleshing oil from limed fleshings post neutralization by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was 26.32g and 12.43g obtained at 200g of flesh, with a particle size of 3.90mm in the time period of 2h. Gas chromatography analysis reveals that the biodiesel (FAME) obtained from limed fleshings is rich in oleic and palmitic acids with weight percentages 46.6 and 32.2 respectively. The resulting biodiesel was characterized for its physio-chemical properties of diesel as per international standards (EN14214). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Populous deltoides wood is a suitable raw material for ethanol production, since it has high cellulose content. Efficient degradation and subsequent conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-ethanol, requires physico-chemical pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain high overall yields of sugars. Microbial hydrolytic enzymes are actively utilized for biomass degradation and bio-ethanol production. Four glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) namely; three subunits of cellulase, endoglucanase (ThWF5-endoglucanase), exoglucanase (ThWF5-exoglucanase) and β-glucosidase (ThWF5-glucosidase), and xylanase (ThWF5-xylanase), from fungal strain Trichoderma harzianum WF5 - isolated from decayed wood, were pulled out and subsequently characterized. Analysis of full length sequences and prediction of secondary and tertiary structure showed that these enzymes shared homology with the respective enzymes of other Trichoderma species and have comparatively evolved structure to express catalytic activity under broad range of environmental conditions. Respective GHs were partially purified and used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of P. deltoids wood after pretreatments. The pretreatment of P. deltoides wood with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4 + H2O2) at 121 °C for 60 min was determined as the best condition to high recovery of reducing sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis. The overall high ethanol yield of 15.6 g/l and fermentation efficiency of 61.1% was obtained when fermentation was performed on pretreated poplar wood slurry followed by detoxification with calcium hydroxide. High bio-ethanol production from P. deltoides wood and molecular characterization of glycosyl hydrolases used, provide insights that this wood offers a potential source for biofuel production while T. harzianum WF5 is a treasure house of robust degrading enzymes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The indirect Land Use Change (iLUC) impacts of biofuels refer to the effects of additional emissions due to land-use changes triggered by the expansion of energy crops in response to increased biofuel demand. These emissions are mostly greenhouse gases (GHG), thus relevant to the climate change impact category. In order to address these effects, the European Commission (EC) has proposed the inclusion of feedstock type specific iLUC factors for different biofuel sources in the Renewable Energy Sources Directive 2009/28/EC (RED). The goal of this study is to quantify the indirect environmental impacts both in terms of global energy crop land area and the subsequent iLUC, if an additional demand of biofuel in Spain occurs, from a consequential approach. Results show a wide range of GHG emissions, in terms of CO2, of biodiesel and bioethanol from iLUC effects, strongly influenced by the place where the potential biofuel is produced. Based on our study, two main aspects -determine the iLUC effects: the dedicated energy crops that are used to produce biofuels and the different coproducts obtained along the biofuels production process. Therefore, contrary to the EC proposal for including a single factor by type of crop, the development of origin-dependent iLUC factors seems to be a more appropriate alternative based on the current assessment. Other aspects that might affect the results, such as crop rotation or field management, have been excluded from the analysis in this work. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports meta-regressions of substitution elasticities between greenhouse gas (GHG) polluting and nonpolluting inputs in agricultural production, which is the main feedstock source for biofuel in the U.S. We treat energy, fertilizer, and manure collectively as the "polluting input" and labor, land, and capital as nonpolluting inputs. We estimate meta-regressions for samples of Morishima substitution elasticities for labor, land, and capital vs. the polluting input. Much of the heterogeneity of Morishima elasticities can be explained by type of primal or dual function, functional form, type and observational level of data, input categories, number of outputs, type of output, time period, and country categories. Each estimated long-run elasticity for the reference case, which is most relevant for assessing GHG emissions through life-cycle analysis, is greater than 1.0 and significantly different from zero. Most predicted long-run elasticities remain significantly different from zero at the data means. These findings imply that life-cycle analysis based on fixed proportion production functions could provide grossly inaccurate measures of GHG of biofuel. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prickly pear is a term used to refer to several species of cactus belonging primarily to the genus Opuntia. In general, these species present an exceptional ability to produce biomass in soil and climate conditions unfavorable for most plant species, in part due to their high water use efficiency. Given the current increase demand for renewable energy and the future prospect of more limited water resources, the potential use of prickly pear cladodes for biofuel production deserves to be investigated. The objectives of this study were to gather information on the chemical composition of prickly pear biomass from the most cultivated varieties in NE Brazil, discuss the potential of processing biomass for ethanol and biogas production and to point out gaps in know-how and priorities for research on this topic. We quantified in the tree varieties studied significant amounts of uronic acids (10.7%) and oxalic acid (10.3%), confirming the reports of high amounts of pectin and calcium oxalate in cladodes of prickly pear. The estimated potential of ethanol production for prickly pear (1490-1875 L ha-1 yr-1) was low when compared to traditional biomass sources (sugarcane and sugar beet, for example). However, it appears that prickly pear stands out as a biomass with potential for high production rates of methane (3717 m3 ha-1 yr-1), being comparable to traditional energy crops. Further studies are needed to assess more consistently both the sustainability of biomass production as the potential for ethanol, and biogas production, specially for newly released varieties of prickly pear. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accounting for co-products of vegetable oil production is essential in reviewing the sustainability of biodiesel production, especially since oil crops produce valuable protein-rich co-products in different quantities and qualities. Two accounting methods, allocation on the basis of energy content and system expansion, are compared. Significant differences in results exist between the methods where system expansion is to be preferred because it can take actual use of co-products into account. Results are very sensitive to the choices made in system expansion. Differences can be large, especially between a system expansion where primarily the use of co-products of the oil crops is taken into account and an expansion that also includes direct oil exchange of the vegetable oil used for biodiesel for the marginal oil in the market. © 2015.

AB  - The making of biofuel from source that aggregates multiple suitable raw materials is of great interest. An example of such source is macauba palm. Its fruit satisfies the demands for biodiesel production, and the solid residues resulting from its processing contain a series of potential fuel byproducts. Thus, our objective was to evaluate macauba fruit yield and the potential of this fruit to produce for solid biofuel. For this, the palm's productivity was assessed in a natural population, and two different scenarios of fruit yield and derived residues were analyzed: in scenario 1, the fruit yield average values were used without a priori information, while in scenario 2, the top 10% of plants in terms of number of bunch per plant were considered. Harvested fruits were quantified and processed. Solid residues had their chemical and physical characteristics determined. The fruit yield in scenario 2 was 98% higher than that in scenario 1, which did not exceed 2.32 Gg km-2 y-1 fresh fruit. Regarding residue characterization, the endocarp showed higher values of fixed carbon, lignin, bulk density and energy density than the other residues. The overall primary energies of the residues were 23.35 TJ km-2 y-1 and 44.39 TJ km-2 y-1 in scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. These findings indicate that macauba fruit is a promising source of primary and residual raw materials for biofuel production. Satisfactory production scale would be from a breeding program to maximize the fruit production of the plants, as mimicked by scenario 2. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Australian agricultural land use and production have evolved within an economic and environmental context that may change substantially in terms of productivity rates, resource scarcity and degradation, greenhouse gas abatement policy, climate change, and global demand. We used an integrated systems modelling approach to explore the response of Australian land use and agricultural production to these changes from 2013 to 2050. We found potentially large transitions in spatial and temporal patterns of land use, agricultural production, output rates, and profitability. New land uses such as carbon plantings, biofuels and bioenergy, and environmental plantings competed with food and fibre production, reducing its area. Global outlooks, including the strength of action on climate change and population assumptions, had a strong influence. Capacity constraints and adoption inertia reduced and delayed land use change. Agricultural production and land use were sensitive to productivity assumptions. Despite the competition for land from new land uses, agricultural production increased under most settings, with greatest impact from land use transitions concentrated on livestock production. Agricultural profits also increased under most settings due to higher prices and output rates. Negligible land use change was observed with carbon payments below $50 per tCO2-e, and significant change did not occur before 2030 in any but the unconstrained, high-abatement scenarios. We conclude that transformative land use change is plausible but high levels of food/fibre production can co-exist with non-food land uses motivated by market responses to global change and domestic policy. Thereby, the Australian land sector can continue its significant contribution to global food security while responding to new economic opportunities. Policy settings can influence these outcomes through reducing infrastructure constraints, strategies for enhancing adoption, and research and development in agricultural technology and productivity. Due to the long time frames required to change attitudes and land use and management practices, consideration of the possible impacts of global change on agriculture and potential policy responses is timely. © 2015.

AB  - Second generation bioethanol production from dried biomass of a common weed Parthenium hysterophorous was investigated using separate hydrolysis and fermentation method. The biomass was found to contain 53.63% of holocellulose, 10.44% lignin, 0.87% extractives, 26.06% others and 9.00% ash. The effects of pretreatment of the biomass with each of the three acids (hydrochloric, sulfuric and phosphoric) and two alkalis (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) under two temperature regimen (cold hydrolysis at room temperature and hot hydrolysis at 121 °C), followed by detoxification of inhibitors and treatment with different concentrations of cellulase enzyme were studied. Three yeast strains viz., Torulaspora delbrueckii R3DFM2, Schizosaccharomyces pombe R3DOM3 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae R3DIM4 were used for fermentation. The maximum yield of total reducing sugars obtained was 615 mg/g of the biomass. Yields of ethanol obtained on the detoxified lignocellulosic broth under optimal conditions were 0.24, 0.27 and 0.27 g/g biomass. The present work lends support to the use of Parthenium biomass as a viable source for second generation bioethanol production from non-agricultural feed stock. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One technique applied to restore degraded or contaminated soils is to use amendments made of different types of waste materials, which in turn may contain metals such as Cu, Pb and Zn. For this reason it is important to determine the capacity of the soil to retain these materials, and to compare the sorption capacity between an amended soil and another unamended soil. The aim of this study was to determine the chemical behaviour of these metals in the soil after applying the amendment, and how it affected the soil's sorption capacity. Another aim was to study the contribution of contaminating elements from the amendment itself. The amendments used in this studywere a mixture made ofwaste material (sewage sludges, sludges froman aluminiumplant, ash, food industry wastes, and sands from a wastewater treatment plant) and biochar (biomass of Acacia dealbata) (97%:3%) in different soil/amendment proportions. The soilwas froma mine tailing. The mine tailingswere amendedwith the mixture ofwaste and biocharwhich had a higher sorption capacity than the soil fromthe pond. The sampleswith amendment had a greater affinity for Cu, Pb and Zn than the mine soil. The results obtained show that adding a mixture made of waste and biochar favours the retention of Cu, Pb and Zn in mine tailing from metal mines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The environmental benefits and energy savings of the production of Jatropha fuels and operation in a typical LPV in India were examined. A baseline scenario and alternative optimised routes were assessed, considering different pathways of energy recovery from Jatropha coproducts. The following impact categories were assessed: Non-Renewable Energy (NRE) consumption, Global Warming Potential (GWP), Terrestrial Acidification Potential (TAP) and Respiratory Inorganic Effects (RIE). At present, the life cycle impact of Jatropha production and use is competitive with conventional diesel in terms of NRE and GHG emissions; however it results in higher local environmental impacts (RIE and TAP categories). Under optimised farming and processing practices and recovery of Jatropha coproducts either via co-generation, gasification or FT-diesel synthesis routes, Jatropha fuels reduce the impact of NRE, GHG, and RIE. The energy recovery paths to generate surplus electricity through generation and gasification routes show a better performance than FT-diesel synthesis routes in terms of NRE and GWP impacts. Nevertheless, in terms of local air pollution indicators, the FT-diesel synthesis route reveals the lowest emissions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Compost habitats sustain a vast ensemble of microbes specializing in the degradation of lignocellulosic plant materials and are thus important both for their roles in the global carbon cycle and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for advanced biofuels production. Studies have revealed substantial diversity in compost microbiomes, yet how this diversity relates to functions and even to the genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes remains obscure. Here, we used a metagenomic analysis of the rice straw-adapted (RSA) microbial consortia enriched from compost ecosystems to decipher the systematic and functional contexts within such a distinctive microbiome. Results: Analyses of the 16S pyrotag library and 5 Gbp of metagenomic sequence showed that the phylum Actinobacteria was the predominant group among the Bacteria in the RSA consortia, followed by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes. The CAZymes profile revealed that CAZyme genes in the RSA consortia were also widely distributed within these bacterial phyla. Strikingly, about 46.1 % of CAZyme genes were from actinomycetal communities, which harbored a substantially expanded catalog of the cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, acetyl xylan esterase, arabinofuranosidase, pectin lyase, and ligninase genes. Among these communities, a variety of previously unrecognized species was found, which reveals a greater ecological functional diversity of thermophilic Actinobacteria than previously assumed. Conclusion: These data underline the pivotal role of thermophilic Actinobacteria in lignocellulose biodegradation processes in the compost habitat. Besides revealing a new benchmark for microbial enzymatic deconstruction of lignocelluloses, the results suggest that actinomycetes found in compost ecosystems are potential candidates for mining efficient lignocellulosic enzymes in the biofuel industry. © 2016 Wang et al.

AB  - NAC genes contribute to enhance survivability of plants under conditions of environmental stress and in secondary growth of the plants, thereby building biomass. Thus, genetic transformation of plants using NAC genes provides a possibility to tailor biofuel plants. Over-expression studies have indicated that NAC family genes can provide tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses, either by physiological or biochemical changes at the cellular level, or by affecting visible morphological and anatomical changes, for example, by development of lateral roots in a number of plants. Over-expression of these genes also work as triggers for development of secondary cell walls. In our laboratory, we have observed a NAC gene from Lepidium latifolium contributing to both enhanced biomass as well as cold stress tolerance of model plants tobacco. Thus, we have reviewed all the developments of genetic engineering using NAC genes which could enhance the traits required for biofuel plants, either by enhancing the stress tolerance or by enhancing the biomass of the plants. © 2016 Singh, Grover and Nasim.

AB  - Sustainable woody bio feedstock production systems require a reliable supply of woody biomass that could be affected by future climate change. However, there is limited understanding of the climatic sensitivity of short rotation woody crops, such as hybrid aspens. The general objective of this study is to identify climatically resilient hybrid aspen clones for woody biomass feedstock development. Specifically, tree-ring analysis methods (dendrochronology) were used to quantify the influence of climate on stem growth rates of hybrid aspens by measuring year-to-year changes in tree-ring width from different cultivars of hybrid aspen and relating annual growth patterns with past instrumental climate records (i.e., temperature and moisture index). Tree-ring analysis was conducted on a full-sib progeny plantation of different cultivars of hybrid aspens (Populus smithii derived from different geographical variants of aspen parents: trembling aspen (Populus × tremuloides) and big tooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) located on Michigan State University property in the Sandhill Research Area (42.7º N latitude; 84.5º Wlongitude). Overall, the hybrid aspen families examined in this study were more sensitive to moisture related stressors compared to a weaker or no response to temperature stressors. By the end of the 21st century (2071-2100), 11 out of the 18 hybrid aspen families will be vulnerable to future changes in moisture stress, while the remaining families were screened to be resilient to future changes in moisture stress. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Algae have attracted attention as sustainable producers of lipid-containing biomass for food, animal feed, and for biofuels. Parachlorella kessleri, a unicellular green alga belonging to the class Trebouxiophyceae, achieves very high biomass, lipid, and starch productivity levels. However, further biotechnological exploitation has been hampered by a lack of genomic information. Results: Here, we sequenced the whole genome and transcriptome, and analyzed the behavior of P. kessleri NIES-2152 under lipid production-inducing conditions. The assembly includes 13,057 protein-coding genes in a 62.5-Mbp nuclear genome. Under conditions of sulfur deprivation, lipid accumulation was correlated with the transcriptomic induction of enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, autophagy, and remodeling of light-harvesting complexes. Conclusions: Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (3D-TEM) revealed extensive alterations in cellular anatomy accompanying lipid hyperaccumulation. The present 3D-TEM results, together with transcriptomic data support the finding that upregulation of TAG synthesis and autophagy are potential key mediators of the hyperaccumulation of lipids under conditions of nutrient stress. © 2016 Ota et al.

AB  - Background: Sugar production via pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic feedstock, in this case softwood harvest residues, is a critical step in the biochemical conversion pathway towards drop-in biofuels. Mild bisulfite (MBS) pretreatment is an emerging option for the breakdown and subsequent processing of biomass towards fermentable sugars. An environmental assessment of this process is critical to discern its future sustainability in the ever-changing biofuels landscape. Results: The subsequent cradle-to-gate assessment of a proposed sugar production facility analyzes sugar made from woody biomass using MBS pretreatment across all seven impact categories (functional unit 1 kg dry mass sugar), with a specific focus on potential global warming and eutrophication impacts. The study found that the eutrophication impact (0.000201 kg N equivalent) is less than the impacts from conventional beet and cane sugars, while the global warming impact (0.353 kg CO2 equivalent) falls within the range of conventional processes. Conclusions: This work discusses some of the environmental impacts of designing and operating a sugar production facility that uses MBS as a method of treating cellulosic forest residuals. The impacts of each unit process in the proposed facility are highlighted. A comparison to other sugar-making process is detailed and will inform the growing biofuels literature. © 2016 Nwaneshiudu et al.

AB  - In the present work, bio-oil derived from the catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge has been blended in small amounts with sunflower biodiesel with the aim of evaluating its potential as a novel, low-cost, and renewable biodiesel additive that could replace costly commercial biodiesel antioxidants normally used to date. The effect of blending small amounts of bio-oil with sunflower biodiesel on the biodiesel properties (oxidation stability, cold flow properties, flash point, and viscosity) has been analyzed. Furthermore, apart from studying the effect of adding low bio-oil concentrations (0.1, 1.8, and 3.5 mass %), the effect of other operating conditions, specifically the temperature (278-333 K) and mixing time (5-60 min), during the bio-oil and biodiesel blend preparations has also been analyzed. With regard the oxidation stability, blends prepared adding 3.5% mass fraction of bio-oil complied with the limits imposed by the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. Blending sewage sludge bio-oil and sunflower biodiesel did not result in an enhancement of the biodiesel cold flow properties in the studied range, while the flash point of these blends was lower than that of pure sunflower biodiesel. The viscosity was barely affected in all cases. The oxidation stability enhancement achieved by the addition of bio-oil obtained from sewage sludge catalytic pyrolysis was higher than the enhancement obtained with bio-oil from non-catalytic pyrolysis. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Producing biofuel feedstock on marginal lands is a viable way to offset fossil fuel production, global warming, and other adverse environmental impacts, while at the same time performing positive ecosystem services by reclaiming unused areas with value producing activities. This research study explored low-input production of sunflower biodiesel feedstock on abandoned mine land (AML) from coal mining refuse treated with bauxite residue (alkaline clay) through the lens of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). An attributional LCA was conducted from the gate of an aluminum production facility (which produces the bauxite residue), through AML amelioration and low-input agricultural activities, to the gate of a biodiesel production facility. A 26 ha (ha) coal mine refuse pile located in Mather, PA, (91 km south of Pittsburgh), was used as an example location. Analysis of published agricultural data and greenhouse research led to a conservative sunflower oilseed yield of 500 kg/ha estimate, with a subsequent biodiesel yield of 190 kg/ha (217 l/ha). Results show substantial impact from the initial soil amendment process, however, when compared to complete restoration of the AML and other similar fuel production activities, overall environmental impacts over a twenty-year production cycle are sensible. An alternative allocation of the bauxite residue transport (i.e. associating transport impacts to aluminum industry) and addition of other fuel conversion pathways would show an improved energy return and better environmental outlook from biofuel production on AML. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, biomass-based EL (ethyl levulinate) was evaluated as an additional fuel to biodiesel and diesel. Physical and chemical properties, including intersolubility, cold flow properties, spray evaporation, oxidation stability, anti-corrosive property, cleanliness, fire reliability and heating value of twelve different EL-biodiesel-diesel blends were analyzed. The results show that the fuel blends that were in line with China's national standard for biodiesel blend fuel (B5) have similar physical and chemical properties to pure diesel with improved cold flow properties. Optimized fuel blends based on grey relational analysis and analytic hierarchy process were selected to evaluate engine performance and emissions using an unmodified diesel engine test bench. The results show that engine power and torque with the fuel blends were in general similar to those with diesel (less than 3% differences). Both brake specific fuel and energy consumption were lower with the fuel blends than with diesel, suggesting higher fuel conversion efficiencies for the fuel blends. HC (Hydrocarbon) and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions and smoke opacity reduced significantly with the fuel blends compared with diesel while NOx (nitrogen oxides) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions increased. Our study suggests that EL produced from lignocellulosic biomass could be used as a blending component with biodiesel and diesel for use in unmodified diesel engines and could potentially be a promising environment-friendly fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fermentation residues from biogas production are known as valuable organic fertilisers. This study deals with the effect of cattle slurry, co-digested cattle slurry, co-digested energy crops and mineral fertilisers on the activity and composition of soil microbiota. Furthermore, the effect of solid-liquid separation as a common pre-treatment of digestate was tested. The fertilising effects were analysed in an 8-week pot experiment on loamy sand using two crops, Amaranthus cruentus and Sorghum bicolor. Amaranth, as a crop with significantly higher P uptake, triggered stress for occurring soil microbes and thereby caused a reduction of microbial biomass C in the soil. Irrespective of the crop, microbial basal respiration and metabolic quotient were higher with the digestates than with the untreated slurry or the mineral treatments. Community level physiological profiles with MicroResp showed considerable differences among the treatments, with particularly strong effects of solid-liquid separation. Similar results were also found on a structural level (PCR-DGGE). Alkaline phosphatase gene analyses revealed high sensitivity to different fertilisation regimes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks have the potential to improve a wide range of ecosystem services while simultaneously reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Here, we report on the six-year production potential (above ground net primary production, ANPP), post-frost harvested biomass (yield), and gross harvest efficiency (GHE=yield/ANPP) of seven model bioenergy cropping systems in both southcentral Wisconsin (ARL) and southwest Michigan (KBS). The cropping systems studied were continuous corn (Zea mays L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), giant miscanthus (Miscanthus×giganteus Greef &amp; Deuter ex Hodkinson &amp; Renvoize), hybrid poplar (Populus nigra×P. maximowiczii A. Henry 'NM6'), a native grass mixture (5 sown species), an early successional community, and a restored prairie (18 sown species). Overall the most productive cropping systems were corn&gt;giant miscanthus&gt;and switchgrass, which were significantly more productive than native grasses≈restored prairie≈early successional≈and hybrid poplar, although some systems (e.g. hybrid poplar) differed significantly by location. Highest total ANPP was observed in giant miscanthus (35.2±2.0 Mg ha-1yr-1) at KBS during the sixth growing season. Six-year cumulative biomass yield from hybrid poplar at KBS (55.4±1.3 Mg ha-1) was high but significantly lower than corn and giant miscanthus (65.5±1.5, 65.2±5.5 Mg ha-1, respectively). Hypothesized yield advantages of diversity in perennial cropping systems were not observed during this period. Harvested biomass yields were 60, 56, and 44% of ANPP for corn, perennial grass, and restored prairie, respectively, suggesting that relatively simple changes in agronomic management (e.g. harvest timing and harvest equipment modification) may provide significant gains in bioenergy crop yields. Species composition was an important determinant of GHE in more diverse systems. Results show that well-established, dedicated bioenergy crops are capable of producing as much biomass as corn stover, but with fewer inputs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Replacing annual row crops with perennial grasses for bioenergy represents a landscape-level change in species composition, with the potential to impact annual soil nutrient removal on a regional scale. In this study we measured the concentration of ten essential nutrients in harvested material from three potential perennial bioenergy crops: Panicum virgatum L., Miscanthus×. giganteus, and a reestablished prairie to determine annual soil nutrient removals. We compared perennial bioenergy crops to nutrient removals by annual cropping systems of Zea mays L. (maize) and Glycine max L. (soybean) in Illinois. Crops were grown under management practices typical for the Midwest, US. In addition, we examined geographic variation in nutrient removal of M.×. giganteus at four US locations. Total removal of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn was significantly greater in maize than in any of the perennials. Removal of N, P, and K in M.×. giganteus was 3.7, 1.8, and 1.8% of the removal in maize, and 49.0, 17.4, and 31.9% of the removal in soybean respectively. At sites in Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, and New Jersey we found differences in N and K removal by M.×. giganteus that corresponded with differences in biomass. There was no effect of fertilization on M.×. giganteus biomass, but removal of N, S, and Mg increased and P removal decreased with increasing rates of urea fertilization. Cultivation of M.×. giganteus and switchgrass on land formerly used for row crops may reduce the need for nutrient additions and potential losses of nutrients to groundwater and the atmosphere. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar (BC) could be a potential candidate for the remediation of metal contaminated soil. Mechanistic understandings are needed for the appropriate selection of BC and investigating molecular microbial ecological interactions. The soybean stover-derived BCs were more effective in immobilizing Pb (88%) and Cu (87%) than the pine needle-derived BCs in a contaminated shooting range soil. The sequential chemical extractions indicated that BCs stimulated the geochemical transformation of metal species. Spectroscopic investigations using scanning electron microscopic elemental dot mapping and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic measurements showed that Pb in the BCs amended soils was immobilized by the formation of stable chloropyromorphite. Soil organic C and microbial activity were also enhanced by BC. The non-labile C fraction in the soil amended with BCs produced at 700. °C was increased. Biochars showed less impact on the bacterial community than feedstock biomass as promulgated by the pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The feedstock type (namely soybean stover and pine needles) was the main factor influencing the BCs efficacy on metals' (im) mobilization and bacterial health in soils. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a cellulosic biofuel feedstock, may promote soil C accumulation compared to annual cropping systems by increasing the amount and retention of root-derived soil C inputs. However, these inputs and stabilization thereof may differ by cultivar, and it is uncertain which root traits favor soil C input and stabilization rates. The aim of this study was to assess how different switchgrass cultivars impact soil C inputs and retention, whether these impacts vary with depth, and whether specific root length (SRL) explains these impacts. We collected soil to a depth of 30cm (10cm increments) from six switchgrass cultivars with root systems ranging from high to low SRL. The cultivars (C4 species) were grown for 27months on soils previously dominated by C3 plants, allowing us to quantify both total C and switchgrass-derived C accumulation in the bulk soil and in coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), silt-sized, and clay-sized fractions. The study led to two main results: (1) bulk soil C concentrations beneath switchgrass cultivars varied by 40% in the 0-10cm soil depth and by 70% in the 10-20cm soil depth, and cultivars with high bulk soil C concentrations tended to have relatively high C concentrations in the mineral soil fractions and relatively low C concentrations in the POM fractions; (2) there were significant differences in switchgrass-derived soil C between cultivars at the 0-10cm depth, where soil C inputs ranged from 1.2 to 3.2mgCg-1 dry soil. In addition, switchgrass-derived C was positively related to SRL when one outlier data point was removed. These results suggest that switchgrass cultivars differentially impact mechanisms contributing to soil C accumulation. © 2015.

AB  - Background: With the increasing global crude oil crisis and resulting environmental concerns, the production of biofuels from renewable resources has become increasingly important. One of the major challenges faced during the process of biofuel production is the low tolerance of the microbial host towards increasing biofuel concentrations. Results: Here, we demonstrate that the ethanol tolerance of Zymomonas mobilis can be greatly enhanced through the random mutagenesis of global transcription factor RpoD protein, (σ70). Using an enrichment screening, four mutants with elevated ethanol tolerance were isolated from error-prone PCR libraries. All mutants showed significant growth improvement in the presence of ethanol stress when compared to the control strain. After an ethanol (9 %) stress exposure lasting 22 h, the rate of glucose consumption was approximately 1.77, 1.78 and 1.39 g L-1 h-1 in the best ethanol-tolerant strain ZM4-mrpoD4, its rebuilt mutant strain ZM4-imrpoD and the control strain, respectively. Our results indicated that both ZM4-mrpoD4 and ZM4-imrpoD consumed glucose at a faster rate after the initial 9 % (v/v) ethanol stress, as nearly 0.64 % of the initial glucose remained after 54 h incubation versus approximately 5.43 % for the control strain. At 9 % ethanol stress, the net ethanol productions by ZM4-mrpoD4 and ZM4-imrpoD during the 30-54 h were 13.0-14.1 g/l versus only 6.6-7.7 g/l for the control strain. The pyruvate decarboxylase activity of ZM4-mrpoD4 was 62.23 and 68.42 U/g at 24 and 48 h, respectively, which were 2.6 and 1.6 times higher than the control strain. After 24 and 48 h of 9 % ethanol stress, the alcohol dehydrogenase activities of ZM4-mrpoD4 were also augmented, showing an approximate 1.4 and 1.3 times increase, respectively, when compared to the control strain. Subsequent quantitative real-time PCR analysis under these stress conditions revealed that the relative expression of pdc in cultured (6 and 24 h) ZM4-mrpoD4 increased by 9.0- and 12.7-fold when compared to control strain. Conclusions: Collectively, these results demonstrate that the RpoD mutation can enhance ethanol tolerance in Z. mobilis. Our results also suggested that RpoD may play an important role in resisting high ethanol concentration in Z. mobilis and manipulating RpoD via global transcription machinery engineering (gTME) can provide an alternative and useful approach for strain improvement for complex phenotypes. © 2016 Tan et al.

AB  - Sustainable transportation biofuels may require considerable changes in land use to meet mandated targets. Understanding the possible impact of different policies on land use and greenhouse gas emissions has typically proceeded by exploring either ecosystem or economic modelling. Here we integrate such models to assess the potential for the US Renewable Fuel Standard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector through the use of cellulosic biofuels. We find that 2022 US emissions are decreased by 7.0 ± 2.5% largely through gasoline displacement and soil carbon storage by perennial grasses. If the Renewable Fuel Standard is accompanied by a cellulosic biofuel tax credit, these emissions could be reduced by 12.3 ± 3.4%. Our integrated approach indicates that transitioning to cellulosic biofuels can meet a 32-billion-gallon Renewable Fuel Standard target with negligible effects on food crop production, while reducing fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. However, emissions savings are lower than previous estimates that did not account for economic constraints. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is one of the most important cereal crops globally and a potential energy plant for biofuel production. In order to explore genetic gain for a range of important quantitative traits, such as drought and heat tolerance, grain yield, stem sugar accumulation, and biomass production, via the use of molecular breeding and genomic selection strategies, knowledge of the available genetic variation and the underlying sequence polymorphisms, is required. Results: Based on the assembled and annotated genome sequences of Sorghum bicolor (v2.1) and the recently published sorghum re-sequencing data, ~62.9 M SNPs were identified among 48 sorghum accessions and included in a newly developed sorghum genome SNP database SorGSD (http://sorgsd.big.ac.cn). The diverse panel of 48 sorghum lines can be classified into four groups, improved varieties, landraces, wild and weedy sorghums, and a wild relative Sorghum propinquum. SorGSD has a web-based query interface to search or browse SNPs from individual accessions, or to compare SNPs among several lines. The query results can be visualized as text format in tables, or rendered as graphics in a genome browser. Users may find useful annotation from query results including type of SNPs such as synonymous or non-synonymous SNPs, start, stop of splice variants, chromosome locations, and links to the annotation on Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) sorghum genome database. In addition, general information related to sorghum research such as online sorghum resources and literature references can also be found on the website. All the SNP data and annotations can be freely download from the website. Conclusions: SorGSD is a comprehensive web-portal providing a database of large-scale genome variation across all racial types of cultivated sorghum and wild relatives. It can serve as a bioinformatics platform for a range of genomics and molecular breeding activities for sorghum and for other C4 grasses. © 2016 Luo et al.

AB  - Background: Integration of first- and second-generation ethanol production can facilitate the introduction of second-generation lignocellulosic ethanol production. Consolidation of the second-generation with the first-generation process can potentially reduce the downstream processing cost for the second-generation process as well as providing the first-generation process with energy. This study presents novel experimental results from integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production from grain and wheat straw in a process development unit. The results were used in techno-economic evaluations to investigate the feasibility of the plant, in which the main co-products were distiller's dried grains with solubles and biogas. Results: An overall glucose to ethanol yield, of 81 % of the theoretical, based on glucose available in the raw material, was achieved in the experiments. A positive net present value was found for all the base case scenarios and the minimal ethanol selling price varied between 0.45 and 0.53 EUR/L ethanol. The revenue increased with combined xylose and glucose fermentation and biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality. A decrease in the biogas yield from 80 to 60 % also largely affects the net present value. The energy efficiency for the energy content in products available for sale compared with the incoming energy content varied from 74 to 80 %. Conclusions: One of the two main configurations can be chosen when designing an integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production plant from grain and straw: that producing biogas or that producing distiller's dried grains with solubles from the xylose sugars. The choice depends mainly on the local market and prices for distiller's dried grains with solubles and biogas, since the prices for both co-products have fluctuated a great deal in recent years. In the current study, however, distiller's dried grains with solubles were found to be a more promising co-product than biogas, if the biogas was not upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. It was also concluded that additional experimental data from biogas production using first- and second-generation substrates are required to obtain improved economic evaluations. © 2016 Joelsson et al.

AB  - Land grabbing in Central America is driven primarily by agro-industries and mining. Tourism development and infrastructure are also important forces behind new processes of land acquisition. Examining land grabbing in Central America allows us to move beyond single-cause explanations of land grabs and shows that it is a complicated and multi-actor process occurring at many scales. Contemporary processes of land acquisition and land re-concentration in Central America are embedded in a historical continuum of indigenous dispossession by colonial powers, later by international corporations and more recently by a combination of domestic and international capital in which the domestic landed elites play an important role. Even when the size of scale of land acquisitions is smaller compared with other parts of the world, new processes of land deals in Central America impact thousands of peasant livelihoods. These impacts are related both to changing property to land and to grabbing control over resources with implications for among other things, food security, human health, employment conditions and taxes, resulting in violent agrarian conflicts. Future research on land grabbing in Central America should focus on how drug trafficking interacts with land deals, the role of domestic elites in mining deals, the legal, illegal and quasi-legal instances in which the State operates in alliance with corporations, private security forces and the military. © 2016 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).

AB  - The political geography of the global soybean complex is shifting. While the complex has long been controlled by US-based transnational corporations, new agribusiness actors, business logics and power relations rooted in South America and East Asia are emerging, based in part on commodity flexing. We explore how soybean flexing is shaping and being shaped by global restructuring of the soybean processing industry. Using the divergent histories and uses of soy in China and Brazil, we propose that in order to understand the changing soy landscape, we must examine the relationships between soy's multiple-ness and flexible-ness, the political economy of soy processing, and the relationships between crop ‘flexors’ – those powerful firms that control the soy complex – with each other and with governments. We demonstrate that the agribusiness actors who are gaining more control over the soy complex are doing so in part through flexing, and that the ability to flex may ultimately determine the trajectory of global agroindustrial restructuring. Finally, we raise questions and make suggestions for further research on flex crops. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In the context of rising resource demand, agricultural crops such as sugarcane are being promoted for their multiple uses in different commodity markets and as alternatives to fossil fuel equivalents (i.e. as a source of biofuel, bioelectricity and bioplastic). These commodities are also produced on an increasingly flexible basis, as sugarcane mills respond to price signals and switch between different crop uses. This paper offers a preliminary exploration into the politics of this latest development in the capitalist industrialization of agriculture. It does so by focusing primarily on flexing in Brazil and highlighting the role of the state in both creating markets for non-food products that sugarcane mills can now switch between and managing the tensions that arise from this. These tensions have concerned consumer prices for fuel, control of distribution infrastructure and conditions of land conversion, each prompting political interventions by the state. The paper then suggests how this same process is taking place, albeit shaped by different contexts, in Southern Africa and Cambodia. It concludes with some key questions for further research: is flexing eroding the distinction between crop regimes? How do primary processors decide what their product mix will be? And on what basis do state actors support flexing between agricultural products and investments in so-called bio-refineries? © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Flexible allocation of crops among food and non-food uses is a key driver of global agri-food system change. Focusing on United States corn production, I explore the dynamics of flex crops, scrutinizing agri-industrial relationships and the distribution of agri-food system value and control. I situate crop flexing as exchanging use value, as opposed to converting use into exchange value without altering the commodity's use. Asking ‘Flexible for whom?' in the context of agri-food system crises, I find: (1) flex crops exacerbate contradictory food security and over supply crises, and that the distribution of flexibility and benefit in the agri-food system they provide depends on the organization of labor; (2) crises of accumulation tie flex crops to agri-food system financialization, which subordinates use to exchange value, obfuscating their relationship and distancing agricultural products and uses from their basis in nature and labor; and (3) debates over US corn flexing illustrate the utility of focusing on power and politics in crop flexing decisions and demonstrate US corn flexing to be a fix for climate and accumulation crises. Findings suggest that examining the distribution of value and control and the positions of labor and nature in the agri-food system may be productive for global flex crop research and advocacy in the future. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biomass is one of the renewable energy sources on which policy makers are greatly dependent on since it is a flexible feedstock capable of conversion into electricity, transport liquid fuels and heat by chemical and biological processes on demand. Though numerous publications have examined the relationship of economic growth with renewable energy and other parameters, biomass energy has never been included in these studies. Then, this study examines the causal relationship within a multivariate panel cointegration/error correction framework which combines the cross-section and time series data while allowing for heterogeneity across different provinces. After employing panel data regression model ranging from 2003 through 2012 to examine the relationships of biofuels production with sustainable development in China, the paper concludes that the development of biofuel energy production integrated with the consideration of the improvement of income per capita, and the attraction of more capital investment, does make a significant contribution to economic growth. However, some negative side effects including the increase of greenhouse emissions and the decrease of marginal land still coexist with the economic development. Of course, the importance of these findings lies on their implications and their adoption on strategic policies. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biofuels are promoted as an alternative energy to replace fossil energy. However biofuel promotion has a number of negative impacts that require government actions. Those impacts include land grabbing, food security, and environmental problems from monoculture. This study aims to analyze ASEAN governments’ actions on the impacts of biofuel promotion in CLMV using Galtung’s coreperiphery model. The preliminary results reveal that biofuel promotion of ASEAN countries reflects the relationship between related groups in the biofuel business, at national and international levels. Thus, such biofuel promotion may not be targeted mainly for energy security enhancement as those countries have claimed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Indian sugarcane crop cultivation forms an important part of the Indian agricultural economy. Production of sugar has shown a phenomenal increase in the last 65 years. One of the byproducts of sugar industry is pressmud, a solid residue, obtained from sugarcane juice before crystallization of sugar. Generally pressmud is used as manure in India. It is an industrial waste available from the sugar mills. For every 100 tonnes of sugarcane crushed about 3 tones of pressmud cake is left behind as by-product. Sugarcane is a renewable, natural agricultural resource because it provides sugar, besides biofuel, fibre, fertilizer and myriad of byproducts/co-products with ecological sustainability. Vermicomposting of pressmud is an efficient method of waste disposal, enabling recycling of organic matter. The organic substrates in solid waste can be biodegraded and stabilized by composting and the final compost products could be applied to land as the organic fertilizer or soil conditioner. This organic compost enhanced the productivity and sustainability of agriculture. The pressmud is very useful for agricultural crops and horticulture because of its richness in various micronutrients. When the cost of chemical fertilizer is skyrocketing and not affordable by farmers, pressmud has promise as a source of plants nutrients. So conserving the sugarcane biodiversity is dire need of hour presently. The present review paper deals with the following topics: characterization of pressmud and its uses and importance, vermicomposting of Pressmud, biodiversity conservation of sugarcane. © 2020, Connect Journal.

AB  - Background: Microbial consortia represent promising candidates for aiding in the development of plant biomass conversion strategies for biofuel production. However, the interaction between different community members and the dynamics of enzyme complements during the lignocellulose deconstruction process remain poorly understood. We present here a comprehensive study on the community structure and enzyme systems of a lignocellulolytic microbial consortium EMSD5 during growth on corn stover, using metagenome sequencing in combination with quantitative metaproteomics. Results: The taxonomic affiliation of the metagenomic data showed that EMSD5 was primarily composed of members from the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) annotation revealed that representatives of Firmicutes encoded a broad array of enzymes responsible for hemicellulose and cellulose deconstruction. Extracellular metaproteome analysis further pinpointed the specific role and synergistic interaction of Firmicutes populations in plant polysaccharide breakdown. In particular, a wide range of xylan degradation-related enzymes, including xylanases, β-xylosidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases and acetyl xylan esterases, were secreted by diverse members from Firmicutes during growth on corn stover. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we identified the differential secretion pattern of a core subset of enzymes, including xylanases and cellulases with multiple carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). In addition, analysis of the coordinate expression patterns indicated that transport proteins and hypothetical proteins may play a role in bacteria processing lignocellulose. Moreover, enzyme preparation from EMSD5 demonstrated synergistic activities in the hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover by commercial cellulases from Trichoderma reesei. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the corn stover-adapted microbial consortium EMSD5 harbors a variety of lignocellulolytic anaerobic bacteria and degradative enzymes, especially those implicated in hemicellulose decomposition. The data in this study highlight the pivotal role and cooperative relationship of Firmicutes members in the biodegradation of plant lignocellulose by EMSD5. The differential expression patterns of enzymes reveal the strategy of sequential lignocellulose deconstruction by EMSD5. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism by which consortium members orchestrate their array of enzymes to degrade complex lignocellulosic biomass. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Since our growth, the human-made activities for better living damage the global environment. Biodiversity is no exception that damages due to massive humanization process. This study focused on the relationship between biofuels consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and biodiversity in a panel of 12 selected biofuels consuming countries for a period of 2000-2013. The study employed panel fixed effect and panel random effect model to obtain the parameter estimates. The results found that biofuels consumption and carbon dioxide emissions both damage the biodiversity in a panel of countries. The results confirm the cointegration relationship between the variables. The quest for the renewable energy fuels for human development remains the keen agenda for the policy makers, however, the war for better health and wealth always exhausts the natural environment of the world's precious natural resources that should be taken into account in the next call for alerts.

AB  - Fuel deficiency is one of the severe threats confronted by the whole world. This foreshadows about a situation where the resources would be insufficient to meet the energy requirements of industries, automobiles, and household equipments. Biofuels have been attracting the scientific world with its properties similar to that of fossil fuels and the capability to get renewed. Alga is widely studied owing to its high lipid content and potential to produce larger quantity of oil than other crops. When compared to food crops and other raw materials, alga is the best feedstock for biodiesel. The requisites for algae cultivation can be met easily which are fewer than that for food crops. But some hurdles are inhibiting the high productivity of algae and profitable algae farming. Lack of suitable sites is the major sticking point that hauls the production of biodiesel to the lowest. This article discusses the survey conducted for the selection of sites pertinent for large-scale algae growth aiming at a high yield of biodiesel. Maps of surveyed locations and charts showing the importance of algae cultivation have been included. The manuscript elaborates the geographical features of each location and shows their aptness to be selected as algae farming sites. Comparison of oil yield from different crops has been shown through graphs. Information regarding algae, similarity of biodiesel to petroleum products, implementation of algae as the feedstock for biodiesel, different processing techniques available for biodiesel production via extraction of oil from algae etc is also comprised in the article.

AB  - Kraft pulp and paper mills have several advantages for serving the emerging biorefinery industry as a source of raw materials. This review examines technologies for producing liquid biofuels, chemicals, and advanced materials from woody feedstocks to generate new sources of revenue. Market pull comes in part from government policies that drive substitution of petroleum-based products with biobased equivalents. Kraft mills have ample networks to supply feedstocks, whether these are forest residues or byproduct side streams. Pulp mills are well suited to expand sufficiently to accommodate production of value added platform chemicals that are in demand because of brand owner sustainability commitments. © 2016.

AB  - This study investigated to understand the trend of international commercializing technologies and industrial status of the transportation biofuel based on lignocellulosic biomass. Two major commercializing technologies for the lignocellulosic biofuel are biochemical conversion technology and thermochemical conversion technology. It was reported that a total of 93 industrial companies were using lignocellulosic biomass of all facilities related to advanced biofuel. On the basis of commercial type, the biochemical conversion technology was identified to be the major technology in the lignocellulosic biofuel industries, showing 84% of all. Also the main products of commercial type industrial companies are bioethanol (1,155,000 tons/yr) and bio-oil (120,000 tons/yr), which are in a remarkably inadequate amount to substitute for the transportation biofuel worldwide. It was suggested that the transportation biofuel market was currently in need of further development in both technology and scale, and was in high demands of technological development and commercializing exertion.

AB  - The life cycle assessment (LCA) and the well-to-wheels approach were employed to evaluate life cycle emissions from the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) TransMilenio compared to other modes of passenger transportation in Bogota Colombia. Particularly OpenLCA software the Ecoinvent database and all the information available in the city were used to conduct LCA. The impact category climate change (CO2 eq) and PM2.5 CO and NOx emissions were assessed. Results indicate that public transport buses including BRT produce the lowest emissions of CO2 eq CO and NOx while the lowest PM2.5 emissions were obtained by an electric BRT and buses powered by natural gas. The highest PM2.5 emissions were observed in motorcycles and private cars while taxis present the highest NOx emissions. If TransMilenio buses change from diesel to electricity CO2 eq and PM2.5 emissions would be reduced by 86% and 88% respectively.

AB  - The field trial was conducted during 2012-13 at Punjab Agricultural University seed farm, Ladhowal, Ludhiana located in central plains of Punjab. Twenty-two willow clones were planted in a randomized block design with three replications, to study the growth and genetic performance of different clones. The data was recorded for plant height, collar diameter, leaf area, leaf less days and number of branches. All the characters under study exhibited significant differences among different clones. On the basis of plant height and collar diameter, clone UHFS-13 showed the maximum growth (4.00 m and 3.57 cm, respectively) and overall performance of other best clones was in the order of UHFS-14, UHFS-3, UHFS-12 and UHFS-19. The values of genotypic variability for different traits were between low (8.57%) in collar diameter to high (36.33%) in leaf area and for phenotypic variability between moderate (16.78%) in plant height to high (40.14%) in leaf area. Values of heritability and genetic gain were observed between low to high. On phenological basis, clone UHFS-2, UHFS-5, UHFS-12 and UHFS-18 would be suitable for tree-crop combination, and clone UHFS-3, UHFS-13, UHFS-14 and UHFS-16 for biofuel or phyto-remediation and clone UHFS-10 with drooping branches for landscape purposes. © 2017, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - Biogas is a multi-purpose technology capable of harvesting renewable energy, converting organic wastes and supplying low-carbon biofuels for transport which all mitigate atmospheric carbon emissions. State-of-the-art biogas CHP technology is however characterised by relatively significant life cycle CO2 emissions intensity typically ranging from 200 to 450 gCO2eq/kWhe, depending on specific feedstocks and configurations. Due to high CO2 content in biogas, the direct biogenic CO2 emissions intensity of a biogas CHP plant is about 700 gCO2/kWhe, which is greater than the direct CO2 emissions intensity of natural gas combustion and it is comparable only with coal combustion. Therefore, in order to meet requirements of future low-carbon energy systems, solutions capable of cost-effectively mitigating various parasitic or even biogenic carbon emissions from biogas are needed. This study analyses the following categories of solutions alleviating CO2 emissions intensity of biogas technology: 1) anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter with increased CH4/CO2 selectivity; 2) biological H2 generation from organic matter; 3) AD with biogenic CO2 recycling; 4) biogas utilisation with facilitated CO2 sequestration; 5) low-carbon biofuels from biogas. For each of these categories solutions aiming at alleviating CO2 emissions intensity are provided and analysed. Finally, optimal embedding in the economic environment is discussed. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Biomethane is one of the biofuel sources produced from biogas which is an important source of renewable energy. Since it is an alternative and clean energy source, its implementation as fuel source applying established energy infrastructure is an attractive opportunity. However, biogas as a source of biomethane contains undesirable compounds, e.g., H2S, NH3, siloxanes, water, etc. and needs to be decontaminated before usage. Biogas cleaning technologies are presented from a material point of view along with their property modifications. A brief discussion of materials applied in technologies with a particular emphasis on biogas cleaning is followed by the alternative properties and possibilities of liquid and solid adsorbents as well as chemical reactions used for biogas cleaning to produce biomethane suitable as fuel source to replace or reduce fossil fuel consumption. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This paper presents a continuous-flow cell screening device to isolate and separate microalgae cells (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) based on lipid content using high frequency (50 MHz) dielectrophoresis. This device enables screening of microalgae due to the balance between lateral DEP forces relative to hydrodynamic forces. Positive DEP force along with amplitude-modulated electric field exerted on the cells flowing over the planar interdigitated electrodes, manipulated low-lipid cell trajectories in a zigzag pattern. Theoretical modelling confirmed cell trajectories during sorting. Separation quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted with time-course experiments and collected samples were analysed by flow cytometry. Experimental testing with nitrogen starveddw15-1 (high-lipid, HL) and pgd1 mutant (low-lipid, LL) strains were carried out at different time periods, and clear separation of the two populations was achieved. Experimental results demonstrated that three populations were produced during nitrogen starvation: HL, LL and low-chlorophyll (LC) populations. Presence of the LC population can affect the binary separation performance. The continuous-flow micro-separator can separate 74% of the HL and 75% of the LL out of the starting sample using a 50 MHz, 30 voltages peak-to-peak AC electric field at Day 6 of the nitrogen starvation. The separation occurred between LL (low-lipid: 86.1% at Outlet # 1) and LC (88.8% at Outlet # 2) at Day 9 of the nitrogen starvation. This device can be used for onsite monitoring; therefore, it has the potential to reduce biofuel production costs. © 2016, Emil J. Geiger, et al.

AB  - This paper aimed to study the environmental impacts throughout of the life cycle of the production process of ethyl biodiesel obtained from beef tallow. The reference flow adopted for the study was the generation of power supplied 1GJ from the produced biodiesel. The data used in the inventory life cycle were calculated based on similar scientific papers. Was chosen the CML 2001 as the method of assessment of environmental impacts. In all were analyzed nine categories of environmental impacts. The results show that the environmental impacts of the nine categories evaluated impacts two (land use and climate change) have higher environmental damage compared to the others. The results suggest further intensification in the measures of operational controls inherent in the process mainly related to agricultural stage (cattle breeding), due to greater contributions to environmental impacts.

AB  - Advanced generation biofuel production from lignocellulosic material (LCM) was investigated. A range of different thermo-chemical pre-treatments were evaluated with different LCM. The pre-treatments included; alkaline (5% NaOH at 50°C), acid (1% H2SO4 at 121°C) and autohydrolytical methods (200°C aqueous based hydrothermal) and were evaluated using samples of miscanthus, wheat-straw and willow. The liberation of sugars, presence of inhibitory compounds, and the degree of enhancement of enzymatic saccharification was accessed. The suitability of the pre-treatment generated hydrolysates (as bioethanol feedstocks for Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was also accessed using a phenotypic microarray that measured yeast metabolic output. The use of the alkaline pre-treatment liberated more glucose and arabinose into both the pre-treatment generated hydrolysate and also the hydrolysate produced after enzymatic hydrolysis (when compared with other pre-treatments). However, hydrolysates derived from use of alkaline pre-treatments were shown to be unsuitable as a fermentation medium due to issues with colloidal stability (high viscosity). Use of acid or autohydrolytical pre-treatments liberated high concentrations of monosaccharides regardless of the LCM used and the hydrolysates had good fermentation performance with measurable yeast metabolic output. Acid pre-treated wheat straw hydrolysates were then used as a model system for larger scale fermentations to confirm both the results of the phenotypic microarray and its validity as an effective high-throughput screening tool. © 2016 BRTeam.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the status of policy design and policy implementation in the biofuel sector in Ireland. The focus of the work addresses the overarching operational context of the biofuel sector in Ireland and the role of different actors in shaping and resolving inconsistencies in policy outlook and practice. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a qualitative research approach involving a series of semi-structured interviews with members of the relevant sub-groups concerned. This study sought to address two questions – whether current or proposed policy is likely to affect consumption of indigenous biofuel feedstocks in the biofuel sector and what are the controlling factors in the demand for indigenous feedstocks for biofuel. Findings: Outcomes suggest that while Irish government policy recognises the need to support the development of renewable energy, it also operates under a number of parallel and potentially inconsistent paradigms in relation to biofuels as a renewable energy commodity. It is contended that the outcome of this position is a lack of coherent and coordinated policy in the area of biofuel production, including second generation biofuel using indigenous feedstocks. Originality/value: This paper provides a new cross sectoral perspective on the status of biofuel policy in Ireland with particular reference to second generation biofuel feedstocks. It focuses analysis on the nature of policy-operational inconsistencies and the need for a deeper ecological perspective in governance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for the decision-makers/stakeholders to design biofuel supply chain under uncertainties. Life cycle energy and CO2 emission of biofuel supply chain are employed as the objective functions, multiple feedstocks, multiple transportation modes, multiple sites for building biofuel plants, multiple technologies for biofuel production, and multiple markets for biofuel distribution are considered, and the amount of feedstocks in agricultural system, transportation capacities, yields of crops, and market demands are considered as uncertainty variables in this study. A bi-objective interval mix integer programming model has been developed for biofuel supply chain design under uncertainties, and the bio-objective interval programming method has been developed to solve this model. An illustrative case of a multiple-feedstock-bioethanol system has been studied by the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed model can help decision-makers/stakeholders plan and design the biofuel supply chain by proposing feasible solutions to them. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane cultivation has expanded in south-eastern Brazil in the last decade, mainly for biofuel (ethanol) production. This expansion has occurred on land that was originally covered with pasture and used for livestock production. The purpose of this study is to experimentally determine the impact on runoff and erosion produced by replacing pasture with sugarcane. Runoff plots of 100 m2 were established at a farm in Itirapina, Sao Paulo (SP), Brazil, on a hill with a 9% slope and sandy soil. An 18-year-old pasture and a new sugarcane plantation were studied. The degrees of runoff and erosion were determined after each rain event for the first year of cultivation. From 1,459 mm of annual rainfall, the pasture had lower runoff than the sugarcane cover (40.5 vs 56.1 mm, respectively). Soil erosion under pasture was lower than sugarcane, where the highest values were recorded at the beginning of the rainy season, just after cane planting. In the first year, the results indicate an increase in soil loss of almost 500% for sugarcane compared to pasture, from 0.58 to 2.58 Mg ha-1 year-1 under our experimental conditions. Overall, changing land cover from pasture to sugarcane increases soil erosion. © 2016, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal. All rights reserved.

AB  - South Africa produces synthetic ethanol and to date there are no commercial bioethanol production plants in operation in the country. Sugarcane, as well as residues from sugarcane, maize, sorghum, wheat and barley are among the acceptable bioethanol feedstocks in South Africa. As the feedstock cultivation areas are scattered over a wide geographical land area, and the potential bioethanol feedstocks have low energy density, there is a need to locate the processing facilities in strategic positions such that production and logistic costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to transportation are minimized. To address the above mentioned challenges associated with bioethanol production in South Africa, a mathematical programming approach for the synthesis of optimal bioethanol supply network is developed. It accounts for sugar demands, production of bioenergy (ethanol, electricity and heat) and other byproducts, various feedstocks and their geographical distributions, etc. Various processing technologies for ethanol production are considered and two data sources for availabilities of feedstocks are used. Synthesis is performed by maximizing the economic objective, measured by annual profit. Evaluation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is also performed. Based on the results obtained, it would be possible, in terms of economics, to meet and surpass the 2 % target penetration of biofuel into the South African national liquid fuel supply stipulated by the government. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Background: Xylan is the most abundant un-cellulosic polysaccharides of plant cell walls. Much progress in xylan biosynthesis has been gained in the model plant species Arabidopsis. Two homologous pairs Irregular Xylem 9 (IRX9)/9L and IRX14/14L from glycosyltransferase (GT) family 43 have been proved to play crucial roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis. However, xylan biosynthesis in grass such as Miscanthus remains poorly understood. Results: We characterized seven GT43 members in M. lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy crop. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the expression of MlGT43 genes was ubiquitously detected in the tissues examined. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that MlGT43A-B and MlGT43F-G were specifically expressed in sclerenchyma, while MlGT43C-E were expressed in both sclerenchyma and parenchyma. All seven MlGT43 proteins were localized to Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of MlGT43A-E but not MlGT43F and MlGT43G in Arabidopsis irx9 fully or partially rescued the mutant defects, including morphological changes, collapsed xylem and increased xylan contents, whereas overexpression of MlGT43F and MlGT43G but not MlGT43A-E complemented the defects of irx14, indicating that MlGT43A-E are functional orthologues of IRX9, while MlGT43F and MlGT43G are functional orthologues of IRX14. However, overexpression of all seven MlGT43 genes could not rescue the mucilage defects of irx14 seeds. Furthermore, transient transactivation analyses of MlGT43A-E reporters demonstrated that MlGT43A and MlGT43B but not MlGT43C-E were differentially activated by MlSND1, MlMYB46 or MlVND7. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that all seven MlGT43s are functionally conserved in xylan biosynthesis during secondary cell wall formation but diversify in seed coat mucilage xylan biosynthesis. The results obtained provide deeper insight into xylan biosynthesis in grass, which lay the foundation for genetic modification of grass cell wall components and structure to better suit for next-generation biofuel production. © 2016 Wang et al.

AB  - Background: Cyanobacteria are phototrophic prokaryotes that convert inorganic carbon as CO2 into organic compounds at the expense of light energy. They need only inorganic nutrients and can be cultivated to high densities using non-arable land and seawater. This has made cyanobacteria attractive organisms for the production of biofuels and chemical feedstock. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is one of the most widely used cyanobacterial model strains. Based on its available genome sequence and genetic tools, Synechocystis has been genetically modified to produce different biotechnological products. Efficient isoprene production is an attractive goal because this compound is widely used as chemical feedstock. Results: Here, we report on our attempts to generate isoprene-producing strains of Synechocystis using a plasmidbased strategy. As previously reported, a codon-optimized plant isoprene synthase (IspS) was expressed under the control of different Synechocystis promoters that ensure strong constitutive or light-regulated ispS expression. The expression of the ispS gene was quantified by qPCR and Western blotting, while the amount of isoprene was quantified using GC-MS. In addition to isoprene measurements in the headspace of closed culture vessels, single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPI-MS) was applied, which allowed online measurements of isoprene production in open-cultivation systems under various conditions. Under standard conditions, a good correlation existed between ispS expression and isoprene production rate. The cultivation of isoprene production strains under NaCl-supplemented conditions decreased isoprene production despite enhanced ispS mRNA levels. The characterization of the metabolome of isoprene-producing strains indicated that isoprene production might be limited by insufficient precursor levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of mRNA and regulatory RNAs characteristic of acclimation to metabolic stress. Conclusions: Our best production strains produced twofold higher isoprene amounts in the presence of low NaCl concentrations than previously reported strains. These results will guide future attempts to establish isoprene production in cyanobacterial hosts. © 2016 Pade et al.

AB  - Background: Thermophilic enzymes have attracted much attention for their advantages of high reaction velocity, exceptional thermostability, and decreased risk of contamination. Exploring efficient thermophilic glycoside hydrolases will accelerate the industrialization of biofuels and biochemicals. Results: A multifunctional glycoside hydrolase (GH) CoGH1A, belonging to GH1 family with high activities of β-D-glucosidase, exoglucanase, β-D-xylosidase, β-D-galactosidase, and transgalactosylation, was cloned and expressed from the extremely thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis. The enzyme exerts excellent thermostability by retaining 100 % activity after 12-h incubation at 75 ° C. The catalytic coefficients (kcat/Km) of the enzyme against pNP-β-D-galactopyranoside, pNP-β-D-glucopyranoside, pNP-β-D-cellobioside, pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside, and cellobiose were, respectively, 7450.0, 2467.5, 1085.4, 90.9, and 137.3 mM-1 s-1. When CoGH1A was supplemented at the dosage of 20 Ucellobiose g-1 biomass for hydrolysis of the pretreated corn stover, comparing with the control, the glucose and xylose yields were, respectively, increased 37.9 and 42.1 %, indicating that the enzyme contributed not only for glucose but also for xylose release. The efficiencies of lactose decomposition and synthesis of galactooligosaccharides (GalOS) by CoGH1A were investigated at low (40 g L-1) and high (500 g L-1) initial lactose concentrations. At low lactose concentration, the time for decomposition of 83 % lactose was 10 min, which is much shorter than the reported 2-10 h for reaching such a decomposition rate. At high lactose concentration, after 50-min catalysis, the GalOS concentration reached 221 g L-1 with a productivity of 265.2 g L-1 h-1. This productivity is at least 12-fold higher than those reported in literature. Conclusions: The multifunctional glycoside hydrolase CoGH1A has high capabilities in saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass, decomposition of lactose, and synthesis of galactooligosaccharides. It is a promising enzyme to be used for bioconversion of carbohydrates in industrial scale. In addition, the results of this study indicate that the extremely thermophilic bacteria are potential resources for screening highly efficient glycoside hydrolases for the production of biofuels and biochemicals. © 2016 Peng et al.

AB  - Biogas is a multi-purpose technology capable of harvesting renewable energy, converting organic wastes and supplying low-carbon biofuels for transport which all mitigate atmospheric carbon emissions. State-of-the-art biogas CHP technology is however characterised by relatively significant life cycle CO2 emissions intensity typically ranging from 200 to 450 gCO2eq/kWhe, depending on specific feedstocks and configurations. Due to high CO2 content in biogas, the direct biogenic CO2 emissions intensity of a biogas CHP plant is about 700 gCO2/kWhe, which is greater than the direct CO2 emissions intensity of natural gas combustion and it is comparable only with coal combustion. Therefore, in order to meet requirements of future low-carbon energy systems, solutions capable of cost-effectively mitigating various parasitic or even biogenic carbon emissions from biogas are needed. This study analyses the following categories of solutions alleviating CO2 emissions intensity of biogas technology: 1) anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter with increased CH4/CO2 selectivity; 2) biological H2 generation from organic matter; 3) AD with biogenic CO2 recycling; 4) biogas utilisation with facilitated CO2 sequestration; 5) low-carbon biofuels from biogas. For each of these categories solutions aiming at alleviating CO2 emissions intensity are provided and analysed. Finally, optimal embedding in the economic environment is discussed. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of dairy manure has environmental benefits, but the impact of effluent (i.e., digestate [DG]) application on environmental nitrogen (N) losses from soils has not been well quantified. Our objective was to evaluate how field application of DG affected nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3) leaching compared with raw dairy manure (RM) in spring versus fall applications. We measured N losses year-round for 2.5 yr in silage corn on tile-drained clay soil in Alfred, Ontario, Canada. Treatments were: digestate applied in spring (DS) and fall (DF), raw dairy manure applied in spring (RS) and fall (RF), urea applied in spring, and a control. Overall, the source of N had no effect on annual N2O emissions (overall average DG and RM, 4.9 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1), but more NO3 leached from DS than RS treatments (8.8 and 4.8 kg NO3-N ha-1 yr-1 on average, respectively). Estimated indirect N2O emissions from leached NO3-N were small (&lt;0.2 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1). Timing of application did not affect annual N2O emissions but did shift emissions to the non-growing season for fall applications (65% on average) and to the growing season for spring applications (60% on average). Overall environmental N losses (N2O-N + NO3-N) from DG were similar to RM when applied at the same time. For the conditions of our study, downstream emissions from anaerobic digestion (i.e., emissions induced by applied digestate) do not present an adverse trade-off to the environmental benefits incurred during the biogas production phase. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - The Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA) is examining the feasibility of a woody biomass-tobiofuels supply chain in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. A part of the ongoing feasibility study involved conducting a survey of informed stakeholders on the use of woody biomass from forest residuals in producing sustainable bioenergy. Survey findings indicated that the more knowledgeable stakeholders considered themselves, the more supportive of biofuel-related activities they were. Also, survey respondents generally wanted to be able to obtain information on the topic on their own and at their own convenience, such as by accessing a website, and through face-to-face forums, where they could ask questions. © 2016 Extension Journal Inc.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a native, long-lived, warm-season perennial grass that is well adapted, has potential for biofuel production, and can improve soil chemical and physical properties. It can be difficult to establish, but it can be productive in marginally productive or difficult to cultivate lands, and its root system can aid in soil conservation. The objectives of this 2-year field experiment were to determine the effects of seedbed preparation (burning, mowing, or tilling) and planting depth (0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 inches) on the establishment and yield of 'EG 1101' switchgrass. Planting between 0.25 and 0.5 inch generally resulted in more seedlings and greater stand percent and yield than 1.0-inch depth. Tilling generally resulted in more initial seedlings at 30 days after planting (DAP) than no-till with burning or mowing, but stand percent (150 DAP) and yield (postfrost) were not affected by seedbed preparation later in the growing season. However, all seedbed preparations and planting depths produced successful switchgrass stands of &gt;1 seedling/ft2 and ≥50% stands. Producers planting on land susceptible to erosion could consider no-till planting after burning or mowing in order to reduce soil erosion and promote better soil structure and fertility without any loss in switchgrass productivity.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to assess the biogas potential of landfilled materials and to further validate the suitability of the enzymatic hydrolysis test EHT as a valuable alternative to substitute the standardised test currently in use (BMP). Both tests were applied to a range of landfill waste samples. The waste composition and volatile solids content (VS) profile together with the BMP test results showed that the biogas potential of the waste samples was directly related to their VS content, as expected. The positive correlation between the VS and the BMP test (r = 0.67) suggests that the first could be used as a primary indicator of biogas potential of waste samples. Nevertheless, it should be validated against the BMP test because, occasionally, the VS content does not equate to the biogas production. This was mainly due to the paper content of the samples which also correlates positively (r = 0.77) with the BMP biogas production. The EHT results showed a higher correlation with the BMP test (r = 0.91) than in previous studies which used a wider mixture of enzymes containing cellulase, hemicellulase and carbohydrase. This finding positions the EHT as a quick assessing method for the biodegradability of waste samples in future sample regimes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Euglena gracilis (E. gracilis) has recently been attracting attention as a potential renewable source for the production of biofuels, livestock feed, cosmetics, and dietary supplements. Research has focused on strain isolation, productivity improvement, nutrient and resource allocation, and co-product production, key steps that ultimately determine the economic viability and compatibility of the biomass produced. To achieve these characteristics, approaches to select E. gracilis mutants with desirable properties, such as high wax ester content, high growth rate, and high environmental tolerance for biodiesel and biomass production, are needed. Flow-based analysis and sorting can be rapid and highly automated but calls for techniques that can precisely control the position of E. gracilis with varying sizes and shapes in a tightly focused stream in a high-throughput manner. In this work, we use a stepped microchannel consisting of a low-aspect-ratio straight channel and a series of expansion regions along the channel height. We study horizontal and vertical focusing, orientation, rotational, and translational behaviors of E. gracilis as a function of aspect ratio (AR) and channel Reynolds number (Re). By making use of inertial focusing and local secondary flows, E. gracilis with diverse shapes are directed to a single equilibrium position in a single focal stream. As an application of on-chip flow cytometry, we integrate a focusing microchip with a custom laser-two-focus (L2F) optical system and demonstrate the detection of chlorophyll autofluorescence as well as the measurement of the velocity of E. gracilis cells flowing through the microchannel. © 2016 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - EU member states promote renewable energy in accordance with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive (red). The directive includes fully harmonized sustainability criteria for biofuels. These criteria apply, however, only when biofuel production and consumption are incentivized through financial support or schemes with renewable-energy obligations. The objective of this article is to explore the potential relevance of the sustainability criteria in the context of public procurement, e.g. when a public authority prioritizes the use of biofuels in transport services it purchases and wishes to include certain sustainability criteria. I conclude that red's sustainability criteria would not apply to most models of sustainable public procurement. With this comes the risk that biofuels are promoted in public procurement in contradiction to the ideals reflected in red. Hence, changes to EU biofuel law should be considered, perhaps even drawing from life-cycle models developed in procurement law. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Biofuels are promoted by governments as a replacement for fossil fuels in the transport sector. However, according to current scientific evidence, their use does not necessarily significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This article examines issues related to the regulation of biofuels' life-cycle GHG emissions. It finds that a regulatory gap exists at the international level, whilst regulation at the domestic level faces limits or is insufficient to fill this gap. It remains to be seen whether, taking into account the scientific complexities, coherent international rules for biofuels will be adopted. Until then, a polycentric regulatory approach on the use of biofuels, which addresses the sustainability problem at multiple scales, thereby enabling experimentation and cross-influence among different levels of standard-setting, will remain in place across the world. The current approach entails a potentially beneficial learning process on how to properly regulate biofuels. However, there is a risk that national regulators will promote biofuels without knowing or accounting exactly for the extent to which they contribute to greenhouse gas reductions. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - This paper presents an analytical model for analyzing the competition between biofuels and food. The model is based on the Cournot model in which two representative consumers of corn, one each for bioethanol and food, decide the consumption so as to maximize their utility. Comparing the equilibrium consumption with the optimal consumption shows that the market equilibrium where corn is used for both bioethanol and food is inefficient. The effects of a tax and a subsidy on consumption are then discussed to examine whether or not the optimal consumption can be achieved. The results demonstrate that the use of a tax can achieve the optimal consumption, whereas the use of a subsidy cannot.

AB  - Background: Bio-jet fuels compatible with current aviation infrastructure are needed as an alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel to lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Cradle to grave life cycle analysis is used to investigate the global warming potential and fossil fuel use of converting poplar biomass to drop-in bio-jet fuel via a novel bioconversion platform. Unique to the biorefinery designs in this research is an acetogen fermentation step. Following dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, poplar biomass is fermented to acetic acid and then distilled, hydroprocessed, and oligomerized to jet fuel. Natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification are proposed to meet hydrogen demands at the biorefineries. Separate well to wake simulations are performed using the hydrogen production processes to obtain life cycle data. Both biorefinery designs are assessed using natural gas and hog fuel to meet excess heat demands. Results: Global warming potential of the natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification bio-jet fuel scenarios range from CO2 equivalences of 60 to 66 and 32 to 73 g MJ-1, respectively. Fossil fuel usage of the natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification bio-jet fuel scenarios range from 0.78 to 0.84 and 0.71 to 1.0 MJ MJ-1, respectively. Lower values for each impact category result from using hog fuel to meet excess heat/steam demands. Higher values result from using natural gas to meet the excess heat demands. Conclusion: Bio-jet fuels produced from the bioconversion of poplar biomass reduce the global warming potential and fossil fuel use compared with petroleum-based jet fuel. Production of hydrogen is identified as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel use in both the natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification bio-jet simulations. Using hog fuel instead of natural gas to meet heat demands can help lower the global warming potential and fossil fuel use at the biorefineries. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Exploiting microalgae as feedstock for biofuel production is a growing field of research and application, but there remain challenges related to industrial viability and economic sustainability. A solution to the water requirements of industrial-scale production is the use of wastewater as a growth medium. Considering the variable quality and contaminant loads of wastewater, algal feedstock would need to have broad tolerance and resilience to fluctuating wastewater conditions during growth. As a first step in targeting strains for growth in wastewater, our study isolated microalgae from wastewater habitats, including urban stormwater-ponds and a municipal wastewater-treatment system, to assess growth, fatty acids and metal tolerance under standardized conditions. Stormwater ponds in particular have widely fluctuating conditions and metal loads, so microalgae from this type of environment may have desirable traits for growth in wastewater. Forty-three algal strains were isolated in total, including several strains from natural habitats. All strains, with the exception of one cyanobacterial strain, are members of the Chlorophyta, including several taxa commonly targeted for biofuel production. Isolates were identified using taxonomic and 18S rRNA sequence methods, and the fastest growing strains with ideal fatty acid profiles for biodiesel production included Scenedesmus and Desmodesmus species (Growth rate (d-1) &gt; 1). All isolates in a small, but diverse taxonomic group of test-strains were tolerant of copper at wastewater-relevant concentrations. Overall, more than half of the isolated strains, particularly those from stormwater ponds, show promise as candidates for biofuel feedstock. © 2016 Massimi & Kirkwood.

AB  - With the last round of negotiations under the Paris Conference of the Parties (COP) now completed, every country would be searching for avenues to meet the targets agreed upon in the COP. Among various options, biofuel development has historically been a preferred option in various countries and Canada (including Saskatchewan) is no exception to it. One of the major motivations of this development is to help the rural communities grow. Results of this study suggest that smaller rural economies in Saskatchewan do not grow under such an initiative, since they have a large degree of leakages. Thus, biofuel development helps more to larger nearby communities than smaller communities. Another aspect of rural development is increased farm level incomes. Both ethanol and biodiesel production activities indicate a favorable impact on farm net income in Saskatchewan. However, in order to develop sustainable biofuel program, some attention needs to be paid to other aspects. Included here are implications of such a development on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use changes, water use, subsidization and further stress on international food security. On the water use issue, examination needs to be made both for the feedstock used and production of biofuel. If the feedstock is through irrigated production, biofuel's desirability on this count is reduced. Estimated GHG emissions from biofuel production studied in a life cycle assessment format, suggest a major reduction is possible, although they are slightly lower if the production of feedstock affects land use changes. Although the issue of food security in the context of Saskatchewan or Canada has not been raised, internationally such concerns could arise depending on the scale of expansion of such production in various countries. © 2016 WIT Press.

AB  - Locating bioenergy crops on strategically selected subfield areas of marginal interest for commodity agriculture can increase environmental sustainability. Location and choice of bioenergy crops should improve environmental benefits with minimal disruption of current food production systems. We identified subfield soils of a tile-drained agricultural watershed as marginal if they had areas of low crop productivity index (CPI), were susceptible to nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching, or were susceptible to at least two other forms of environmental degradation (marginal areas). In the test watershed (Indian Creek watershed, IL) with annual precipitation of 852 mm, 3% of soils were CPI areas and 22% were marginal areas. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to forecast the impact of growing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), willow (Salix spp.), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman) in these subfield areas on annual grain yields, NO3-N and sediment exports, and water yield. Simulated conversion of CPI areas from current land use to bioenergy crops had no significant (p ≤ 0.05) impact on grain production and reduced NO3-N and sediment exports by 5.0 to 6.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Conversion of marginal areas from current land use to switchgrass forecasted the production of 34,000 t of biomass and reductions in NO3-N (26.0%) and sediment (33.0%) exports. Alternatively, conversion of marginal areas from current land use to willow forecasted similar reductions as switchgrass for sediment but significantly (p ≤ 0.01) lower reductions in annual NO3-N export (18.0 vs. 26.0%). © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Jatropha-based biofuels have undergone a rapid boom-and-bust cycle in southern Africa. Despite strong initial support by governments, donors, and the private sector, there is a lack of empirical studies that compare the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of Jatropha’s two dominant modes of production: large plantations and smallholder-based projects. We apply a rapid ecosystem services assessment approach to understand the impact of two Jatropha projects that are still operational despite widespread project collapse across southern Africa: a smallholder-based project (BERL, Malawi) and a large plantation (Niqel, Mozambique). Our study focuses on changes in provisioning ecosystem services such as biofuel feedstock, food, and woodland products that can have important effects on human well-being locally. Qualitative information is provided for other regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Although at this stage no impact is tremendously positive or negative, both projects show some signs of viability and local poverty alleviation potential. However, their long-term sustainability is not guaranteed given low yields, uncertain markets, and some prevailing management practices. © 2016 by the author(s).

AB  - Production of bioenergy from cellulosic sources is likely to increase due to mandates, tax incentives, and subsidies. However, unchecked growth in the bioenergy industry has the potential to adversely influence land use, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water resources. It may have unintended environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Against this backdrop, it is important to develop standards and protocols that ensure sustainable bioenergy production, promote the benefits of biofuels, and avoid or minimize potential adverse outcomes. This paper highlights agronomic information on switchgrass, a high-potential bioenergy feedstock, and the role of specialized certification programs. The existing sustainability standards and protocols were reviewed in order to identify key gaps that justify a certification program specifically for switchgrass-based bioenergy. The criteria and indicators that should be considered for such a certification program are outlined.

AB  - This paper presents a heuristic methodology for estimating the possible variation of the liquid biofuel potential of a region, an appraisal made for a future period of time. The determination of the liquid biofuel potential has been made up either on the account of an average (constant) yield of the energetic crops that were used, or on the account of a yield that varies depending on a known trend, which can be estimated through a certain method. The proposed methodology uses the variation of the yield of energetic crops over time in order to simulate a variation of the biofuel potential for a future ten year time period. This new approach to the problem of determining the liquid biofuel potential of a certain land area can be useful for investors, as it allows making a more realistic analysis of the investment risk and of the possibilities of recovering the investment. On the other hand, the presented methodology can be useful to the governmental administration in order to elaborate strategies and policies to ensure the necessity of fuels and liquid biofuels for transportation, in a certain area. Unlike current methods, which approach the problem of determining the liquid biofuel potential in a deterministic way, by using econometric methods, the proposed methodology uses heuristic reasoning schemes in order to reduce the great number of factors that actually influence the biofuel potential and which usually have unknown values. © 2016 by the Authors.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a promising crop for biofuel and forage production, having strong resilience to multiple stresses and being capable of thriving on marginal land. The main goals in sweet sorghum improvement are to increase biomass and sugar yield. We validated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling plant height, biomass, juice weight and Brix with 181 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Shihong137, a dwarf grain sorghum, and L-Tian, a tall sweet sorghum, under four environments. Seven QTLs for plant height, stem and leaf fresh weight, stem fresh weight and juice weight could be repeatedly identified across four environments. However, three of those major QTLs, qPH7-2, qSLFW9 and qSFW9, had strong epistatic effect. Many QTLs related to biomass production were co-localised with previously known height QTLs, suggesting that plant height is a major trait regulating biomass production. However, qSFW1-2, qSLFW6-1, and qSLFW6-2 were mapped to positions with no known height QTL. We also identified and validated stable qBrix2 across environments. This study provided a genetic basis for integrated approaches, including plant height, to improve sweet sorghum biomass and sugar production. © CSIRO 2016.

AB  - This article assesses the potential of introducing energy crops for the biofuel chain in rural areas based on a land suitability analysis. The most suitable areas for cultivation of energy crops were evaluated using a geographic information system (GIS) based on a cartographic database merged with pedoclimatic and structural factors. The land evaluation model was integrated into a multi-criteria framework for classifying the land on the basis of pedoclimatic and structural opportunities and constraints in a multidisciplinary approach. The model was applied to a case study in the province of Ferrara, northeastern Italy, considering three crops (sunflower, rapeseed, and soybean) for the production of biofuels as an alternative to traditional crops. The results indicated that, while the structural factors (farm size, mechanization level, and road network) presented intermediate and severe limitations in most of the territory, the agronomic and pedoclimatic factors showed no limiting values for the crops. The matching of pedoclimatic and structural factors determined that the most suitable crop was sunflower, with more than half of the area (55.3%) very suitable, while soybean was the crop most penalized by pedoclimatic factors. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Shea tree sawdust delignification kinetic data during alkaline peroxide pretreatment were investigated at temperatures of 120 °C, 135 °C, and 150 °C. The activation energy during delignification was 76.4 kJ/mol and the Arrhenius constant was calculated as 8.4 × 106 per min. The reducing sugar yield for the treated to the untreated biomass was about 22-fold. Enzymatic hydrolysis conditions studied were; time (72 h and 96 h), substrate concentration (20, 30, 40, and 50 g/L), and enzyme loadings (10, 25, 40, 50 FPU/g dry biomass), which showed the optimum conditions of 96 h, 40 g/L, and 25 FPU/g dry biomass at 45 °C hydrolysis temperature. At the optimized enzymatic hydrolysis conditions, the reducing sugar yield was 416.32 mg equivalent glucose/g treated dry biomass. After 96 h fermentation of treated biomass, the ethanol obtained at 2% effective cellulose loading was 12.73 g/L. Alkaline peroxide oxidation pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis improved the ethanol yield of the biomass.

AB  - Grass biomass is a potential feedstock for solid biofuel production. This paper presents the results of experiments conducted on Endocalcari-Epihypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-p-w-can) to evaluate the biomass yield, quality and bioenergy potential of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.). Two kinds of fertilizers mineral nitrogen (90 kg ha-1) and biogas waste (digestate) with the same amount of nitrogen and one-cut regime either in July or in October were chosen to estimate the biomass productivity and energy potential. The results of a two-year experiment suggest that the biomass yield and energy potential depended on the grass species and cultivation technology. Higher biomass and energy yields were produced by reed canary grass when harvested in July, while by tall fescue when harvested in October. Both grass species were most productive when fertilized with mineral nitrogen. Of the two grass species and harvesting dates tested, the highest biomass and energy yields were produced by reed canary grass swards harvested in July. It was proved that the highest content of lignin in the biomass led to the highest energy yield of swards. © 2016 Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the GHG emissions associated with producing bio-hydrocarbons via fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus. The feedstock is then upgraded to bio-oil products via hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking. Inventory data for this study were obtained from current commercial cultivation practices of Miscanthus in the UK and state-of-the-art process models developed in Aspen Plus®. The system boundary considered spans from the cultivation of Miscanthus to conversion of the pyrolysis-derived bio-oil into bio-hydrocarbons up to the refinery gate. The Miscanthus cultivation subsystem considers three scenarios for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates. These were assumed as follows: (i) excluding (SOC), (ii) low SOC and (iii) high (SOC) for best and worst cases. Overall, Miscanthus cultivation contributed moderate to negative values to GHG emissions, from analysis of excluding SOC to high SOC scenarios. Furthermore, the rate of SOC in the Miscanthus cultivation subsystem has significant effects on total GHG emissions. Where SOC is excluded, the fast pyrolysis subsystem shows the highest positive contribution to GHG emissions, while the credit for exported electricity was the main ‘negative’ GHG emission contributor for both upgrading pathways. Comparison between the bio-hydrocarbons produced from the two upgrading routes and fossil fuels indicates GHG emission savings between 68% and 87%. Sensitivity analysis reveals that bio-hydrocarbon yield and nitrogen gas feed to the fast pyrolysis reactor are the main parameters that influence the total GHG emissions for both pathways. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The waste cooking oils and fats (WCOF) from the catering industry were systematically evaluated in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. Results pointed out that the eight restaurant types found in the city produced 174 t of WCOF/year in the following proportion: 41 [%] formal restaurant, 24 [%] fast food, 8 [%] taquerias, 7 [%] antojitos, 6 [%] soup kitchens,6 [%] bars, 4 [%] gorditas and 4 [%] roast chicken shops. In addition, representative samples of WCOF coming from every restaurant type were characterized for biodiesel production, in terms of viscosity, oxidative stability, free fatty acid content, acid value, saponification number, moisture content and fatty acid composition. The physicochemical analysis suggests that all the WCOF produced in the city, except that coming from the fast food cooking, met the recommended free fatty acid levels and the acidity values for alkaline transesterification. Based on the population of the city an average production of 0.31 t/year of WCOF per 1000 inhabitants was estimated. Projecting this figure to the whole country of Mexico, 34.9 kt of this fuel would be obtained per year, which would avoid the emission of 92 kt/year of CO2and contribute to reduce pollution in the country. © 2016, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

AB  - Capacity-building plans for transportation systems must be resilient to disruptions and erroneous assumptions to protect performance outcomes as well as schedule and cost. An example is the future supply chain of aviation biofuels for industry, government, and military applications. The challenges include balancing the aims and assumptions of diverse stakeholders, including regulators, agencies, manufacturers, airlines, fuel companies, and agricultural and husbandry producers. Resilience analytics of the strategic plans should characterize both the influential trends and stressors and the robust initiatives. This paper demonstrates resilience analytics to address varied, evolving, and potentially conflicting stakeholder preferences in the life cycle of supply chains for aviation biofuels. Heterogeneous feedstocks can be converted to aviation biofuel, although several are more attractive across technological, environmental, and economic criteria. The choice of feedstocks for conversion to biofuel depends on balancing desired outcomes, including life-cycle costs, availabilities, proximities, environmental impacts, and the like. Resilience analytics enables prioritization of feedstocks and other supply chain initiatives, with prioritization that varies by scenario. A technology road map for near-and midterm investment horizons to establish aviation biofuels is described. Poultry waste products are explored by using the above methods for a particular region in the mid-Atlantic area of the United States.

AB  - The amines are basic compounds present in the atmosphere that react with acidic species forming particulate matter. Are generated during combustion process and can impact the human health and ecosystems. The use of biodiesel as a biofuel added to diesel is growing and it is necessary to study the impact of their use on the environment. Four primary aliphatic amines were studied in the ambient air of a bus station where vehicles circulate using B5 mixture. The amines have been determined by HPLC/PDA after derivatization with phenyl isothiocyanate in basic medium. Methyl, ethyl and buthylamine have been quantified. In the gas phase the average concentrations were 86.2; 102 and 224 ng m-3 of methyl, ethyl and buthylamine, respectively. On the fine fraction (&lt; PM2.5) the average concentrations were 2.9; 10.0 and 6.87 ng m-3 of methyl, ethyl and buthylamine, respectively. We can infer that the gaseous amines are emitted directly from the B5 combustion process; methyl and ethylamine in the PM2.5 may be resulting from gasparticle conversion and buthylamine distinguished from the source or formation process.

AB  - Production of biofuels has been one of the promising efforts in biotechnology in the past few decades. The perspective of these efforts can be reduction of increasing demands for fossil fuels and consequently reducing environmental pollution. Nonetheless, most previous approaches did not succeed in obviating many big challenges in this way. In recent years systems biology with the help of microorganisms has been trying to overcome these challenges. Unicellular cyanobacteria are widespread phototrophic microorganisms that have capabilities such as consuming solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide for growth and thus can be a suitable chassis for the production of valuable organic materials such as biofuels. For the ultimate use of metabolic potential of cyanobacteria, it is necessary to understand the reactions that are taking place inside the metabolic network of these microorganisms. In this study, we developed a Java tool to reconstruct an integrated metabolic network of a cyanobacterium (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803). We merged three existing reconstructed metabolic networks of this microorganism. Then, after modeling for biofuel production, the results from flux balance analysis (FBA) disclosed an increased yield in biofuel production for ethanol, isobutanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and propanol. The numbers of blocked reactions were also decreased for 2-methyl-1-butanol production. In addition, coverage of the metabolic network in terms of the number of metabolites and reactions was increased in the new obtained model. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Facing the global issues of dwindling oil reserves and global warming, the search for alternative green energy source has become a priority. Microalgal biofuels has been regarded as a potential sustainable energy source, due to the high oil yield per area of land, ease of culturing microalgae, zero net carbon emission and reduced competition for arable land. In this paper, five different lipid extraction methods were studied using dry biomass of the microalga Chlamydomonas sp. Folch et al. method gave the highest oil yield of 26.27 wt%. The extracted microalgal oil underwent transesterification process using immobilised lipases. The highest conversion achieved was 72.09% in the following optimized conditions: 0.100 g of immobilised enzymes and solvent to methanol volume ratio of 1:1 with tert-butanol as the organic solvent. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seeds of four castor bean landraces were obtained from different locations in Egypt. The seeds were investigated first for their physical properties and latter planted in the research farm of the soils and water Department, Nuclear Research Centre, Atomic Energy Authority, Egypt. The morphoagronomic properties and oil parameters were studied. After harvest, seeds of the four landraces were irradiated at 0,100,200, 300,400,500, 600, 700 and 800 Gy in gamma cell and fatty acid composition were studied. Based on seed size and color, four main landraces of dry dehiscent castor seed types were observed: gray small-seeded landrace (GSSL) (LI), brown medium-seeded landrace (BMSL) (L2), reddish medium-seeded landrace (RMSL) (L3) and brown large-seeded landrace (BLSL) (L4). The seed characters ranged from 0.18-0.71 g weight, 0.86-2.16 cm height, 0.46-1.30 cm width, and 0.11-0.57cm thickness. The red medium-seeded landrace resulted plants with greater height (320cm). The brown medium-seeded landrace recorded the tallest main spike (38.0cm), highest number of capsules spike-1 (39), maximum number of capsules plant-1 (743.7), highest seed yield plant-1 (1.10kg), highest seed yield ha-1 (1.75ton), and maximum oil yield ha-1 (648.1 kg). The gray small-seeded landrace produced seeds with the highest oil percentage (44.01%). The brown large-seeded landrace produced the heavier grains (68.06g). Five fatty acids were found in castor bean oil (palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and ricinoleic acid). A slight variation was noted in ricinoleic acid, which was the major component of castor oil ranging from 81.96 to 86.80%. The brown medium-seeded landrace that exhibited a high seed yield, oil content, and proper fatty acid composition will be further investigated for biodiesel production. The results also showed that the increase of radiation dose led to an increased proportion of saturated acids and decreased the contents of unsaturated acids. Copyright © EM International.

AB  - The issue of carbon (C) neutrality and the environmental advantages and variations in soil organic C (SOC) stocks under biofuel crops need to be addressed thoroughly and objectively. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the impact of annual biofuel crops (no-till maize, Zea mays L.; sorghum, Sorghum bicolor L.) and perennial lignocellulosic grasses (switch grass, Panicum virgatum L.; miscanthus, Miscanthus×giganteus; and prairie mix) on soil properties and SOC stock in central Ohio. Two years of perennial energy crops improved soil properties in terms of lower soil bulk density, higher porosity, improved water-stable aggregates (WSA), higher mean weight diameter, pH and electrical conductivity compared with those under maize and sorghum. The WSA in the 0-10 and 10-20cm soil layers were higher under miscanthus (94.7% and 91.8%, respectively) and switch grass (92.7% and 89.4%) than under maize (89.9% and 86.1%) and sorghum (85.1% and 85.4%). Macroaggregates (>0.25mm diameter) contained higher concentrations of C and nitrogen (N) than microaggregates. Macroaggregates in soil under sorghum and maize contained 17.3% and 14.2% less C and 22.8% and 15.2% less N in 0-10cm layer, and 29.8% and 24.2% less C and 22% and 7.1% less N in 10-20cm layer, than macroaggregates under switch grass (15.82gCkg-1 in 0-10cm and 14.06gCkg-1 in 10-20cm layers), respectively. The SOC stock in the 0-10cm layer, on an equivalent soil-mass basis, was significantly higher under switch grass (28.5MgCha-1) and miscanthus (28MgCha-1) than that under sorghum (24.8MgCha-1). Thus, only switch grass and miscanthus sequestered C, whereas other species had no or negative effect, with loss of soil C under sorghum in 2 years. There is a need for long-term studies and estimation of SOC stock in deeper layers to establish the SOC balance under biofuel crops. © CSIRO 2016.

AB  - This study develops water footprint scenarios for Europe for 2050, at the country level, based on projections regarding population and economic growth, production and trade patterns, consumption patterns (diets and bioenergy use) and technological development. The objective is to estimate possible future changes in the green, blue and grey water footprint (WF) of production and consumption, to analyze the main drivers of projected changes and to assess Europe's future dependence on water resources elsewhere in the world. We develop four scenarios, considering globalization versus regional self-sufficiency, and development driven by economic objectives versus development driven by social and environmental objectives. The study shows that the most critical driver of change affecting Europe's future WF is the consumption pattern. The WFs of both production and consumption in Western Europe increase under scenarios with high meat consumption and decrease with low-meat scenarios. Besides, additional water demands from increasing biofuel needs will put further pressure on European water resources. The European countries with a large ratio of external to total WF of consumption in 2000 decrease their dependencies on foreign water resources in 2050. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass biorefining can improve the economy of biofuel production through synthesizing multiple value-added products and minimizing waste production. In this study, Eruca sativa was evaluated as a biorefining feedstock. High free fatty acid oil was first pretreated through an esterification process and then applied to an alkaline transesterification reaction for biodiesel production. The effects of the operating conditions were studied to maximize the biodiesel production yield. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment was employed to improve biogas and ethanol production from the plant residues. The pretreatment at 100 °C for 60 min represented the most promising potential for ethanol production, resulting in over 215% improvement in the yield. The pretreatment at 0 °C was more successful than the pretreatment at 100 °C for the biogas production; however, the results were not universal. Even though in the case of the straw, the pretreatment for 60 min increased the methane production by 233% compared to untreated straw, it showed a negative effect on the anaerobic digestion of the seed cake. At the best conditions, 1 kg of Eruca sativa yielded 140 g biodiesel, 16.8 g glycerol, 76.2 g ethanol from the pretreated straw, and 60.0 L (39.3 g) methane from the untreated seed cake. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - In response to the negative externalities associated with the intensification of biofuel production; the spike in food prices in 2008 and threats to biodiversity, the European Union revised it biofuels policy to reduce its negative impact on the environment and food security. It did not, however, revise its renewable fuels policy which mandates ambitious consumption targets. The framework used to mitigate the negative externalities of environmental degradation (GHG emissions) and food insecurity through the diversion of land used for food production into the production of biofuels crops is Directive 2009/28/EC. The revised policy applies to the production of biodiesel imports from developing countries. The restrictions on land use and the proof required will make it difficult for developing countries to produce biodiesel for the EU market. The paper outlines the EU requirements and the problems developing countries will face in supplying biodiesel to the EU. Copyright © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Industrial wastes that are well pre-treated during related upstream industrial processes, such as cassava residuals and furfural residuals, are becoming promising feedstocks for producing biofuels. To better use these wastes, an approach must be flexible in their use during biologically based ethanol production. In the current study, three scenarios, including the cellulosic ethanol process, the starchy ethanol process, and the integration of 1 G and 2 G ethanol, were compared for ethanol production from CR, FR, and corn. Compared with the starch ethanol process, the cellulosic ethanol process and integration of 1 G and 2 G ethanol produced ethanol at a higher ethanol concentration and yield. Of the three processes, the integrated process utilized over 75% of polysaccharides when using multiple materials as feedstocks. Protein, cellulose, and starch were yield-determining components in the high-solid integration process. Protein provided important nutrients for yeast cells. The influences of cellulose and starch were associated with product inhibition of cellulases and viscosity. Lignin had a low or negligible influence. For an integration process at a 20% (w/w) substrate loading, the optimum concentrations of protein, cellulose, and starch included &gt;1%, from 4% to 5%, and from 8% to 11%, respectively. At the optimum concentrations, the integration process obtained a final ethanol concentration of about 70 g L-1 and an ethanol yield of about 80%. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a smart biofuel crop, which can be grown under tropical rainfed conditions without sacrificing food and fodder security. Three sweet sorghum cultivars (viz. ICSA 52 × SPV 1411, CSH 22 SS and ICSV 93046) were grown under six nitrogen levels (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 kg ha-1) on Vertisols during two rainy (kharif) seasons at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India. The results from two-year trial indicated that out of three sweet sorghum cultivars evaluated, sweet sorghum hybrid CSH 22 SS produced highest green stalk (46.90 t ha-1) and ethanol yield (1940 l ha-1) compared to other cultivars. The three cultivars responded well to applied N doses up to 150 kg ha-1, however, application of N beyond 90 kg ha-1 did not result in any significant increase in grain yield and economic returns. Net economic returns of Rs 32,898 ha-1 (US$ 601.21 ha-1) were significantly higher with 90 kg N ha-1 application as compared to other levels of fertilization. It is concluded that for obtaining the highest green stalk yield, ethanol yield and thereby maximum economic returns, sweet sorghum cultivar, viz. CSH 22 SS should be fertilized with 90 kg N ha-1.

AB  - Presently, climate metrics in life-cycle assessment (LCA) aggregate the emission of greenhouse gases in one impact-triggering instant, rather than accommodating its distribution along a timeline. There have been efforts to make the global warming potential (GWP) metric dynamic to study temporary carbon storage in wood products. In this article, we test the use of dynamic LCA on bioenergy production from Jatropha oil in Mali, which offers temporary carbon sequestration in biomass and soil. We built a life-cycle inventory for land conversion to jatropha after cropland and fallow land. The assessment was made for one and for 10 consecutive rotations, and yielded dynamic emission profiles over the years. We found that dynamic LCA is sensitive to variations in emission over time, and that it resulted in lower GWP compared to the conventional static approach following IPCC rules, except for early times of analysis. But the largest variation occurs within dynamic LCA between readings at different times of analysis. The choice of time of analysis in the dynamic LCA methodology has no theoretical grounds and is therefore subjective. In the particular case of this short-lived product, we did not find an added value for the provoked increase in complexity of LCA. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The study aims to estimate the reduction of CO2 provided by the production of biofuels from palm oil in suitable areas, according to the "land use plan-Palm Oil" of the Brazilian Amazon. These estimates, still lacking in the literature, are part of the government guidelines to climate change. Such guidelines involve the measurement of two potential carbon pools: i) the fixation of atmospheric CO2 from the accumulation of biomass through croplands and ii) the reduction of CO2 emissions arising from the replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels (less polluting), generated from palm oil. The results show that over the cultivation period, 151.85 Mg.CO2eq.ha-1 can be stocked in above-ground biomass. In 35 million hectares scenario of potential use for the production of palm oil in deforested areas of Brazilian Amazon 5.3 billion Mg.CO2eq could be absorbed with the plantation. However, approximately 90% of the CO2 absorbed returns to the atmosphere during the production process due to low technology applied, making essential the reuse of waste production to increase the efficiency of CO2 reduction.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel leads the research to be focused on alternate source for biofuel production. Though various sources have been identified for the production of biofuel, their availability and cost of manufacturing was found to be high. Macroalgae are most promising feed stock to their wide spread availability and higher lipid content. Extraction of biofuel from algae was found to be the best method of biofuel production. The main aim of the project is to make use of the marine algae such as Gracilaria corticata collected from Covelong, Tamil Nadu and Ulva sp., from Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu to extract the useful algal oil meant for biofuel production and study the GC-MS characteristics of biofuel extracted from it. Results showed that the presence of dodecamethyl (34.19% area) in Gracilaria corticata and 36.6% area decanoic acid in Ulva sp which confirmed the biodiesel.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., a multipurpose plant originated from Central and South America, is receiving increase interest as a biofuel feedstock. Desirable characteristics such as drought tolerance and the ability to grow in marginal lands with low inputs, triggered the development of several projects around the World, not always successful. In fact, despite this hype, J. curcas remains a new crop for which the agronomic requirements are not yet fully understood. For example water requirements of the crop are subject to debate, and in the initial growth stages a considerable amount of water is necessary. We performed a glasshouse experiment to study the influence of water levels and the use of soil conditioners in the growth and development of J. curcas seedlings in the nursery. Results show a positive influence of water level on most of the growth and development parameters studied. The use of soil conditioners also did contributed to a better plant growth. A combination of moderate supply of water and soil conditioners could allow water saving of about 50% in the nursery.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) has been recognized globally as a potential biofuel crop for ethanol production. Sweet sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop that is widely adapted to different environmental growing conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the water use efficiency (utilisable yield per unit amount of water used) of drip-irrigated sweet sorghum (variety Sugargraze) under two different climatic conditions in South Africa. The sweet sorghum trials were conducted at Ukulinga research farm (University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg) and Hatfield experimental farm (University of Pretoria, Pretoria), South Africa. Field trials were conducted in two successive seasons, viz., 2010/11 and 2011/12. Seasonal water use was estimated using eddy covariance and surface renewal methods. Fresh and dry aboveground biomass yield, stalk yield and stalk Brix % were measured at final harvest. Theoretical ethanol yield was calculated from fresh stalk yield and Brix %. Water use for the two growing seasons was 415 mm at Ukulinga and 398 mm at Hatfield. The ethanol water use efficiency (WUE) values for the sweet sorghum at Ukulinga were 0.27 and 0.60 L-m-3for 2010/11 and 2011/12 growing seasons, respectively. The ethanol WUE estimate of the sweet sorghum at Hatfield was 0.53 L-m-3 for the 2010/11 season and 0.70 L-m-3 for the 2011/12 growing season. WUE estimates of the sweet sorghum crop were higher for Hatfield compared to Ukulinga research farm. The results from this study showed that the WUE of sweet sorghum was sensitive to plant density. The WUE values confirm that sweet sorghum has high WUE under different climatic conditions. © 2016, South African Water Research Commission. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper it is proposed a modified bioethanol production model that it is based on the Monod kinetic equation. The model includes the effects of substrate and product inhibition, substrate limitation and some pseudo parameters that are function of the operation conditions: temperature, pH and glucose-xylose concentration. From experimental data reported in the literature it was performed a multivariate analysis, fitting the pseudo parameters. The simulation results with the proposed model are compared against experimental data and against a constant parameter model reported in the literature. The average error obtained with the proposed model is less than the error generated by the model reported in the literature and reproduces the process variables at different operating conditions with an average error of 8.2%. © 2016, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - Rhodopseudomonas palustris is an alphaproteobacterium that has served as a model organism for studies of photophosphorylation, regulation of nitrogen fixation, production of hydrogen as a biofuel, and anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. This bacterium is able to transition between anaerobic photoautotrophic growth, anaerobic photoheterotrophic growth, and aerobic heterotrophic growth. As a starting point to explore the genetic basis for the metabolic versatility of R. palustris, we used transposon mutagenesis and Tn-seq to identify 552 genes as essential for viability in cells growing aerobically on semirich medium. Of these, 323 have essential gene homologs in the alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, and 187 have essential gene homologs in Escherichia coli. There were 24 R. palustris genes that were essential for viability under aerobic growth conditions that have low sequence identity but are likely to be functionally homologous to essential E. coli genes. As expected, certain functional categories of essential genes were highly conserved among the three organisms, including translation, ribosome structure and biogenesis, secretion, and lipid metabolism. R. palustris cells divide by budding in which a sessile cell gives rise to a motile swarmer cell. Conserved cell cycle genes required for this developmental process were essential in both C. crescentus and R. palustris. Our results suggest that despite vast differences in lifestyles, members of the alphaproteobacteria have a common set of essential genes that is specific to this group and distinct from that of gammaproteobacteria like E. coli. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Laminaria residues are major wastes during the production of alginate, mannitol and iodine by the kelp industry. To explore the capability of using Laminaria residues for microbial lipid production, here we developed an effective hydrolysis process to prepare Laminaria residue hydrolysates (LRH). Ten oleaginous yeast strains were then screened on agar plates using LRH as the sole nutrient sources. Two strains, Rhodosporidium toruloides Y4 and Rhodotorula glutinis AS 2.107, were found to use LRH for lipid production when phosphorus was removed, and lipid yields and cellular lipid contents reached 0.16 g g-1 total reducing sugar (TRS) and 37.6%, and 0.07 g g-1 TRS and 22.2%, respectively. The lipid products had similar fatty acid composition profiles to those of vegetable oils. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating lipid-based biofuel production and the kelp industry, which should facilitate more efficient utilization of macroalgae resources such as Laminaria and related marine biomass. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The role of biomass for increasing renewable energy sources mix is considered fundamental, despite some negative environmental impact of first-generation biofuels. The use of biomass obtained in a more sustainable way, as represented by agricultural wastes, should be favoured. The Mediterranean area and Italy in particular offer a large amount of vineyard pruning residues that can be converted into bioenergy. Since vineyards are exposed to treatments based on copper (Cu) and zinc, these metals last in wood residues during pruning and accumulate in the soil. In this study an evaluation of the concentrations of copper and other heavy metals in grapevine pruning wastes, when treated with common plant protection products, was carried out. The study was also extended to the soil, being potentially mixed to the biomass in the case of mechanical collection of pruning residues. The grapevine residues free of impurities that were collected during this study have typical values of copper in pruning wood, varying from 8.5 mg kg-1 when treated with low Cu product, to 19.2 mg kg-1 when treated with high Cu product. It was observed that contaminations during pruning with soil could increase the amount of copper in the residues. More in detail, every percentage point of soil that winds up on pruning residues involves an increase of 1 mg of Cu every kg of biomass. For this reason, we recommend the use of appropriate systems for the harvest of grapevine residues, particularly mechanical systems that avoid soil lifting. Moreover, we suggest the use of pruning residues preferably in large-scale power plants with appropriate emission filters instead of small-scale domestic boilers. © D. Duca et al., 2016.

AB  - The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) was developed to evaluate impacts of land use and management practices on soil quality (SQ), but its suitability for Brazilian tropical soils was unknown. We hypothesized that SMAF would be sensitive enough to detect SQ changes associated with sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) expansion for ethanol production. Field studies were performed at three sites across the south-central region of Brazil, aiming to quantify the impacts of a land use change sequence (i.e., native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) on SQ. Eight soil indicators were individually scored using SMAF curves developed primarily for North American soils and integrated into an overall Soil Quality Index (SQI) and its chemical, physical, and biological sectors. The SMAF scores were correlated with two other approaches used to assess SQ changes, soil organic C (SOC) stocks and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) scores. Our findings showed that the SMAF was an efficient tool for assessing land use change effects on the SQ of Brazilian tropical soils. The SMAF scoring curves developed using robust algorithms allowed proper assignment of scores for the soil chemical, physical, and biological indicators assessed. The SQI scores were significantly correlated with SOC stocks and VESS scores. Long-term transition from native vegetation to extensive pasture promoted significant decreases in soil chemical, physical, and biological indicators. Overall SQI suggested that soils under native vegetation were functioning at 87% of their potential capacity, while pasture soils were functioning at 70%. Conversions of pasture to sugarcane induced slight improvements in SQ, primarily because of improved soil fertility. Sugarcane soils are functioning at 74% of their potential capacity. Based on this study, management strategies were developed to improve SQ and the sustainability of sugarcane production in Brazil. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is the world's fifth most important crop, grown for forage, grain, and as a biofuel. Fast growing and drought tolerant, it is increasingly being planted as a climate change-ready alternative to maize. All parts of the sorghum plant except the grain contain the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin, which breaks down to release hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid) when plant tissue is disrupted. Fresh forage, hay and silage may be toxic to stock when derived from plants that are young, droughted or heavily fertilized. Sorghum also stores nitrate, which can cause nitrite toxicity. The impact of elevated CO2 on dhurrin and nitrate concentration is unknown. It is important to understand how global environmental change will affect composition in order to be able to predict the safety of the crop in coming decades. Sorghum was grown experimentally at elevated CO2 in two free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments at ambient and elevated CO2 (ca. 550 ppm) and either irrigated regularly or only once after sowing in consecutive years and sampled at different stages of development. Since FACE-grown sorghum has been shown to have improved water status we hypothesized that they would contain less dhurrin. We found the most important factors governing cyanide concentration were (in decreasing order): plant age, irrigation treatment and tissue type. For nitrate, tissue type was by far the most important factor, followed by plant age, and then irrigation treatment. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had no significant effect on the total nitrogen concentration, or the concentrations of cyanide and nitrate. As sorghum is becomes more widely used for forage, it will be important to have simple methods to assess the cyanide levels in the field or to develop new, low cyanogenic varieties to ensure that it is safe for grazing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of renewable energy for transportation has received increasing support in environmental policy-making around the globe. Following this trend, the Indian government launched a large-scale biofuel programme in selected federal states, which involved the ecological rehabilitation of so-called wastelands with energy crops. Although met with considerable opposition from civil society actors, the programme was further expanded and a national biofuel policy was adopted. Employing a critical discourse approach, this study argues that the government's strategy to promote biofuels can be explained based on technocratic design principles that have underpinned previous public policies in India. A consolidated view of these factors indicates that the continued domination of the pro-biofuel discourse draws on a notion of weak ecological modernization. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Hong Kong is experiencing a pressing need for food waste management. Currently, approximately 3600 tonnes of food waste are disposed of at landfills in Hong Kong daily. The landfills in Hong Kong are expected to be exhausted by 2020. In the long run, unavoidable food waste should be sorted out from the other municipal solid waste (MSW) and then valorized into valuable resources. A simple sorting process involving less behavioural change of residents is, therefore, of paramount importance in order to encourage residents to sort the food waste from other MSW. In this paper, a sustainable framework of food waste collection and recycling for renewable biogas fuel production is proposed. For an efficient separation and collection system, an optic bag (i.e. green bag) can be used to pack the food waste, while the residual MSW can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations in the conventional way (i.e. refuse collection vehicles). At the refuse transfer stations, the food waste is separated from the residual MSW using optic sensors which recognize the colours of the bags. The food waste in the optic bags is then delivered to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities, in which biogas is generated following the anaerobic digestion technology. The biogas can be further upgraded via gas upgrading units to a quality suitable for use as a vehicle biogas fuel. The use of biogas fuel from food waste has been widely practiced by some countries such as Sweden, France, and Norway. Hopefully, the proposed framework can provide the epitome of the waste-to-wealth concept for the sustainable collection and recycling of food waste in Hong Kong. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels represent a promising alternative to substitute fossil fuels and, given the relevance of environmental impacts of the transport sector, policy initiatives worldwide aim at supporting the shift towards such cleaner energy source. Acknowledging the crucial role that biofuels will play in years to come in the energetic paradigm, the study aims at investigating key-determinants of drivers' willingness to pay for biofuels, focusing on a sample of 260 individuals from Northern Italy (n = 260). In line with recent research on consumer behavior, socio-demographics are not good predictors of drivers' willingness to pay. Surprisingly, on the other hand, knowledge of the topic is negatively correlated to willingness to pay, so that the more people know about biofuels, the less they are willing to pay a premium price. Moreover, certification is not an effective tool to convince drivers of the eco-friendliness of biofuels, hence spurring willingness to pay. Possible explanations of the research findings as well as policy implications are discussed in detail, along with suggestions for future research on the topic. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second generation biofuels offer a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and storing or delaying soil carbon emissions relative to petroleum-based fuels depending upon the strategy used to synthesize the biofuel and co-products. Unless mitigated, the soil organic carbon and nitrogen loss resulting from removing agricultural residues for biofuel production may cause life cycle greenhouse gas emissions to surpass national policy thresholds, and thus risk non-compliance with renewable fuel policy. Strategies to mitigate soil organic carbon loss such as using nutrient and carbon-rich, and stable land amendments will lead to time-variable greenhouse gas credits. Recent studies have argued for using time-dependent rather than time-averaged radiative forcing methods for biofuel greenhouse gas accounting but few life cycle assessment studies have examined the impact of time-varying emissions of soil organic carbon using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier 3 models. This study applies a time-dependent radiative forcing approach to a 100-year time-series data set of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for lignocellulosic ethanol that includes temporally variable soil greenhouse gas emissions. This study demonstrates that averaging soil emissions and neglecting the time when the sequestration or release occurs within a selected time horizon can lead to a 9% to over 80% overestimation of the magnitude of the effect of the mitigation strategy. This affirms that employing strategies to maintain soil organic carbon stock early within a biofuel program supports climate change mitigation. Such strategies would guide farmers to best manage soil carbon within the biofuel production life cycle. Time-dependent approaches underscore the need for early measures of greenhouse gas curtailment to support sustainable renewable biofuel and agricultural policy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine the interplay between Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the United Nations Programme to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) using a scenario approach with a recursive-dynamic global computable general equilibrium model. A methodological issue addressed in the paper is the specification of the supply of agricultural land in the face of restrictions over its availability, as arises under REDD. By giving magnitudes to the effects of REDD and RED, our simulations provide a defense against environmental skeptics who, in the absence of such estimates, can dismiss these policies as being exorbitantly expensive. Although REDD and RED are in tension with respect to land use, the paper shows that they could be implemented simultaneously without significant global problems for food supply. The paper does however pinpoint some regional problems. Implementation of RED and REDD would cause large increases in food prices in Indonesia and Southern Africa. The methodology used in this paper, if implemented at a more detailed level, could be the basis of working out compensation packages that would be needed to make pervasive RED and REDD policies politically feasible. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy input-output analysis is usually used to evaluate the efficiency and environmental impacts of production systems. In this analysis, the amount of energy that consumed for cultivation of crop is compared to the energy content of the product. This is important to define the energy efficiency of rapeseed cultivation as an energy source of biofuel production. For that reasons, in this experimental study, the conventional tillage, reduced tillage and direct sowing methods were applied for the winter rapeseed cultivation. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the different cultivation methods with respect to energy use for sustainable rapeseed production. The energy efficiency parameters were calculated for the considered tillage systems. The amount of direct and indirect energies that consumed in tillage, planting, fertilizing and harvesting applications were calculated for the winter rapeseed production. Three different cultivation methods have proved to be statistically important on seed yield of rapeseed and fuel consumption. It was found that the specific fuel consumption per tones rapeseed was 33.93 L/t, 22.20 L/t and 15.51 L/t, for the conventional tillage, reduced tillage and direct sowing applications, respectively. The energy input for fertilizer was 7242.50 MJ per hectare, compared to other inputs in all applications. The energy output/input ratios of rapeseed cultivation were determined as 7.30, 7.55 and 7.24, respectively for each application. It was found that the reduced tillage method has the highest energy efficiency in the rapeseed cultivation compared to other two applications. According to this study results, it is concluded that the soil must be analyzed with respect to necessary plant nutrients, the fertilization programs should be arranged and applied carefully, the required power optimization should be executed and the agricultural tools/machinery must be operated at full load and efficiently. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water hyacinth was used as substrate for bioethanol production in the present study. Combination of acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was the most effective process for sugar production that resulted in the production of 402.93 mg reducing sugar at optimal condition. A regression model was built to optimize the fermentation factors according to response surface method in saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process. The optimized condition for ethanol production by SSF process was fermented at 38.87°C in 81.87 h when inoculated with 6.11 ml yeast, where 1.291 g/L bioethanol was produced. Meanwhile, 1.289 g/L ethanol was produced during experimentation, which showed reliability of presented regression model in this research. The optimization method discussed in the present study leading to relatively high bioethanol production could provide a promising way for Alien Invasive Species with high cellulose content. © 2016 Zhang, Weng, Huang, Achal and Wang.

AB  - Algal biofuels and valuable co-products are being produced in both open and closed cultivation systems. Growing algae in open pond systems may be a more economical alternative, but this approach allows environmental microorganisms to colonize the pond and potentially infect or outcompete the algal "crop." In this study, we monitored the microbial community of an outdoor, open raceway pond inoculated with a high lipid-producing alkaliphilic alga, Chlorella vulgaris BA050. The strain C. vulgaris BA050 was previously isolated from Soap Lake, Washington, a system characterized by a high pH (~9.8). An outdoor raceway pond (200 L) was inoculated with C. vulgaris and monitored for 10 days and then the culture was transferred to a 2,000 L raceway pond and cultivated for an additional 6 days. Community DNA samples were collected over the 16-day period in conjunction with water chemistry analyses and cell counts. Universal primers for the SSU rRNA gene sequences for Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea were used for barcoded pyrosequence determination. The environmental parameters that most closely correlated with C. vulgaris abundance were pH and phosphate. Community analyses indicated that the pond system remained dominated by the Chlorella population (93% of eukaryotic sequences), but was also colonized by other microorganisms. Bacterial sequence diversity increased over time while archaeal sequence diversity declined over the same time period. Using SparCC co-occurrence network analysis, a positive correlation was observed between C. vulgaris and Pseudomonas sp. throughout the experiment, which may suggest a symbiotic relationship between the two organisms. The putative relationship coupled with high pH may have contributed to the success of C. vulgaris. The characterization of the microbial community dynamics of an alkaliphilic open pond system provides significant insight into open pond systems that could be used to control photoautotrophic biomass productivity in an open, non-sterile environment. © 2016 Bell, Prithiviraj, Wahlen, Fields and Peyton.

AB  - The increasing consumption of fossil fuels has led to the development of alternative fuels for the future. Domestic biofuel production and the utilization of alternative fuels can decrease dependency on petroleum oil, reduce trade deficits, reduce air pollution and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Bioethanol is a renewable fuel produced by the fermentation of sugar which is derived from plants such as sugarcane or beet, maize, or cassava etc. However, bioethanol consumption in an engine is approximately 51% higher than gasoline since the energy per unit volume of ethanol is 34% lower than for gasoline. Bioethanol is an oxygenated fuel that contains 35% oxygen, which can reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions caused by combustion of the fuel. Therefore, bioethanol-gasoline blends can significantly reduce petroleum use and GHG emission. In addition, utilization of lignocellulosic materials in bioethanol production is the most viable pathway from an environmental point of view. This paper reviews the current status and technologies involved in bioethanol production and the properties and engine performance from various biomass feedstocks which are the recommended sustainable alternative fuel in the future. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of eight types of green landscaping waste as feedstock to produce bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The eight selected plants differed in terms of botanical classification, morphology, leaf state, and growth habit. Leaves and branches as waste from these plants were separately subjected to HTL in a high-pressure batch reactor at 300 °C for 0.5 h. Results indicated the bio-oils and biochars of leaves obviously differed from those of branches in terms of yields and higher heating values (HHVs). However, less difference in yields and HHVs was found for HTL products within the eight leaves even though they were different in composition components such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. The same was observed for branches. The average bio-oil yields of the leaves and branches were 33.74 and 43.22 wt%, respectively. The optimal bio-oil yield was 50.44 wt%, which was obtained when Cinnamomum camphora branches were used as feedstock. The average HHVs of light and heavy oils in the leaves were 25.13 and 31.27 MJ kg-1, respectively. These HHVs were higher than those of light and heavy oils in the branches (21.51 and 28.71 MJ kg-1, respectively). Among the oil products, the heavy oil derived from Salix alba leaves yielded the optimum HHV (35.63 MJ kg-1). The mean HHV of biochar was 24.17 MJ kg-1, which was considerably higher than that of feedstock (17.21 MJ kg-1). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry revealed the presence of value-added chemicals, such as phenolics, ketones, esters, acids, and alcohols, in bio-oils. The amounts of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes in the bio-oils derived from the leaves were higher than those in the bio-oils derived from the branches. These results indicated the feasibility of using different types of green landscaping waste as feedstock to produce bio-oils with high HHV and yield through HTL. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

AB  - The industrial scale production of biodiesel, the most common biofuel, requires innovative solutions to become more and more competitive with a reduced environmental impact. Microalgae are the most promising feedstock for biodiesel production since they are grown on non-arable areas and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions as well. The oil extraction is the competitiveness bottleneck, largely impacting the overall process cost. Oil extraction using ionic liquids is considered a promising technique, which has the chance to become a benchmark for large scale applications. In this paper a novel process simulation of ionic liquid operation is developed, implemented by Aspen Hysys V7.3®. The chosen ionic liquid is Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, a green solvent; since it is a non-conventional compound, a method to compute its properties through a thermodynamic model is provided. Moreover, a process scheme has been set up and simulated, composed of a lysis reactor, in which the ionic liquid is added for oil extraction, and a three phase separator, with recycle lines and several heat exchangers for heat recovery. Mass and energy balances have been carried out. The main results allowed to calculate the recovered oil as a function of the ionic liquid to dry biomass weight ratio (with assuming a bio-oil extraction yield of 100) and as expected, the bio-oil recovery yield increased at decreasing temperature. However, a complete recovery is not feasible, due to the physical constraints in the thermodynamic model hypotheses. Albeit some simplifying hypotheses for the thermodynamic properties, the novelty of this work is that it reports results of a process simulation, providing indication for industrial technological implementation coming from a professional tool for process simulation and control. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Both Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosine (SPK) fuels are considered as leading alternative replacements for conventional jet fuel. To satisfy the requirements of Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA), their drop-in incorporations have been subjected to a rigorous certification process. To reach the ambitious incorporation targets, new routes for biofuels incorporation may need to emerge, involving optimizing the production processes and the blending strategies. This paper focuses on a new strategy for incorporating HEFA, allowing the process yield to be optimised. One of the major steps limiting the process yield for HEFA remains the isomerisation that allows production of a biofuel with very good cold flow properties. But this step introduces a substantial decrease of the overall yield (fuel component per kg of starting material) due to the production of light compounds, unsuitable for conventional jet fuel. In this work relaxing the freezing point requirement for the neat HEFA component (by decreasing the severity of the isomerisation step) is proposed in order to minimize the production of less valuable light compounds. This strategy could lead to a significant additional biofuel yield with respect to the oil compared to a process making a better freezing point component. This allows the land surface area necessary for HEFA feedstock cultivation to be reduced for a given amount of bio-jet fuel produced. © L. Starck et al., published by IFP Energies nouvelles, 2014.

AB  - Plants needs cost many years to remediateheavy metal-contaminated croplands, and because some plants lack economic value, farmers often have no income during this period.Therefore, selecting suitable plants tolerant to heavy metals and producing products ofeconomicvalue may be a key factor in promoting the practical application of phytoremediation polluted soils. Many studies have demonstrated that some cash crops, which have the ability to attain large biomasses and accumulate metals, are highly tolerant to metal pollution.In order to fully utilize farmland contaminated with heavy metalsfrom mine tailings in Chenzhou, three cash crops (rape, corn, and sunflower) wereinvestigated as candidate phytoextraction plants with the potential to overcome these disadvantages of phytoremediation. To identify the potential of two seasonal cropping patterns (rape and corn, rape and sunflower) to remediate heavy metal contaminated land in Chenzhou, field experiments were conducted using rape, corn, and sunflower at a site highly contaminated with heavy metals(Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, As, and Hg) from mine tailings.The three cash crops demonstrated the potential to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. Significant accumulations of Cu and Cd were found in leaves and roots of sunflower. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of Cd in all sunflower parts (roots, stems, leaves, flower heads, and seeds) and the BCF of Cu in sunflower leaves and roots were more than 1. Both cropping patterns (rape-corn, rape-sunflower) performed well and had no significant effect on yield. Three cash crops produced high annual yields of dry biomass (rape: 16.6t/hm2, corn: 25.29t/hm2, sunflower: 25.25t/hm2)after one year rotations. Both cropping patterns absorbed a wide range of heavy metals from thesoil due to their highbiomass yields.Data obtained from the field experiment were used to estimate the amounts of heavy metals (g hm-2 a-1) extracted by the three cash crops grown in each of the two cropping patterns. The rape-sunflower cropping system extracted large amounts of Cu (2408g hm-2 a-1), Pb (2027g hm-2 a-1), Cd (658.5g hm-2 a-1), As (250g hm-2 a-1), while Zn (4987g hm-2 a-1) and Hg (7.92g hm-2 a-1) were extracted by the rape-corn cropping system. The rape-sunflower system performed better than rape-corn at remediating the heavy metal contaminated soil. Overall, the three cash crops tested are more suitable for phytoextraction than most conventional hyperaccumulator plants due to their larger biomass, although they have low bioconcentration factors. Cropping pattern had no effect on crop yield, but increased annual extraction of heavy metals from soil comparedsingle crop systems. Furthermore, rape, corn and sunflower are widely used as biofuel crops, so their seed oil could be for this purpose and the stems have great commercial value in ethanol and paper production. Using these crops and cropping systems for phytoextraction offers thepossibility of producing some economic returns for farmers during the remediationprocess. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Desert plants are hypothesized to survive the environmental stress inherent to these regions in part thanks to symbioses with microorganisms, and yet these microbial species, the communities they form, and the forces that influence them are poorly understood. Here we report the first comprehensive investigation of the microbial communities associated with species of Agave, which are native to semiarid and arid regions of Central and North America and are emerging as biofuel feedstocks. We examined prokaryotic and fungal communities in the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, leaf and root endosphere, as well as proximal and distal soil samples from cultivated and native agaves, through Illumina amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic profiling revealed that the composition of prokaryotic communities was primarily determined by the plant compartment, whereas the composition of fungal communities was mainly influenced by the biogeography of the host species. Cultivated A. tequilana exhibited lower levels of prokaryotic diversity compared with native agaves, although no differences in microbial diversity were found in the endosphere. Agaves shared core prokaryotic and fungal taxa known to promote plant growth and confer tolerance to abiotic stress, which suggests common principles underpinning Agave-microbe interactions. © 2015 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - Due to the variability of feed cost and in order to maintain the competitiveness of pork products, the pig farmers of the European Union try to maximize the use of locally produced feeds, such as rapeseed meal which is a by-product of the oil and biofuel industries. Dietary rapeseed meal of Greek origin was evaluated as alternative for imported soybean meal on the performance, meat quality parameters and gut microbiota of growing-fattening pigs. A total of 120 pigs were allocated to two equal groups for a period of 90 days. The pigs of the control group (C) were fed with commercial soybean meal based growing and fattening rations. The pigs of the second group were fed with isocaloric and isonitrogenous rapeseed meal based rations. Body weight gain did not differ (p>0.05) during the growing and the fattening periods. Feed conversion ratio did not differ (p>0.05) during the growing period but was higher (p≤0.05) for group R during the fattening period. Some differences (p≤0.05) were found in the meat chemical composition (moisture, crude protein, crude fat) between the two groups. In the steak cuts, group R had higher (p≤0.05) total monounsaturated fatty acids and lower (p≤0.05) saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, compared to group C. No differences (p>0.05) were found on the ham and steak meat lipid oxidative stability after 4 days or 7 days of refrigerated storage 4°C. Group R had higher (p≤0.05) Lactobacillus spp., in the caecum and lower (p≤0.05), Clostridium perfringens in the mid-colon. © 2016 Skoufos et al.

AB  - Sewage sludge is a considerable source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in the field of organic solid waste treatment and disposal. In this case study, total GHG emissions from sludge anaerobic digestion, including direct and indirect emissions as well as replaceable emission reduction due to biogas being reused instead of natural gas, were quantified respectively. The results indicated that no GHG generation needed to be considered during the anaerobic digestion process. Indirect emissions were mainly from electricity and fossil fuel consumption on-site and sludge transportation. Overall, the total GHG emission owing to relative subtraction from anaerobic digestion rather than landfill, and replaceable GHG reduction caused by reuse of its product of biogas, were quantified to be 0.7214 (northern China) or 0.7384 (southern China) MgCO2 MgWS-1 (wet sludge). © IWA Publishing 2016.

AB  - Switchgrass is a potential feedstock for cellulosic bioenergy production. Weed competition from annual grass during the establishment year can reduce switchgrass establishment and resulting productivity, but the relationship between early season grass densities and outcomes of competition are not well understood. We measured how a range of giant and yellow foxtail densities in the establishment year influenced switchgrass establishment and resulting productivity in the first production year (second year of the growing season). In two of the three site-yr more than four foxtail plants m-2 reduced switchgrass plant densities below documented thresholds of establishment success. A lesser effect of foxtails in the third site-year suggested that higher switchgrass emergence rates reduced foxtail competitive ability during establishment. Effects on yield were consistent over the three site-yr. The yield (10.96 Mg ha-1 ± 0.77) decreased rapidly as foxtail density increased. One foxtail plant m-2 reduced switchgrass yield in the first production year by 25%, and yield loss was 90% or greater at densities &gt; 50 foxtail plants m-2. Although switchgrass can establish in the presence of foxtail competition, these weed species should be controlled to maximize yields in the first production year.

AB  - A socioeconomic model is used to estimate the land-use implications on the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program from potential increases in second-generation biofuel production. A baseline scenario with no second-generation biofuel production is compared to a scenario where the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2) volumes are met by 2022. We allow for the possibility of converting expiring CRP lands to alternative uses such as conventional crops, dedicated second-generation biofuel crops, or harvesting existing CRP grasses for biomass. Results indicate that RFS2 volumes (RFS2-v) can be met primarily with crop residues (78% of feedstock demand) and woody residues (19% of feedstock demand) compared with dedicated biomass (3% of feedstock demand), with only minimal conversion of cropland (0.27 million hectares, <1% of total cropland), pastureland (0.28 million hectares of pastureland, <1% of total pastureland), and CRP lands (0.29 million hectares of CRP lands, 3% of existing CRP lands) to biomass production. Meeting RFS2 volumes would reduce CRP re-enrollment by 0.19 million hectares, or 4%, below the baseline scenario where RFS2 is not met. Yet under RFS2-v scenario, expiring CRP lands are more likely to be converted to or maintain perennial cover, with 1.78 million hectares of CRP lands converting to hay production, and 0.29 million hectares being harvested for existing grasses. A small amount of CRP is harvested for existing biomass, but no conversion of CRP to dedicated biomass crops, such as switchgrass, are projected to occur. Although less land is enrolled in CRP under RFS2-v scenario, total land in perennial cover increases by 0.15 million hectares, or 2%, under RFS2-v. Sensitivity to yield, payment and residue retention assumptions are evaluated. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) change can be a major impact of land use change (LUC) associated with biofuel feedstock production. By collecting and analyzing data from worldwide field observations of major LUCs from cropland, grassland, and forest to lands producing biofuel crops (i.e. corn, switchgrass, Miscanthus, poplar, and willow), we were able to estimate SOC response ratios and sequestration rates and evaluate the effects of soil depth and time scale on SOC change. Both the amount and rate of SOC change were highly dependent on the specific land transition. Irrespective of soil depth or time horizon, cropland conversions resulted in an overall SOC gain of 6-14% relative to initial SOC level, while conversion from grassland or forest to corn (without residue removal) or poplar caused significant carbon loss (9-35%). No significant SOC changes were observed in land converted from grasslands or forests to switchgrass, Miscanthus, or willow. The SOC response ratios were similar in both 0-30 and 0-100 cm soil depths in most cases, suggesting SOC changes in deep soil and that use of top soil only for SOC accounting in biofuel life cycle analysis (LCA) might underestimate total SOC changes. Soil carbon sequestration rates varied greatly among studies and land transition types. Generally, the rates of SOC change tended to be the greatest during the 10 years following land conversion and had declined to approach 0 within about 20 years for most LUCs. Observed trends in SOC change were generally consistent with previous reports. Soil depth and duration of study significantly influence SOC change rates and so should be considered in carbon emission accounting in biofuel LCA. High uncertainty remains for many perennial systems and forest transitions, additional field trials, and modeling efforts are needed to draw conclusions about the site- and system-specific rates and direction of change. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions from bioenergy crops may differ from those of conventional crops. We compared emission rates of isoprene and a number of monoterpenes from the lignocellulosic bioenergy crops short-rotation coppice (SRC) willow and Miscanthus, with the conventional crops wheat and oilseed rape. BVOC emission rates were measured via dynamic vegetation enclosure and GC-MS analysis approximately monthly between April 2010 and August 2012 at a location in England and from SRC willow at two locations in Scotland. The largest BVOC emission rates were measured from willow in England and varied between years. Isoprene emission rates varied between &lt;lod and 1960 μg g-1 h-1. Of the monoterpenes detected from willow, α-pinene emission rates were highest (&lt;lod to 803 μg g-1h-1), followed by &lt;lod to 268 μg g-1 h-1 for δ-3-carene, &lt;lod to 125 μg g-1 h-1 for β-pinene and &lt;lod to 80.4 μg g-1 h-1 for limonene. BVOC emission rates measured in Scotland were much lower. Low emission rates of isoprene and α-pinene were measured from Miscanthus in 2010 (&lt;lod to 6.42 μg g-1 h-1 and &lt;lod to 20.8 μg g-1 h-1, respectively) but were not detected in subsequent years. Emission rates from wheat of isoprene were negligible but relatively high for monoterpenes (&lt;lod to 422 μg g-1 h-1 and &lt;lod to 104 μg g-1h-1 for α-pinene and limonene, respectively). No significant emission rates of BVOCs were measured from oilseed rape. The measured emission rates followed a clear seasonal trend. Crude extrapolations based solely on data gathered here indicate that isoprene emissions from willow could correspond to 0.004-0.03% (UK) and 0.76-5.5% (Europe) of current global isoprene if 50% of all land potentially available for bioenergy crops is planted with willow. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study evaluates the effect of agronomic uncertainty on bioenergy crop production as well as endogenous commodity and biomass prices on the feedstock composition of cellulosic biofuels under a binding mandate in the United States. The county-level simulation model focuses on both field crops (corn, soybean, and wheat) and biomass feedstocks (corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and Miscanthus). In addition, pasture serves as a potential area for bioenergy crop production. The economic model is calibrated to 2022 in terms of yield, crop demand, and baseline prices and allocates land optimally among the alternative crops given the binding cellulosic biofuel mandate. The simulation scenarios differ in terms of bioenergy crop type (switchgrass and Miscanthus) and yield, biomass production inputs, and pasture availability. The cellulosic biofuel mandates range from 15 to 60 billion L. The results indicate that the 15 and 30 billion L mandates in the high production input scenarios for switchgrass and Miscanthus are covered entirely by agricultural residues. With the exception of the low production input for Miscanthus scenario, the share of agricultural residues is always over 50% for all other scenarios including the 60 billion L mandate. The largest proportion of agricultural land dedicated to either switchgrass or Miscanthus is found in the southern Plains and the southeast. Almost no bioenergy crops are grown in the Midwest across all scenarios. Changes in the prices for the three commodities are negligible for cellulosic ethanol mandates because most of the mandate is met with agricultural residues. The lessons learned are that (1) the share of agricultural residue in the feedstock mix is higher than previously estimated and (2) for a given mandate, the feedstock composition is relatively stable with the exception of one scenario. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - An agent-based modelling (ABM) framework was adapted to assess bioenergy crop uptake and integrate social and economic processes with biophysical elements. Survey results indicated that economic rationalisation was intrinsic to farmers' decision-making, but was not the only consideration. This study presents an approach, set within an established resource management framework, to incorporate a number of key socio-economic factors, which we call Mitigation Willingness Factors (MWFs), using survey data collected from farmers and land managers, into the ABM. The MWFs represent farmers' willingness to compromise revenue in order to reduce GHG emissions, derived from their attitudes to climate change and the ability of different economic mechanisms to stimulate energy crop uptake. Adoption of bioenergy crops of different farmer types and farming enterprises was also assessed. Adoption rates and scenarios that take into account noneconomic factors are presented, and particular farming enterprises that may respond more positively to policy initiatives are identified. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Global rice agriculture will be increasingly challenged by water scarcity, while at the same time changes in demand (e.g. changes in diets or increasing demand for biofuels) will feed back on agricultural practices. These factors are changing traditional cropping patterns from double-rice cropping to the introduction of upland crops in the dry season. For a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, we measured methane (CH4)/nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and agronomic parameters over 2.5 years in double-rice cropping (R-R) and paddy rice rotations diversified with either maize (R-M) or aerobic rice (R-A) in upland cultivation. Introduction of upland crops in the dry season reduced irrigation water use and CH4 emissions by 66-81% and 95-99%, respectively. Moreover, for practices including upland crops, CH4 emissions in the subsequent wet season with paddy rice were reduced by 54-60%. Although annual N2O emissions increased two- to threefold in the diversified systems, the strong reduction in CH4 led to a significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) annual GWP (CH4 + N2O) as compared to the traditional double-rice cropping system. Measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents before and 3 years after the introduction of upland crop rotations indicated a SOC loss for the R-M system, while for the other systems SOC stocks were unaffected. This trend for R-M systems needs to be followed as it has significant consequences not only for the GWP balance but also with regard to soil fertility. Economic assessment showed a similar gross profit span for R-M and R-R, while gross profits for R-A were reduced as a consequence of lower productivity. Nevertheless, regarding a future increase in water scarcity, it can be expected that mixed lowland-upland systems will expand in SE Asia as water requirements were cut by more than half in both rotation systems with upland crops. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The removal of perennial bioenergy crops, such as Miscanthus, has rarely been studied although it is an important form of land use change. Miscanthus is a C4 plant, and the carbon (C) it deposits during its growth has a different isotopic signature (12/13C) compared to a C3 plant. Identifying the proportion of C stored and released to the atmosphere is important information for ecosystem models and life cycle analyses. During a removal experiment in June 2011 of a 20-year old Miscanthus field (Grignon, France), vegetation was removed mechanically and chemically. Two replicate plots were converted into a rotation of annual crops, two plots had Miscanthus removed with no soil disturbance, followed by bare soil (set-aside), one control plot was left with continued Miscanthus cultivation, and an adjacent field was used as annual arable crops control. There was a significant difference in the isotopic composition of the total soil C under Miscanthus compared with adjacent annual arable crops in all three measured soil layers (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm). Before Miscanthus removal, total C in the soil under Miscanthus ranged from 4.9% in the top layer to 3.9% in the lower layers with δ13C values of -16.3 to -17.8 while soil C under the adjacent arable crop was significantly lower and ranged from 1.6 to 2% with δ13C values of -23.2. This did not change much in 2012, suggesting the accumulation of soil C under Miscanthus persists for at least the first year. In contrast, the isotopic signals of soil respiration 1 year after Miscanthus removal from recultivated and set-aside plots were similar to that of the annual arable control, while just after removal the signals were similar to that of the Miscanthus control. This suggests a rapid change in the form of soil C pools that are respired. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus is often regarded as one of the most promising crops to produce bioenergy because it is renowned for its high biomass yields, combined with low input requirements. However, its productivity has been mainly studied in experimental conditions. Our study aimed at characterizing and explaining young M. giganteus yield variability on a farmers' field network located in the supply area of a cooperative society in east central France. It included the first three growth years of the crop. We defined and calculated a set of indicators of limiting factors that could be involved in yield variations and used the mixed-model method to identify those explaining most of the yield variation. Commercial yields averaged 8.1 and 12.8 t DM ha-1 for the second and third growth year, respectively. However, these mean results concealed a high variability, ranging from 3 to 19 DM ha-1. Commercial yields, measured on whole fields, were on average 20% lower than plot yields, measured on a small area (two plots of 25 m2). Yields were found to be much more related to shoot density than to shoot mass, and particularly to the shoot density established at the end of the planting year. We highlighted that planting success was decisive and was built during the whole plantation year. Fields with the lowest yields also had the highest weed cover, which was influenced by the distance between the field and the farmhouse, the preceding crop and the soil type. Our findings show that growing young M. giganteus on farmers' fields involves limiting factors different from those commonly reported in the literature for experimental conditions and they could be useful to assess the economic and environmental impacts of growing M. giganteus on farmers' fields. They could also stimulate the discussion about growing bioenergy crops on marginal lands. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The potential for climate change mitigation by bioenergy crops and terrestrial carbon sinks has been the object of intensive research in the past decade. There has been much debate about whether energy crops used to offset fossil fuel use, or carbon sequestration in forests, would provide the best climate mitigation benefit. Most current food cropland is unlikely to be used for bioenergy, but in many regions of the world, a proportion of cropland is being abandoned, particularly marginal croplands, and some of this land is now being used for bioenergy. In this study, we assess the consequences of land-use change on cropland. We first identify areas where cropland is so productive that it may never be converted and assess the potential of the remaining cropland to mitigate climate change by identifying which alternative land use provides the best climate benefit: C4 grass bioenergy crops, coppiced woody energy crops or allowing forest regrowth to create a carbon sink. We do not present this as a scenario of land-use change - we simply assess the best option in any given global location should a land-use change occur. To do this, we use global biomass potential studies based on food crop productivity, forest inventory data and dynamic global vegetation models to provide, for the first time, a global comparison of the climate change implications of either deploying bioenergy crops or allowing forest regeneration on current crop land, over a period of 20 years starting in the nominal year of 2000 ad. Globally, the extent of cropland on which conversion to energy crops or forest would result in a net carbon loss, and therefore likely always to remain as cropland, was estimated to be about 420.1 Mha, or 35.6% of the total cropland in Africa, 40.3% in Asia and Russia Federation, 30.8% in Europe-25, 48.4% in North America, 13.7% in South America and 58.5% in Oceania. Fast growing C4 grasses such as Miscanthus and switch-grass cultivars are the bioenergy feedstock with the highest climate mitigation potential. Fast growing C4 grasses such as Miscanthus and switch-grass cultivars provide the best climate mitigation option on ≈485 Mha of cropland worldwide with ~42% of this land characterized by a terrain slope equal or above 20%. If that land-use change did occur, it would displace ≈58.1 Pg fossil fuel C equivalent (Ceq oil). Woody energy crops such as poplar, willow and Eucalyptus species would be the best option on only 2.4% (≈26.3 Mha) of current cropland, and if this land-use change occurred, it would displace ≈0.9 Pg Ceq oil. Allowing cropland to revert to forest would be the best climate mitigation option on ≈17% of current cropland (≈184.5 Mha), and if this land-use change occurred, it would sequester ≈5.8 Pg C in biomass in the 20-year-old forest and ≈2.7 Pg C in soil. This study is spatially explicit, so also serves to identify the regional differences in the efficacy of different climate mitigation options, informing policymakers developing regionally or nationally appropriate mitigation actions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Drought is a periodic occurrence in the High Plains of the U.S.A.; thereby low-water using crops are desired. Canola, a biofuel and food oil, has been studied in the region under rain-fed conditions for several years. The study's objective was to measure plant growth, seed yield, and oil characteristic of canola at four levels of applied water in western Nebraska. The cultivar Hyola 357 Magnum was exposed to rain-fed only (RF), and irrigated with 10 (LI), 20 (MI), and 30 (HI) cm water. Adding irrigation increased plant growth, i.e., canopy height, stem length, and canopy weight. Highest canopy height (>100 cm for MI and HI) was reached by 10 weeks after planting (WAP) with a total of 23 cm of applied water or 13 cm of irrigation. By 8 WAP, canopy fresh weight was increased by 37 to 58% by MI and HI irrigations. Pod fresh and dry weights at harvest (13 WAP) were increased?>50% and >20%, respectively, by all irrigations. Seed yield were increased by each incremental increase in irrigation from 1220 kg/ha for RF to 2905 for HI, a 2.4-fold increase. Seed oil content was increased by MI and HI irrigations (4–8%). The fatty acid profile was not substantially altered by irrigation. There was a slight decrease of palmitic acid and increase in linolenic acid with HI. Canola showed that?>20 cm of applied water is needed for good vine and pod growth but >40 cm was needed to achieve the highest yield. Canola could be grown successfully in western Nebraska, supplying oil for fuel and cooking. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioenergy is expected to play an important role in the future energy mix as it can substitute fossil fuels and contribute to climate change mitigation. However, large-scale bioenergy cultivation may put substantial pressure on land and water resources. While irrigated bioenergy production can reduce the pressure on land due to higher yields, associated irrigation water requirements may lead to degradation of freshwater ecosystems and to conflicts with other potential users. In this article, we investigate the trade-offs between land and water requirements of large-scale bioenergy production. To this end, we adopt an exogenous demand trajectory for bioenergy from dedicated energy crops, targeted at limiting greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector to 1100 Gt carbon dioxide equivalent until 2095. We then use the spatially explicit global land- and water-use allocation model MAgPIE to project the implications of this bioenergy target for global land and water resources. We find that producing 300 EJ yr-1 of bioenergy in 2095 from dedicated bioenergy crops is likely to double agricultural water withdrawals if no explicit water protection policies are implemented. Since current human water withdrawals are dominated by agriculture and already lead to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, such a doubling will pose a severe threat to freshwater ecosystems. If irrigated bioenergy production is prohibited to prevent negative impacts of bioenergy cultivation on water resources, bioenergy land requirements for meeting a 300 EJ yr-1 bioenergy target increase substantially (+ 41%) - mainly at the expense of pasture areas and tropical forests. Thus, avoiding negative environmental impacts of large-scale bioenergy production will require policies that balance associated water and land requirements. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - To develop a more sustainable bio-based economy, an increasing amount of carbon for industrial applications and biofuel will be obtained from bioenergy crops. This may result in intensified land use and potential conflicts with other ecosystem services provided by soil, such as control of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, and nutrient dynamics. A growing number of studies examine how bioenergy crops influence carbon and nitrogen cycling. Few studies, however, have combined such assessments with analysing both the immediate effects on the provisioning of soil ecosystem services as well as the legacy effects for subsequent crops in the rotation. Here, we present results from field and laboratory experiments on effects of a standard first-generation bioenergy crop (maize) and three different second-generation bioenergy crops (willow short rotation coppice (SRC), Miscanthus × giganteus, switchgrass) on key soil quality parameters: soil structure, organic matter, biodiversity and growth and disease susceptibility of a major follow-up crop, wheat (Triticum aestivum). We analysed a 6-year field experiment and show that willow SRC, Miscanthus, and maize maintained a high yield over this period. Soil quality parameters and legacy effects of Miscanthus and switchgrass were similar or performed worse than maize. In contrast, willow SRC enhanced soil organic carbon concentration (0-5 cm), soil fertility, and soil biodiversity in the upper soil layer when compared to maize. In a greenhouse experiment, wheat grown in willow soil had higher biomass production than when grown in maize or Miscanthus soil and exhibited no growth reduction in response to introduction of a soil-borne (Rhizoctonia solani) or a leaf pathogen (Mycosphaerella graminicola). We conclude that the choice of bioenergy crops can greatly influence provisioning of soil ecosystem services and legacy effects in soil. Our results imply that bioenergy crops with specific traits might even enhance ecosystem properties through positive legacy effects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - To date, only few studies have compared the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential between perennial woody and herbaceous crops. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of perennial woody (poplar, black locust, willow) and herbaceous (giant reed, miscanthus, switchgrass) crops on SOC stock and its stabilization level after 6 years from plantation on an arable field. Seven SOC fractions related to different soil stabilization mechanisms were isolated by a combination of physical and chemical fractionation methods: unprotected (cPOM and fPOM), physically protected (iPOM), physically and chemically protected (HC-μs + c), chemically protected (HC-ds + c), and biochemically protected (NHC-ds + c and NHC-μs + c). The continuous C input to the soil and the minimal soil disturbance increased SOC stocks in the top 10 cm of soil, but not in deeper soil layers (10-30; 30-60; and 60-100 cm). In the top soil layer, greater SOC accumulation rates were observed under woody species (105 g m-2 yr-1) than under herbaceous ones (71 g m-2 yr-1) presumably due to a higher C input from leaf-litter. The conversion from an arable maize monoculture to perennial bioenergy crops increased the organic C associated to the most labile organic matter (POM) fractions, which accounted for 38% of the total SOC stock across bioenergy crops, while no significant increments were observed in more recalcitrant (silt- and clay-sized) fractions, highlighting that the POM fractions were the most prone to land-use change. The iPOM fraction increased under all perennial bioenergy species compared to the arable field. In addition, the iPOM was higher under woody crops than under herbaceous ones because of the additional C inputs from leaf-litter that occurred in the former. Conversion from arable cropping systems to perennial bioenergy crops can effectively increase the SOC stock and enlarge the SOC fraction that is physically protected within soil microaggregates. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A modeling framework was used to examine gaps in understanding of seasonal and spatial heterogeneity in aerosol abundance and radiative forcing over northern South Asia, whose glimpses are revealed in observational studies. Regionally representative emissions were used in chemical transport model simulations at a spatial resolution of 60 × 60 km2, in April, July and September, chosen as months of contrasting emissions and rainfall. Modeled aerosol abundance in northern South Asia was predominantly found to be dust and carbonaceous in April, dust and sulfate in July and sulfate and carbonaceous in September. Anthropogenic aerosols arose from energy-use emissions (from industrial sources, residential biofuel cooking, brick kilns) in all months, additionally from field burning in April, and incursion from East Asia in September. In April, carbonaceous aerosols were abundant from open burning of agricultural fields even at high altitude locations (Godavari), and of forests in the eastern Gangetic Plain (Kolkata). Direct radiative forcing and heating rate, calculated from OPAC-SBDART, using modeled aerosol fields, and corrected by MODIS AOD observations, showed regionally uniform atmospheric forcing in April, compared to that in other months, influenced by both dust and black carbon abundance. A strong spatial heterogeneity of radiative forcing and heating rate was found, with factor of 2.5-3.5 lower atmospheric forcing over the Tibet plateau than that over the Ganga Plain and Northwest in July and September. However, even over the remote Tibet plateau, there was significant anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric forcing and heating rate (45% in Apr, 75% in Sep). Wind fields showed black carbon transport from south Asia in April and east Asia in September. Further evaluation of the transport of dust and anthropogenic emissions from various source regions and their deposition in the Himalaya and Tibet, is important in understanding regional air quality and climate change over this ecosystem. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the last decade, debates about the livelihood impacts of large-scale biofuel projects have focused mainly on either employment creation or on land dispossession. The mediating role of social institutions and communal reciprocity in resource-access manoeuvring processes have rarely been considered. This comparative study of two biofuel projects in Ghana shows that households affected by land dispossession quickly obtained new productive land areas by switching to fallow farmland or through long-term reciprocal social networks. The livelihoods of households with members employed by the projects improved in terms of increased income and access to cultivation on project land. Not everyone, however, had the resources and ability to use social networks for job-seeking and land access negotiation, particularly those considered to be migrants. The authors argue that a context-specific focus on, and processual examination of, the abilities of individuals and groups to utilize social institutions to sustain their livelihoods during a project's lifetime, are crucial in analysing the impacts of biofuels land deals. Such an approach explores the various forms and uses of livelihood capitals, and shows how new configurations of social and economic relations emerging from land commercialization can reinforce local inequalities. © 2016 International Institute of Social Studies.

AB  - Biofuel production by microalgae has the advantage of higher biomass productivity over land crops. The selection of potential microalgae depends on the growth in outdoor mass cultivation during different seasons, which can be predicted by a mathematical model. Here, freshwater green algae were isolated from a local water body in Pilani, Rajasthan, India (geographical coordinates: 28°22′N 75°36′E) and characterized by microscopy and ribosomal RNA analysis. The strain was submitted to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute's microbial culture collection (IARI, India) and identified as Desmodesmus sp. MCC34. This strain, along with a fresh water green algae (Chlorella minutissima), two marine green algae species (Dunaliella salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta) and two nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena doliolum), were screened for lipid productivity and growth kinetics under culture room and raceway pond conditions. Desmodesmus sp. MCC34 showed the highest specific growth rate (0.26 day-1), biomass production (1.9 g L-1) and lipid productivity (103 mg L-1 day-1). The optimal temperature and saturating light intensity for maximal growth of Desmodesmus sp. MCC34 were 35 °C and 75 μmol m-2 s-1 with molar extinction coefficient of 0.22 m2 g-1, respectively. Desmodesmus sp. MCC34 was then subjected to outdoor cultivation in a 20-m long raceway pond for 18 days during March and November 2013. The areal biomass productivity and volumetric biomass productivity were 13946.23 kg ha-1 year-1 and 56.94 mg L- 1day-1 during the month of March, decreasing to 6262.28 kg ha-1 year-1 and 25.57 mg L- 1day-1 during the month of November. A mathematical model was constructed to explain the relationship between biomass production and growth parameters such as temperature, light intensity and nutrient concentration. The productivity values predicted with the proposed model correspond well with the experimental data, suggesting the validity of the model. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, a thermoacidophilic bacterium, has a repertoire of thermo- and acid-stable enzymes that deconstruct lignocellulosic compounds. The work presented here describes the ability of A. acidocaldarius to reduce the concentration of the phenolic compounds: phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid during growth conditions. The extent and rate of the removal of these compounds were significantly increased by the presence of micro-molar copper concentrations, suggesting activity by copper oxidases that have been identified in the genome of A. acidocaldarius. Substrate removal kinetics was first order for phenol, ferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and sinapinic acid in the presence of 50 μM copper sulfate. In addition, laccase enzyme assays of cellular protein fractions suggested significant activity on a lignin analog between the temperatures of 45 and 90 °C. This work shows the potential for A. acidocaldarius to degrade phenolic compounds, demonstrating potential relevance to biofuel production and other industrial processes. © 2015, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology (outside the USA).

AB  - Although the biofuel market remains at its early stage, it is expected to play an important role in climate policy in the future in the transportation sector. In this paper, we develop a bottom-up equilibrium model to study the supply chain of the biofuel market, explicitly formulating the interactions among farmers, biofuel producers, blenders, and consumers. The model is built on optimization problems faced by each entity and considers decisions associated with farmers’ land allocation, biomass transportation, biofuel production, and biofuel blending. As such, the model is capable of and appropriate for policy analysis related to interactions among multiple stakeholders. For example, the model can be used to analyze the impacts of biofuel policies on market outcomes, pass-through of taxes or subsidies, and distribution of consumers’ or producers’ surplus. The equilibrium model can also serve as an analytical tool to study the price impact of biomass, biofuel, and Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for biofuels. We demonstrate the model by applying it to a case study of Iowa. We specifically focus on the effects of market structure, i.e., points-of-implementation on subsidies on market outcomes. The results indicate that some entities can benefit greatly at the expense of others when they possess market power. Government oversight is therefore needed to safeguard the development of the sector. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Roadmaps towards sustainable bioeconomy, including the production of biofuels, in many EU countries mostly rely on biomass use. However, although biomass is renewable, the efficiency of biomass production is too low to be able to fully replace the fossil fuels. The use of land for fuel production also introduces ethical problems in increasing the food price. Harvesting solar energy by the photosynthetic machinery of plants and autotrophic microorganisms is the basis for all biomass production. This paper describes current challenges and possibilities to sustainably increase the biomass production and highlights future technologies to further enhance biofuel production directly from sunlight. The biggest scientific breakthroughs are expected to rely on a new technology called “synthetic biology”, which makes engineering of biological systems possible. It will enable direct conversion of solar energy to a fuel from inexhaustible raw materials: sun light, water and CO2. In the future, such solar biofuels are expected to be produced in engineered photosynthetic microorganisms or in completely synthetic living factories. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines three technology routes for lowering the carbon intensity of biofuels: (1) a leapfrog route that focuses on major technological breakthroughs in lignocellulosic pathways at new, stand-alone biorefineries; (2) an incremental route in which improvements are made to existing U.S. corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel biorefineries; and (3) a transitional route in which biotechnology firms gain experience growing, handling, or chemically converting lignocellulosic biomass in a lower-risk fashion than leapfrog biorefineries by leveraging existing capital stock. We find the incremental route is likely to involve the largest production volumes and greenhouse gas benefits until at least the mid-2020s, but transitional and leapfrog biofuels together have far greater long-term potential. We estimate that the Renewable Fuel Standard, California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and federal tax credits provided an incentive of roughly $1.5-2.5 per gallon of leapfrog biofuel between 2012 and 2015, but that regulatory elements in these policies mostly incentivize lower-risk incremental investments. Adjustments in policy may be necessary to bring a greater focus on transitional technologies that provide targeted learning and cost reduction opportunities for leapfrog biofuels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposite is of great significance in biofuel production, energy storage and conversion, catalysis, environmental protection, and biology and medicine. To understand how montmorillonite facilitates the conversion of cellulose into hydrochar, it is essential to accurately control the properties and structure of hydrochar and its nanocomposites for technological applications. In this work, hydrochar and montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposites were produced by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at 200 °C for 2-24 h in the absence and the presence of montmorillonite. The roles of montmorillonite in the formation of hydrochar were explored in detail. Results showed that montmorillonite acted as a catalyst, an adsorbent, and an inorganic template for hydrochar formation. The formation process of montmorillonite-hydrochar nanocomposite can be divided into two stages: first, the hydrolysis of cellulose yielding degraded liquid products (e.g. glucose, fructose, and organic acids); second, the formed liquid products were adsorbed by montmorillonite, which catalyzed condensation and aromatization to form hydrochar particles on the surface of montmorillonite. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The optimal supply chain configuration for biomass production on a given territory is identified by a two-tier approach, which considers both the environmental and the economic points of view. The first tier performs a quick evaluation of the supply chain, based on simplified assumptions and on average values of the parameters characterizing the geographical territory. The second tier allows for the inclusion of spatially explicit parameters of the territory and realizes a more detailed optimization of the supply chain using a multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming framework. A demonstrative case study is presented for the bio-fuel supply to a centralized electric power plant. The considered supply chain is based on miscanthus, cultivated in marginal terrains and converted to pyro-oil in a number of delocalized plants for long distance shipment. The results obtained from the two tiers of the model provide quantitative information, to support quick and effective decision making on the optimal configuration of the supply chain in terms of plant size, location, transport logistics and cultivation. © 2015.

AB  - In the situation of increasing agricultural utilization of residues from biogas production (RBP) it is important to determine the concentration of contaminants, which could occur in these materials. The group of contaminants that requires special attention are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The objective of the study was to determine the total and freely dissolved (Cfree) of PAHs in RBP from 6 different biogas plants operating under various temperature conditions and without or with the separation into the solid and liquid fractions. The freely dissolved PAHs were determined using polyoxymethylene (POM method). The total content of the Σ16 PAHs in RBP varied from 449 to 6147 μg/kgdw, while that of Cfree PAHs was at the level from 57 to 653 ng/L. No significant differences were noted in the content of the Σ16 PAHs (total) between the solid and the liquid fractions. This indicates that in the course of the separation, the PAHs are distributed proportionally between the fractions. However in the case of Cfree, PAHs content in the solid fraction was over twice as high as in the liquid fraction. This was probably due to the greater affinity of the particles present in the liquid fraction to the analysed PAHs than to the particles of the solid fraction. Higher affinity to liquid fraction was also confirmed by the distribution coefficients KTOC determined on the basis of Cfree. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is growing interest in developing non-photosynthetic routes for the conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals. One underexplored approach is the transfer of energy to the metabolism of genetically modified chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an obligate chemolithoautotroph that derives its metabolic energy from the oxidation of iron or sulfur at low pH. Two heterologous biosynthetic pathways have been expressed in A. ferrooxidans to produce either isobutyric acid or heptadecane from CO2 and the oxidation of Fe2+. A sevenfold improvement in productivity of isobutyric acid was obtained through improved media formulations in batch cultures. Steady-state efficiencies were lower in continuous cultures, likely due to ferric inhibition. If coupled to solar panels, the photon-to-fuel efficiency of this proof-of-principle process approaches estimates for agriculture-derived biofuels. These efforts lay the foundation for the utilization of this organism in the exploitation of electrical energy for biochemical synthesis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - We studied the effects of different wood harvesting and utilisation policies on the carbon balance and economic profitability of forestry under the current and changing climate (A1B climate scenario). Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study describes a framework to attribute national-level atmospheric emissions in the year 2010 from the residential sector, one of the largest energy-related sources of aerosol emissions. We place special emphasis on end-uses, dividing usage into cooking, heating, lighting, and others. This study covers regions where solid biomass fuel provides more than 50% of total residential energy: Latin America, Africa, and Asia (5.2 billion people in 2010). Using nightlight data and population density, we classify five land types: urban, electrified rural with forest access, electrified rural without forest access, non-electrified rural with forest access, and non-electrified rural without forest access. We then apportion national-level residential fuel consumption among all land-types and end-uses, and assign end-use technologies to each combination. The resulting calculation gives spatially-distributed emissions of particulate matter, black carbon, organic carbon, nitrogen oxides, methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Within this study region, about 13% of the energy is consumed in urban areas, and 45% in non-urban land near forests. About half the energy is consumed in land without access to electricity. Cooking accounts for 54% of the consumption, heating for 9%, and lighting only 2%, with unidentified uses making up the remainder. Because biofuel use is assumed to occur preferentially where wood is accessible and electricity is not, our method shifts emissions to land types without electrification, compared with previous methods. The framework developed here is an important first step in acknowledging the role of household needs and local constraints in choosing energy provision. Although data and relationships described here need further development, this structure offers a more physically-based understanding of residential energy choices and, ultimately, opportunities for emission reduction. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Energy supply and its efficient use in production are key to ensuring the healthy functioning of the world economies. Based on that, to ensure sustainability, the supply and use of energy have to apply the principle of minimising negative environmental impacts and even improving the environment through net-regenerative development. In this context, ensuring cleaner energy is the cornerstone for cleaner production, especially for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, which are directly related to the types and loads of the energy sources used. This introductory article presents a review of the main lessons recently learned in the area of more efficient energy use, cleaner fuels and biofuels, cleaner production, CO 2 capture, optimisation and waste management. This article provides the readers with ideas and technologies that can be incorporated into real world solutions and can serve as the foundations for future research. With firm realisation of the importance of these issues, the 17th conference "Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction - PRES" was held in Prague, Czech Republic, to provide a platform for discussing ideas and devising solutions for cleaner energy supplies that are used more effectively and efficiently. This was followed by comprehensive research that resulted in several high quality scientific contributions published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The wide topical coverage and the high quality provided excellent directions for future collaborative research of the PRES family - including process level emission minimisation, self-sufficient regions, and industrial symbiosis for optimizing usage of waste heat and waste material flows. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work aims to assess the impacts of biodiesel blends use in road-traffic on air quality. In this frame, the air quality numerical modelling system WRF-EURAD was applied over Portugal and the Porto urban area, forced by two emission scenarios (including CO, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and benzene): a reference scenario, without biofuels, and a scenario where a B20 fuel (20% biodiesel/80% diesel, v/v) is used by the diesel vehicle fleet. Regarding carbonyl compounds, emission scenarios pointed out that B20 fuel can promote an increase of 20% on formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein emissions, leading to increments on equivalent ozone production. On the other hand, through the air quality modelling exercise, it was verified that the use of B20 helps in controlling air pollution, improving CO and NO2 concentrations in urban airshed in about 20% and 10%, respectively, taking into account a regional simulation grid. However, according to the urban scale simulation, NO2 levels can increase in about 1%, due to the use of B20, over the Porto urban area. For the remaining studied pollutants, namely PM10 and PM2.5, mean concentrations will be reduced all over the territory, however in a negligible amount of &lt;1%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, laboratory scale digesters were operated to simulate potential shocks to the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) process at a 350 ML/day wastewater treatment plant. The shocks included high (42 °C) and low (32 °C) temperature (either side of mesophilic 37 °C) and a 20% loading of fats, oil and grease (FOG; 20% w:v). These variables were explored at two sludge retention times (12 and 20 days) and two organic loading rates (2.0 and 2.5 kgTS/m3day OLR). Metagenomic and metabolomic approaches were then used to characterise the impact of operational shocks in regard to temperature and FOG addition, as determined through monitoring of biogas production, the microbial profile and their metabolism. Results showed that AD performance was not greatly affected by temperature shocks, with the biggest impact being a reduction in biogas production at 42 °C that persisted for 32 ± 1 days. The average biogas production across all digesters at the completion of the experiment was 264.1 ± 76.5 mL/day, with FOG addition observed to significantly promote biogas production (+87.8 mL/day). Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of the digesters indicated that methanogens and methane oxidising bacteria (MOB) were low in relative abundance, and that the ratio of oxidising bacteria (methane, sulphide and sulphate) with respect to sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) had a noticeable influence on biogas production. Furthermore, increased biogas production correlated with an increase in short chain fatty acids, a product of the addition of 20% FOG. This work demonstrates the application of metagenomics and metabolomics to characterise the microbiota and their metabolism in AD digesters, providing insight to the resilience of crucial microbial populations when exposed to operational shocks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The article starts from the premise that agricultural bioenergy crop production has massive influence in changing the land use paradigm in Romania, due the fact that important land surface areas are cultivated with such crops because of the increasing demand of biofuels. The main aim of the paper is to answer a research question: are there any changes in arable land use patterns determined by the increasing of the agricultural bioenergy crop production and what is the pressure on food consumption? The results show that the competition agricultural vs. energy crops has a considerable impact on land use pattern changes and food security. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - There is a need to explore alternative energy sources to meet the future energy demand in a sustainable way. Algae could be a potential feed stock for biodiesel and other co-products such as animal feed and chemicals. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of such production system has to be assessed before any implementation at commercial scale. In this context, a prospective LCA of algae biorefinery considering selected multi-products (biodiesel, protein and succinic acid) was carried out to estimate the environmental impact compared to a reference system. LCA results revealed less CO2 emissions and land use for biodiesel, protein and succinic acid production system compared to that of only biodiesel and protein production system from algae. The impact reduction was even more when compared with conventional diesel, soy protein and fossil based succinic acid system. A higher carbohydrate composition in algae favors less CO2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption in the algae system compared to that of the reference system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Demetalization of sewage sludge (SS) by sequential extraction before liquefaction was implemented to produce cleaner bio-char and bio-oil. Demetalization steps 1 and 2 did not cause much organic matter loss on SS, and thus the bio-oil and bio-char yields and the compositions of bio-oils were also not affected significantly. However, the demetalization procedures resulted in the production of cleaner bio-chars and bio-oils. The total concentrations and the acid soluble/exchangeable fraction (F1 fraction, the most toxic heavy metal fraction) of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in these products were significantly reduced and the environmental risks of these products were also relived considerably compared with those produced from raw SS, respectively. Additionally, these bio-oils had less heavy fractions. Demetalization processes with removal of F1 and F2 fractions of heavy metals would benefit the production of cleaner bio-char and bio-oil by liquefaction of heavy metal abundant biomass like SS. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates the suitability of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), fiber hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), energy sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), Amur silver-grass (Miscanthus sacchariflorus), and energy grass cultivar (cv) Szarvasi-1 for biofuel production in Northern climatic conditions. Above ground biomass, bioethanol production yield, and methane production yield are used as indicators to assess the bio-energy potential of the culture. Results presented show that energy crops of Southern origin produce 30-70% less biomass than in the origin region. Nonetheless, both perennial and annual energy crops produce high above ground biomass yields (660-1280 g m-2) for Northern climatic conditions. Experimental results show that bioethanol yield is dependent on cellulose content of the biomass. The higher the cellulose content, the higher the bioethanol yield. The biogas production on the other hand, depends on lignin content. The lower the lignin content the higher the biogas yield. Therefore, the selection of the energy crop for bioethanol production should be based on high cellulose content, while for biogas production it should rather be based on the low lignin content. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper studies if intensity and recentness of wartime violence is related to the trajectory of post-conflict agricultural development. We consider the case of Mozambique, where the government has made agricultural concessions to corporations, as well as land grants to communities. These uses may stand in competition with one another, and we test if violence affects the awarding of concessions or land grants. We analyze district-level, GIS-generated data on concessions, grants, and civil war events. We find wartime violence intensity is associated with more concessions and fewer grants. We conversely find recentness of violence is associated with fewer concessions and more grants. Embedding our empirical analysis in a community resilience framework, we suggest the intensity of wartime violence may erode local institutions - be they traditional governance structures, or agricultural cooperatives seeking community lands - or limit their access to government bodies and local NGOs tasked with vetting, delimiting, and monitoring proposed concessions. Paradoxically, recentness violence may mobilize those same institutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures are a leading feedstock choice for producing cellulosic biofuels. However, in natural stands, switchgrass is only dominant in a narrow ecological niche of the Tallgrass Prairie. This suggests that strategically selected monocultures or binary mixtures of species, adapted to particular ecological niches, might outyield switchgrass monocultures while increasing biodiversity at the field and landscape scales. To test this hypothesis, we planted monocultures of switchgrass and three alternative species at each of three landscape positions (shoulderslope, midslope, and footslope). Alternative species were also mixed with switchgrass such that they composed 33 or 67% of the total number of plants in each plot. Alternative species at each position included a C3 grass, a C4 grass, and a forb. Biomass data were collected in autumn during each of the two consecutive years following the establishment year. At the shoulderslope, the highest-yielding treatments were those containing little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium; 12.0Mgha-1) and those dominated by switchgrass (10.4Mgha-1). At the midslope and footslope, there were interactions of year×treatment (p&lt;0.05). In general, the highest-yielding treatments at the midslope were those containing big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii; 16.4Mgha-1). At the footslope in 2013, the prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) monoculture and treatments with at least 67% of the plants being cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) produced the most biomass (24.3Mgha-1; p&lt;0.05) but there were few yield differences at the footslope in 2014. This research demonstrated that biomass yield of two- and three-year-old stands of monocultures or binary mixtures of native plant species with switchgrass, when appropriately matched to their natural landscape positions, produced biomass in equal or greater amounts than switchgrass monocultures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy crops are considered key actors in meeting the international and European carbon reduction targets, increasing the national energy security through renewable energy production, mitigating climate change impacts, and promoting sustainability. Multicriteria analysis is a suitable decision-making tool for the energy sector, where the final decisions have to consider for a range of aspects, and can be utilised as well for deciding on appropriate energy crops. In this paper, a popular multicriteria method, PROMETHEE, is employed for the identification of the most optimal energy crops for their exploitation in Cyprus. The criteria and the weights of each are defined, and accordingly five different scenarios are developed and examined. The obtained results indicated that the promotion of second-generation energy crops is more ideal in terms of the set objectives, as well as more sustainable than the exploitation of any first-generation energy crop. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Despite the growing importance of energy cropping systems, little is known about their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in topsoils and subsoils. Furthermore, information regarding the impact of N-fertilization on C-sequestration for perennial compared with annual energy cropping systems is scarce. In order to study SOC changes in the soils of different energy cropping systems, a long-term study was established in southwestern Germany with the following cropping systems: energy maize (Zea mays) with reduced tillage, Miscanthus (M. x giganteus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and willow (Salix schwerinii x viminalis), as well as a crop rotation with conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) consisting of oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleifera), winter triticale (Triticale triticosecale) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). The soil is a Haplic Luvisol (Siltic). For each cropping system three N-fertilization regimes adapted to the needs of each crop were applied. With the main hypothesis that perennial energy cropping systems increase SOC stocks compared with conventional annual cropping systems, the SOC stocks were analyzed to a depth of 90cm after 11 years of continuous cropping (2002-2012). Compared with the control (CT) with 76 Mg SOC ha -1 , the perennial crops had significantly higher SOC stocks in all N-fertilization regimes, which amounted to 92-95 Mg SOC ha -1 in the N1-fertilization regime. The crop rotation with NT also had higher SOC stocks with 93 Mg SOC ha -1 in the N1-fertilization regime. N-fertilization generally led to higher SOC stocks in all cropping systems, although SOC stocks did not increase any further from reduced to highest crop-specific N-fertilization, with the exception of energy maize. The current findings also stress the importance of subsoil carbon analyses: SOC stocks at a depth from 30 to 90cm made up 44-55% of the total stocks and differed significantly between cropping systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive application of vinasse, a subproduct from sugar cane plantations for bioethanol production, is currently taking place as a source of nutrients that forms part of agricultural management in different agroclimatic regions. Liquid vinasse composition is characterised by high variability of organic compounds and major ions, acid pH (4.7), high TDS concentration (117,416-599,400mgL-1) and elevated EC (14,350-64,099μScm-1). A large-scale sugar cane field application is taking place in Valle del Cauca (Colombia), where monitoring of soil, unsaturated zone and the aquifer underneath has been made since 2006 to evaluate possible impacts on three experimental plots. For this assessment, monitoring wells and piezometers were installed to determine groundwater flow and water samples were collected for chemical analysis. In the unsaturated zone, tensiometers were installed at different depths to determine flow patterns, while suction lysimeters were used for water sample chemical determinations. The findings show that in the sandy loam plot (Hacienda Real), the unsaturated zone is characterised by low water retention, showing a high transport capacity, while the other two plots of silty composition presented temporal saturation due to La Niña event (2010-2011). The strong La Niña effect on aquifer recharge which would dilute the infiltrated water during the monitoring period and, on the other hand dissolution of possible precipitated salts bringing them back into solution may occur. A slight increase in the concentration of major ions was observed in groundwater (~5% of TDS), which can be attributed to a combination of factors: vinasse dilution produced by water input and hydrochemical processes along with nutrient removal produced by sugar cane uptake. This fact may make the aquifer vulnerable to contamination. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Biofuels produced from nonedible sources that are cultivated on marginal lands represent a viable source of renewable and carbon-neutral energy. In this context, biodiesel obtained from Jatropha and Karanja oil seeds have received significant interest, especially in South Asian subcontinent. Both of these fuels are produced from nonedible plant seeds with high oil content, which can be grown on marginal lands. In this research, we have investigated the performance and emission characteristics of Jatropha and Karanja methyl esters (biodiesel) and their blends with diesel. Another objective is to examine the effect of long-term storage on biodiesel's oxidative stability. The biodiesels were produced at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, (IIT Kanpur), India, and the engine experiments were performed in a single cylinder, four-stroke, compression ignition engine at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Chicago. An endoscope was used to visualize in-cylinder combustion events and examine the soot distribution. The effects of fuel and start of injection (SOI) on engine performance and emissions were investigated. Results indicated that ignition delay was shorter with biodiesel. Consequently, the cylinder pressure and premixed heat release were higher for diesel compared to biodiesel. Engine performance data for biodiesel (J100, K100) and biodiesel blends (J30, K30) showed an increase in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) (10.9%, 7.6% for biodiesel and blend, respectively), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) (13.1% and 5.6%), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission (9.8% and 12.9%), and a reduction in brake specific hydrocarbon emission (BSHC) (8.64% and 12.9%), and brake specific CO emission (BSCO) (15.56% and 4.0%). The soot analysis from optical images qualitatively showed that biodiesel and blends produced less soot compared to diesel. The temperature profiles obtained from optical imaging further supported higher NOx in biodiesels and their blends compared to diesel. Additionally, the data indicated that retarding the injection timing leads to higher BSFC, but lower flame temperatures and NOx levels along with higher soot formation for all test fuels. The physicochemical properties such as fatty acid profile, cetane number, and oxygen content in biodiesels support the observed combustion and emission characteristics of the fuels tested in this study. Finally, the effect of long-term storage is found to increase the glycerol content, acid value, and cetane number of the two biodiesels, indicating some oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the fuels.

AB  - The hydrogenation of natural triglycerides to produce motor fuels has an increasing importance. Therefore increase the efficiency of the production is important. So a special case of hydrogenation of triglycerides was studied on a sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at wide range of process parameters (Pressure = 40 and 80 bar, Temperature = 320-380°C, Liquid Hourly Space Velocity = 0.75-2.0 h-1, H2/feed ratio = 600 m3/m3). The sulphur content of the feedstock was ensured with mixing a small amount (10%) of high sulphur containing (0.9%) gas oil into the sunflower oil to ensure the sulphided state of the catalyst. In comparison, the hydrogenation of a reference feedstock was examined which sulphur content was set to similar concentration (905 mg/kg) level by using an easily decomposable sulphur compound (dimethyl disulphide). By applying favourable process parameters (Temperature = 360-380°C, Pressure = 80 bar, Liquid Hourly Space Velocity = 0.75 to 1.0 h-1, H2/feed ratio = 600 m3/m3) the properties of the products being obtained in high yield satisfied the requirements of the EN 590:2013 standard, except Cold Filter Plugging Point and density values for both feedstocks. In case of the catalytic hydrogenation of triglycerides it was concluded to cover the sulphur content of the feedstock with straight run (high sulphur containing) gas oil is a suitable and cost-effective solution to preserve the sulphide state of the catalyst. Diesel fuel can be produced with blending of products of high cetane and low density into other gas oil streams. The hydrogenated vegetable oil products can improve the quality of low-quality gas oil streams to produce better quality diesel fuel with bio-component content. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 5-(Chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) is rapidly being established as a renewable platform chemical of great promise. The effects of mass transfer, reaction temperature, Hansen solvent parameters, solvent fraction, and initial glucose concentrations on yields of CMF, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), 2-(hydroxyacetyl)furan (HAF), levulinic acid (LA), and humic matter were investigated in a two-phase system of 6M HCl and an organic solvent. The ability of the solvent to extract HMF from the aqueous phase is found to be critical to achieving high CMF yields. Effective solvents must possess at least a small degree of Hansen hydrogen bonding capacity, and a high polarity is beneficial. Yields of CMF and HAF decrease with increasing glucose concentration but the yield of HMF is largely unaffected. The maximum productivity of CMF is achieved at a glucose loading of ca. 1.5M across all solvent fractions tested. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the potential production of non-food biofuels in China. The evaluation is conducted for ethanol and biodiesel. The ethanol production is predicted based on the available amounts of energy crops, agricultural and forest residues and waste molasses, while the biodiesel is predicted to be produced from wood energy plants and waste cooking oil. The results indicate that China's potential capacity on non-food biofuels from 2015 to 2030 will be in the range between 75.60 and 152.13 million metric tons. In order to exploit this potential capacity, there is a long way to march. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the European Union the demand for middle distillates is growing, while decrease in the gasoline demand can be observed. Even the most complex refineries are not able to produce the economic yield distribution from the processed crude oil which constantly meets the changing market demand. The growing need of diesel fuel can only be satisfied by using unconventional feedstocks, such as bio-originated resources and less valuable refinery streams (e.g. light cycle oil with high aromatic content, &gt;80%, from Fluid Catalytic Cracker). The aim of our experiments was the investigation (co-processing) of differently prepared mixtures from straight run gas oil (70-100%), light cycle oil (LCO: 0-10%) and waste animal fat (0-20%). There are no publicly available articles which present the use of these feedstock components. We investigated the effects of the process parameters (temperature: 300-380°C, pressure: 40-70 bar, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV): 0.75-2.0 -1, H2/feedstock ratio: 600 Nm3/m3) on the quality and quantity of products obtained from different composition feedstocks. We found that with the usage of favourable parameter combination the total conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA) into n-paraffins as well as the saturation of a significant part of the aromatic compounds and the desulphurisation of the LCO and straight run gas oil can be reached. Notable quality improvement was observed in case of all feedstock components at co-processing. High cetane number of alkanes formed from the conversion of triglycerides and FFAs, compensating the low cetane number of products (e.g. monoaromatics and diaromatics) from the saturation of polyaromatic components. Products obtained at advantageous process parameters can be excellent diesel fuel blending components, because they have low sulphur and aromatic content as well as adequate cetane number, density and cold flow properties. Besides these, they contain components from renewable sources, too. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In sugarcane biorefineries, the lignocellulosic portion of the sugarcane biomass (i.e. bagasse and cane trash) can be used as fuel for electricity production and/or feedstock for second generation (2G) ethanol. This study presents a techno-economic analysis of upgraded sugarcane biorefineries in Brazil, aiming at utilizing surplus bagasse and cane trash for electricity and/or ethanol production. The study investigates the trade-off on sugarcane biomass use for energy production: bioelectricity versus 2G ethanol production. The BeWhere mixed integer and spatially explicit model is used for evaluating the choice of technological options. Different scenarios are developed to find the optimal utilization of sugarcane biomass. The study finds that energy prices, type of electricity substituted, biofuel support and carbon tax, investment costs, and conversion efficiencies are the major factors influencing the technological choice. At the existing market and technological conditions applied in the upgraded biorefineries, 300PJy-1 2G ethanol could be optimally produced and exported to the EU, which corresponds to 2.5% of total transport fuel demand in the EU. This study provides a methodological framework on how to optimize the alternative use of agricultural residues and industrial co-products for energy production in agro-industries considering biomass supply chains, the pattern of domestic energy demand, and biofuel trade. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
