AB  - Catalytic cracking of camelina oil over Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst in a fixed-bed tubular reactor was investigated. An optimization study on the catalytic cracking conditions based on nine well-planned orthogonal experiments was carried out. Three main operation conditions including reaction temperature, liquid hourly space velocity and oil extraction press frequency were studied to examine their effects on the yield and quality of hydrocarbon biofuel produced. Characterization of the catalyst, hydrocarbon biofuel and non-condensable gas was conducted. There was no significant difference between the bulk structures of fresh Zn/ZSM-5 and used Zn/ZSM-5. Small ZnO particles dispersed well on the parent ZSM-5. Hydrocarbon biofuel contained 65.18% hydrocarbons and its properties including dynamic viscosity, density and higher heating value were improved after upgrading, compared to camelina oil. It was found that the oil extraction press frequency was the most important factor and liquid hourly space velocity was the least important factor for the hydrocarbon biofuel production. In addition, the optimum conditions for camelina oil upgrading were a combination of reaction temperature of 550°C, a liquid hourly space velocity of 1.0h-1 and an oil extraction press frequency of 15Hz. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) is a potential biodiesel crop that can be cultivated on marginal land because of its strong tolerance to drought and low soil nutrient content. However, seed yield remains low. To enhance the commercial viability and green index of Jatropha biofuel, a systemic and coordinated approach must be adopted to improve seed oil and biomass productivity. Here, we present our investigations on the Jatropha-associated nitrogen-fixing bacteria with an aim to understand and exploit the unique biology of this plant from the perspective of plant-microbe interactions. Results: An analysis of 1017 endophytic bacterial isolates derived from different parts of Jatropha revealed that diazotrophs were abundant and diversely distributed into five classes belonging to α, β, γ-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Methylobacterium species accounted for 69.1 % of endophytic bacterial isolates in leaves and surprisingly, 30.2 % which were able to fix nitrogen that inhabit in leaves. Among the Methylobacterium isolates, strain L2-4 was characterized in detail. Phylogenetically, strain L2-4 is closely related to M. radiotolerans and showed strong molybdenum-iron dependent acetylene reduction (AR) activity in vitro and in planta. Foliar spray of L2-4 led to successful colonization on both leaf surface and in internal tissues of systemic leaves and significantly improved plant height, leaf number, chlorophyll content and stem volume. Importantly, seed production was improved by 222.2 and 96.3 % in plants potted in sterilized and non-sterilized soil, respectively. Seed yield increase was associated with an increase in female-male flower ratio. Conclusion: The ability of Methylobacterium to fix nitrogen and colonize leaf tissues serves as an important trait for Jatropha. This bacteria-plant interaction may significantly contribute to Jatropha's tolerance to low soil nutrient content. Strain L2-4 opens a new possibility to improve plant's nitrogen supply from the leaves and may be exploited to significantly improve the productivity and Green Index of Jatropha biofuel. © 2015 Madhaiyan et al.

AB  - Background: Clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium capable of producing high value commodity chemicals and biofuels from the C1 gases present in synthesis gas. This common industrial waste gas can act as the sole energy and carbon source for the bacterium that converts the low value gaseous components into cellular building blocks and industrially relevant products via the action of the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway. Current research efforts are focused on the enhancement and extension of product formation in this organism via synthetic biology approaches. However, crucial to metabolic modelling and directed pathway engineering is a reliable and comprehensively annotated genome sequence. Results: We performed next generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq technology on the DSM10061 strain of Clostridium autoethanogenum and observed 243 single nucleotide discrepancies when compared to the published finished sequence (NCBI: GCA_000484505.1), with 59.1 % present in coding regions. These variations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and subsequent analysis suggested that the discrepancies were sequencing errors in the published genome not true single nucleotide polymorphisms. This was corroborated by the observation that over 90 % occurred within homopolymer regions of greater than 4 nucleotides in length. It was also observed that many genes containing these sequencing errors were annotated in the published closed genome as encoding proteins containing frameshift mutations (18 instances) or were annotated despite the coding frame containing stop codons, which if genuine, would severely hinder the organism's ability to survive. Furthermore, we have completed a comprehensive manual curation to reduce errors in the annotation that occur through serial use of automated annotation pipelines in related species. As a result, different functions were assigned to gene products or previous functional annotations rejected because of missing evidence in various occasions. Conclusions: We present a revised manually curated full genome sequence for Clostridium autoethanogenum DSM10061, which provides reliable information for genome-scale models that rely heavily on the accuracy of annotation, and represents an important step towards the manipulation and metabolic modelling of this industrially relevant acetogen. © 2015 Humphreys et al.

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of alcohol recovery technology on the economics, energy consumption, and environment of bioethanol production from brown algae. The process under consideration is the anaerobic digestion of brown algae to produce VFAs (volatile fatty acids), which are then hydrogenated to produce mixed alcohols. Three alternative processes, i.e., hybrid pervaporation/distillation (PV), hybrid vapor-permeation/distillation (VP), and classical molecular-sieves/distillation (classical), are considered for the dehydration and recovery of ethanol. The alternatives are analyzed in terms of product value (i.e., minimum ethanol selling price – MESP), capital costs, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. For a plant scale of 400,000 ton/year of dry brown algae, the MESPs for the PV (Pervaporation), VP (vapor permeation), and classical processes were calculated to be $1.06/gal, $1.08/gal, and $1.24/gal, respectively. Results show that the PV, VP, and classical processes have $2.0, $2.6, and $4.6 million/year utility costs, respectively, for the recovery of alcohols and produce 23.1, 30.2, and 62.2 kton CO2-eq/year greenhouse gases. Therefore, PV is more economical and environmentally friendly process, with lower MESP, CO2 emissions, and utility requirements. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the selling price of the heavier alcohols and biomass price have the highest impact on the economics of bioethanol production from brown algae. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates a novel strategy of reducing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants through co-firing bio-oil and sequestering biochar in agricultural lands. The heavy end fraction of bio-oil recovered from corn stover fast pyrolysis is blended and co-fired with bituminous coal to form a bio-oil co-firing fuel (BCF). Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kWh electricity produced vary from 1.02 to 0.26 kg CO2-eq among different cases, with BCF heavy end fractions ranging from 10% to 60%, which corresponds to a GHG emissions reduction of 2.9% to 74.9% compared with that from traditional bituminous coal power plants. We found a heavy end fraction between 34.8% and 37.3% is required to meet the Clean Power Plans emission regulation for new coal-fired power plants. The minimum electricity selling prices are predicted to increase from 8.8 to 14.9 cents/kWh, with heavy end fractions ranging from 30% to 60%. A minimum carbon price of 67.4 ± 13 per metric ton of CO2-eq was estimated to make BCF power commercially viable for the base case. These results suggest that BCF co-firing is an attractive pathway for clean power generation in existing power plants with a potential for significant reductions in carbon emissions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Field and laboratory trials of the energy crop species Virginia mallow (Sida hermaphrodita L. Rusby) and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) were conducted to evaluate the effects of liming and nitrogen application on biomass and energy productivity and the suitability of the biomass for biofuel production. Independent of the growing year, the average DM (dry mass) yields of cup plant and Virginia mallow ranged from 6746 kg ha-1 to 13,485 kg ha-1 and from 4675 kg ha-1 to 7451 kg ha-1, respectively. The Virginia mallow and cup plant pellet humidity ranged from 9.6% to 11.6%, and the Virginia mallow pellet density reached 969.3 kg m-3 DM. The ash contents of the Virginia mallow and cup plant pellet were high, reaching 10% and 6.1%, respectively. The net calorific values of the Virginia mallow and cup plant dry masses were 17.49-18.44 kJ ha-1 and 17.19 to 17.48 kJ kg-1, respectively, and were correlated with the biomass crude fibre content with energy outputs of 79-105 GJ ha-1 (for Virginia mallow) and 200-236 GJ ha-1 (for cup plant). The energy expenses of the Virginia mallow and cup plant growing methods (including planting and harvesting year) reached 8630-29,264 MJ ha-1. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As Ghana's economy grows, the choice of future energy paths and policies in the coming years will have a significant influence on its energy security. A Renewable Energy Act approved in 2011 seeks to encourage the influx of renewable energy sources in Ghana's energy mix. The new legal framework combined with increasing demand for energy has created an opportunity for dramatic changes in the way energy is generated in Ghana. However, the impending changes and their implication remain uncertain. This paper examines the extent to which future energy scenarios in Ghana could rely on energy from biomass sources, through the production of biogas, liquid biofuels and electricity. Analysis was based on moderate and high use of bioenergy for transportation, electricity generation and residential fuel using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) model. Results obtained indicate that introducing bioenergy to the energy mix could reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by about 6 million tonnes CO2e by 2030, equivalent to a 14% reduction in a business-as-usual scenario. This paper advocates the use of second generation ethanol for transport, to the extent that it is economically exploitable. Resorting to first generation ethanol would require the allocation of over 580,000 ha of agricultural land for ethanol production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are suitable alternatives to conventional and fossil fuels that pose serious environmental adverse effects to society. Bioethanol is the most promising biofuel and can be generated from lignocellulosic biomasses. Forest residues are outside the human food chain and inexpensive raw materials, but they need a previous pretreatment, in order to improve the cellulose accessibility for further bioconversion. The study of bioethanol production from rockrose pretreated by steam explosion (SE) was carried out employing separate enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) approaches. Saccharification of untreated rockrose attained only 0.9% of sugars yield. However, the steam explosion pretreatment promoted the disruption of interfibrillar surfaces of fibers with partial degradation of lignin thus enhancing the accessibility of polysaccharides toward enzymatic hydrolysis. Alkaline extraction after steam explosion pretreatment of rockrose residue (R-SE-OH) led to the partial removal of lignin, hemicelluloses, and other degradation products from fibre surface allowing an increase of 75% in the glucose yield. Bioethanol production in SSF mode was faster and slightly more efficient process than SHF providing the best results: ethanol concentration of 16.1 g L-1, fermentation efficiency of 69.8% and a yield of 22.1 g ethanol/100 g R-SE-OH. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hunger of the modern human society for energy is tremendous, which is increasing with the increasing population and with the pursuit of higher standards of living. A significant proportion of this energy demand is made up by the different fuels which ensure mobility. Based on environmental and energetic considerations, a larger proportion of this energy is trying to be covered with renewable energy sources on the whole world. Recently mankind utilised the first generation of biofuels for the transportation sector (bioethanol and biodiesel), but the development has not stopped. Today, the second generation is on the border of utilisation (2nd gen. bioethanol and bio gas oil - mixture of iso and normal paraffins). In this article, we are focusing on the topic of 2nd generation bio derived Diesel fuel, the so-called bio gas oil. We are investigating the possibilities of the utilisation of a new, waste feedstock, namely the brown greases which are the products of rendering facilities, in co-process with high sulphur containing heavy gas oil (1.2% sulphur content). During our experiments we produced bio gas oil containing gas oil fraction via the most favourable process parameters of hydrogenation (T: 330-340°C, p: 50 bar, LHSV: 1.0 h-1) and isomerisation (T: 340°C, p: 50 bar, 1.0 h-1) of waste lard containing gas oil stream. We determined that these kinds of waste fatty materials can be appropriate feedstocks for the production of renewable diesel-fuel components. In addition, these materials are cheap, and their iLUC (indirect land use change) value is practically zero. The properties (cetane number: ≥54, CFPP: -10 to -20°C, yield: &gt;91%) of the product obtained after the two consecutive process steps met the valid standard for diesel fuel, thus we proved that this kind of waste feedstock can be an option for bio derived engine fuel production. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae-sourced feedstocks remain confined to commercialization because of the high cost and energy consumption of biomass cultivation and feedstock extraction. In this study, to reduce the energy consumption required for algae extraction, experiments with Chlorella vulgais extraction by ionic liquids (ILs) combined with CO2 capture were conducted considering that captured CO2 by ILs can compensate the energy consumption of extraction. The results showed that the addition of CO2 to [BMIM][BF4] increased the lipid yield of Chlorella vulgaris from 68.0% to 75.6%. The properties of synthesized biodiesel from C. vulgaris lipids met the UNE-EN 14214 European biodiesel standard except for oxidative stability. Protein denaturation and degradation were found during the lysis of algae cells. Approximately 82.2wt.% of the total extracted proteins could be precipitated during both algae lysis and supernatant liquid drying. A microalgae-to-biofuel route including C. vulgaris extraction and CO2 capture was proposed that involves wet algae input and delivery outputs of water, biodiesel, pyrolysis oil, proteins, sugars, biogas and glycerol. Fossil energy ratios (FER) based on the overall energy balance were 3.30 (n=1, n is the volume ratio of IL to wet algae) and 3.84 (n=2) for [BMIM][BF4] with CO2 capture, approximately 2.5 times those based on commercially available technologies. The possibilities of synthesizing novel ILs that show both high CO2 absorption and good abilities in cell wall breakage are discussed. More progress is greatly needed to reduce IL recovery loss. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents: (a) results of gross primary production (GPP) 8-d estimated values using a light use efficiency model (LUE) in a non-irrigated rotating rapeseed crop in the upper Spanish plateau, and (b) inter-comparison results of observed GPP with those concurrently retrieved by MODIS. The rotation scheme over the four-year study comprised rapeseed, wheat, peas and rye. Rapeseed, peas and, in part, rye grew under well-watered conditions whereas wheat was dominated by drought. Input data for the LUE model were the fraction of PAR absorbed (FPAR) 8-d products supplied by MODIS (FPARMODIS), in situ photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) measurements and a scalar f varying between 0 and 1, to take into account the reduction of the maximum PAR conversion efficiency (ε0LUE) under limiting environmental conditions. In this study, f values were assumed to be dependent on air temperature (T) and the evaporative fraction which was considered a proxy of water availability. ε0LUE, a key parameter in LUE models, which varied according to land use, was derived through the results of a linear regression fit between observed GPP and concurrent GAPAR estimates defined as the product of PAR, FPARMODIS and f. Overall, the LUE model provided satisfactory results, R2=86.3%, significantly improving GPP MODIS estimates (GPPMODIS), R2=71.8%. GPPMODIS uncertainties have primarily been attributed to differences in the f stress factor involved in its formulation (fMODIS) depending on vapour pressure deficit and T which did not fully describe the environmental stress conditions at the measuring site. Overall, ε0LUE yielded 3.33±0.10gCMJ-1 although this varied depending on crop architecture, phenology and prevailing meteorological conditions. Crop-to-crop ε0LUE ranged from 2.74±0.17 to 3.95±0.19gCMJ-1 for peas and rye, respectively, yielding intermediate values for rapeseed and wheat, 2.92±0.18 and 2.86±0.23gCMJ-1, respectively. ε0MODIS, derived from the linear fit of GPP versus GPPMODIS estimates, yielded 2.13±0.10gCMJ-1 and crop-to-crop ranged from 1.28±0.17 to 2.41±0.12gCMJ-1 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively. The best linear fits corresponded to crops growing under well-watered conditions, rapeseed and peas, and the worst fits were for wheat, affected by drought. GPP annuals were 1680, 710, 730 and 1410gCm-2 for rapeseed, wheat, peas and rye, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European Union aims to reach a 10% share of biofuels in the transport sector by 2020. The major burden is most likely to fall on already established annual energy crops such as rapeseed and cereals for the production of biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively. Annual energy crops are typically cultivated in intensive agricultural production systems, which require the application of pesticides. Agricultural pesticides can have adverse effects on aquatic invertebrates in adjacent streams. We assessed the relative ecological risk to aquatic invertebrates associated with the chemical pest management from six energy crops (maize, potato, sugar beet, winter barley, winter rapeseed, and winter wheat) as well as from mixed cultivation scenarios.The pesticide exposure related to energy crops and cultivation scenarios was estimated as surface runoff for 253 small stream sites in Central Germany using a GIS-based runoff potential model. The ecological risk for aquatic invertebrates, an important organism group for the functioning of stream ecosystems, was assessed using acute toxicity data (48-h LC50 values) of the crustacean Daphnia magna. We calculated the Ecological Risk from potential Pesticide Runoff (ERPR) for all three main groups of pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides). Our findings suggest that the crops potato, sugar beet, and rapeseed pose a higher ecological risk to aquatic invertebrates than maize, barley, and wheat. As maize had by far the lowest ERPR values, from the perspective of pesticide pollution, its cultivation as substrate for the production of the gaseous biofuel biomethane may be preferable compared to the production of, for example, biodiesel from rapeseed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the major causes of crop stress is soil or water salinity. Thus, selection of the best species for cultivation in semiarid and arid climates is fundamental. Salvadora persica is an evergreen perennial halophyte that can grow under extreme conditions, from very dry environments to highly saline soils. Based on international bibliography, the authors outlined an agro-ecological zoning model to determine the potential cultivation zones for S. persica in Argentina. This model may be applied to any part of the world, using the agro-ecological limits presented in this work. All the maps were developed by the implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) that can be updated by the further incorporation of complementary information, with the consequent improvement of the original database. The overlap of the agroclimatic suitability map on the drylands' saline soils and the drylands' alkaline soils maps, determined the agro-ecological zoning. Since some areas in the agro-ecological zoning can overlap with land that is already assigned for other uses, protected areas, current land use/cover of the different zones, and urban areas maps were incorporated into the GIS and subtracted by a mask. This resulted in the delimitation of "potential cultivation zoning", thus avoiding possible conflicts surrounding the use of land and making the agro-ecological zonation more efficient. There is a broad agro-ecological zone for cultivation of S. persica that extends from Northern Argentina to approximately 41° South latitude, under dry-subhumid to semiarid climates. Lands classified with different degrees of suitability in the potential cultivation zoning could be used for production of this species for energy purposes on lands that are either unsuitable for food production or currently assigned for other purposes. This paper represents pioneering work since there are no previous studies concerning the introduction of S. persica in Argentina. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) enable energy recovery from wastewater while simultaneously achieving high levels of treatment. The objective of this study was to elucidate how detailed design and operational decisions of submerged AnMBRs influence the technological, environmental, and economic sustainability of the system across its life cycle. Specific design and operational decisions evaluated included: solids retention time (SRT), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, sludge recycling ratio (r), flux (J), and specific gas demand per membrane area (SGD). The possibility of methane recovery (both as biogas and as soluble methane in reactor effluent) and bioenergy production, nutrient recovery, and final destination of the sludge (land application, landfill, or incineration) were also evaluated. The implications of these design and operational decisions were characterized by leveraging a quantitative sustainable design (QSD) framework which integrated steady-state performance modeling across seasonal temperatures (using pilot-scale experimental data and the simulating software DESASS), life cycle cost (LCC) analysis, and life cycle assessment (LCA). Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were used to characterize the relative importance of individual design decisions, and to navigate trade-offs across environmental, economic, and technological criteria. Based on this analysis, there are design and operational conditions under which submerged AnMBRs could be net energy positive and contribute to the pursuit of carbon negative wastewater treatment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Co-digestion has been used to improve biogas yields and the long-term stability of anaerobic digesters compared to mono-digestion; however, less is known about the ultimate inhibition from co-substrates at their maximum loading rates and mixing ratios because these limits cannot be practically tested by existing facilities. Here, we performed a controlled experiment with long operating periods to ensure sufficient acclimation with the goal to observe ultimate inhibition and the full benefit that can be gained from co-digestion. The three substrates: 1) food waste (FW); 2) alkaline hydrolysate (AH); and 3) crude glycerol (GY) were individually co-digested with dairy manure (MN) for more than 900 days using continuously stirred anaerobic reactors at mesophilic temperatures. Food waste caused no reduction in performance or stability when co-digested with manure up to a total organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.9 g volatile solids (VS)·L-1·Day-1 (MN:FW = 51:49; VS basis), resulting in a specific methane yield (SMY) of 297 ± 3 mL CH4·g VS-1 for the combined wastes. Alkaline hydrolysate was co-digested with manure up to a total OLR of 2.7 g VS·L-1·Day-1 (MN:AH = 75:25) with a corresponding SMY of 299 ± 6 mL CH4·g VS-1. However, the free ammonia concentration reached levels previously reported as inhibitory, and may have led to the observed accumulation of volatile fatty acids at higher loading rates. Crude glycerol co-digestion resulted in an optimum SMY of 549 ± 25 mL CH4·g VS-1 at a total OLR of 3.2 g VS·L-1·Day-1 (MN:GY = 62:38). Stable digestion beyond this level was prohibited by an accumulation of long-chain fatty acids and foaming. These results can be used to implement effective co-digestion strategies. Co-substrates that possess similar inhibiting characteristics should be monitored to prevent severe instability at high loading rates and mixing ratios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in plant development processes and play pivotal roles in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Salicornia europaea, a salt mash euhalophyte, is a suitable model plant to study salt adaptation mechanisms. S. europaea is also a vegetable, forage, and oilseed that can be used for saline land reclamation and biofuel precursor production on marginal lands. Despite its importance, no miRNA has been identified from S. europaea thus far. Results: Deep sequencing was performed to investigate small RNA transcriptome of S. europaea. Two hundred and ten conserved miRNAs comprising 51 families and 31 novel miRNAs (including seven miRNA star sequences) belonging to 30 families were identified. About half (13 out of 31) of the novel miRNAs were only detected in salt-treated samples. The expression of 43 conserved and 13 novel miRNAs significantly changed in response to salinity. In addition, 53 conserved and 13 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between the shoots and roots. Furthermore, 306 and 195 S. europaea unigenes were predicted to be targets of 41 conserved and 29 novel miRNA families, respectively. These targets encoded a wide range of proteins, and genes involved in transcription regulation constituted the largest category. Four of these genes encoding laccase, F-box family protein, SAC3/GANP family protein, and NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase were validated using 5'-RACE. Conclusions: Our results indicate that specific miRNAs are tightly regulated by salinity in the shoots and/or roots of S. europaea, which may play important roles in salt tolerance of this euhalophyte. The S. europaea salt-responsive miRNAs and miRNAs that target transcription factors, nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat proteins and enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis as well as carbon and nitrogen metabolism may be applied in genetic engineering of crops with high stress tolerance, and genetic modification of biofuel crops with high biomass and regulatable lignin biosynthesis. © 2015 Feng et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - The introduction and spread of potentially invasive species present profound ecological challenges with major consequences for natural and cultivated ecosystems. The spread of invasive species is driven by both invader traits and the landscapes they are colonizing and there is a pressing need for objective and quantitative methods that integrate landscape details into predictions of biological invasions. Here we develop a new spatially explicit integro-difference equation model to predict the spread of invasive species over real landscapes. We use this model to evaluate the spread of a potentially invasive biomass crop, namely a fertile variety of Miscanthus giganteus, as a case study of how such models can be used to aid decision making when managing agricultural landscapes. We show that M. giganteus has the ability to invade large landscapes, but the rate and extent of that spread is strongly dependent on the landscape, including composition, spatial structure and the presence of dispersal corridors. Lastly, we discuss the potential application and value of spatial models in risk analysis and management of novel agricultural production systems that include potentially invasive crops. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coal-bed natural gas production in the U.S. in 2012 was 1655 billion cubic feet (bcf). A by-product of this production is co-produced water, which is categorized as a waste product by the Environmental Protection Agency. The effects of varying concentrations of coal-bed methane (produced) water were studied in the greenhouse to elucidate their effects on two species as feedstock for lignocellulosic ethanol production: Panicum virgatum L. and Artemisia annua L. Two populations of A. annua were used, one from Canada and the other from Bulgaria. Plants were treated with varying ratios of produced water: control (0% produced or 100% municipal water), 25% produced, 50% produced, 75% produced, and 100% produced water. With increased concentration of produced water, the soil soluble Na increased, whereas soil soluble Mg and Ca decreased. The Na adsorption ratio (SAR) increased from 2 in the control to 21 in the 100% produced water treatment, and significant interaction was observed between the crop and water terms for electrical conductivity and phosphorus bicarbonate. SAR also increased in soils with both varieties of wormwood and with switchgrass as a result of increased concentrations of produced water. In addition, SAR was influenced by crop; SAR was higher in soil under switchgrass than in soil under the wormwood varieties. The biomass yields had significant interaction between crop and water treatments with Bulgarian wormwood consistently yielding more until the highest concentration of produced water when it decreased below that of Canadian wormwood. Bulgarian wormwood yielded the most with 131g/pot for the control followed by the 75% (118g/pot, statistically similar to control), 25% (111g/pot, statistically similar to control), and 50% (107g/pot) treatments. Biomass yields were reduced in the 100% produced water treatment. Regression analysis of the Canadian wormwood essential oil yield and constituents revealed weak correlations to increasing treatment of produced water. β-pinene, for which a quadratic yield curve was present, indicated a steep decline and leveling off of β-pinene production at high concentrations of produced water. The study shows increasing accumulation of Na and salts in the soil with increasing concentration of the produced (saline-sodic) water. High concentrations of these ions (average Na concentrations were 1156mgl-1) and salts in the 100% produced water treatment hampered growth and development of the plants. Implications of this research indicate that produced water could be utilized chemically untreated if diluted with high quality water. Produced water concentrations in dilution can be no higher than 25% in order to avoid deleterious soil and plant growth effects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - This study investigated the effects of biochar and compost, applied individually or together, on soil fertility, peanut yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a Ferralsol in north Queensland, Australia. The treatments were (1) inorganic fertilizer only (F) as a control; (2) 10tha-1 biochar+F (B+F); (3) 25t compost+F (Com+F)ha-1; (4) 2.5t Bha-1+25t Comha-1 mixed on site+F; and (5) 25tha-1 co-composted biochar-compost+F (COMBI+F). Application of B and COMBI increased seed yield by 23% and 24%, respectively. Biochar, compost and their mixtures significantly improved plant nutrient availability and use, which appeared critical in improving peanut performance. Soil organic carbon (SOC) increased from 0.93% (F only) to 1.25% (B amended), soil water content (SWC) from 18% (F only) to over 23% (B amended) and CEC from 8.9cmol(+)/kg (F only) to over 10.3cmol(+)/kg (organic amended). Peanut yield was significantly positively correlated with leaf chlorophyll content, nodulation number (NN), leaf nutrient concentration, SOC and SWC for the organic amendments. Fluxes of CO2 were highest for the F treatment and lowest for the COMBI treatment, whereas N2O flux was highest for the F treatment and all organic amended plots reduced N2O flux relative to the control. Principal component analysis indicates that 24 out of 30 characters in the first principal component (PRIN1) individually contributed substantial effects to the total variation between the treatments. Our study concludes that applications of B, Com, B+Com or COMBI have strong potential to, over time, improve SOC, SWC, soil nutrient status, peanut yield and abate GHG fluxes on tropical Ferralsols. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use change (LUC) in Brazil for sugarcane ethanol production has raised concerns about its potential environmental impacts. Soil quality is a key indicator to infer about the environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol production. Our objective was to quantify the effects of the most common LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on chemical attributes in tropical soils. Soil sampling was carried out in three study sites located in central-southern Brazil, primary sugarcane region of production and expansion of the world. Overall, long-term conversions from natural ecosystems to extensive pasturelands decreases available P, S, Ca, Mg and B contents. In addition, the LUC leads to soil acidification and decreases of CECpH7, indicating that pasturelands have poor soil chemical quality. The LUC from pasture to sugarcane increases soil nutrient levels and reduces the soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers. Despite that, increments of available P and base saturation are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions to sugarcane growth. Overall, our findings suggest that sugarcane expansion in Brazil replacing pasturelands will promotes improvements on soil chemical quality. Nevertheless, sugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to increase soil organic matter and improve the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and economic costs associated with ethanol production in Brazil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainability criteria for palm oil production guide new planting toward non-forest land cover on mineral soil, avoiding carbon debts caused by forest and peat conversion. Effects on soil carbon stock (soil Cstock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil Cstock (Mgha-1), soil bulk density (BD, gcm-3) and soil organic carbon concentration (Corg, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Corg (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in Corg (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil Cstock in the top 30cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil Cstock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil Cstock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation. © 2015 Z.

AB  - There is a carbon sequestration benefit to the ethanol manufacturing process if the CO2 that is created in the fermentation process in an ethanol plant is geologically stored by an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project. In order to recover one barrel of oil using CO2-EOR, an equal or greater amount of CO2 must be sequestered in order to recover the oil (~1.0-2.5 tonnes of CO2 are stored for each tonne of CO2 emissions resulting from combustion of the recovered oil). The oil produced from a CO2-EOR sequestration project is therefore either carbon neutral or carbon negative if the CO2 is sourced from the fermentation emissions from an ethanol plant. The 40.3 million metric tonnes of CO2 fermentation emissions vented during the production of 53.4 million liters of ethanol per year in the U.S. could result in production of 40-100 million barrels of carbon negative oil annually. A carbon value chain (CVC) based on carbon credits could incentivize the construction of a CCS infrastructure in the United States that begins with the capture of corn ethanol CO2 fermentation emissions. Utilization of biofuel fermentation emissions worldwide in bio-CO2-EOR sequestration projects would help achieve global CO2 emission reduction goals. © 2015 Z.

AB  - The economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels requires in addition to pretreatment techniques access to large quantities of inexpensive cellulases to be competitive with established first generation processes. A solution to this problem could be achieved by plant based expression of these enzymes. We expressed the complete set of six cellulases and an additional β-glucosidase expressed from Thermobifida fusca in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum). This was done to determine whether functional enzyme expression was feasible in these organisms. In extracts of recombinant E. coli cells, five of the proteins were detected by western blot analysis, but exocellulases E3 and E6 were undetectable. In the plant-based expression system we were able to detect all six cellulases but not the β-glucosidase even though activity was detectable. When E. coli was used as the expression system, endocellulase E2 was active, while endocellulases E1 and E5 showed only residual activity. The remaining cellulases appeared completely inactive against the model substrates azo-carboxymethyl-cellulose (Azo-CMC) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-cellobioside (4-MUC). Only the β-glucosidase showed high activity against 4-MUC. In contrast, all the plant-derived enzymes were active against the respective model substrates. Our data indicate that some enzymes of bacterial origin are more active and more efficiently expressed in plants than in a bacterial host. © Copyright © 2015 Klinger, Fischer and Commandeur.

AB  - Background: A significant fraction of short fibers commonly called “reject fines” is produced while recycling wastepaper at paper mills producing linerboard. These fines are usually rejected into the solid waste stream that further requires land filling and poses environmental problems. The major component of these rejects is cellulose that can be a potential source of fermentable sugars for biofuels, bioplastics or other products. Therefore, a feasible process for converting these reject fines into sugars can profit the paper mills by producing value for their waste products while simultaneously mitigating their adverse environmental impact by avoided solid waste. Additionally, the sugar feedstocks can be used to reduce fossil carbon contributing to the sustainability of the industry. Results: Enzymatic conversion of rejects fines from paper mills was achieved using commercial cellulases from Trichoderma reesei. The presence of mineral particles along with the cellulosic fines was found to have potent inhibitory effects on enzyme hydrolysis. The mineral particles are kaolin and calcium carbonate and originate from the fillers used in the wastepaper. The adsorption of the cellulase onto these mineral components was measured and quantified by the slope of the adsorption isotherm. The application of a nonionic surfactant Tween-80, decreased the adsorption of cellulase and this improved the hydrolysis yield of sugars. Conclusions: Enzymatic hydrolysis of rejects from recycled paper mills is feasible and provides a source of sugars for biofuels and bioplastics. However, the presence of mineral particles can be detrimental to this bioconversion. Calcium carbonate which occurs as a filler in waste paper shows high adsorption affinity to the cellulase enzymes and thus reduces the available enzyme for cellulolysis. This can be remedied by the application of surfactants which preferentially occlude to the mineral surfaces and thus increase enzyme availability in solution. The non-ionic surfactant, Tween-80, shows the best hydrolysis enhancement at a dosage of 3 % based on the dry weight of the biomass. © 2015 Min et al.

AB  - We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate farmers' decisions on crop type and fertilizer application in response to commodity and biofuel crop prices. Farm profit maximization constrained by farmers' profit expectations for land committed to biofuel crop production was used as the decision rule. Empirical parameters characterizing farmers' profit expectations were derived from an agricultural landowners and operators survey and integrated in the ABM. The integration of crop production cost models and the survey information in the ABM is critical to producing simulations that can provide realistic insights into agricultural land use planning and policy making. Model simulations were run with historical market prices and alternative market scenarios for corn price, soybean to corn price ratio, switchgrass price, and switchgrass to corn stover ratio. The results of the comparison between simulated cropland percentage and crop rotations with satellite-based land cover data suggest that farmers may be underestimating the effects that continuous corn production has on yields. The simulation results for alternative market scenarios based on a survey of agricultural land owners and operators in the Clear Creek Watershed in eastern Iowa show that farmers see cellulosic biofuel feedstock production in the form of perennial grasses or corn stover as a more risky enterprise than their current crop production systems, likely because of market and production risks and lock in effects. As a result farmers do not follow a simple farm-profit maximization rule. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Today the European Union has taken on both the challenge of energy security and that of food security. In the last decade the European legislature has specifically focused its attention on ensuring energy security in the European Union, probably thinking that the problem of European food security had already been solved. Having a secure supply of energy is crucial for the well-being of European citizens and the economy. Increasing energy production in the EU includes further deployment of renewable energies. In this context the appeal of Agro-Energy has increased: Agro-Energy is an alternative energy source which guarantees maximumenergy security while at the same time having a less disruptive environmental impact. Policies aimed at providing incentives for Agro-Energy crops combined with the lack of foresight of the European legislature in defining the contents of the medium-term CAP reformhave implied a considerable shrinking of other crops directly or indirectly used as food. Growing crops for bioenergy or biofuels is increasingly viewed as conflicting with food production. Balancing the needs of eco-compatible energetic production of agricultural origin with the need to safeguard the basic rights of food is indispensable. The new CAP tries to take that into account. Even if today the primary sector is also expected to diversify energy supply sources, it is necessary, however, to ensure that the increased attention given to Agro-Energy issues does not imply a decrease in attention to what is known as food security.

AB  - Concern over rising atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases due to fossil fuel combustion has intensified research into carbon-neutral energy production. Approximately 15.8 million ha of pine plantations exist across the southeastern United States, representing a vast land area advantageous for bioenergy production without significant landuse change or diversion of agricultural resources from food production. Furthermore, intercropping of pine with bioenergy grasses could provide annually harvestable, lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks along with production of traditional wood products. Viability of such a system hinges in part on soil nitrogen (N) availability and effects of N competition between pines and grasses on ecosystem productivity. We investigated effects of intercropping loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) with switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) on microbial N cycling processes in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA. Soil samples were collected from bedded rows of pine and interbed space of two treatments, composed of either volunteer native woody and herbaceous vegetation (pine-native) or pure switchgrass (pine-switchgrass) in interbeds. An in vitro 15N pool-dilution technique was employed to quantify gross N transformations at two soil depths (0-5 and 5-15 cm) on four dates in 2012-2013. At the 0-5 cm depth in beds of the pine-switchgrass treatment, gross N mineralization was two to three times higher in November and February compared to the pine-native treatment, resulting in increased NH4+ availability. Gross and net nitrification were also significantly higher in February in the same pine beds. In interbeds of the pine-switchgrass treatment, gross N mineralization was lower from April to November, but higher in February, potentially reflecting positive effects of switchgrass root-derived C inputs during dormancy on microbial activity. These findings indicate soil N cycling and availability has increased in pine beds of the pine-switchgrass treatment compared to those of the pine-native treatment, potentially alleviating any negative effects of N competition between pine and switchgrass. We expect that reduced soil C in the pine-switchgrass treatment, effects of pine and switchgrass rooting on soil C availability, and plant N demand are major factors influencing soil N transformations. Future research should examine rooting architecture in intercropped systems and the effects on soil microbial communities and function. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Background: The area used for bioenergy crops (annual row crops (e.g., wheat, maize), herbaceous perennial grasses, and short-rotation woody crops (e.g., poplar)) is increasing because the substitution of fossil fuels by bioenergy is promoted as an option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, biomass used for bioenergy production is not per se environmentally benign, since bioenergy crop production is associated with negative side effects such as GHG emissions from soil (dominated by N2O). N2O emissions vary greatly in space and time; thus, direct comparison of soil N2O fluxes from various agro-ecosystems is certainly crucial for the assessment of the GHG reduction potential from energy crops. Methods: Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the two different agro-ecosystems (cropland and agro-forestry) cultivated in central Germany for their environmental impact. In a 1-year field experiment, we compared N2O fluxes from cropland (non-fertilized wheat, N-fertilized wheat, non-fertilized faba bean, and wheat mixed intercropping with faba bean) and agro-forestry (non-fertilized poplar, N-fertilized poplar, non-fertilized Robinia, and poplar mixed intercropping with Robinia) as a randomized split-block design. Results: Rainfall at the field site was slightly over average during the period from 1 April to 1 July in 2014 (201 mm rain) and considerably below average during the same period in 2015 (100 mm rain). Cumulative mean N2O fluxes were up to five fold higher in agro-forestry than in arable crop treatments during 2014 growing period. We hypothesized that the difference in N2O emissions when comparing arable land and agro-forestry was mainly due to the limited water and nutrient uptake of plantations during the first year. Among the arable crops (wheat, N-fertilized wheat, wheat mixed intercropped with bean, and bean), seasonal and annual N2O emissions were highest in soils when faba bean was grown as a mono-crop. On the other hand, cumulative mean N2O fluxes were 31 % lower (p &lt; 0.05) when faba bean mixed with wheat than in soils planted with N-fertilized wheat. Conclusions: The latter clearly suggests that using legume crops as intercrop or mixed crop in wheat may significantly mitigate fertilizer-derived N2O fluxes and may be an effective proxy for increasing GHG emission savings for energy crops. © 2015, Senbayram et al.

AB  - Large parts of sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid changes in land use and land cover, driven largely by the expansion of small-scale shifting cultivation. This practice creates complex mosaic landscapes with active agricultural fields and patches of mature woodland, interspersed with remnant patches in various stages of regrowth. Our objective here was to examine the rate and extent to which carbon stocks in trees and soils recover after cultivation, and detail how this disturbance and regrowth affect patterns in tree species composition and diversity over 40 years of succession in a miombo woodland landscape in southeast Tanzania. We sampled 67 areas, including plots previously cleared for cultivation, active fields, and mature woodlands for reference purposes. Sites were further stratified by soil texture to test for associated effects. Tree carbon stocks accumulated at an average rate of 0.83 6 0.10 Mg C.ha-1-yr-1, with soil texture having no clear impact on accumulation rates. Bulk soil carbon stocks on both soil types appeared unaffected by both the initial land clearance and the subsequent regrowth, which resulted in no significant changes over time. Tree species diversity in regrowing plots developed rapidly and within;10 years was equivalent to that of mature woodland. Many of the species found in mature woodlands reappeared relatively quickly after abandonment, although species composition is expected to take considerably longer to recover, with at least 60-80 years required for the compositional similarity between regrowing and mature woodlands to reach levels similar to that among nearby mature woodlands. Through impacts on b-diversity, disturbance was also found to increase the total number of tree species present in the landscape, with many of the recorded species only found in regrowing woodlands. Our results are of relevance to carbon sequestration projects by helping to inform the potential future carbon and biodiversity benefits of restoring disturbed habitats (REDD ). At a time where the use of shifting cultivation is threatened by shifts to larger-scale, commercial agriculture, we show that secondary woodland habitats can retain considerable biodiversity value, and act as carbon sinks. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Conventional Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) are static models not considering any mechanism of revenue maximization and price equilibrium under external constraints. The underlying assumption is that demand of a given commodity, irrespective of the amount, can always be supplied by the average supplier (fully elastic market). This constitutes a recognized limitation for the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to the evaluation of complex systems, like agro-systems. In the Consequential LCI, the relationships between the activities and processes of a life-cycle are no longer seen as essentially technical connections, based on average data; instead the relevant socio-economic mechanisms are considered via market information and economic models (partial or computable general equilibrium). The paper presents two partial equilibrium (PE) models of the agricultural sector of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, to calculate the LCI and the Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) effects related to the introduction of a given demand for biomass (in particular maize) for biogas generation. The model is market-based and has farmers' revenue maximization as the driver, represents the first step of a Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) for biogas production in Luxembourg. © 2015 ISEIS All rights reserved.

AB  - The economic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels requires in addition to pretreatment techniques access to large quantities of inexpensive cellulases to be competitive with established first generation processes. A solution to this problem could be achieved by plant based expression of these enzymes. We expressed the complete set of six cellulases and an additional p-glucosidase expressed from Thermobifida fusca in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum). This was done to determine whether functional enzyme expression was feasible in these organisms. In extracts of recombinant E. coli cells, five of the proteins were detected by western blot analysis, but exocellulases E3 and E6 were undetectable. In the plant-based expression system we were able to detect all six cellulases but not the p-glucosidase even though activity was detectable. When E. coli was used as the expression system, endocellulase E2 was active, while endocellulases E1 and E5 showed only residual activity. The remaining cellulases appeared completely inactive against the model substrates azo-carboxymethyl-cellulose (Azo-CMC) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-cellobioside (4-MUC). Only the p-glucosidase showed high activity against 4-MUC. In contrast, all the plant-derived enzymes were active against the respective model substrates. Our data indicate that some enzymes of bacterial origin are more active and more efficiently expressed in plants than in a bacterial host. © 2015 Klinger, Fischer and Commandeur.

AB  - The article addresses the issue of biofuel production and the cultivation of energy crops from the perspective of environmental protection. Widely discussed in the context of the development of the biofuel industry are its environmental aspects, including carbon footprints and its impacts on natural ecosystems and biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Regarded as the most important environmental tools in the search for the necessary compromise between environmental protection and production of biofuels in the agricultural landscape are methods for certifying biofuels and prudent planning of the use of agricultural land, including the development of methods for the objective evaluation of the potential impacts of cultivating crops for the production of biofuels on ecosystems. © 2015, Listy Cukrovarnicke a Reparske.

AB  - Net carbon sinks capable of avoiding dangerous perturbation of the climate system and preventing ocean acidification have been identified, but they are likely to be limited by resource constraints (Nature 463:747-756, 2010). Land scarcity already creates tension between food security and bioenergy production, and this competition is likely to intensify as populations and the effects of climate change expand. Despite research into microalgae as a next-generation energy source, the land-sparing consequences of alternative sources of livestock feed have been overlooked. Here we use the FeliX model to quantify emissions pathways when microalgae is used as a feedstock to free up to 2 billion hectares of land currently used for pasture and feed crops. Forest plantations established on these areas can conceivably meet 50 % of global primary energy demand, resulting in emissions mitigation from the energy and LULUC sectors of up to 544 ± 107 PgC by 2100. Further emissions reductions from carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology can reduce global atmospheric carbon concentrations close to preindustrial levels by the end of the present century. Though previously thought unattainable, carbon sinks and climate change mitigation of this magnitude are well within the bounds of technological feasibility. © 2015 Walsh et al.

AB  - The United States has mandated the production of 80 billion liters of second-generation biofuel by 2022, and several approaches to meet this target focus on using ligno-cellulosic ethanol from perennial grasses and non-food crops. The large-scale deployment of biofuel agronomy should consider high-yielding crops that meet ethanol production goals, choose appropriate landscapes for biofuel crops from a climate and food production standpoint, and a full consideration of the environmental impact of large-scale land use change. The southeastern United States has a long growing season conducive for producing high-yielding crops, and is relatively less important to US food production than the rain-fed Midwestern states that have been extensively studied for biofuel crops. We use the DayCent biogeochemical model to run simulation experiments to test the hypotheses that converting a large swath of traditional agriculture in the southeastern United States that is already utilized for bioenergy production (assuming 35% of current corn-soy, and 10% of grazed pasture hectares; ;950,000 ha) to energy cane will result in greater biomass production, increased soil C storage, decreased soil N losses and lower greenhouse gas emissions than a landscape of corn-soy rotations and interspersed grazed pasture. Our simulations suggest that energy cane above-ground productivity on former pasture and corn-soy fields would be between 52-59 million Mg dry mass per year, resulting in 21.1-23.7 billion liters of ligno-cellulosic ethanol, or ∼28% of the 2022 US government mandate. DayCent did not predict significant changes in soil C flux from land conversion to energy cane, but simulations predicted lower rates of N loss compared to current agriculture. GHG emissions from energy cane landscapes were substantially higher on former pasture, but an order of magnitude lower when compared to corn-soy hectares. While further study is needed to ascertain the full economic and industrial feasibility of converting nearly 1,000,000 ha of land to energy cane production, our results suggest that such an undertaking could meet a sizeable fraction of the US ethanol mandate, reduce N pollution and GHG emissions, and avoid compromising land devoted to food production in the southeastern United States. © 2015 Duval et al.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the stabilization/solidification (S/S) of trace element-contaminated soil using air pollution control residues (APCRs) prior to disposal in landfill sites. Two soil samples (with low and moderate concentrations of organic matter) were stabilized using three APCRs that originated from the incineration of municipal solid waste, bio-fuels and a mixture of coal and crushed olive kernels. Two APCR/soil mixtures were tested: 30 % APCR/70 % soil and 50 % APCR/50 % soil. A batch leaching test was used to study immobilization of As and co-occurring metals Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. Solidification was evaluated by measuring the unconfined compression strength (UCS). Leaching of As was reduced by 39–93 % in APCR/soil mixtures and decreased with increased amounts of added APCR. Immobilization of As positively correlated with the amount of Ca in the APCR and negatively with the amount of soil organic matter. According to geochemical modelling, the precipitation of calcium arsenate (Ca3(AsO4)2/4H2O) and incorporation of As in ettringite (Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12 · 26H2O) in soil/APCR mixtures might explain the reduced leaching of As. A negative effect of the treatment was an increased leaching of Cu, Cr and dissolved organic carbon. Solidification of APCR/soil was considerably weakened by soil organic matter. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Bioethanol production output has increased steadily over the last two decades and is now beginning to become competitive with traditional liquid transportation fuels due to advances in engineering, the identification of new production host organisms, and the development of novel biodesign strategies. A significant portion of these efforts has been dedicated to mitigating the toxicological challenges encountered across the bioethanol production process. From the release of potentially cytotoxic or inhibitory compounds from input feedstocks, through the metabolic co-synthesis of ethanol and potentially detrimental byproducts, and to the potential cytotoxicity of ethanol itself, each stage of bioethanol production requires the application of genetic or engineering controls that ensure the host organisms remain healthy and productive to meet the necessary economies required for large scale production. In addition, as production levels continue to increase, there is an escalating focus on the detoxification of the resulting waste streams to minimize their environmental impact. This review will present the major toxicological challenges encountered throughout each stage of the bioethanol production process and the commonly employed strategies for reducing or eliminating potential toxic effects. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Four reactors were initiated to study the effect of inoculum and sulfide type on the simultaneous hydrogen sulfide removal from biogas and nitrogen removal from swine slurry (Ssu-Nir) process. Anaerobic sludge, aerobic sludge, and water were used as inocula, and Na2S and biogas were used as a sulfide substrate, respectively. Additionally, 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to explore the bacterial diversity. The results showed that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus, 42.2–84.4 %) were dominant in Ssu-Nir process and led to the excellent performance. Aerobic sludge was more suitable for inoculation of the Ssu-Nir process because it is better for rapidly enriching dominant sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus, 54.4 %), denitrifying sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (40.0 %) and denitrifiers (23.9 %). Lower S2− removal efficiency (72.6 %) and NO3 − removal efficiency (&lt;90 %) of the Ssu-Nir process were obtained using biogas as a sulfide substrate than when Na2S was used. For the Ssu-Nir process with biogas as the sulfide substrate, limiting H2S absorption caused a high relative abundance of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, Thiobacillus (84.8 %) and Thiobacillus sayanicus (39.6 %), which in turn led to low relative abundance of denitrifiers (1.6 %) and denitrifying sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (24.4 %), low NO3 − removal efficiency, and eventually poor performance. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In a context of volatility in the oil price and with the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, the sustainable growth of the aviation is conditioned by the environment, economy and technical efficiency. In order to overcome these issues, new alternative fuels and biofuels could be an alternative to established technologies. In this study, a dynamical competition model for aviation fuel substitution has been developed. Investment and market factors are modeled by the Lotka–Volterra dynamical system for the substitution of fossil by alternative fuels. The model calculates the dynamics of Jet A-1, gas-to-liquid (GtL)/coal-to-liquid (CtL) and biomass-to-liquid (BtL) market shares up to the year 2030. In particular, the model looks at the use of carbon capture sequestration for GtL/CtL and the indirect land use change for BtL. Three main scenarios (high/low environmental incentives and business as usual) based on input data provided by the partners of the FP7 Alfa-Bird Project (2012) consortium were developed in 2012, and according to these scenarios, alternative fuels appeared to be competitive in the near term. Current collapse in oil prices, however, removes one of the key drivers that supported alternative fuel development in recent years: energy scarcity and security concerns, and as a consequence, it delays in this way the competitiveness of alternative fuels with respect to Jet A-1. This has been quantified in the present paper, and the respective conclusions were drawn. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Energy is a critical input for socio-economic development, and its strategy aims at efficiency and security. To provide access to environmentally friendly energy resources, the national biofuel policy targets cellulosic feedstocks which necessitates analysing feedstocks using holistic approaches. This paper studies the life cycle impact of ethanol production from cellulosic agricultural feedstocks. Methods: The difficulty of finding appropriate life cycle inventory data for the analysed biofuels in the Indian context is overcome by combining data from diverse sources such as journal articles, government reports and personal contact with farmers. Variation in these numbers across studies is captured by means of error bars. These data are used to calculate environmental sustainability metrics such as energy return on investment, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle water use for each fuel. Biomass sources considered in this work include cellulose from wheat stalk, rice husk, sorghum stalk, sugarcane bagasse and cotton stalk. These results are compared with ethanol from molasses and sugarcane juice, which are the conventional approaches. Results and discussion: Results of the analysis indicate that sorghum stalk is most attractive due to its high energy return on investment, low greenhouse gas emissions, and low water and land use. Ethanol from rice husk has relatively high water use and greenhouse gas emissions, but these are within the margin of variability of other fuels. Despite the attractiveness of sorghum stalk from the current analysis, it is not likely that this will become a major feedstock for cellulosic ethanol in India. This is because farmers value sorghum as an animal feed and may not be willing to convert it into ethanol. Conclusions: This is the first life cycle study of Indian cellulosic biofuel pathways. The inventory data collected in this work is a novel contribution that should be useful for other studies. Findings from the analysis can help guide the decision-making process in the biofuel sector for India. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Pond-grown microalgae have been considered as feedstocks for production of biodiesel. Various natural habitats and man-made environments can be exploited to cultivate microalgae without utilizing arable land which is already decreasing due to urbanization and industrial development. Suitable temperature, solar illumination and availability of phosphorus and nitrogen-rich organic wastes result in algal blooms in stagnant water and river bank’s associated pools in many regions including Pakistan. However, for practical application different land areas and effluents of varying natural and man-influenced environments are to be screened for promoting growth and fat-rich body composition of microalgal biomass. Lessons from well-established science of continuous culturing of bacteria can be applied for the open systems with provisions of semi-controlled physico-chemical conditions. In situ microalgal cultivation ponds may be declared mandatory for suitable industries and they can also be cultivated along the banks of rivers. Such efforts will lead to the production of biodiesel, environmental management of effluents and usage of the oil extracted/defatted algal biomass as animal feed supplement. The triad of biofuel production, bioremediation of suitable effluents and provision of animal feed/its supplement would obviously achieve economical feasibility. Different prospects of microalgal cultivation in different localities of Pakistan are discussed with reference to profitable investments. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Uncertainty in predictions of long-term yields of perennial grasses makes business plans untenable in the short run. Long-term data across varied environments, including marginal lands, will help in preventing uncertainty while providing farmers and entrepreneurs with sound information to estimate reliable and affordable strategies on what, where, and how long to grow perennial grasses. In the present study, the long-term yields (11 to 22 years) of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deuter), and giant reed (Arundo donax L.) grown in northern and southern Mediterranean environments are reported. Switchgrass was grown in Greece and northern Italy, giant reed in southern and northern Italy, and miscanthus in southern Italy. Furthermore, lowland and upland switchgrass ecotypes were compared in Greece. Despite similar biomass productions (9.8 and 10.0 Mg DM ha−1 for uplands and lowlands, respectively), the upland ecotypes showed a significantly higher yield stability (CV of 24 and 32 % for uplands and lowlands, respectively) over a 17-year period. Biomass yield varied considerably across years and locations; giant reed outperformed switchgrass under northern Italy environment (21.2 and 13.6 Mg DM ha−1 for giant reed and switchgrass, respectively). Annual yield of switchgrass was 30 % higher in the north than south Mediterranean; miscanthus showed intermediate production compared to giant reed and switchgrass (average of 22 years) and a CV similar to switchgrass. In summary, these results evidence that multi-location, long-term trials are strongly needed to reduce uncertainties on crop yield variability and provide more accurate data from which optimized socio-economic and environmental predictions can be achieved. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs) such as Populus have great potential as biofuel feedstocks. Biomass yields and yield stability at potential sites are important considerations when SRWCs are widely planted. The process-based, daily time-step simulation model Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) offers promise as a useful tool to evaluate tree growth over large ranges of conditions. The objective of this study was to develop algorithms and growth parameters of hybrid poplar ‘Tristis #1’ (Populus balsamifera L. × Populus tristis Fisch) and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) in ALMANAC and to improve simulation of leaf area index (LAI) and plant biomass as well as biomass partitioning. ALMANAC with the improved algorithms for LAI and weight of falling leaves was applied to hybrid poplar plots in Wisconsin and cottonwood plots in Mississippi, and the modeled biomass yield and LAI were compared with measured data to modify and evaluate the location-specific ALMANAC models. Improved algorithms for LAI and biomass simulation and suggested values and potential parameter ranges for hybrid poplar and cottonwood were reasonable (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) 0.81 ~ 0.99 and R2 0.76 ~ 0.99). ALMANAC with modified algorithms and parameters for Populus growth realistically simulated LAI, aboveground woody biomass, and root biomass of Populus. Thus, this model can be used for biofeedstock production modeling for Populus. The improved algorithms of LAI and biomass simulation for tree growth should also be useful for other process-based models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC), and Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Development of viable bioenergy economies will require large increases in biomass feedstock production. Improved methods are needed to quantify production potential based on land availability, land suitability, biomass yield, and cost. We developed such a method and applied it throughout New York State. While maintaining existing forest and agricultural production, we quantified additional sustainable biomass production potential using geospatial and yield modeling that integrates remotely sensed and survey data for land cover, soil type, climate patterns, and crop yields and then applied multiple sustainability constraints. Nearly 680,000 ha with varying quality was found to be available and suitable for new biomass production. Predicted yields ranged from 7.8 to 18.3 Mg/ha for short-rotation willow and 6.9–16.3 Mg/ha for perennial grasses for a total production potential of 8.2 Tg/year. Increased forest harvest could produce an additional 4.3 Tg/year of hardwood and 1.6 Tg/year of softwood. In total, an additional 14.2 Tg/year of biomass for bioenergy could be produced while maintaining existing agricultural and forest production. This new biomass, before processing, would contain energy equivalent to 7.4 % of 2012 New York energy use (3.4 % if converted to ethanol). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Efficient conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol will benefit from a consistent composition of supplied biomass. While composition or quality for a given feedstock is known to vary, the influence of environment, rather than genotype, has rarely been separated for mature field-grown material. Replicated trials of a single sterile hybrid clone of Miscanthus × giganteus across Illinois provided a unique opportunity to test the influence of environmental, rather than genetic control over biomass composition, under US Midwest conditions. Given the interest in M. x giganteus cv. “Illinois” as a lignocellulosic feedstock, it is valuable to understand the variation in composition of this crop that would need to be dealt with by processors. This study examined the effect of seven sites spanning nearly 5° in latitude and contrasting soil types from sands to clays with land capability classes ranging from 1 to 4. Four levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 67, 135, and 202 kg N ha−1) were applied on these mature, genetically identical, clonally propagated stands of M. × giganteus which were harvested both pre- and post-senescence. Despite the wide range of environmental differences, there was minimal variation in the composition across all locations, sampling times, and fertilization treatments. Composition varied from 39–45 % for cellulose, 19–24 % for hemicellulose, to 19–24 % for lignin. Nitrogen fertilization, while having a small effect, decreased the proportion of hemicellulose, acetyl groups, and ash and increased cellulose and lignin at statistically significant levels. Delaying harvest from October to December increased the proportion of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and decreased the proportion of ash and extractables at statistically significant levels. The findings show that in the absence of genetic variation, composition varies minimally with environment or timing of harvest, which has important implications for costs of processing in a given location. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Geographic Information System (GIS) tools have been used to strategically locate bioenergy facilities and optimize the relationship between biomass supply and demand, aiming to minimize overall fuel production costs. Microalgae, also termed third generation bioenergy feedstocks, are discussed for their potential to meet future energy demands. This study reviews literature on GIS applications to locate algae cultivation sites and estimate algae biofuel potential. To highlight the diversity of results, a quantitative comparison for the US studies is presented. We found two major assumptions that primarily limited the algae biofuel production potential estimates: (1) the production technology (open pond or photobioreactor), and (2) the number and type of resources considered, such as land type, CO2, water source, water quality, etc. All studies used binary (a location is either unsuitable or suitable) suitability models to determine areas for algae production. Most studies considered water, land, and CO2 resources, while some also accounted for infrastructure, soil properties, and work force requirements. We found that potential cultivation area in the USA is most sensitive to the constraints of CO2 availability and land cost. This review explains the wide range of algal biofuel potential estimates (from 0.09 to over 600 billion L yr−1) by identifying underlying assumptions, methodologies, and data. The highly variable outputs indicate the need for a comprehensive analysis of different criteria individually and in combination to estimate realistic biofuel potential. The results suggest that with models becoming increasingly detailed in considering resources and conversion/production technologies, further decrease in estimated theoretical production potential is expected under available technology. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Genetic and genomic resources have recently been developed for the bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Despite these advances, little research has been focused on identifying genetic loci involved in natural variation of important bioenergy traits, including biomass. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is typically used to discover loci that contribute to trait variation. Once identified, QTLs can be used to improve agronomically important traits through marker-assisted selection. In this study, we conducted QTL mapping in Austin, TX, USA, with a full-sib mapping population derived from a cross between tetraploid clones of two major switchgrass cultivars (Alamo-A4 and Kanlow-K5). We observed significant among-genotype variation for the vast majority of growth, morphological, and phenological traits measured on the mapping population. Overall, we discovered 27 significant QTLs across 23 traits. QTLs for biomass production colocalized on linkage group 9b across years, as well as with a major biomass QTL discovered in another recent switchgrass QTL study. The experiment was conducted under a rainout shelter, which allowed us to examine the effects of differential irrigation on trait values. We found very minimal effects of the reduced watering treatment on traits, with no significant effect on biomass production. Overall, the results of our study set the stage for future crop improvement through marker-assisted selection breeding. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Biofuels have been the subject of heated political discussions, but also of a growing literature on discourses and environmental policies. Previous studies on the issue have, however, neglected the fact that the different discourses about on biofuels are increasingly crossing national boundaries, i.e., that there is a tendency toward transnationalization. In the light of this development the present article analyzes the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse in the period 2005-2011 with a special emphasis on actors from Brazil, the EU and the USA. By conducting a discourse analysis along the lines of Hajer, five discourse coalitions can be distinguished, each providing a different view on the opportunities, problems and perspectives of biofuel production in Brazil. It is observed that the long-established hegemony of the discourse coalition of biofuel supporters was successfully challenged by a more critical position during the food crisis of 2007/2008. As a result, the discourse coalition of critical supporters-which was committed to sustainable biofuel production via political regulation-prevailed in the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse and its position was translated into policy measures. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - The landfill of Modena, in northern Italy, is now crossed by the new high velocity railway line connecting Milan and Bologna. Waste was completely removed from a part of the landfill and a trench for the train line was built. With the aim of facilitating excavation and further disposal of the material extracted, suitable measures were defined. In order to prevent undesired emissions into the excavation area, the aerobic in situ stabilisation by means of the Airflow technology took place before and during the Landfill Mining. Specific project features involved the pneumatic leachate extraction from the aeration wells (to keep the leachate table low inside the landfill and increase the volume of waste available for air migration) and the controlled moisture addition into a limited zone, for a preliminary evaluation of the effects on process enhancement. Waste and leachate were periodically sampled in the landfill during the aeration before the excavation, for quality assessment over time; the evolution of biogas composition in the landfill body and in the extraction system for different plant set-ups during the project was monitored, with specific focus on uncontrolled migration into the excavation area. Waste biological stability significantly increased during the aeration (waste respiration index dropped to 33% of the initial value after six months). Leachate head decreased from 4 to 1.5. m; leachate recirculation tests proved the beneficial effects of moisture addition on temperature control, without hampering waste aerobization. Proper management of the aeration plant enabled the minimization of uncontrolled biogas emissions into the excavation area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The need for a unified appraisal framework for biomass and bioenergy has been extensively discussed in literature. It is emphasized that a working unified appraisal framework can essentially improve bioenergy policymaking by offering a structured and transparent approach to tackle the bioenergy trilemma and to work out whether or not a certain biomass conversion technology or system should be implemented (always in direct comparison to others). Further, such an approach could be used to better examine the interdependencies of the single elements of the triple bottom line of sustainability (economy, environment, society). This also would lead to the improvement of existing and future policies and would give bioenergy a better foundation within the ethical debate by transparently showing the trade-offs between economy, environment and society. This paper drafts a unified appraisal framework for biomass conversion systems that integrates different approaches on the data, impact and decision making level. On the bottom line the proposed architecture in total addresses all relevant requirements from literature and fits well into the valuable work that has been done previously. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, resulting ecosystem services associated with dedicated bioenergy crop production, such as soil respiration and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of land use [i.e., switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) grown as dedicated bioenergy crops and a soybean (Glycine max)-grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) agroecosystem rotation] on monthly respiration and estimated annual CO2 emissions for 2012 and 2013 from a silt -loam soil in east-central Arkansas. Peak monthly fluxes achieved each year differed (p &lt; 0.05) somewhat among ecosystems. Annual CO2 emissions differed among ecosystems (p &lt; 0.001), but not between years (p = 0.45). Cottonwood emitted less CO2 in both years (7.3 and 7.4 Mg ha-1 for 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to the other two ecosystems, while emissions from the switchgrass did not differ from those from the soybean in 2012 (10.3 and 9.5 Mg ha-1, respectively) or grain sorghum in 2013 (9.7 and 9.2 Mg ha-1, respectively). Results showed established bioenergy feedstock cropping systems do not have greater soil CO2 emissions compared with a traditional soybean-grain sorghum crop rotation. Results also indicated that different bioenergy feedstocks can produce different quantities of CO2 emissions, which may be important to consider when converting marginal lands to bioenergy feedstock cropping systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study reports on the biotransformation of the brewer’s spent grain (BSG) in co-digestion with Jerusalem artichoke (JA, Helianthus tuberosus L.) phytomass by thermophilic (+55 °C) and mesophilic (+30 °C) anaerobic methanogenic communities. BSG is a by-product of the beer-brewing process generated in large amounts, in which utilization provokes a negative effect on the environment. In this study, we will show an effective conversion of BSG into biogas by selected microbial communities, obtained from different sources (animal manure and previously isolated microbial consortia). The stimulation of methanogenesis was reached by the co-digestion of JA’s phytomass (stem and leaves). The optimized conditions for microbial stable cultivation included the use of nutrient medium, containing yeast extract and trace element solution. The optimal BSG concentration in biogas production was 50 and 100 g L−1. Under thermophilic conditions, the maximum total methane production reached 64 %, and it comprised around 6–8 and 9–11 of L CH4 per 100 g of fermented BSG without and with co-digested JA, respectively, when the fresh inoculum was added. Although, after a year of re-cultivation, the values reduced to around 6–7, and 6–10 L CH4/100 g BSG, correspondingly, the selected microbial communities showed effective biotransformation of BSG. The supplementation of soil with the residual fermented BSG (10 %, w/w) resulted in the promotion of lettuce (Lepidium sativum L.) growth. The results obtained demonstrate a potential for complete BSG utilization via biogas production and application as a soil additive. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Microalgae are considered to be efficient bio-resources for biofuels and bio-based chemicals because they generally have high productivity. The filamentous cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis has been widely used for food, feed, and nutrient supplements and is usually cultivated in open ponds. In order to extend the surface area for growing this alga, we designed a pilot-scale floating closed culture system for cultivating A. platensis on open water and compared the growth and quality of the alga harvested at both subtropical and temperate regions. The biomass productivity of A. platensis NIES-39 was ca. 9 g dry biomass m−2 day−1 in summer at Awaji Island (warm temperature region) and ca. 10 and 6 g dry biomass m−2 day−1 in autumn and winter, respectively, at Ishigaki Island, (subtropical region) in Japan. If seawater can be used for culture media, culture cost can be reduced; therefore, we examined the influence of seawater salt concentrations on the growth of A. platensis NIES-39. Growth rates of A. platensis NIES-39 in diluted seawater with enrichment of 2.5 g L−1 NaNO3, 0.01 g L−1 FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.08 g L−1 Na2EDTA were considerably lower than SOT medium, but the biomass productivity (dry weight) was comparable to SOT medium. This is explained by the heavier cell weight of the alga grown in modified seawater media compared to the alga grown in SOT medium. Furthermore, A. platensis grown in modified seawater-based medium exhibited self-flocculation and had more loosely coiled trichomes. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Context: Expansion of bioenergy production is part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Dedicated biomass crops will compete with other land uses as most high quality arable land is already used for agriculture, urban development, and biodiversity conservation. Objective: First, we explore the trade-offs between converting land enrolled in the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to switchgrass for biofuel production or preserving it for biodiversity. Next, we examine the trade-offs between agriculture, biodiversity, and biofuel across the central and eastern U.S. Methods: We compiled measures of biodiversity, agriculture, and biofuel from land cover classifications, species range maps, and mechanistic model output of switchgrass yield. We used a spatially-explicit optimization algorithm to analyze the impacts of small-to-large scale biomass production by identifying locations that maximize biofuel produced from switchgrass and minimize negative impacts on biodiversity and agriculture. Results: Using CRP land for switchgrass production increases the land area required to meet biomass goals and the species range area altered for birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles. When conversion is not limited to CRP, conversion scenarios including biodiversity and agriculture trade-offs require greater than 100 % more area for switchgrass to reach the same production goals. When land conversion scenarios do not include biodiversity, twice the range area for reptiles and amphibians could be altered. Conclusions: Land-use trade-offs between biofuel production, agriculture, and biodiversity exist and alter optimum location of land conversion for low-to-high biofuel levels. This highlights the need for systematic land-use planning for the future. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - Lignocellulose crops serve as an excellent feedstock for biofuels because of their reduced costs and net carbon emission, and higher energy efficiency. To estimate more suitable lignocellulosic crops, we compared the contents of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in miscanthus, switchgrass, sorghum, and reed (from 14 accessions according to the collection site) in the leaves and stems and expressed these as % content based on dry weight. This study shows that miscanthus, switchgrass, and sorghum are valuable lignocellulosic crops owing to the significantly lower lignin content than that in reed, among both whole crops as well as specific plant parts. Although switchgrass has been reported to possess the highest polysaccharide content among the crops examined; our results showed no difference at a 5% significance level. Our study also showed that Miscanthus sacchariflorus possesses lower lignin and higher polysaccharide content in its leaves and stalks compared to the other Miscanthus species. Furthermore, M. sacchariflorus also showed lower lignin and higher polysaccharide contents than those in switchgrass. It is possible that M. sacchariflorus is a better resource than switchgrass, although these content assays showed no differences at the 5% significance level. M. sacchariflorus plants collected in Hacheonri, Jejudo, Korea (MFJH), contained 14.12% lignin and 64.23% holocellulose, indicating that Korean miscanthus is a competitive bioenergy crop compared to foreign crops such as switchgrass, which is widely used in the United States. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the intensive and exhaustive land use in China, the so-called marginal land is expected to play a major role in supporting the biofuel industry of the country. We developed a regional-level framework of using geospatial information technologies to achieve an optimal utilization of the marginal land for biofuel production. The framework includes identifying marginal lands, evaluating optimality of the land for growing certain bioenergy crops, estimating local potential feedstock production, and finally selecting optimal sites for biofuel factories. We present a case study of farming Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) and Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Guangdong, China. The marginal land was identified from satellite imageries at a 30-m resolution. The optimality for growing the two species was evaluated using the Ecological Niche Models (ENMs), which incorporates local temperature, precipitation, soil, and terrain. The optimality value was then converted into potential feedstock production using a conversion model. The site selection for the factories incorporated the local potential feedstock production, the transportation cost measured by road distance, and the farming cost related to the land patch geometry. Each candidate site received an overall optimality score derived based on those factors. We identified five sites that have high scores and also minimal or none spatial overlaps of their supporting areas. Three of them (Zhanjiang, Yunfu, and Jieyang) are for Cassava, located on in southern Guangdong. Two (Qingyuan and Meizhou) are for Jatropha in northern Guangdong. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We analysed the influence of the mode of participation in biomass production for biofuels on food security of different farm types. We studied two modes of participation in biomass production: an outgrower scheme for sunflower and a jatropha plantation offering full time employment and assessed the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability and utilization in smallholder farms in Central Mozambique. We interviewed 80 households who were participating in the sunflower outgrower scheme, had a household member working on the jatropha plantation or were not participating with biofuel production. For each household we quantified four indicators: maize sales minus purchases, gross revenue, revenue diversity, and household dietary diversity scores. Involvement of smallholder farmers with biomass production for fuel had a positive or no impact on the four dimensions of food security at the farm level. Positive food security impacts from working on the biofuel plantation were improvements in availability for the larger farms and improvements in access for the smaller farms. Utilization of food was generally not impacted. Impacts on food security from the sunflower outgrower scheme were minor. There is scope to improve the outgrower scheme with services and inputs that increase sunflower yields and give positive spill-overs to other crops. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) intercropped with Loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda L.) has been proposed as a potential biomass feedstock for biofuel production in the southeastern United States. This study investigated effects of treatments (intercropping vs. grass only) on biomass increment processes and morphological properties of switchgrass at two experimental plots (Lenoir1) located in the coastal plain of North Carolina. We also evaluated effects of trimming lower tree branches of pine trees on switchgrass growth at another watershed-scale site (Carteret7) in the same region. Results showed that biomass yield of intercropped switchgrass was reduced by adjacent trees and negatively affected by relative position of grass to trees at the 6th year after planting at Lenoir1. Relative grass-to-tree position was also found to be a significant (p < 0.001) factor affecting grass growth at Carteret7 site with tree age of 5 years old, which is irrespective to the trimming practice. Trimming lower tree branches did not significantly (p = 0.57) improve biomass yield of switchgrass at Carteret7. We also observed intercropped switchgrass typically had higher specific leaf area and grew taller compared to grass-only plots. Stem-to-leaf ratios of switchgrass were significantly (p = 0.02) affected by trees at Lenoir1, but not by trimming lower branches in Carteret7 and relative position of grass to trees at both study sites. Findings from this study are important for evaluating the viability of producing biofuel feedstocks using this proposed intercropping system in the southeastern United States. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Faced with a changing climate, bioenergy has been promoted as a sustainable resource. However, while it is a renewable energy source, biofuel cultivation comes with several environmental problems such as land use change and water consumption, the environmental impacts of which often counterbalance the reduced global warming potential compared to fossil alternatives. Methods: This paper presents life cycle assessment (LCA) results for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon footprints) and water consumption (water scarcity footprint) for different first-generation biofuels in comparison with their fossil alternatives. We employed standard (secondary) LCA data including uncertainties of process activities, resource consumption, and emissions throughout the value chain in order to compare different options under the influence of uncertainties and in order to identify the contribution to variance (CTV) of input data, giving insight into which environmental flows need to be better assessed. Furthermore, by also introducing uncertainties in the impact assessment for GHG emissions and water consumption, we were able to determine which LCA stage is more influenced by uncertainties, the accounting or impact assessment stage. Additionally, we analyzed the effect of choosing different time horizons GHGs (typically set to 100 years). Results: The analyzed fuels perform differently depending on the choice of impact category considered. For liquid fuels, we observed a tradeoff between resource depletion and water footprint, while biogas options have lower impacts in most categories. Biogas from waste has significantly lower carbon footprints than natural gas for long time horizons and a similar water footprint. However, with the 20-year Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) factors, methane emissions from biogas largely compensate the fossil CO2 emissions in our case and no robust difference is observed under uncertainty considerations. Both impact assessment and inventory uncertainties are important. Due to the very high number of parameters, the CTV analysis was not robust for assessing GHG emissions. Conclusions: This study shows that uncertainty is important in LCA and carbon or water footprint assessment of agricultural feedstock production. Integration of parameter uncertainties helps to evaluate the significance of the difference from two product options. For biogas, the choice of the time horizon in carbon footprint assessment is decisive and needs a strong justification. © 2015, Pfister and Scherer.

AB  - Microalgae are a promising source of biofuels and bioproducts, as they consume CO2 to grow, multiply quickly, and can be cultivated in wastewater and on marginal land. Development of low-cost and high-efficiency microalgal cultivation systems is important to the cost-competitiveness of algae. A floating horizontal photobioreactor (HBR) was developed that is inexpensive and scalable, as it is manufactured from inexpensive plastic film and is modular. Its performance was successfully tested using the marine microalgae Nannochloris atomus Butcher CCAP 251/4A in a 65-L prototype unit. High biomass concentration of 4.0 g L-1 and productivity of 12.9 g m-2d-1 was achieved indoors under artificial illumination of 31.3 klux (435 μmol m-2s-1). Outdoors, during semi-continuous operation in Florida, the HBR achieved over the course of 165days a maximum biomass concentration of 4.3 g L-1 and an average biomass productivity of 18.2 g m-2d-1 without any contamination issues. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of land-use change in the dry tropics on soil CO2-C flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, along with the major factors controlling them i.e. soil microbial biomass (SMB), belowground net productivity (BNP), and soil aggregate size fractions. Land-use change, in this study, involved conversion of natural forest, to degraded forest and then to an agroecosystem or a bioenergy crop plantation of Jatropha curcas. The soil CO2-C flux was highest in the agroecosystem followed in decreasing order by degraded forest, bioenergy crop plantation and smallest in the natural forest. The inverse trend was found in case of SOC storage, SMB and BNP. The proportion of macroaggregate in the soil follows the trend of SOC storage, whereas mesoaggregate follows the trend of CO2-C flux across all land-use types. The CO2-C flux showed significant negative correlation with BNP, SMB, macroaggregate size fraction, and SOC. Our study suggests that the flux of soil CO2-C was regulated directly by the soil aggregate fraction and not by SMB or BNP. However, soil aggregate formation was, in turn, related to the SMB and/or below BNP. Macroaggregates appear to protect the SOC, which results in lower CO2-C flux and higher SOC storage. It can be concluded that the bioenergy crops plantation on degraded forest lands in the dry tropics, may increase C storage in soil and reduce soil CO2-C flux, thereby helping in the mitigation of global climate change in addition to providing feed stocks for fossil fuel substitution. © 2015 .

AB  - Perennial bioenergy crops provide biomass for renewable energy production, but also sequester atmospheric carbon (C) in the soil. Roots represent one of the most important soil C inputs-root length density (RLD, cm cm-3), root diameter and fine root biomass (FRB, Mg ha-1) in the top 1 m of soil were characterized for three woody (poplar, black locust, willow) and three herbaceous (giant reed, miscanthus, switchgrass) perennial crops in the same location. The vertical distribution of FRB and RLD was described by fitting the "beta" (β) model to the experimental data. The herbaceous species had higher β values for FRB and RLD than woody crops, suggesting that the former explore the deeper soil layers with a greater proportion of roots. In particular, 3.7 Mg ha-1, or 43% of the whole root mass, was found below the ploughing soil layer (0.3 m) for the herbaceous species, while only 1.2 Mg ha-1, or 26% of the whole root mass, was allocated by woody crops to the same soil layer. In all the species, the majority of the sampled roots (99.1%) had a diameter lower than 2 mm, and in the first 10 cm of the soil the woody species tended to produce roots with a smaller diameter than those of the herbaceous species. Overall, the herbaceous crops have a higher potential to contribute to C storage in the deep soil layers, while the woody species, have a greater potential to affect soil organic carbon in the top soil layer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban marginal land can be used for growing high yield bioenergy crops such as miscanthus and poplar. Here, a GIS-based modeling framework was created to assess potential urban marginal lands in Boston that include vacant lands and under-utilized public and private areas with adequate soil quality and sunlight. Using ArcGIS model builder as a spatial analysis tool, land parcels were screened for typical urban features such as buildings, driveways, parking lots, water and protected areas. The resultant layer was subjected to bio-geophysical modeling that includes soil quality, slope analysis and finally shadow analysis. Approximately 2660. ha of potential marginal land was identified as suitable, representing 24% of total land area in Boston. Using crop yield information, it was estimated that this marginal land could be used to produce up to a total of nearly 42,130. tons of high yield short rotation poplar biomass in a regular growing season. Also, bioenergy potential calculation revealed that for short rotation poplar, this amount of biomass can potentially yield up to 745 TJ (LHV) to 830 (HHV) TJ of yearly primary energy for the city of Boston that can be used for heat or electricity production, particularly for microgrid or district heating applications. This is equivalent to ~0.6% of Massachusetts primary energy demand for 2012. Ongoing work will explore other urban regions of Massachusetts and the Eastern US that might be able to fulfill part of their energy demand locally while providing benefits in environmental quality, economic development, and urban resilience. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A novel method for energy recycling from sewage sludge was developed through biophysical drying coupled with fast pyrolysis. Thermal decomposition properties of biophysical-dried sludge (BDS) and thermal-dried sludge (TDS) were characterized through thermogravimetric (TG) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. BDS exhibited typical peaks in each differential thermogravimetric (DTG) region and presented slower mass loss rates in H, C, and L regions (180-550) but remarkable weight loss in region I (550) compared with TDS. The charring process centered at region I, was responsible for the prominent H2 emission from BDS. The pseudo multicomponent model showed that the Em values of BDS and TDS were 48.84 and 37.75kJ/mol, respectively. Furthermore, fast pyrolysis of BDS was proven to facilitate syngas and char formation more than TDS. For the yielded syngas, the thermal conversion of BDS was characterized by high H2 and CH4 content beyond 700. © 2015.

AB  - Chlorella species from the UTEX collection, classified by rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis, were screened based on biomass and lipid production in different scales and modes of culture. The lead candidate strains of C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230 and C. vulgaris UTEX 395 and 259 were compared between conditions of vigorous aeration with filtered atmospheric air and 3% CO2 shake-flask cultivation. The biomass of UTEX 1230 produced 2 times higher at 652mgL-1 dry weight under both ambient CO2 vigorous aeration and 3% CO2 conditions, while UTEX 395 and 259 under 3% CO2 increased to 3 times higher at 863mgL-1 dry weight than ambient CO2 vigorous aeration. The triacylglycerol contents of UTEX 395 and 259 increased more than 30 times to 30% dry weight with 3% CO2, indicating that additional CO2 is essential for both biomass and lipid accumulation in UTEX 395 and 259. © 2015.

AB  - Expansion of ethanol production has led to regional-scale cultivation of cellulosic biofuel crops, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), on agriculturally marginal lands. A range of forest-based solutions are also being evaluated, especially in the southeastern U.S. However, there may be unanticipated environmental consequences, including changes in water export when managing forests to accommodate biofuel demands at a regional scale. We used the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate effects of regional-scale conversion of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations to switchgrass biofuel production on stream flow in the ~5 million ha Tombigbee River Watershed in the southeastern U.S. Greater than 50% of the Tombigbee Watershed is forested, with 20% of the watershed supporting primarily loblolly pine forests. We modified the SWAT model by adding five age classes of loblolly pine trees, to more accurately represent existing forested systems. We found that maximum conversion of loblolly pine to switchgrass, affecting 7% of the watershed, represented an extreme land-use change and resulted in a 4% increase in annual stream flow. The more operationally and economically feasible option of converting young (≤4 yrs) and old (≥16 yrs) loblolly pine stands to switchgrass on <8% slope (2% of the watershed) resulted in a 2% increase in stream flow. Changes in annual stream flow were driven primarily by alterations in evapotranspiration (ET). Seasonal changes in stream flow were attributed to complex interactions among water-balance components of ET, surface flow, and groundwater flow. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Municipal sewage sludge, paper mill sludge, and slaughterhouse sludge were pyrolyzed and liquefied for the production of bio-char. The migration and transformation behavior of Cu, Cr, and Zn during pyrolysis and liquefaction of these sludges were studied. Pyrolysis and liquefaction promoted mobile fraction (F1 and F2) to stable fraction (F3 and F4). The results showed that pyrolysis and liquefaction largely affected the redistribution of Cu and Zn in raw materials. The environmental risk assessment results indicated that the environmental risk levels of Cu and Zn were significantly reduced in bio-char, and risk level of Cr was slightly decreased after pyrolysis or liquefaction. Both pyrolysis and liquefaction were promising detoxification technologies for the three sludges in terms of the mitigation of heavy metals toxicity. It was suggested that dewatered sludge could be reduced toxicity/risk before utilization by pyrolysis or liquefaction technology, especially for Cu and Zn in slaughterhouse sludge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The addition of biochar (BC) has been suggested to increase the soil fertility and crop productivity of agricultural lands. This study evaluated the effect of different levels of BC on properties of sandy desert soils and its ultimate impact on plant growth. The samples of desert sand were taken from the Kubuqi of Inner Mongolia, China and the Thar Desert, Pakistan. The sands were treated with a BC made from the fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust at 400°C. Four BC application rates i.e. 0, 15, 22 and 45tha-1 were used in this study. Effects of BC addition on the water consumption and plant growth of sorghum were monitored for eight weeks in a pot experiment. The hydraulic and chemical properties of soil were analyzed to discern the effect of BC on the fertility of sandy desert soils. The results showed that BC amendment significantly improved soil hydraulic and chemical properties. The BC applied at the rate of 22tha-1 provided the best results as compared to all other treatments. Compared with the control group, the soil water-holding capacity (WHC) increased by 11% and 14%, water-retention capacity (WRC) increased by 28% and 32% and hydraulic conductivity decreased by 32% and 7% under the Kubuqi and the Thar Desert soils, respectively when BC was applied at 22tha-1. Similarly, total C increased by 11% and 7%, total K increased by 37% and 42%, total P increased by 70% and 68% and total Ca increased by 69% and 75% while soil pH significantly reduced by 0.67 and 0.79units, in the Kubuqi and the Thar Desert soils, respectively. The sorghum dry matter yield (DMY) was also significantly improved by 18% and 22% under the Kubuqi and the Thar Desert soils, respectively. The higher sorghum DMY consequently improved water-use efficiency (WUE) by 40% and 41% under the Kubuqi and the Thar Desert soils, respectively. In contrast, the plant growth and DMY declined at higher application rate (45tha-1) of BC. The BC made from fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust at a temperature of 400°C showed great potential in improving the quality of sandy desert soils. Hence, it can be used for sandy desert soil management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioconversion production of ethanol from cellulosic feedstock is generally proposed to use direct fermentation of sugars to ethanol. Another potential route for ethanol production is fermentation of sugars to acetic acid followed by hydrogenation to convert the acetic acid into ethanol. The advantage of the acetogen pathway is an increased ethanol yield; however, using an acetogen requires the additional hydrogenation, which could substantially affect the life cycle global warming potential of the process. Assuming a poplar feedstock, a cradle to grave Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of an acetogen based fermentation pathway. An LCA of a fermentation pathway that uses ethanologen fermentation is developed for comparison. It is found that the ethanologen and acetogen pathways have Global Warming Potentials (GWP) that are 92% and 46% lower than the GWP of gasoline, respectively. When the absolute GWP reduction compared to gasoline is calculated using a unit of land basis, the benefit of the higher ethanol yield using the acetogen is observed as the two pathways achieve similar GWP savings. The higher ethanol yield in the acetogen process plays a crucial role in choosing a lignocellulosic ethanol production method if land is a limited resource. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In producing cellulosic ethanol as a renewable biofuel from forest biomass, a tradeoff exists between the displacement of fossil fuel carbon (C) emissions by biofuels and the high rates of C storage in aggrading forest stands. To assess this tradeoff, the landscape area affected by feedstock harvest must be considered, which depends on numerous factors including forest productivity, the amount of forest in a fragmented landscape, and the willingness of forest landowners to sell timber as a bioenergy feedstock. We studied landscape scale net C balance by combining these considerations in a new, basic simulation model, CEBRAM, and applying it to a hypothetical landscape of short-rotation aspen forests in northern Michigan, USA. The model was parameterized for forest species, growth and ecosystem C storage, as well as landscape spatial patterns of forest cover in this region. To understand and parameterize forest owner decision making we surveyed 505 nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners in Michigan. Survey results indicated that 47% of these NIPF owners would willingly harvest forest biomass for bioenergy. Model results showed that at this rate the net C balance was 0.024 kg/m2 for a cellulosic ethanol system without considering land use over a 40 year time horizon. When C storage in aggrading, nonparticipating NIPF land was included, net C balance was 1.09 kg/m2 over 40 years. In this region, greater overall C gains can be realized through aspen forest aggradation than through the displacement of gasoline by cellulosic ethanol produced from forest biomass. © 2015.

AB  - Background: Environmental issues, e.g. climate change, fossil resource depletion have triggered ambitious national/regional policies to develop biofuel and bioenergy roles within the overall energy portfolio to achieve decarbonising the global economy and increase energy security. With the 10 % binding target for the transport sector, the Renewable Energy Directive confirms the EU's commitment to renewable transport fuels especially advanced biofuels. Imola is an elite poplar clone crossed from Populus deltoides Bartr. and Populus nigra L. by Research Units for Intensive Wood Production, Agriculture Research Council in Italy. This study examines its suitability for plantation cultivation under short or very short rotation coppice regimes as a potential lignocellulosic feedstock for the production of ethanol as a transport biofuel. A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was used to model the cradle-to-gate environmental profile of Imola-derived biofuel benchmarked against conventional fossil gasoline. Specific attention was given to analysing the agroecosystem fluxes of carbon and nitrogen occurring in the cultivation of the Imola biomass in the biofuel life cycle using a process-oriented biogeochemistry model (DeNitrification-DeComposition) specifically modified for application to 2G perennial bioenergy crops and carbon and nitrogen cycling. Results: Our results demonstrate that carbon and nitrogen cycling in perennial crop-soil ecosystems such as this example can be expected to have significant effects on the overall environmental profiles of 2G biofuels. In particular, soil carbon accumulation in perennial biomass plantations is likely to be a significant component in the overall greenhouse gas balance of future biofuel and other biorefinery products and warrants ongoing research and data collection for LCA models. We conclude that bioethanol produced from Imola represents a promising alternative transport fuel offering some savings ranging from 35 to 100 % over petrol in global warming potential, ozone depletion and photochemical oxidation impact categories. Conclusions: Via comparative analyses for Imola-derived bioethanol across potential supply chains, we highlight priority issues for potential improvement in 2G biofuel profiling. Advanced clones of poplar such as Imola for 2G biofuel production in Italy as modelled here show potential to deliver an environmentally sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery industry and accelerate advanced biofuel penetration in the transport sector. © 2015 Guo et al.

AB  - Biofuels are seen as an effective means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of energy production. However, the cultivation phase of agribiomass-based biofuel production in particular can cause significant GHG emissions and additional environmental problems, such as water pollution and biodiversity loss. In this study, the aim was to develop a comprehensive environmental sustainability framework for agribiomass chains. The chosen environmental impact categories (climate change, eutrophication, soil erosion, soil organic matter decline, ecotoxicity, biodiversity, use of non-renewable resources, water use, and production efficiency) were selected based on literature and the views of energy companies and interest groups. The framework was tested with two Finnish agribiomass chains: barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) straw (for combustion) and turnip rape (Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera DC.) (for biodiesel). Relevant improvement options were identified and their impact reduction potential was assessed. The GHG emissions of both selected bioenergy sources were less than those of their fossil fuel references. Critical challenges for both studied agribiomass chains currently include eutrophication, soil organic matter decline and the use of non-renewable natural resources. The indicator values could be markedly improved by the selected improvement options, of which the most important is optimal yield. Better distributions of manure and soil fertility improvement (carbon stock and pH) were identified as the most important long-term goals for improving sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The promotion of policies aiming to the establishment of sustainable energy crops cultivation is currently one of the major efforts in the field of biomass. Stakeholders and experts are struggling to define and adopt those measures which will enable the promotion of appropriate energy crops. This study examines sustainability aspects of energy crops promotion in Cyprus, an island state in the Mediterranean, with arid climate, limited water resources, yet with strict biomass penetration targets arising from the European 2020 policy. The main input in this study is the detailed characterization of the performance of six energy crops in Cyprus. Through a multicriteria analysis, this work prioritizes the suitability of these crops in Cyprus, based on specific quantitative criteria. The sustainability of the most promising energy crops that result from this process are assessed both in terms of the production costs as well as of the potential production yield using Geographical Information System (GIS). According to the outcome of this analysis, it is shown that the possibility of promotion of energy crops in Cyprus is extremely limited and in any case insufficient to satisfy the expected contribution of biofuels in the energy mix of the island. Also the results prove that the production costs result to a non-competitive price compared to the commodities prices of the examined grains in the national market. Based on the findings of this study, strategic guidelines for the development of a framework for the sustainable promotion of energy crops in Cyprus are provided as food for thought. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Proponents of "green and clean" fuel argue that land acquisitions for biofuel development could result in significant economic benefits, such as job creation, local development, fuel and energy security, and minimal negative impacts on the environment. With a dominant focus on these purported benefits, comparatively little attention has been given to the processes and impacts of land acquisitions on the local people whose livelihoods depend on land-based activities. Using a case study of bio-ethanol development in Chisumbanje, Zimbabwe, this paper assesses the processes and local livelihood implications of land acquisitions for biofuel development and considers who is likely to bear the costs. Our findings show that local communities felt they were not consulted in the land acquisition process and despite the promises of local livelihood enhancement from biofuel development, displaced households (farmers) perceived that the costs incurred from biofuel development were more than the benefits received. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence of amending a contaminated soil with different dry-pyrolyzed biochars on the bioaccessibility and biouptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and potentially toxic elements (PTE) in turnip (Brassica rapa L.,) was investigated. This is the first study to examine the influence of biochar amendments on turnips grown in a contaminated soil. The biochars came from different local feedstocks, including sewage sludge biochar (SSBC), soybean straw biochar (SBBC), rice straw biochar (RSBC) and peanut shell biochar (PNBC). The biochars were applied to soil at 2% and 5% amendments, and the resulting influence on various soil and porewater properties were quantified. The bioaccessible concentrations of PAHs in soil and their bioaccumulation in B. rapa L. significantly (P< 0.05) decreased in the biochar amended soils. Biochar additions significantly (P≤ 0.05) reduced the bioaccumulation of PTEs (As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) in B. rapa L, though not as much as for PAHs. The most effective biochar at reducing both PAHs and PTEs was PNBC (P≤ 0.05). Amendments of 5% biochar were more effective at reducing contaminant bioaccessibility than amendments at 2% (P< 0.05). Crop yield, however, increased the most for the 2% biochar amendments, in particular for SSBC (with a 49% increase in crop yield compared to the non-amended soil). Therefore, which biochar would be the most advantageous in this system would require a cost-benefit analysis between increasing crop yield (best achieved with 2% SSBC amendments) and decreasing the PAH and PTE uptake (best achieved with 5% PNBC amendments). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) stover has been identified as a prime feedstock for biofuel production in the U.S. Corn Belt because of its perceived abundance and availability, but long-term stover harvest effects on regional nutrient budgets have not been evaluated. We defined the minimum stover requirement (MSR) to maintain current soil organic carbon levels and then estimated current and future soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) budgets for various stover harvest scenarios. Analyses for 2006 through 2010 across the entire Corn Belt indicated that currently, 28Tg or 1.6Mgha-1 of stover could be sustainably harvested from 17.95 million hectares (Mha) with N, P, and K removal of 113, 26, and 47kgha-1, respectively, and C removal for that period was estimated to be 4.55MgCha-1. Assuming continued yield increases and a planted area of 26.74 Mha in 2050, 77.4Tg stover (or 2.4Mgha-1) could be sustainably harvested with N, P, and K removal of 177, 37, and 72kgha-1, respectively, along with C removal of ~6.57MgCha-1. Although there would be significant variation across the region, harvesting only the excess over the MSR under current fertilization rates would result in a small depletion of soil N (-5±27kgha-1) and K (-20±31kgha-1) and a moderate surplus of P (36±18kgha-1). Our 2050 projections based on continuing to keep the MSR, but having higher yields indicate that soil N and K deficits would become larger, thus emphasize the importance of balancing soil nutrient supply with crop residue removal. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The potential of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to offset large-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions depends on optimizing external inputs when the crop is primarily managed as a sustainable source for renewable energy production. Due to the heterogeneity of climate and soil conditions and the complexity of agriculture, an evaluation of the effect of adopting switchgrass as a new biofuel crop into agriculture needs to be done at the regional scale. The objective of the study was to predict long-term (100-yr) GHG emissions under different N fertilization (0, 112, and 224kgNha-1) and irrigation application (0, 25, 50, 75, and 99cm H2O) levels across the Central Valley of California using the DAYCENT model. Six cultivars (Alamo, Kanlow, Cave-in-Rock, Blackwell, Sunburst, and Trailblazer) were selected. The model results suggest that switchgrass productivity is primarily constrained by N inputs when no or low water stress is expected in a Mediterranean climate. In the short-term (the first decade after establishment), soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (0-20cm) increased by 0.42-0.92MgCha-1yr-1 and N2O emissions were 1.37-2.48kg N2O-Nha-1yr-1 across the cultivars with baseline input rates of 224kgNha-1yr-1 and 99cm H2O. All cultivars were net CO2 sinks in the near term and the potential decreased by 0.09-0.30MgCha-1yr-1 (15.5-52.8%) with reduced N input from baseline under varying irrigation rates. There was a reduction in N2O emissions by 47.2-61.6% by applying less N fertilizer when irrigated at rates ≥75cm H2O per year over time. In general, higher-yielding cultivars (e.g., Alamo) tended to sequester more CO2 but also led to higher N2O emissions. In the near term, the use of N fertilizer and irrigation is needed for switchgrass systems to be a soil GHG sink, but for longer-term GHG mitigation strategies reducing both N fertilization and irrigation inputs is required. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Side by side biomass productivities, harvesting time (autumn vs. winter) and frequency (annual vs. biennial) of three perennial grasses were compared under northern and southern Mediterranean climates. Miscanthus (Miscanthus×giganteus Greef et Deu.) was compared to giant reed (Arundo donax L.) in Catania (37°24'N, 15°03'E), and to switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in Bologna (44°55'N, 11°45'E). Generally, giant reed produced about 50% higher biomass than miscanthus in Catania. Miscanthus almost halved biomass productivity in the driest year, while giant reed reduced biomass yield by only 30% under the same conditions. In Bologna, miscanthus and switchgrass produced similar amounts of cumulative biomass over 6 years. Switchgrass kept more stable annual yields than miscanthus, which, however, evidenced a higher potential under favorable climate conditions. Autumn harvest significantly reduced biomass productivity and quality (moisture content, ashes, cellulose and hemicellulose), particularly under South Mediterranean climate. In Catania, autumn biomass was 50% (giant reed) to 85% (miscanthus) lower than winter biomass, while in Bologna, autumn cut reduced switchgrass yield by 20%. Biennial harvesting resulted in almost 40% lower cumulative biomass yield than annual cut, after 6 years. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The first generation biofuels still have the role of leader in global production of biofuels. In Europe biodiesel is produced mostly from rapeseed (Brassica napus L. oleifera Metzg) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The EU policy is giving attention to the valorization of residues deriving also from those chains. The present work had the objective of evaluating the quality of residues deriving from biodiesel chains based on rapeseed and sunflower crops as well as on other interesting crops in the Mediterranean area, such as Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.). For this purpose an energetic characterization of straws, hulls and press cakes were performed following the official technical normative, as well as the evaluation of their energetic potential. The energy content of residues resulted to be interesting and their quality compatible in general with an energetic use. Crop residues seem to have the most energy potential in quantitative terms, and their exploitation can improve the energy balance of first generation biodiesel production chain improving their sustainability. Concerning quality, crop residues should be employed in medium-large sized plants to limit problems related to plant management and emissions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass can be used as a substrate in an integrated biorefinery, including in the production of second-generation biofuels. Therefore, this study analyzed the chemical composition of biomass of willow, poplar and black locust, depending on the method of soil enrichment (lignin, mineral fertilization, mycorrhiza inoculation and control - no enrichment), and harvest cycle (three- and four-year), as potential feedstock in the production of second-generation bioethanol. The highest content of cellulose in the experiment was found in willow biomass obtained from the control plot in the 3-year harvest cycle. Although the content of cellulose in poplar biomass was similar regardless of its harvest cycle, it was lower than in willow biomass by an average of 5% points. Furthermore, the average content of cellulose in biomass of black locust harvested in a 3-year cycle was the lowest. Of the species under study, the highest content of lignin was found in biomass of poplar, both in the 3-year and 4-year harvest cycle. The study found that although the choice of SRWC species used as a source of polysaccharides must take into account the percentage content in biomass, species and soil enrichment methods must also be chosen to ensure high biomass yield per unit area because differences in the potential yield of individual polysaccharides per 1. ha in some cases exceeded 1000%. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brassinosteroids are plant hormones whose stimulating activity on plant growth and development has been fully characterised and already investigated for agricultural applications. Straw and deoiled cakes, that are main residues from crops and processing for biodiesel production, of Brassica carinata and Brassica napus var. oleifera were analyzed for their content of brassinosteroids and compared to the concentrations detected in seeds. Brassinosteroids in these extracts were quantified by both HPLC analysis and bioactivity test, and a very high residual content was found in these by-products. B. carinata showed a higher concentration of brassinosteroids than B. napus var. oleifera. A new extraction method was optimized to accelerate the process. As brassinosteroids are hydrophobic compounds, then characterised by low water-solubility, the addition of HP-β cyclodextrin as coadjuvant was tested in order to improve their bioavailability in a commercial formulation for agricultural uses. These extracts were tested for their phytostimulating activity in pot-grown annual plants (lettuce and chard) under controlled conditions in a plant growth chamber. A significant increase of biomass yield was reached with both foliar and root treatments; no significant yield increased was observed when HP-β cyclodextrin was added. Then the formulation of a commercial bio-based product to be proposed as phytostimulant for agricultural uses is possible by extraction of brassinosteroids from residues of the biodiesel chain; this co-product can improve the addition value and reduce the environmental impact of a biodiesel biorefinery converting a byproduct, coproduct or residue in a source. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a growing developing world, innovative cropping systems are necessary to obtain continuous and sustainable supplies of food, feed, fuel, and bio-based products. Double- and relay-cropping systems are an option to produce biofuels, food, and biomass feedstock in a single season on the same land without sacrificing food security. Field studies were conducted between 2011 and 2013 in Prosper and Carrington, ND, and Morris, MN. Eleven crop sequences composed of double- and relay-cropping of forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and maize (Zea mays L.), following winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) were evaluated and compared with soybean, maize, and sorghum monocultures. Forage sorghum and camelina were used as theoretical feedstocks for energy production from biomass and oil, respectively. Camelina seed yield was 1415 and 940kgha-1 in Prosper and Carrington, respectively, when averaged across years. In Morris, camelina seed yield averaged 278, and 1745kg ha-1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the relay-cropping systems, the highest biomass yield (16.2Mgha-1) was achieved with forage sorghum inter-seeded into standing camelina. As expected, all sorghum, soybean, and maize monocultures had higher biomass yield than the same crops in double- or relay-cropping with camelina. Energy efficiency was evaluated for double- and relay-cropping systems based on energy inputs and outputs. The forage sorghum seeded at a normal seeding date (NSD) and at the same time that it was seeded into the double-crop treatments (DSD) on fallow ground, and soybean seeded at a NSD had energy efficiencies of 17.8, 18.7, and 21.6, respectively, in Carrington. In Morris, forage sorghum and maize seeded at NSD had energy efficiencies of 42.6 and 34.7, respectively. Of the double- and relay-cropping systems, the camelina-forage sorghum relay treatment produced the highest energy efficiency at all three locations in both years. Forage sorghum seeded at NSD was the most energy efficient monocrop at all three locations. Both forage sorghum in monocrop and the camelina-sorghum relay treatment showed good potential for biofuel and energy feedstock production in the northern Great Plains. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An extensive protein hydrolyzate was produced starting from sunflower defatted seed meal, an abundant by-product of biodiesel chain oil extraction. Two-step enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out using sequentially Alcalase-Flavourzyme enzymes and a high quality hydrolyzate was produced with an interesting composition in terms of nutrient, amino acid, and peptide content for application in conventional and organic agriculture. The biostimulant properties of the hydrolyzate were investigated by carrying out auxin and gibberellin-like activity assays in Petri dishes on garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings and by conducting experiments in pot on maize plants. The sunflower hydrolyzate showed auxin-like, but no gibberellin-like activity and interesting effects on plant root elongation suggesting a potential use of the product as an effective biostimulant in the agricultural field. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing rise in the production of meat around the world causes a significant generation of agro-industrial waste—most of it with a low value added. Fatty wastes have the potential of being converted into biodiesel, given the overcome of technological and economical barriers, as well as its presentation in solid form. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the capacity of Staphylococcus xylosus strains to modify the chemical structure of chicken fatty wastes intending to reduce the melting points of the wastes to mild temperatures, thereby breaking new ground in the production of biodiesel from these sources in an economically attractive and sustainable manner. The effects in time of fermentation and concentration of the fat in the medium were investigated, assessing the melting point and profile of fatty acids. The melting temperature showed a decrease of approximately 22 °C in the best operational conditions, due to reduction in the content of saturated fatty acids (high melting point) and increase of unsaturated fatty acids (low melting point). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Although herbaceous perennial crops are becoming a larger component of bioenergy production both in the United States and worldwide, there is growing concern that these crops pose a substantial risk of biological invasion. Miscanthus × giganteus, a sterile hybrid native to Asia, is considered an ideal biofuel crop for lands that are poorly suited for annual food crops and is currently being tested by growers. A fertile variety of M. × giganteus was developed by seed and energy companies in an effort to decrease the costs associated with planting rhizomes. No regulations have been established to manage the risk of invasion by the fertile variety. Because bioenergy production is expanding rapidly, and the few studies to quantify invasion risks in this species have addressed small spatial scales, we used a modeling approach to explore a broader domain of invasion scenarios at landscape scales. We implemented a spatially-explicit population model of fertile M. × giganteus to determine the efficacy of proposed management strategies in limiting or slowing the spread of this species. We found that fertile M. × giganteus may spread rapidly outside of field margins, and the ability of localized management strategies to curtail spread was highly sensitive to M. × giganteus first year survival and the amount of suitable habitat within the larger landscape. Commercialization of novel “bioeconomy crops”, such as fertile M. × giganteus, could increase both production and resource conservation in agriculture; however, these crops may also produce ecosystem “disservices” such as biological invasion and accompanying risks to native species. Landscape-scale modeling that allows for rapid testing of the interactions between new crop genotypes and landscape configurations will be a powerful tool for exploring the ecological risks posed by new bioeconomy crops. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - We determine and interpret fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in eastern China for January to December 2013 at a horizontal resolution of 6 km from aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from the Korean geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) satellite instrument. We implement a set of filters to minimize cloud contamination in GOCI AOD. Evaluation of filtered GOCI AOD with AOD from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) indicates significant agreement with mean fractional bias (MFB) in Beijing of 6.7 % and northern Taiwan of -1.2 %. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to relate the total column AOD to the near-surface PM2.5. The simulated PM2.5 / AOD ratio exhibits high consistency with ground-based measurements in Taiwan (MFB = -0.52 %) and Beijing (MFB = -8.0 %). We evaluate the satellite-derived PM2.5 versus the ground-level PM2.5 in 2013 measured by the China Environmental Monitoring Center. Significant agreement is found between GOCI-derived PM2.5 and in situ observations in both annual averages (r2 = 0.66, N = 494) and monthly averages (relative RMSE = 18.3 %), indicating GOCI provides valuable data for air quality studies in Northeast Asia. The GEOS-Chem simulated chemical composition of GOCI-derived PM2.5 reveals that secondary inorganics (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+) and organic matter are the most significant components. Biofuel emissions in northern China for heating increase the concentration of organic matter in winter. The population-weighted GOCI-derived PM2.5 over eastern China for 2013 is 53.8 μg mg-3, with 400 million residents in regions that exceed the Interim Target-1 of the World Health Organization. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Open rooftop incubators may provide a cost-effective way for producing microalgal biomass for biodiesel production without requiring large land areas. While cultivating a Chlorella vulgaris strain with high oil content in a rooftop incubator, we identified an invading thermo-resistant green alga, which replaced the original culture. The isolated strain HTA1-65 had the typical Chlorella morphology with spherical cells and a cup-shaped parietal chloroplast. The protoplast contained a single pyrenoid traversed by a double-layered thylakoid and enveloped by a single starch sheath. The oil content of this strain was only 21.5 %, one third of the original strain. This strain grew at 42 °C, with an optimum of 33 °C. Heat treatment of 45 °C for 3 h per day did not decrease its growth rate, suggesting that it has a high potential in biotechnological applications. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HTA1-65 belongs to the genus Chlorella, but a specific relationship to any species was not indicated by nuclear and chloroplast small subunit rRNA genes. However, based on at least one compensating base change (CBC) and a few hemi-CBCs in the ITS2 secondary structure of closely related species, we describe strain HTA1-65 as a novel, thermo-tolerant Chlorella species, C. thermophila. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Tolumonas lignolytica BRL6-1T sp. nov. is the type strain of T. lignolytica sp. nov., a proposed novel species of the Tolumonas genus. This strain was isolated from tropical rainforest soils based on its ability to utilize lignin as a sole carbon source. Cells of Tolumonas lignolytica BRL6-1T are mesophilic, non-spore forming, Gram-negative rods that are oxidase and catalase negative. The genome for this isolate was sequenced and returned in seven unique contigs totaling 3.6Mbp, enabling the characterization of several putative pathways for lignin breakdown. Particularly, we found an extracellular peroxidase involved in lignin depolymerization, as well as several enzymes involved in β-aryl ether bond cleavage, which is the most abundant linkage between lignin monomers. We also found genes for enzymes involved in ferulic acid metabolism, which is a common product of lignin breakdown. By characterizing pathways and enzymes employed in the bacterial breakdown of lignin in anaerobic environments, this work should assist in the efficient engineering of biofuel production from lignocellulosic material. © 2015 Billings et al.

AB  - Biofuels are being advocated by certain sections of the commercial aviation industry as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering fossil-fuel dependency within the confines of current aircraft technology and infrastructure. Rising oil prices, increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and continued growth in air travel demand have stimulated the development of renewable lower-carbon fuel alternatives that can act as a substitute for conventional Jet A1 kerosene. However, although biofuels may offer a number of apparent benefits, barriers to widespread commercial uptake and deployment remain, including concerns about competition for feedstocks and impact on global water resources and biodiversity. The processes involved in the uptake of aviation-grade biofuels are not straightforward and there is a need to explore the factors affecting commercial deployment. This paper reports on the findings of a series of in-depth semistructured interviews with key aviation stakeholders in Europe. The research reveals that concerns about the supply of suitable feedstocks, uncertainty surrounding the true life-cycle emissions savings of the fuels, and the perceived lack of policy support are key obstacles that need to be addressed before aviation biofuels can be widely utilized. The research also reveals that the potential inclusion of aviation within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme will create a zero accounting “loophole” for biofuel that may uniquely influence the pattern of uptake in the EU vis-à-vis other world markets. Additional key constraints identified include limitations on the supply of suitable feedstocks, concerns about sustainability of the fuels, and uncertain policy support. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Energy from biomass can be provided in various ways, such as burning the solid wastes, production of biogas (by anaerobic digesters), biofuels (i.e. methanol, ethanol, biodiesel, and derivatives), and methane via the utilization of landfills. Biodiesel is a widely used biofuel produced by the conversion of first-generation biomass feedstock via bio-chemical conversion platforms. Crude glycerol is the by-product of biodiesel production being 10 wt.% of the produced biodiesel. The objective of this study is to utilize this glycerol fraction by converting it to fuel gas or to chemical feedstock. In this study, the concentration of glycerol feedstock solution and the catalyst concentration were 50 g/L and 5 g/L, respectively. Crude glycerol was gasified in a sub and supercritical water medium by using a batch autoclave with an inner volume of 100 ml. A temperature range from 300 to 600 °C was studied. Experiments were performed with pure and crude glycerol samples in the absence and the presence of homogeneous acidic and alkali catalysts, namely H3PO4, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, and K3PO4. These were used to obtain higher gasification efficiencies and hydrogen and/or methane yields. Subsequent to each experiment liquid, solid, and gaseous products were collected and analyzed by GC, TCA (total carbon analyzer), HPLC, and GC/MS. The order of the effectiveness of the catalysts on gasification was found as: K3PO4 &gt; K2HPO4 &gt; H3PO4 &gt; KH2PO4 for crude glycerol and K3PO4 &gt; K2HPO4 &gt; KH2PO4 &gt; H3PO4 for pure glycerol. K2HPO4 and K3PO4 were found to be more effective in terms of hydrogen production while H3PO4 and KH2PO4 showed the best performance for the maximized methane production. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Global demand for palm oil is increasing to fulfil worldwide needs for cooking oil, food ingredients, biofuels, soap and other chemicals. In response, palm oil production is rapidly expanding which promotes economic growth in producing countries but also leads to serious environmental and social problems such as destruction of tropical forests, climate change and threats to small-holder livelihoods. For these reasons, palm oil production and use have become highly controversial. However, the global character of palm oil production and consumption, the number of different actors involved and its multiple uses makes promotion its sustainability highly complex. Individual nation-states can no longer control and regulate a global flow like palm oil and alternative governing networks appear involving private companies and NGOs. Acknowledging the roles of such governance networks with different forms of power means that relying only on economic and political power to explain current dynamics in the palm oil sector is inadequate. In global networks like palm oil supply, encompassing transnational material flows and multiple actors, the relevance of each actor relates to his position in the network. Power in global palm oil supply is therefore not only related to their position in the (vertical) supply chains, but also to their role in the horizontal networks. New forms of power in networks arise from steering the networks (programming) and from connecting different networks (switching). In the multiple networks that compose global palm oil provision today, different programmers and switchers play critical roles. This is briefly illustrated in this paper on the basis of different cases of active steering in global palm oil provision. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a very suitable process to transform wet biomass feedstocks into a peat-like material without drying the biomass input. Therefore, the energetic balance is more favorable than for alternative processes converting biomass as a whole. Further synergies can be achieved when the plant is employed as central hub for a regional biorefinery. Hence, a HTC pilot plant is operated with garden prunings and monitored during two years. It is shown that the elemental composition of HTC carbon is relatively constant. A carbon content of higher than 60% (based on dry, ash-free matter) is achieved. Fixed carbon content and volatile matter show low variation being the volatile content quite high with 61% on average. Dried in a post-process treatment which is less energy-demanding than drying of the raw biomass and pressed into pellets or briquettes the HTC carbon can be used as solid biofuel fulfilling the European standard (EN 14961-6). With a regional thermal valorization of the biofuel the ashes can be returned as phosphorous source to the crop land from which the biomass was harvested. Part of the process water, which involves a high amount of potassium, can be used for crop irrigation. In this way, valuable plant nutrients are recovered for soil remediation. Hence, closing the nutrient cycles a HTC plant can be considered as a sustainable local biorefinery producing a solid biofuel. Thereby, solar energy is exploited which was fixed before by photosynthesis together with the carbon dioxide which is liberated in the combustion of the solid biofuel. Optionally, the process water might serve as an alternative source of energy as it is demonstrated that its carbon content can be exploited for biogas production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae and scum on HZSM-5 catalyst for bio-oil production was investigated. The effects of co-pyrolysis temperature, catalyst to feed ratio, and microalgae to scum ratio on bio-oil yield and composition were examined. Experimental results show that temperature had great influence on the co-pyrolysis process. The optimal temperature was 550 °C since the maximum bio-oil yield and highest proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil were obtained at this temperature. The bio-oil yield decreased when catalyst was used, but the production of aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly promoted when the catalyst to feed ratio increased from 1:1 to 2:1. Co-feeding of scum could improve the bio-oil and aromatics production, while the optimal microalgae to scum ratio was 1:2 from the perspective of bio-oil quality. The synergistic effect between microalgae and scum during the co-pyrolysis process became significant only when the effective hydrogen index (EHI) of feedstock was larger than about 0.7. © 2015, Elsevier Ltd.

The column was designed to reproduce at lab-scale a real biofilter trying to consider the more probable landfill boundary conditions. Although the methane oxidation efficiency in the column was lower than the expected (around 35%), an appropriate model implementation showed an acceptable agreement between the outcomes data of the model simulation and the experimental data (with Theil's Inequality Coefficient value of 0.08). A calibrated model allows a better management of the biofilter performance in terms of methane oxidation. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Camelina sativa is an oil-producing crop belonging to the family of Brassicaceae. Due to exceptionally high content of omega fatty acid, it is commercially grown around the world as edible oil, biofuel, and animal feed. A commonly referred 'false flax' or gold-of-pleasure Camelina sativa has been interested as one of biofuel feedstocks. The species can grow on marginal land due to its superior drought tolerance with low requirement of agricultural inputs. This crop has been unexploited due to very limited transcriptomic and genomic data. Use of gene-specific molecular markers is an important strategy for new cultivar development in breeding program. In this study, Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools were used to obtain expression profiling of genes responding to drought stress in Camelina sativa BN14. A total of more than 60,000 loci were assembled, corresponding to approximately 275 K transcripts. When the species was exposed to 10 kPa drought stress, 100 kPa drought stress, and rehydrated conditions, a total of 107, 2,989, and 982 genes, respectively, were up-regulated, while 146, 3,659, and 1189 genes, respectively, were down-regulated compared to control condition. Some unknown genes were found to be highly expressed under drought conditions, together with some already reported gene families such as senescence-associated genes, CAP160, and LEA under 100 kPa soil water condition, cysteine protease, 2OG, Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase, and RAD-like 1 under rehydrated condition. These genes will be further validated and mapped to determine their function and loci. This EST library will be favorably applied to develop gene-specific molecular markers and discover genes responsible for drought tolerance in Camelina species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Corn oil recovery and conversion to biodiesel has been widely adopted at corn ethanol plants recently. The US EPA has projected 2.6 billion liters of biodiesel will be produced from corn oil in 2022. Corn oil biodiesel may qualify for federal renewable identification number (RIN) credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard, as well as for low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity credits under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Because multiple products [ethanol, biodiesel, and distiller's grain with solubles (DGS)] are produced from one feedstock (corn), however, a careful co-product treatment approach is required to accurately estimate GHG intensities of both ethanol and corn oil biodiesel and to avoid double counting of benefits associated with corn oil biodiesel production. Results: This study develops four co-product treatment methods: (1) displacement, (2) marginal, (3) hybrid allocation, and (4) process-level energy allocation. Life-cycle GHG emissions for corn oil biodiesel were more sensitive to the choice of co-product allocation method because significantly less corn oil biodiesel is produced than corn ethanol at a dry mill. Corn ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions with the displacement, marginal, and hybrid allocation approaches are similar (61, 62, and 59 g CO2e/MJ, respectively). Although corn ethanol and DGS share upstream farming and conversion burdens in both the hybrid and process-level energy allocation methods, DGS bears a higher burden in the latter because it has lower energy content per selling price as compared to corn ethanol. As a result, with the process-level allocation approach, ethanol's life-cycle GHG emissions are lower at 46 g CO2e/MJ. Corn oil biodiesel life-cycle GHG emissions from the marginal, hybrid allocation, and process-level energy allocation methods were 14, 59, and 45 g CO2e/MJ, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the influence corn oil yield, soy biodiesel, and defatted DGS displacement credits, and energy consumption for corn oil production and corn oil biodiesel production. Conclusions: This study's results demonstrate that co-product treatment methodology strongly influences corn oil biodiesel life-cycle GHG emissions and can affect how this fuel is treated under the Renewable Fuel and Low Carbon Fuel Standards. © 2015 Wang et al.

AB  - Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have prompted the widespread application of metagenomics for the investigation of novel bioresources (e.g., industrial enzymes and bioactive molecules) and unknown biohazards (e.g., pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes) in natural and engineered microbial systems across multiple disciplines. This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. Moreover, this review summarizes the principles, methodologies, and state-of-the-art bioinformatics procedures, tools and database resources for metagenomics applications and discusses two popular strategies (analysis of unassembled reads versus assembled contigs/draft genomes) for quantitative or qualitative insights of microbial community structure and functions. Overall, this review aims to facilitate more extensive application of metagenomics in the investigation of uncultured microorganisms, novel enzymes, microbe-environment interactions, and biohazards in biotechnological applications where microbial communities are engineered for bioenergy production, wastewater treatment, and bioremediation. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

The panel model is used in this study taking the period of 2000-2010. The results show that biofuel energy increases GDP growth and reduces the level of pollution. However, it increases both agriculture production and agriculture crop prices. Since biofuel energy promotes GDP growth and reduces the level of pollution, it is recommended that these countries should conduct strategies to increase their biofuel energy without causing an increase in agriculture price level.

AB  - With an increasing concern over world population, energy security, volatile fuel prices and rising in greenhouse gas emissions, many countries are considering to a more friendly alternative fossil fuels. United States and also the European Union has already introduce of legislation mandating the use of biofuels in the energy mix. This action has stimulated the demand for vegetable oils. Malaysia is currently the largest palm oil exporter and the second largest producer after Indonesia has launched her palm-based biodiesel blending mandate of 5 percent (B5) in year 2011. However the mandate has not been implemented nationwide. Thus, this study, therefore seeks to contribute to our understanding of the impacts of various blend mandates specifically B5, blending mandate of 7 percent (B7) and blending mandate of 10 percent (B10) on the Malaysian crude palm oil market stock and price. A system dynamics model was developed for the Malaysian palm oil industry which provides a framework to understand the feedback structure and how changes in various blend mandates impact the behaviour of the crude palm oil stock and price. This research suggests that increasing the blending rate is not a favourable policy, although it managed to decrease the crude palm oil stock to the targeted level but it does not contribute to palm-based biodiesel industry production due to loss in terms of profitability because of high crude palm oil prices. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - Second-generation bioenergy crops, including Short Rotation Forestry (SRF), have the potential to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings through reduced soil GHG fluxes and greater soil C sequestration. If we are to predict the magnitude of any such GHG benefits a better understanding is needed of the effect of land use change (LUC) on the underlying factors which regulate GHG fluxes. Under controlled conditions we measured soil GHG flux potentials, and associated soil physico-chemical and microbial community characteristics for a range of LUC transitions from grassland land uses to SRF. These involved ten broadleaved and seven coniferous transitions. Differences in GHGs and microbial community composition assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) profiles were detected between land uses, with distinctions between broadleaved and coniferous tree species. Compared to grassland controls, CO2 flux, total PLFAs and fungal PLFAs (on a mass of C basis), were lower under coniferous species but unaffected under broadleaved tree species. There were no significant differences in N2O and CH4 flux rates between grassland, broadleaved and coniferous land uses, though both CH4 and N2O tended to have greater uptake under broadleaved species in the upper soil layer. Effect sizes of CO2 flux across LUC transitions were positively related with effect sizes of soil pH, total PLFA and fungal PLFA. These relationships between fluxes and microbial community suggest that LUC to SRF may drive change in soil respiration by altering the composition of the soil microbial community. These findings support that LUC to SRF for bioenergy can contribute towards C savings and GHG mitigation. Crown Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In light of larger public policy debates over intellectual property and climate change, this article considers patent practice, law, and policy in respect of biofuels. This debate has significant implications for public policy discussions in respect of energy independence, food security, and climate change. The first section of the paper provides a network analysis of patents in respect of biofuels across the three generations. It provides empirical research in respect of patent subject matter, ownership, and strategy in respect of biofuels. The second section provides a case study of significant patent litigation over biofuels. There is an examination of the biofuels patent litigation between the Danish company Novozymes, and Danisco and DuPont. The third section examines flexibilities in respect of patent law and clean technologies in the context of the case study of biofuels. In particular, it explores the debate over substantive doctrinal matters in respect of biofuels - such as patentable subject matter, technology transfer, patent pools, compulsory licensing, and disclosure requirements. The conclusion explores the relevance of the debate over patent law and biofuels to the larger public policy discussions over energy independence, food security, and climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In political debates about indirect land-use changes (iLUCs) caused by biofuel development, environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) have demanded that the formulation of policies should be based on scientific evidence. However, scientific knowledge cannot become the basis of climate policy integration without agency input. Against this backdrop, this article analyses how the characterization of iLUCs alters as ENGOs mediate the knowledge of iLUC-associated research into European Union (EU) policy-making. After outlining the methodology of the frame analysis, I demonstrate how the different fields of scientific inquiry characterize iLUCs as contingent, uncertain and diverse. However, ENGOs re-frame this phenomenon as determined, certain and unified. ENGOs transform the complexity of iLUCs into a form that is compatible with the EU's modality of approaching biofuels as a question of the decarbonization of transport. Finally, there was an opportunity through appraising iLUCs to revisit the criticized governance of biofuels, but which was not grasped by the EU. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Among the various renewable energy sources, biohydrogen is gaining a lot of traction as it has very high efficiency of conversion to usable power with less pollutant generation. The various technologies available for the production of biohydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass such as direct biophotolysis, indirect biophotolysis, photo, and dark fermentations have some drawbacks (e.g., low yield and slower production rate, etc.), which limits their practical application. Among these, metabolic engineering is presently the most promising for the production of biohydrogen as it overcomes most of the limitations in other technologies. Microbial electrolysis is another recent technology that is progressing very rapidly. However, it is the dark fermentation approach, followed by photo fermentation, which seem closer to commercialization. Biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass is particularly suitable for relatively small and decentralized systems and it can be considered as an important sustainable and renewable energy source. The comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of biohydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass and its comparison with other biofuels can be a tool for policy decisions. In this paper, we discuss the various possible approaches for producing biohydrogen from lignocellulosic biomass which is an globally available abundant resource. The main technological challenges are discussed in detail, followed by potential solutions. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Algae are an attractive, alternative renewable source for biofuel production compared to biomass from food crops or cellulosic materials. Marine algae do not need fresh water or arable land and, thus, production of marine algae does not compete with food production. In contrast to biofuel production from microalgae, the use of macroalgal biomass as feedstock for biofuel production is still in its infancy. This study presents an environmental assessment of bioethanol from onshore grown green seaweed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The environmental assessment is based on data from literature and initial laboratory scale experiments, as industrial scale facilities for bioethanol production from macroalgae do not exist. Alternative systems are compared to the reference system and the limits of the LCA are discussed with respect to the co-product management (allocation vs. substitution) in the LCA model. Impact assessment results showed that nutrients for seaweed growth and electricity consumption by the culture system were the main contributors to the environmental burdens of the reference system. Bioethanol from onshore cultivated green seaweed turned out to be an environmentally efficient biofuel compared to fossil fuel and bioethanol from sugarcane. The type of co-product management selected in LCA largely affected the impact assessment results. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sound crop and land management strategies can maintain land productivity and improve the environmental sustainability of agricultural crop and feedstock production. This study evaluates a strategy of incorporating landscape design and management concepts into bioenergy feedstock production. It examines the effect of land conversion and agricultural best management practices (BMPs) on water quality (nutrients and suspended sediments) and hydrology. The strategy was applied to the watershed of the South Fork Iowa River in Iowa, where the focus was on converting low-productivity land to provide cellulosic biomass and implementing riparian buffers. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was employed to simulate the impact at watershed and sub-basin scales. The study compared the representation of buffers by using trapping efficiency and area ratio methods in SWAT. Landscape design and management scenarios were developed to quantify water quality under (i) current land use, (ii) partial land conversion to switchgrass, and (iii) riparian buffer implementation. Results show that implementation of vegetative barriers and riparian buffer can trap the loss of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment significantly. The effect increases with the increase of buffer area coverage. Implementing riparian buffer at 30 m width is able to produce 4 million liters of biofuels. When low-productivity land (15.2% of total watershed land area) is converted to grow switchgrass, suspended sediment, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and nitrate loadings are reduced by 69.3%, 55.5%, 46.1%, and 13.4%, respectively. Results highlight the significant role of lower-productivity land and buffers in cellulosic biomass and provide insights into the design of an integrated landscape with a conservation buffer for future bioenergy feedstock production.

AB  - There is a growing interest in producing biofuels and bio-chemicals from lignocellulosic feedstocks in integrated biorefineries. However, the sustainability implications of integrated biorefineries are still poorly understood. Using a life cycle approach, this paper examines environmental impacts of second-generation ethanol produced in thermo-chemical refineries together with chemicals and energy. Four feedstocks are considered: wheat straw, poplar, Miscanthus and forest residue. The results suggest that the production of ethanol from these feedstocks offers significant savings in eight out of 12 environmental impacts when the system is credited for the avoided impacts from producing the co-products from fossil resources. Ethanol from forest residue is the best and wheat straw the worst option for most impacts. Land use change has a significant effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of ethanol. For example, conversion of forest to grow Miscanthus increases the GWP from -234 to 6685 g CO2 eq./l of ethanol. The effect is opposite when grassland is converted to grow poplar: the GWP is reduced by two times because of carbon sequestration by poplar. The thermo-chemical route for producing ethanol from poplar and forest residue is more sustainable for most impacts than the bio-chemical conversion with the same feedstocks. Although ethanol saves up to 83% of GHG emissions per MJ of fuel compared to petrol, the savings are much smaller (~3%) for current ethanol blends of 5%. Therefore, unless a much higher proportion of ethanol was used, the contribution of second-generation ethanol to climate change mitigation would be small. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - This paper describes the potential for algal biomass production in conjunction with wastewater treatment and power generation within a fully biotic Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). The anaerobic biofilm in the anodic half-cell is generating current, whereas the phototrophic biofilm on the cathode is providing the oxygen for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) and forming biomass. The MFC is producing electricity with simultaneous biomass regeneration in the cathodic half-cell, which is dependent on the nutrient value of the anodic feedstock. Growth of algal biomass in the cathode was monitored, assessed and compared against the MFC power production (charge transfer), during this process. MFC generation of electricity activated the cation crossover for the formation of biomass, which has been harvested and reused as energy source in a closed loop system. It can be concluded that the nutrient reclamation and assimilation into new biomass increases the energy efficiency. This work is presenting a simple and self-sustainable MFC operation with minimal dependency on chemicals and an energy generation system utilising waste products and maximising energy turnover through an additional biomass recovery. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Since 2010, Guatemala has been exporting ethanol, principally to European markets. This means that Guatemalan biofuel has been certified sustainable, although this is deeply contested with NGO reports drawing attention to the negative impacts of 'agrofuels', particularly for marginalised communities. Guatemala therefore provides an excellent case study for examining not only the impacts of increased global demand for biofuels, but also whether sustainability, as conceptualised by the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive, can capture those issues that are salient to the Guatemalan context. Drawing on more than eighty qualitative, in-depth interviews, this paper finds that the bloc's governance framework for biofuels fails to capture many of the issues that matter most to local people in Guatemala, namely land access, trade unions and compliance with the law. This paper argues that the current framework therefore runs the risk of exacerbating the plight of Guatemala's already marginalised rural communities. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were used to assess the current state of knowledge and quantify the effects of land use change (LUC) to second generation (2G), non-food bioenergy crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of relevance to temperate zone agriculture. Following analysis from 138 original studies, transitions from arable to short rotation coppice (SRC, poplar or willow) or perennial grasses (mostly Miscanthus or switchgrass) resulted in increased SOC (+5.0 ± 7.8% and +25.7 ± 6.7% respectively). Transitions from grassland to SRC were broadly neutral (+3.7 ± 14.6%), whilst grassland to perennial grass transitions and forest to SRC both showed a decrease in SOC (-10.9 ± 4.3% and -11.4 ± 23.4% respectively). There were insufficient paired data to conduct a strict meta-analysis for GHG emissions but summary figures of general trends in GHGs from 188 original studies revealed increased and decreased soil CO2 emissions following transition from forests and arable to perennial grasses. We demonstrate that significant knowledge gaps exist surrounding the effects of land use change to bioenergy on greenhouse gas balance, particularly for CH4. There is also large uncertainty in quantifying transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry. A striking finding of this review is the lack of empirical studies that are available to validate modelled data. Given that models are extensively use in the development of bioenergy LCA and sustainability criteria, this is an area where further long-term data sets are required. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Oleaginous microalgae have a great potential as a feedstock for biodiesel and other biofuels. However, the current cost of producing biofuels from microalgae biomass is still high to envision massive and profitable commercialization in the near future. One of the drawbacks of implementing large-scale cultivation of these organisms is the unsustainable requirement of N-fertilizers. It is presumed that co-production of higher value by-products in the frame of a biorefinery would increase the profitability of producing oil from microalgae. The aim of this work is to provide proof-of-concept for the complete substitution of chemical N-fertilization by on-site biological N2 fixation in a process of microalgal oil production. We show the efficient conversion of biomass of a N2-fixing cyanobacterium into oil-rich microalgae biomass when the eukaryotic alga is fed with a cyanobacterium extract as a sole source of nutrients. Oil production yields in environmental photobioreactor simulations were in the range of current yields obtained at the expense of synthetic N-fertilizer and up to 20-fold higher than those reported when using plant feedstocks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - When green algae are exposed to physiological stresses such as nutrient deprivation, growth is arrested and the cells channel fixed carbon instead into storage compounds, accumulating first starch granules and then lipid bodies containing triacylglycerides. In recent years there has been significant interest in the commercial exploitation of algal lipids as a sustainable source of biodiesel. Since starch and lipid biosynthesis involves the same C3 precursor pool, it has been proposed that mutations blocking starch accumulation should result in increased lipid yields, and indeed several studies have supported this. The fast-growing, thermotolerant alga Chlorella sorokiniana represents an attractive strain for industrial cultivation. We have therefore generated and characterized starch-deficient mutants of C. sorokiniana and determined whether lipid levels are increased in these strains under stress conditions. One mutant (ST68) is shown to lack isoamylase, whilst two others (ST3 and ST12) are defective in starch phosphorylase. However, we find no significant change in the accumulation or profile of fatty acids in these mutants compared to the wild-type, suggesting that a failure to accumulate starch per se is not sufficient for the hyper-accumulation of lipid, and that more subtle regulatory steps underlie the partitioning of carbon to the two storage products. © 2015.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the energy balance of utilising nature conservation biomass from meadow habitats in Danish biogas production. Utilisation of nature conservation grass in biogas production in Denmark represents an interesting perspective for enhancing nature conservation of the open grassland habitats, while introducing an alternative to the use of intensively cultivated energy crops as co-substrates in manure based biogas plants. The energy balance of utilising nature conservation grass was investigated by using: data collected from previous investigations on the productivity of meadow areas, different relevant geo-datasets, spatial analyses, and various statistical analyses. The results show that values for the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) ranging from 1.7 to 3.3 can be obtained when utilising meadow grasses in local biogas production. The total national net energy gain (NEG) was estimated to more than 600,000 GJ corresponding to ≈ 15% of the total Danish biogas production in 2012. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing digestate output and developing a market for the product is a serious challenge for the biogas industry. Without effective strategies for sustainable management, the large volume of digestate produced by biogas plants may cripple the industry and its potential. Through interviews with diverse biogas stakeholders, we examine current approaches to digestate marketing to identify factors that support and those that inhibit its success. We find that marketing to regions with a nutrient demand or into the non-agricultural sector holds promise. Upgraded digestate products offer increased marketability due to their higher nutrient content and lower water content. Fertilizer and soil manufacturers, farmers, horticulturists and private customers all represent markets for digestate. Current disposal prices range from negative to strongly positive, depending on the regional nutrient availability, agricultural structure, season, feedstock and degree of upgrading. Marketers agree that concealing the biogas origin of digestate products is still necessary to avoid negative perceptions by customers. One implication of this is the need for better understanding by marketers of consumer concerns and preferences, and for better education of consumers regarding the safety and benefits of digestate. Overall, we find that opportunities for digestate marketing remain largely unexploited and marketing strategies remain immature. Our findings should prove helpful to current and future digestate marketers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intercropping legumes may reduce inputs and enhance sustainability of forage and feedstock production, especially on marginal soils. This approach is largely untested for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production, yet producer acceptance should be high given the traditional use of legumes in forage/agricultural systems. Our objectives were to evaluate three cool-season and two warm-season legumes and their required densities to influence yield and supply nitrogen (N) compared to three inorganic N levels (0, 33, and 66 kg N ha-1 [0, 30, and 60 lb N ac-1]) at three locations in Tennessee (Knoxville [Sequatchie Silt Loam], Crossville [Lilly Loam], and Milan [Loring B2 Series]). Fall of 2010 seeded, cool-season legumes (red clover [Trifolium pratense L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa L.], ladino clover [Trifolium repens L.]), arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum L.), and a spring of 2011 seeded, warm-season legume (partridge pea [Chamaecrista fasciculate L.]) were interseeded into switchgrass at three (high, medium, and low) seeding rates each in two experiments. Harvest treatments were annual single, postdormancy biofuel (Experiment One) or integrated forage-biofuel (preanthesis and postdormancy; Experiment Two). Year one yield impacts were minimal. During the second harvest year, legumes increased yield versus Year 1; in general, yields for 33 and 67 kg N ha-1 did not differ from those for red clover, hairy vetch, ladino clover, or partridge pea (p < 0.05). Arrowleaf clover yields were not different from 0 kg N ha-1. Forage biomass yields were generally more responsive to legumes (p < 0.05) than the biomass regime. Legume persistence after three years was generally greatest for ladino clover and partridge pea. Forage quality (switchgrass only) in some cases was positively influenced by legume treatments, notably hairy vetch and partridge pea (p < 0.05). Intercropping selected legumes in switchgrass may enhance forage quality and yield while reducing nonrenewable inputs, fertilizer costs, and emissions/runoff to air and groundwater.

AB  - Butanol is an ideal biofuel, although poor titers lead to high recovery costs by distillation. Fluidization of microbial membranes by butanol is one of the major factors limiting titers in butanol-producing bioprocesses. Starting with the hypothesis that certain membrane insertion molecules would stabilize the lipid bilayer in the presence of butanol, we applied a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques within an in silico framework to describe a new approach to achieve solvent tolerance in bacteria. Single-molecule tracking of a model supported bilayer showed that COE1-5C, a five-ringed oligo-polyphenylenevinylene conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), reduced the diffusion rate of phospholipids in a microbially derived lipid bilayer to a greater extent than three-ringed and four-ringed COEs. Furthermore, COE1-5C treatment increased the specific growth rate of E. coli K12 relative to a control at inhibitory butanol concentrations. Consequently, to confer butanol tolerance to microbes by exogenous means is complementary to genetic modification of strains in industrial bioprocesses, extends the physiological range of microbes to match favorable bioprocess conditions, and is amenable with complex and undefined microbial consortia for biobutanol production. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the π-conjugated aromatic backbone of COE1-5C likely acts as a hydrophobic tether for glycerophospholipid acyl chains by enhancing bilayer integrity in the presence of high butanol concentrations, which thereby counters membrane fluidization. COE1-5C-mitigated E. coli K12 membrane depolarization by butanol is consistent with the hypothesis that improved growth rates in the presence of butanol are a consequence of improved bilayer stability. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Lignin is an important factor affecting agricultural traits, biofuel production, and the pulping industry. Most lignin biosynthesis genes and their regulatory genes are expressed mainly in the vascular bundles of stems and leaves, preferentially in tissues undergoing lignification. Other genes are poorly expressed during normal stages of development, but are strongly induced by abiotic or biotic stresses. Some are expressed in non-lignifying tissues such as the shoot apical meristem. Alterations in lignin levels affect plant development. Suppression of lignin biosynthesis genes causes abnormal phenotypes such as collapsed xylem, bending stems, and growth retardation. The loss of expression by genes that function early in the lignin biosynthesis pathway results in more severe developmental phenotypes when compared with plants that have mutations in later genes. Defective lignin deposition is also associated with phenotypes of seed shattering or brittle culm. MYB and NAC transcriptional factors function as switches, and some homeobox proteins negatively control lignin biosynthesis genes. Ectopic deposition caused by overexpression of lignin biosynthesis genes or master switch genes induces curly leaf formation and dwarfism. © 2015 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Fats and oils continue to be the main feedstock for alternative transport fuels, especially for FAME (biodiesel) production. Nevertheless, hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVO), which are mixtures of alkanes, are also established as a commercial fuel. This review describes recent developments in FAME and HVO production and utilization, including microbial oil use. However, the use of unmodified plant oil as fuel or their corresponding engine and emission tests are not discussed. Recent developed catalysts are described for FAME production, including heterogeneous catalysts, such as super acids, ion-exchange resins, and other green catalysts produced from biomass. Bio-catalytic approaches using soluble or immobilized enzymes are at the early commercialization stage. Since HVO production technology is based mainly on current mineral oil industry processing methods, the scientific literature is not as extensive as that of FAME production. The main reaction routes of HVO are a combination of hydrogenation, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, hydroisomerization, and cracking under high pressure and temperatures, using supported and unsupported heterogeneous metal catalysts. Recent reports have highlighted the potential use of non-food oils, such as microalgae lipids, but industrial significant progress has not occurred, leading to some disillusionment with this approach. Therefore, a clear strategy should be developed for upstream and downstream processes with parallel evaluation of life cycle assessment (LCA). In addition, energy intensive steps of biomass drying and solvent extraction should be avoided by using intelligent technologies, such as in situ processing of wet biomass. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Despite the great potential of camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) as a promising biofuel feedstock, in-farm energy flow of the crop and its associated environmental impacts has not received sufficient attention from researchers. In order to assess net energy gain and to identify energy saving and environmental friendly production operations, a two year study was conducted at central Montana. We investigated the effects of tillage method (CT (conventional tillage) vs. NT (no-tillage)) and N (nitrogen) fertilizer rate (0, 45, 90 kg N ha-1) on energy balance and GHG (greenhouse gas emission) of dryland camelina production. Results indicated that energy input and GHG emission were 5 and 8% lower in NT than in CT. Application of 45 and 90 kg N ha-1 increased camelina energy input by 186 and 365%, while increased energy output by only 21 and 64%, respectively. There was no significant difference in net energy gain in response to N fertilization, but lower energy efficiency in response to higher N inputs. Averaged across tillage systems, the GHG emission was 32.0 kg C eq ha-1 with 0 N applied, and the GHG emission increased by 206 and 389% when 45 and 90 kg N ha-1 was applied. Overall, N fertilizer had the biggest share in total energy input. Averaged over all experimental treatments, 14,945 MJ ha-1 net energy was obtained from camelina crop in this study which shows the potential of this crop as a bioenergy feedstock. Our result showed that implementation of NT is strongly recommendable for camelina production in this region. Moreover, improvement of N use efficiency has the highest priority to improve energy performance and reduce GHG emissions in camelina production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fine fraction (FF, &lt;20 mm) from mined landfill was stabilized in four laboratory-scale leach bed reactors (LBR) over 180days. The aim was to study feasibility of biotechnological methods to treat FF and if further stabilization of FF is possible. Four different stabilization methods were compared and their effects upon quality of FF were evaluated. Also during the stabilization experiment, leachate quality as well as gas composition and quantity were analyzed. The methods studied included three anaerobic LBRs (one without water addition, one with water addition, and one with leachate recirculation) and one aerobic LBR (with water addition). During the experiment, the most methane was produced in anaerobic LBR without water addition (18.0LCH4/kgVS), while water addition and leachate recirculation depressed methane production slightly, to 16.1 and 16.4LCH4/kgVS, respectively. Organic matter was also removed via the leachate and was measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD). Calculated removal of organic matter in gas and leachate was highest in LBR with water addition (59gCOD/kgVS), compared with LBR without water addition or with leachate recirculation (51gCOD/kgVS). Concentrations of COD, ammonium nitrogen and anions in leachate decreased during the experiment, indicating washout mechanism caused by water additions. Aeration increased sulfate and nitrate concentrations in leachate due to oxidized sulfide and ammonium. Molecular weight distributions of leachates showed that all the size categories decreased, especially low molecular weight compounds, which were reduced the most. Aerobic stabilization resulted in the lowest final VS/TS (13.1%), lowest respiration activity (0.9-1.2mgO2/gTS), and lowest methane production after treatment (0.0-0.8LCH4/kgVS), with 29% of VS being removed from FF. Anaerobic stabilization methods also reduced organic matter by 9-20% compared with the initial amount. Stabilization reduced the quantity of soluble nitrogen in FF and did not alter concentration of soluble and insoluble phosphorus, and insoluble nitrogen. All four stabilization methods decreased organic matter and thus are possible stabilization methods for FF, but aerobic treatment was the most efficient in this study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Much research has been carried out in the last decade to convert bio-based feedstock into fuels and chemicals. Most of the research focuses on developing active and selective catalysts, with much less attention devoted to their long-term stability. This Review considers the main challenges in long-term catalyst stability, discusses some fundamentals, and presents options for their mitigation. Three main challenges are discussed: catalyst fouling, catalyst poisoning, and catalyst destruction. Fouling is generally related to the deposition of insoluble components present in the feed or formed by degradation of the feed or intermediates. Poisoning is related to the deposition of electropositive contaminants (e.g. alkali and alkaline earth metals) on acid sites or of electronegative contaminants (e.g. N and S) at hydrogenation sites. Catalyst destruction results from the thermodynamic instability of most oxidic supports, solid acids/bases, and hydrogenation functions under hydrothermal conditions. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Feed in tariffs (FiTs) and renewable heat incentives (RHIs) are driving a rapid expansion in anaerobic digestion (AD) coupled with combined heat and power (CHP) plants in the UK. Farm models were combined with consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) to assess the net environmental balance of representative biogas, biofuel and biomass scenarios on a large arable farm, capturing crop rotation and digestate nutrient cycling effects. All bioenergy options led to avoided fossil resource depletion. Global warming potential (GWP) balances ranged from -1732 kg CO2e Mg-1 dry matter (DM) for pig slurry AD feedstock after accounting for avoided slurry storage to +2251 kg CO2e Mg-1 DM for oilseed rape biodiesel feedstock after attributing indirect land use change (iLUC) to displaced food production. Maize monoculture for AD led to net GWP increases via iLUC, but optimized integration of maize into an arable rotation resulted in negligible food crop displacement and iLUC. However, even under best-case assumptions such as full use of heat output from AD-CHP, crop-biogas achieved low GWP reductions per hectare compared with Miscanthus heating pellets under default estimates of iLUC. Ecosystem services (ES) assessment highlighted soil and water quality risks for maize cultivation. All bioenergy crop options led to net increases in eutrophication after displaced food production was accounted for. The environmental balance of AD is sensitive to design and management factors such as digestate storage and application techniques, which are not well regulated in the UK. Currently, FiT payments are not dependent on compliance with sustainability criteria. We conclude that CLCA and ES effects should be integrated into sustainability criteria for FiTs and RHIs, to direct public money towards resource-efficient renewable energy options that achieve genuine climate protection without degrading soil, air or water quality.

AB  - Land-use conversion into bioenergy crop production can alter litter decomposition processes tightly coupled to soil carbon and nutrient dynamics. Yet, litter decomposition has been poorly described in bioenergy production systems, especially following land-use conversion. Predicting decomposition dynamics in postconversion bioenergy production systems is challenging because of the combined influence of land-use legacies with current management and litter quality. To evaluate how land-use legacies interact with current bioenergy crop management to influence litter decomposition in different litter types, we conducted a landscape-scale litterbag decomposition experiment. We proposed land-use legacies regulate decomposition, but their effects are weakened under higher quality litter and when current land use intensifies ecosystem disturbance relative to prior land use. We compared sites left in historical land uses of either agriculture (AG) or Conservation Reserve Program grassland (CRP) to those that were converted to corn or switchgrass bioenergy crop production. Enzyme activities, mass loss, microbial biomass, and changes in litter chemistry were monitored in corn stover and switchgrass litter over 485 days, accompanied by similar soil measurements. Across all measured variables, legacy had the strongest effect (P < 0.05) relative to litter type and current management, where CRP sites maintained higher soil and litter enzyme activities and microbial biomass relative to AG sites. Decomposition responses to conversion depended on legacy but also current management and litter type. Within the CRP sites, conversion into corn increased litter enzymes, microbial biomass, and litter protein and lipid abundances, especially on decomposing corn litter, relative to nonconverted CRP. However, conversion into switchgrass from CRP, a moderate disturbance, often had no effect on switchgrass litter decomposition parameters. Thus, legacies shape the direction and magnitude of decomposition responses to bioenergy crop conversion and therefore should be considered a key influence on litter and soil C cycling under bioenergy crop management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The US Department of Energy has mandated the production of 16 billion gallons (60.6 billion liters) of renewable biofuel from cellulosic feedstocks by 2022. The perennial grass, Miscanthus×giganteus, is a potential candidate for cellulosic biofuel production because of high productivity with minimal inputs. This study determined the effect of three different spring fertilizer treatments (0, 60, and 120kg Nha-1yr-1 as urea) on biomass production, soil organic matter (SOM), and inorganic N leaching in Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Virginia, along with N2O and CO2 emissions at the IL site. There were no significant yield responses to fertilizer treatments, except at the IL site in 2012 (yields in 2012, year 4, varied from 10 to 23.7 Mgha-1 across all sites). Potentially mineralizable N increased across all fertilizer treatments and sites in the 0-10cm soil depth. An increase in permanganate oxidizable carbon (POX-C, labile C) in surface soils occurred at the IL and NJ sites, which were regularly tilled before planting. Decreases in POX-C were observed in the 0 - 10cm soil depth at the KY and NE sites where highly managed turfgrass was grown prior to planting. Growing M.×giganteus altered SOM composition in only 4years of production by increasing the amount of potentially mineralizable N at every site, regardless of fertilization amount. Nitrogen applications increased N leaching and N2O emission without increasing biomass production. This suggests that for the initial period (4years) of M.×giganteus production, N application has a detrimental environmental impact without any yield benefits and thus should not be recommended. Further research is needed to define a time when N application to M.×giganteus results in increased biomass production. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Growing biomass feedstocks from marginal lands is becoming an increasingly attractive choice for producing biofuel as an alternative energy to fossil fuels. Here, we used a biogeochemical model at ecosystem scale to estimate crop productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands in the United States. Two broadly tested cellulosic crops, switchgrass, and Miscanthus, were assumed to be grown on the abandoned land and mixed crop-vegetation land with marginal productivity. Production of biomass and biofuel as well as net carbon exchange and nitrous oxide emissions were estimated in a spatially explicit manner. We found that, cellulosic crops, especially Miscanthus could produce a considerable amount of biomass, and the effective ethanol yield is high on these marginal lands. For every hectare of marginal land, switchgrass and Miscanthus could produce 1.0-2.3kl and 2.9-6.9kl ethanol, respectively, depending on nitrogen fertilization rate and biofuel conversion efficiency. Nationally, both crop systems act as net GHG sources. Switchgrass has high global warming intensity (100-390g CO2eql-1 ethanol), in terms of GHG emissions per unit ethanol produced. Miscanthus, however, emits only 21-36g CO2eq to produce every liter of ethanol. To reach the mandated cellulosic ethanol target in the United States, growing Miscanthus on the marginal lands could potentially save land and reduce GHG emissions in comparison to growing switchgrass. However, the ecosystem modeling is still limited by data availability and model deficiencies, further efforts should be made to classify crop-specific marginal land availability, improve model structure, and better integrate ecosystem modeling into life cycle assessment. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Oilseed rape is one of the leading feedstocks for biofuel production in Europe. The climate change mitigation effect of rape methyl ester (RME) is particularly challenged by the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during crop production, mainly as nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. Oilseed rape requires high nitrogen fertilization and crop residues are rich in nitrogen, both potentially causing enhanced N2O emissions. However, GHG emissions of oilseed rape production are often estimated using emission factors that account for crop-type specifics only with respect to crop residues. This meta-analysis therefore aimed to assess annual N2O emissions from winter oilseed rape, to compare them to those of cereals and to explore the underlying reasons for differences. For the identification of the most important factors, linear mixed effects models were fitted with 43 N2O emission data points deriving from 12 different field sites. N2O emissions increased exponentially with N-fertilization rates, but interyear and site-specific variability were high and climate variables or soil parameters did not improve the prediction model. Annual N2O emissions from winter oilseed rape were 22% higher than those from winter cereals fertilized at the same rate. At a common fertilization rate of 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1, the mean fraction of fertilizer N that was lost as N2O-N was 1.27% for oilseed rape compared to 1.04% for cereals. The risk of high yield-scaled N2O emissions increased after a critical N surplus of about 80 kg N ha-1 yr-1. The difference in N2O emissions between oilseed rape and cereal cultivation was especially high after harvest due to the high N contents in oilseed rape's crop residues. However, annual N2O emissions of winter oilseed rape were still lower than predicted by the Stehfest and Bouwman model. Hence, the assignment of oilseed rape to the crop-type classes of cereals or other crops should be reconsidered. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy is seen as one of the options for industrialised countries to wean themselves off fossil fuels. However bioenergy, transport biofuels in particular, has faced considerable environmental and social controversies. Biorefining has been proposed in the UK and Denmark to address these concerns by using biomass efficiently for multiple purposes (food, feed, fuel, chemicals). Drawing from frameworks on responsible innovation, this paper opens up the implicit assumptions within the biorefinery concept about how biomass should be produced. Stakeholder interviews show that the biorefinery concept is framed within an industrial agricultural paradigm that aims to overcome controversies through large-scale production stimulated by biotechnology innovation. By contrast, an "alternative agriculture" paradigm envisions sustainable multipurpose biomass production in terms of on-farm nutrient and energy cycling and local, smaller scale production. However, there is a potential overlap through the concept of quality industrial biomass production. These three visions provide different perspectives on the bioeconomy in terms of the differences between biomass and fossil fuels; and where biomass should come from. Policy development for bioenergy must reckon with these different visions in innovation pathways for multipurpose biomass. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents mass balances and a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) for energy and greenhouse gases (GHGs) of a simulated microalgae biodiesel production system. Key parameters of the system include biomass productivity of 16 and 25 g m-2 day-1 and lipid content of algae of 40% and 25% for low and normal nitrogen conditions respectively. Based on an oil extraction efficiency from wet biomass of 73.6% and methane yields from anaerobically digested lipid-extracted biomass of 0.31 to 0.34 l per gram of volatile solids, the mass balance shows that recycling growth media and recovering nutrients from residual biomass through anaerobic digestion can reduce the total demand for nitrogen by 66% and phosphorus by 90%. Freshwater requirements can be reduced by 89% by recirculating growth media, and carbon requirements reduced by 40% by recycling CO2 from biogas combustion, for normal nitrogen conditions. A variety of technology options for each step of the production process and allocation methods for coproducts used outside the production system are evaluated using LCA. Extensive sensitivity and scenario analysis is also performed to provide better understanding of uncertainty associated with results. The best performing scenario consists of normal nitrogen cultivation conditions, bioflocculation and dissolved air flotation for harvesting, centrifugation for dewatering, wet extraction with hexane, transesterification for biodiesel production, and anaerobic digestion of biomass residual, which generates biogas used in a combined heat and power unit for energy recovery. This combination of technologies and operating conditions results in life cycle energy requirements and GHG emissions of 1.02 MJ and 71 g CO2-equivalent per MJ of biodiesel, with cultivation and oil extraction dominating energy use and emissions. Thus, even under optimistic conditions, the near-term performance of this biofuel pathway does not achieve the significant reductions in life cycle GHG emissions hoped for from second-generation biofuel feedstocks. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum has the natural ability to convert cellulose to ethanol, making it a promising candidate for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of cellulosic biomass to biofuels. To further improve its CBP capabilities, a mutant strain of C. thermocellum was constructed (strain AG553; C. thermocellum δhpt δhydG δldh δpfl δpta-ack) to increase flux to ethanol by removing side product formation. Strain AG553 showed a two- to threefold increase in ethanol yield relative to the wild type on all substrates tested. On defined medium, strain AG553 exceeded 70% of theoretical ethanol yield on lower loadings of the model crystalline cellulose Avicel, effectively eliminating formate, acetate, and lactate production and reducing H2 production by fivefold. On 5g/L Avicel, strain AG553 reached an ethanol yield of 63.5% of the theoretical maximum compared with 19.9% by the wild type, and it showed similar yields on pretreated switchgrass and poplar. The elimination of organic acid production suggested that the strain might be capable of growth under higher substrate loadings in the absence of pH control. Final ethanol titer peaked at 73.4mM in mutant AG553 on 20g/L Avicel, at which point the pH decreased to a level that does not allow growth of C. thermocellum, likely due to CO2 accumulation. In comparison, the maximum titer of wild type C. thermocellum was 14.1mM ethanol on 10g/L Avicel. With the elimination of the metabolic pathways to all traditional fermentation products other than ethanol, AG553 is the best ethanol-yielding CBP strain to date and will serve as a platform strain for further metabolic engineering for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

AB  - LCA has evolved from its origins in energy analysis in the 1960s and 70s into a wide ranging tool used to determine impacts of products or systems over several environmental and resource issues. The approach has become more prevalent in research, industry and policy. Its use continues to expand as it seeks to encompass impacts as diverse as resource accounting and social well being. Carbon policy for bioenergy has driven many of these changes. Enabling assessment of complex issues over a life cycle basis is beneficial, but the process is sometimes difficult. LCA's use in framing is increasingly complex and more uncertain, and in some cases, irreconcilable. The charged environment surrounding biofuels and bioenergy exacerbates all of these. Reaching its full potential to help guide difficult policy discussions and emerging research involves successfully managing LCA's transition from attributional to consequential and from retrospective to prospective. This paper examines LCA's on-going evolution and its use within bioenergy deployment. The management of methodological growth in the context of the unique challenges associated with bioenergy and biofuels is explored. Changes seen in bioenergy LCA will bleed into other LCA arenas, especially where it is important that a sustainable solution is chosen. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between key characteristics of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and Certified Emission Reduction (CER) prices. Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis, we show that the CER credit prices are likely to have had a greater influence than regional levels of economic development on the sectors, regions and sizes of CDM projects. There are comparatively few CDM projects in Sub-Saharan Africa (less South Africa) and the small-scale forestation projects that are characteristic for the region mainly entered the CDM pipeline when CER credit price levels were high. Latin America hosts a larger number of projects, and the small-scale methane, biofuel and hydro projects that are typical for this region generally also applied for validation under high CER price levels. The large industrial gas and energy efficiency projects typical for the Middle East/Northern Africa region appear to have been largely insensitive to CER price levels. The large number and variety of projects in Asia have applied for registration under a broad range of CER price levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plant cell wall represents an important source of fermentable sugars for second generation bioethanol production. However, cellulosic biomass hydrolysis still is a bottleneck to bioethanol production in an efficient and low cost process. Thermophilic bacteria have been studied as a source of cellulolytic enzymes for cellulosic biomass deconstruction, as their enzymes present unique features compatible with current industrial process conditions. The present study was carried out to evaluate the use of different agro-industrial wastes as suitable carbon sources for growth and enzyme secretion by a strain of Clostridium thermocellum isolated from goat rumen. C. thermocellum B8 was able to grow on/degrade microcrystalline cellulose, Sugar cane bagasse/Straw and Cotton waste, and produced different sets of cellulases and hemicellulases in their presence. The enzymatic mixtures produced by C. thermocellum (B8) showed activities over a broad range of temperatures (50-70 °C). Highest values were obtained between 60 and 70 °C, at a pH range from 5 to 7, decreasing at alkaline pH values. In addition, enzymes displayed thermostability, with CMCase and xylanase activities maintaining maximum values over 12 days at 50 °C. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The nexus of population growth and changing diets has increased the demands placed on agriculture to supply food for human consumption, animal feed and fuel. Rising incomes lead to dietary changes, from staple crops, towards commodities with greater land requirements, e.g. meat and dairy products. Despite yield improvements partially offsetting increases in demand, agricultural land has still been expanding, causing potential harm to ecosystems, e.g. through deforestation. We use country-level panel data (1961-2011) to allocate the land areas used to produce food for human consumption, waste and biofuels, and to attribute the food production area changes to diet, population and yields drivers. The results show that the production of animal products dominates agricultural land use and land use change over the 50-year period, accounting for 65% of land use change. The rate of extensification of animal production was found to have reduced more recently, principally due to the smaller effect of population growth. The area used for bioenergy was shown to be relatively small, but formed a substantial contribution (36%) to net agricultural expansion in the most recent period. Nevertheless, in comparison to dietary shifts in animal products, bioenergy accounted for less than a tenth of the increase in demand for agricultural land. Population expansion has been the largest driver for agricultural land use change, but dietary changes are a significant and growing driver. China was a notable exception, where dietary transitions dominate food consumption changes, due to rapidly rising incomes. This suggests that future dietary changes will become the principal driver for land use change, pointing to the potential need for demand-side measures to regulate agricultural expansion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability science is difficult to conceptualise, plan and conduct, given the broad range of epistemological commitments, methodological practices, and approaches to problem-framing taken by its constituent disciplines. This special issue is based on the idea of place as a boundary device for the sustainability sciences, in the belief that it can foster integrative work, guide theoretical reflection, encourage methodological innovation, and inform empirical research. Here we reflect on place concepts, before developing a series of arguments on the relationship of place to sustainability science. We first emphasise that place is not solely an interpretivist or post-positivist perspective on sustainability, as it is also congenial to mechanistic or positivist ontologies. Secondly, we argue that place does not entail a retreat from theory into particularism or thick description; it is coherent with attempts to provide explanations. Thirdly, we claim that it does not imply a sedentary, parochial approach to sustainability science that neglects interactions across scale or location. Fourthly, we caution that public spheres for tackling environmental issues can act to close-down deliberation and marginalise informal knowledge, if institutions retain norms that emphasise abstract, placeless evidence. We highlight how these ideas have been cashed out in the collected papers in this special issue, in domains ranging from biofuels governance, to estuary management, to marine governance, to ecosystem stewardship, to community-led low energy transitions, and to climate change more broadly. We end by suggesting that a place-based approach to sustainability science entails a relentless focus on context. It takes the spatially patterned, heterogeneous, fluid, networked, and contextually moderated form of socio-environmental processes as central points of investigation, rather than as mere modifiers of more general mechanisms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work addresses the economic and environmental performance of integrated biorefineries based on sugarcane juice and residues. Four multiproduct scenarios were considered; two from sugar mills and the others from ethanol distilleries. They are integrated biorefineries producing first (1G) and second (2G) generation ethanol, sugar, molasses (for animal feed) and electricity in the context of Brazil. The scenarios were analysed and compared using techno-economic value-based approach and LCA methodology. The results show that the best economic configuration is provided by a scenario with largest ethanol production while the best environmental performance is presented by a scenario with full integration sugar - 1G2G ethanol production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The blending of liquid biofuels into road transport fuel has been supported by legally binding targets in Europe since 2009. Concerns over the extent to which these targets might engender indirect land-use change (ILUC), however, have an equally long history. Brought about when biofuel production displaces existing agricultural activity into new territory, ILUC has the potential to exert deleterious impacts upon the global climate, biodiversity, water and soil quality, food security, and even land rights. This paper begins by illustrating how current approaches to addressing this problem, predicated on equilibrium modelling and the concept of emissions 'factors', effectively detach its impacts from their place-specific contexts. Drawing on a relational view of space, the paper then advances an alternative, assemblage-based approach to conceptualising ILUC. By emphasising ILUC's fluidity, indeterminacy and complexity, this approach questions the logic of relying solely on abstractive science and policy tools to address the problem. The paper concludes by advocating an alternative approach to remedying ILUC - one that imbricates both place-specific and globally aggregated representations of the problem. The paper has implications for research across multiple disciplines addressing the sustainable governance of transport biofuels and wider bioenergy systems as a whole. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Eddy covariance measurements were made in seven fields in the Midwest USA over 4 years (including the 2012 drought year) to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) of newly established rain-fed cellulosic and grain biofuel crops. Four of the converted fields had been managed as grasslands under the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for 22 years, and three had been in conventional agriculture (AGR) soybean/corn rotation prior to conversion. In 2009, all sites were planted to no-till soybean except one CRP grassland that was left unchanged as a reference site; in 2010, three of the former CRP sites and the three former AGR sites were planted to annual (corn) and perennial (switchgrass and mixed-prairie) grasslands. The annual ET over the 4 years ranged from 45% to 77% (mean = 60%) of the annual precipitation (848-1063 mm; November-October), with the unconverted CRP grassland having the highest ET (622-706 mm). In the fields converted to annual and perennial crops, the annual ET ranged between 480 and 639 mm despite the large variations in growing-season precipitation and in soil water contents, which had strong effects on regional crop yields. Results suggest that in this humid temperate climate, which represents the US Corn Belt, water use by annual and perennial crops is not greatly different across years with highly variable precipitation and soil water availability. Therefore, large-scale conversion of row crops to perennial biofuel cropping systems may not strongly alter terrestrial water balances. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of naturally produced water hyacinth was assessed through Emergy accounting approach. Two analyses were carried out to evaluate the influence of additional services and externalities on Emergy indicators for a pyrolysis plant unit able to process 1000. kg of dry biomass per hour. The initial approach was a traditional Emergy assessment in which financial fluxes and externalities were not considered. The second approach included taxes and fees of the Brazilian government, interests related to financing operations and assumes a reserve financial fund of 5% of the total investment as externalities cost. For the first evaluation, the renewability of 86% indicates that local and renewable resources mainly support the process and the Emergy Yield Ratio of 3.2 shows that the system has a potential contribution to the regional economy due to the local resources use. The inclusion of financial fluxes and externalities in the second evaluation reduces both renewability and Emergy Yield Ratio, whereas it increases the Emergy Investment Ratio which means a higher dependence on external resources. The second analysis allows portraying significant forces of the industrial and financial systems and the evaluation of the externalities' impact on the general system Emergy behavior. A comparison of the renewability of water hyacinth fast pyrolysis with other biofuels like soybean biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol indicates that the former is less dependent on fossil fuel resources, machinery and fertilizers. To complement the sustainability assessment provided by the Emergy method, a regular financial analysis for the second defined system was done. It shows that the system is financially attractive even with the accounting of additional costs. The results obtained in this study could be used as the maximum and minimum thresholds to subsidize regulatory policies for new economic activities in tropical wetlands involving natural resources exploitation and bio-industrial systems. © 2015.

AB  - The global demand for polystyrene is supposed to reach an overall baseline of 23.5milliontons by 2020. The market has experienced the effects of such growth, especially regarding the environmental performance of the production processes. In Brazil, renewable assets have been used to overcome the adverse consequences of this expansion. This study evaluates this issue for the production of Brazilian polystyrene resins, general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). The effects of replacing fossil ethylene with a biobased alternative are also investigated. Life Cycle Assessment is applied for ten scenarios, with different technological approaches for renewable ethylene production and an alternative for obtaining bioethanol, which considers the export of electricity. The fossil GPPS and HIPS show a better performance than the partially renewable sources in terms of Climate Change (CC), Terrestrial Acidification (TA), Photochemical Oxidant Formation (POF), and Water Depletion (WD). The exception is Fossil Depletion (FD), a somewhat predictable result. The main environmental loads associated with the renewable options are related to the sugarcane production. Polybutadiene fails to provide greater additional impact to HIPS when compared to GPPS. With regard to obtaining ethylene from ethanol, Adiabatic Dehydration (AD) technology consumes less sugarcane than Adiabatic Dehydration at High Pressure (ADHP), which leads to gains in TA and POF. In contrast, ADHP was more eco-friendly for WD because of its lower water losses and in terms of CC because of the advantageous balance of fossil CO2eq at the agricultural stage and the lower consumption of natural gas in ethylene production. The electricity export is an auspicious environmental opportunity because it can counterbalance some of the negative impacts associated with the renewable route. According to a "cradle-to-grave" perspective, the partially renewable resins show a more favorable balance of carbon. This difference increases when sequestration and biogenic carbon emissions are considered. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently we lack knowledge on how the soil microbial community responds to the transition from traditional grain production to cellulosic feedstock production systems with residue removal for biofuel production. Implementation of second-generation biofuel production systems could create a challenge in meeting the goal of providing cellulose biomass if the processes impact soil's function as part of ecosystem services. Our goal was to assess the transition period as we move from a grain harvest system with residue return into biomass production systems with both residue and grain removal. The existing traditional systems were continuous corn (CC) and corn-soybean rotations (corn-soybean-corn (R1) or soybean-corn-soybean (R2)). The biomass production systems include a previously established mixed tall grass prairie dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii; PR) where the above ground biomass is now harvested when it had been previously burned, corn-soybean rotations transitioned to residue recovery based on: Miscanthus×. giganteus (MS), dual-purpose sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; SG), upland switchgrass (Panicum virgatum; c.v. Shawnee; SW) and a tilled continuous corn changed to continuous no-till corn (Zea mays; CR) with the residue removed. Over a three-year transition period, biological indicators of soil health included microbial biomass and community structure profile using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biochemical markers, and an assessment of the saprotrophic fungal diversity using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction amplified ITS rRNA genetic marker. Over the course of the transition, bacterial biomass dominated soils in the annual systems of CC, R1, R2, CR and SG, and the perennial system of MS. While fungal biomass dominated soils under PR. Fungal PLFA signatures and ITS-DGGE profiles demonstrated similarity between PR and the transitioned SW system, and to a lesser extent SG. In contrast, MS did not statistically alter the microbial biomass, community structure or fungal diversity away from patterns observed in the corn-soybean system. Our findings support microbial community stability and resilience as we found no negative impacts in any of the biomass recovery systems (PR, MS, SG, SW and CR) relative to the traditional systems (CC, R1 and R2), as indicated by measures of soil health. We did find that the selection of the plant types used in the biomass system could have a significant impact on the structure of both bacterial and fungal communities. With respect to soil health indicators including the fungal community, our findings suggest the dual-purpose SG system provides an encouraging alternative to continuous maize when considering plant biomass production. The selection of this dedicated perennial biomass system offers an avenue to enhance indicators of soil health and associated ecosystem services while supporting the bioenergy economy. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cassava stem is found to be one of few crop residues containing starch (up to 42% of dry mass) that may be converted to fuel ethanol. The current study was to evaluate the influence of parameters genotype, growth location and harvest time on cassava stem starch contents and yields as well as consequences in ethanol production (non-cellulosic process), based on 180 samples from a full factorial design experiment (3 varieties×3 locations×5 harvest times) in Guangxi, China. The potential utilization of stem starch and soluble sugar that varied 14-42% and 3-12.1% of dry mass, respectively, can correspond to an increase of 26% in ethanol production compared to that produced by roots only. The cassava stem starch content was significantly affected by all three studied parameters and location had the largest effect followed by variety and harvest time, while the stem starch yield was significantly affected by location only. The starch and soluble sugar content were significantly correlated with soil properties, e.g., soil pH and organic carbon, S and P contents. A general and positive correlation was also found between the stem and root starch, suggesting a promising potential of using stem starch without reducing root starch production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil wind erosion is a serious concern in agricultural regions. Wind erosion is of particular concern in Northeast China where a north continental monsoon climate is prevalent and land is prepared for seeding using an ancient ridge culture technique. Cultural reluctance to adopting a cropping strategy that leaves residues is also based on local population use of corn stalks as animal fodder and fuel. In order to evaluate the conservation effects of standing residue on controlling soil wind erosion, a 4-year study (2011-2014) was conducted near Changchun city in Northeast China. Four experimental treatments were used: un-fixed corn residue coverage (shattering/cutting the corn stalks into small sections and spreading them on the soil surface) and three treatments with the standing corn residue of different height for each treatment; 30-, 40- and 50-cm.11The treatment with soil surface covered with small pieces of un-fixed, loose corn residue is designated as PA. The 30-cm high standing corn residue treatment is designated as PB; 40-cm treatment as PC; and 50-cm treatment as PD. Saltation probability is designated as Pi. The corn stalk residue above that which remained in each treatment was removed from the field as much as practical. The standing residue treatments also resulted in some soil coverage by fugitive leaves and small stalk pieces. The experimental design was four treatments replicated four times, with years as replicates. Soil loss from the un-fixed corn residue coverage treatment and soil sediment from the standing residue coverage treatments was measured. Standing residue with the heights of 30-, 40- and 50-cm increased mean aerodynamic roughness length (equivalent to the height at which the wind speed theoretically becomes zero) by 19.87, 43.77 and 61.62, respectively, and increased mean threshold wind speed by 11, 25 and 33%, respectively. Mean monthly soil loss mass balance for un-fixed corn residue was 1.27Mgha-1, and the mean monthly values for soil sediment mass balance were 0.725, 1.088 and 1.967Mgha-1 for 30-, 40- and 50-cm standing residue treatments, respectively. These experiments indicate that standing residue conservation management can act as an effective way to control soil wind erosion, while providing a portion of corn stalks for the local population to continue using as animal fodder and fuel. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - In this paper, we analyse the opinions, attitudes and willingness of consumers to pay for biodiesel as an alternative to diesel in Barcelona province. Data were gathered from face-to-face structured questionnaires from 300 diesel car owners/users that regularly purchase fuel. A variation of the traditional choice experiments (CE) was used by excluding the price attribute from the design. In a subsequent contingent valuation (CV) exercise, respondents were asked to state their maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for their preferred choice sets using the "payment card" format. The relative importance of the attributes and levels were calculated by estimating a random parameter logit model. The results demonstrated, contrary to the literature in Spain, that consumers were not willing to pay for biodiesel, especially when its production may negatively affect food prices. The main limitation was that car manufacturers do not recommend its use as it may lead to engine failure. The public authorities are asked to work jointly with the automotive industry to address this drawback. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable and inexpensive production of biomass is necessary to make biofuel production feasible, but represents a challenge. Five short rotation coppice willow cultivars, selected for high biomass yield, were cultivated on sites at four diverse regions of Quebec in contrasting environments. Wood composition and anatomical traits were characterized. Tree height and stem diameter were measured to evaluate growth performance of the cultivars according to the diverse pedoclimatic conditions. Each cultivar showed very specific responses to its environment. While no significant variation in lignin content was observed between sites, there was variation between cultivars. Surprisingly, the pattern of substantial genotype variability in stem density was maintained across all sites. However, wood anatomy did differ between sites in a cultivar (producing high and low density wood), suggesting a probable response to an abiotic stress. Furthermore, twice as many cellulose-rich G-fibers, comprising over 50% of secondary xylem, were also found in the high density wood, a finding with potential to bring higher value to the lignocellulosic bioethanol industry. © 2015 Berthod, Brereton, Pitre and Labrecque.

AB  - Cleome viscosa, a neglected crop grows as a weed along roadsides, wastelands and other degraded areas in various warmer parts of the world including India. In spite of this, several local communities in India use it as a green leafy vegetable and its seed as condiment. Used in ayurvedic system of medicine for activities like anthelminthic, analgesic, antipyretic, antidiarrhoeal, anticonvulsant, hepatoprotective, antibacterial, insecticidal, repellent, nematicidal, allelopathic and antimicrobial, its pharmaceutical value is intensifying day by day. The agro-economical value initiated is restricted to Himalayan region and needs to be implemented on larger scale. In this background, a holistic approach is required in disseminating the traditional knowledge, cultivation and marketing practices and conducting in-depth research studies to improve overall scenario of economic and food security. Knowledge of high fecundity (fruit and seed set) and the sex expression in improving the recently explored biodiesel potential has been discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: Camelina sativa is an oilseed crop with great potential for biofuel production on marginal land. The seed oil from camelina has been converted to jet fuel and improved fuel efficiency in commercial and military test flights. Hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel from camelina is environmentally superior to that from canola due to lower agricultural inputs, and the seed meal is FDA approved for animal consumption. However, relatively low yield makes its farming less profitable. Our study is aimed at increasing camelina seed yield by reducing carbon loss from photorespiration via a photorespiratory bypass. Genes encoding three enzymes of the Escherichia coli glycolate catabolic pathway were introduced: glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), glyoxylate carboxyligase (GCL) and tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). These enzymes compete for the photorespiratory substrate, glycolate, convert it to glycerate within the chloroplasts, and reduce photorespiration. As a by-product of the reaction, CO2 is released in the chloroplast, which increases photosynthesis. Camelina plants were transformed with either partial bypass (GDH), or full bypass (GDH, GCL and TSR) genes. Transgenic plants were evaluated for physiological and metabolic traits. Results: Expressing the photorespiratory bypass genes in camelina reduced photorespiration and increased photosynthesis in both partial and full bypass expressing lines. Expression of partial bypass increased seed yield by 50-57 %, while expression of full bypass increased seed yield by 57-73 %, with no loss in seed quality. The transgenic plants also showed increased vegetative biomass and faster development; they flowered, set seed and reached seed maturity about 1 week earlier than WT. At the transcriptional level, transgenic plants showed differential expression in categories such as respiration, amino acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism. The increased growth of the bypass transgenics compared to WT was only observed in ambient or low CO2 conditions, but not in elevated CO2 conditions. Conclusions: The photorespiratory bypass is an effective approach to increase photosynthetic productivity in camelina. By reducing photorespiratory losses and increasing photosynthetic CO2 fixation rates, transgenic plants show dramatic increases in seed yield. Because photorespiration causes losses in productivity of most C3 plants, the bypass approach may have significant impact on increasing agricultural productivity for C3 crops. © 2015 Dalal et al.

AB  - Miscanthus sinensis Anderss is a perennial C4-grass. It is a promising bioenergy plant, which has been proposed as general feedstock for biomass and lignocellulosic biofuel production. In this study, the flower and leaf buds transcriptomes of Miscanthus sinensis Anderss were sequenced by the platform of Illumina HiSeq™ 2000. In total 98326 Unigenes were generated by de novo assembly with an average length of 822 bp and N50 of 1023 bp. Based on the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, GO and COG databases (Evalue&lt;1e-5), 74134 (75.40%) Unigenes were annotated. A total of 45507 Unigenes were mapped into different GO terms. In KEGG pathways identification, 36710 sequences were assigned to 128 KEGG pathways. Sorghum bicolor (37731, 60.86%), Zea mays (16258, 26.22%), and Oryza sativa (3065, 4.94%) showed high similarity to Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. And 24 photosynthesis-related enzyme genes were identified. The result provides a foundation for further characterizing the functional genes in Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. © 2015 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved.

AB  - The impacts of biofuel production and the adequacy of the associated production structures are controversial matters despite a projected medium-term growth rate increase. Concurrently, electricity is increasingly perceived as a prerequisite for development. In this article, we assess the potential impacts of the local production of biofuels for electricity production on development and the food supply in the village of Laela in Western Tanzania. Based on a village survey, focus group discussions and expert interviews, we calculated the potential food security effects on four different economic types of farmer groups. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the potential use of sunflower and groundnut oils as substitutes for fossil fuels for the production of electricity. The baseline framework is based on a comparison of crop production data with current fossil fuel consumption. The ex-ante scenarios assess the gap between the estimated yield losses and the increasing fuel demand through 2015. These comparative analyses of schemes in which vegetable oil production replaces a given level of crop production showed that replacing food crops with crops producing biofuel will most likely impact local food security negatively, causing increased hunger, especially for the poorest farmers and even if climate change is not considered. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is cultivated especially by small-scale farm households as a bioenergy plant, but also as a supporting plant for spice production such as vanilla and black pepper. With the increasing worldwide demand for both biofuel and spices, Jatropha cultivation is expected to expand in the future. To explore its role in rural households’ livelihood strategies, a factor, cluster and a multinomial logit regression analysis were conducted using household data from rural Tanzania. Three different livelihood strategies were identified: (1) “subsistence farm households combined with unskilled wage employment”, (2) “farm households highly specialized in cash crop production”, and (3) “farm households specialized in cash crop production combined with skilled off-farm employment”. While households from Cluster 3 are better-off, those from Cluster 1 are the poorest. The income from cultivation of Jatropha/spices is significantly higher for the third cluster. However, for poorer households of Cluster 1, the share of income from Jatropha/spices has been quite significant with up to 30 %. The result of the multinomial logit regression analysis identifies human and financial capital, transaction costs and institutional factors explaining differences in livelihood portfolios. The results help shaping and targeting interventions to improve livelihood strategies of the rural poor in Tanzania. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The global demand for palm oil has increased sharply in the past and is expected to double over the coming decades. Land use changes resulting from the concomitant expansion of oil palm cultivation have caused further deforestation, which in turn has had a severely negative impact on the environment and climate. Sustainable intensification strategies are therefore required to meet the growing demand for palm oil while simultaneously improving farm household incomes, increasing food security and self-sufficiency. Palm oil production in Africa and especially in Tanzania is dominated by small-scale subsistence farming systems that are characterised by low productivity and low yields, even in regions with the most suitable cultivation conditions. By conducting stakeholder interviews, focus-group discussions and a household survey, we analysed palm oil production in the Western Tanzanian Province of Kigoma in order to gain a more complete picture of oil palm farming in smallholder systems and to better understand how smallholders evaluate certain options for the intensification of palm oil production. We identified and evaluated locally existing best practices from the farmers’ perspective and identified factors which may have a positive impact on production levels. Our case study sites are characterised by large oil palm plantations that have been operating since colonial times. Also examined were farm plots with an average of 35.7 palm oil trees per acre. Palms are cultivated to produce edible vegetable oil and are used for firewood. The results indicate large differences between output levels that result from the agricultural management practice employed (e.g. using hybrid varieties, sub-optimal planting densities and low weeding or organic fertilising inputs). The processing technology used in the households examined was not conducive for changing the situation from low to high yields and productivity levels. A shift from subsistence to market-orientated production generates income opportunities for farmers and helps meet the ever-increasing demand for palm oil. Our results indicate that an improved small-scale palm oil production system, including agroforestry or mixed cropping and general intensification of plant maintenance, may increase yields without putting additional pressure on natural forests—a step towards ensuring palm oil is produced in a supply chain that avoids deforestation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is an oil-bearing semi-evergreen shrub or small tree with potential as a source of sustainable biofuel, yet information regarding vegetative and fruit biomass in relation to plant architecture is lacking. Research conducted in Indonesia used the tree based functional branch analysis (FBA) model as a non-destructive method to estimate above and belowground biomass, and plant architecture. The FBA utility for shrubs was unknown and required modification. This research used destructive measurements to validate modifications to the FBA model that included sub-categorisation of the tapering coefficient for twig, branch, and wood diameter classes, and addition of a fruit load parameter in the distal link. The modified FBA model confirmed jatropha to be a shrub rather than a tree, producing variable estimates for aboveground biomass. This variation was due to morphological plasticity in the length–diameter relationship of the branches that diverged from fractal branching architecture. Fruit biomass variation between replicates was not well estimated and total proximal root diameter was a poor predictor of total root biomass, due to the proximal roots having enlarged water storage structures that do not follow fractal branching assumptions. Jatropha fruit was shown to predominate on twigs with a diameter between 0.9 and 1.4 cm. Understanding the correlation between fruit development and plant architecture will be necessary for fine-tuning the FBA model for future commercial breeding and selection. The high degree of morphological plasticity displayed by jatropha requires consideration when determining plant biomass. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgae have been proposed as a promising source for biodiesel production. Focusing on algal strains for biodiesel production, efforts should be made to search new strains. Experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of growth parameters (nutrients, pH, light, aeration and temperature) and the oil percentage of eight algal strains (Chlorella sp., Cladophora sp., Hydrodictylium sp., Oedogonium sp., Oscillatoria sp., Spirogyra sp., Stigeocolonium sp., Ulothrix sp.). Results show that 6.5-7.5 is the optimum pH for the growth of all algal species. Temperature showed a greater variation (25°40°C). Ulothrix sp. gave more biomass productivity and is the most suitable strain for biodiesel production due to higher oil percentage (62%). Least biomass production was observed for Stigeocolonium sp. and least oil content was obtained from Hydrodictylium sp. It was observed that among these eight algal strains for biodiesel production, Ulothrix and Chlorella are the most promising algae species. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Oak trees are biodiversity hotspots in many landscapes and provide habitats for several organism groups, including species that are rare or threatened by extinction. Oak regeneration in the northern hemisphere is often poor, which is a serious problem in many oak-rich conservation forests. Competition from other vegetation and browsing by ungulates are two factors that limit oak regeneration. In 13 mixed oak-rich forests with high values for biodiversity we tested conservation-oriented thinning. Trees and shrubs were harvested for biofuel, but the main aim was to favour oak regeneration and biodiversity. On average, 23% of the initial basal area was removed during the winter 2002/2003. After thinning, we set up exclosures to protect oak seedlings from browsing. In 2012, after ten growing seasons, the exclosures had favoured regeneration of oak by reducing ungulate browsing, though the effect was weak. Tall oak saplings (<130. cm) were present in exclosures at five sites, and no such new stems were recorded in control plots with browsing. These five sites were characterized by higher canopy openness, and probably higher light availability, compared to the other sites. Other broadleaves, and especially shrubs, increased much more in density and height than oaks, in both exclosures and control plots. Thus, conservation-oriented thinning in combination with fences to protect oak seedlings from browsing ungulates, increased oak regeneration in the mixed conservation forests, but control of competing understory vegetation in exclosures is probably also needed. © 2015.

AB  - Mainconclusion: Analysis of 180 accessions of Miscanthus using a DArT platform revealed high diversity. The phylogenetic analysis revealed thatM. × giganteusaccessions fall into two genetically distinct groups. Miscanthus is a genus of perennial rhizomatous grasses that has emerged in last 20 years as a feedstock for bioenergy and biofuel production. Currently, the most widely used accession for bioenergy purposes is Miscanthus × giganteus, a sterile triploid hybrid between Miscanthussinensis and Miscanthussacchariflorus. However, previous reports have shown that genetic diversity of Miscanthus × giganteus is limited. Here, we report development of Diversity Arrays Technology platform for the analysis of genetic structure of a Miscanthus collection of 180 accessions. A total of 906 markers were obtained of which around 25.5 % exhibited polymorphism information content value in the range of 0.40 and 0.50 and are considered particularly informative. Newly developed marker system will serve as an additional resource to assist crop improvement, germplasm preservation and genetic studies. Three types of analysis indicated that 180 accessions from the collection were well differentiated and presented high diversity. Interestingly, the analysis revealed that there are two separate groups of plants, significantly differing in genetic diversity, that are commercially available as M. × giganteus. We suggest that one of these groups is most likely mutants or somaclonal variants of original M. × giganteus. The other group is recent hybrids of Miscanthus of higher genetic diversity. This study indicates that the diversity of commercially available M. × giganteus is higher than commonly assumed. Development of the new marker system can significantly assist breeding of new commercial cultivars of Miscanthus for bioenergy use. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A growing and more affluent human population is expected to increase the demand for resources and to accelerate habitat modification, but by how much and where remains unknown. Here we project and aggregate global spatial patterns of expected urban and agricultural expansion, conventional and unconventional oil and gas, coal, solar, wind, biofuels and mining development. Cumulatively, these threats place at risk 20% of the remaining global natural lands (19.68 million km2) and could result in half of the world's biomes becoming &gt;50% converted while doubling and tripling the extent of land converted in South America and Africa, respectively. Regionally, substantial shifts in land conversion could occur in Southern and Western South America, Central and Eastern Africa, and the Central Rocky Mountains of North America. With only 5% of the Earth's at-risk natural lands under strict legal protection, estimating and proactively mitigating multi-sector development risk is critical for curtailing the further substantial loss of nature. © 2015 Oakleaf et al.

AB  - Wheat is a dominant crop in temperate countries and is being used as human food and livestock feed. The success of wheat depends partly on its adaptability and high yield potential, and also on the gluten protein fraction, which confers the visco-elastic properties that allows its dough to be processed into bread, pasta, noodles and other food products. In terms of human diet, it contributes nutritional factors, beneficial phytochemicals and dietary fibre components. The present review deals with current and future concerns that include sustaining the wheat production and quality with reduced inputs of agrochemicals, and developing lines with enhanced quality for specific end-uses, notably for biofuels and human nutrition.

AB  - The largest production of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) focuses on Bahia savanna, where the change of land use to their cultivation has been considered a strategy of degraded areas recovery. However, changes in the native soil can arise environmental impacts as greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. We have assumed that higher GHG emissions come from a change of land use for castor bean cultivation and their subproducts contribute to GHG emissions. The objective of this study was to make the inventory of the emission of GHG resulting from the castor bean cultivation and their sub-products. It was done a study in the municipality of Irecê-BA and were evaluated: changes in carbon (C) soil stocks in cultivated areas with castor bean and Local native forest; a number of senescent leaves and the biomass produced epigeal; GHG emissions from the subproducts of castor bean. The results showed that the sum of senescent leaves and epigeal biomass obtained by castor bean pruning is more than 1.6 Mg ha-1ano-1 and the castor bean residues used in this soil presented N2O emissions close to 600 μg m-2. The emissions from the use of castor oil biodiesel represented less than 10% of the emissions. The change in land use handled high emissions of greenhouse gases, accounting for 87% of the total in CO2eq. Compared to emissions estimated for sugarcane ethanol, castor biodiesel showed emissions 32% lower. © 2015, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid. All right rserved.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass - such as wood, agricultural residues or dedicated energy crops - is a promising renewable feedstock for production of fuels and chemicals that is available at large scale at low cost without direct competition for food usage. Its biochemical conversion in a sugar platform biorefinery includes three main unit operations that are illustrated in this review: the physico-chemical pretreatment of the biomass, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the carbohydrates to a fermentable sugar stream by cellulases and finally the fermentation of the sugars by suitable microorganisms to the target molecules. Special emphasis in this review is put on the technology, commercial status and future prospects of the production of second-generation fuel ethanol, as this process has received most research and development efforts so far. Despite significant advances, high enzyme costs are still a hurdle for large scale competitive lignocellulosic ethanol production. This could be overcome by a strategy termed 'consolidated bioprocessing' (CBP), where enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation is integrated in one step - either by utilizing one genetically engineered superior microorganism or by creating an artificial co-culture. Insight is provided on both CBP strategies for the production of ethanol as well as of advanced fuels and commodity chemicals. © 2015 Schweizerische Chemische Gesellschaft.

AB  - The food crisis of 2007–08 generated widespread global concerns about land consolidation and agricultural transition, with renewed attention on foreign land investments and growing global markets for meat and biofuels. As part of and alongside this process, agriculture and land-use projects registered in the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) continued to rise, representing almost a third of global projects and almost 50% of projects in Latin America. In this paper we conduct an analysis of the sustainable development claims of Latin American CDM projects, focusing particularly on their implications for land consolidation, regional food security, and agrarian justice. Our analysis suggests that in Latin America those benefiting most from the development and sale of carbon-offset projects have, to date, been large-scale corporations investing in industrial carbon projects such as large tree plantations, sugarcane, and large-scale, export-oriented livestock production. As such, we argue that the carbonization of agriculture through the CDM serves as a driver of ‘global green grabbing’ and that the scope and financialization of CDM projects in the agriculture and forestry sectors in Latin America may contribute to the maintenance of an agrarian system of ‘climate injustice’ rather than foster sustainable development across the region. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Utilization of the agricultural residues as lignocellulosic biomass should involve economical processes. Accordingly, it is not enough to produce biofuel from the agricultural residues but one should develop chemical/biochemical processes which produce valuable platform chemicals, as well. This paper gives a brief survey on the possible future processes focusing on the Central Europe. Such kind of technological processes should be developed in the next future in this region in order to make the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass profitable.

AB  - Algal biofuels are considered to be the only biomass-based fuel capable of producing the global fuel demand in terms of land constraint. However, its sustainable production and commercialization have been criticized with respect to its environmental impact, energy requirement, and economic potential. Hence, a viable approach to address such a concern is through synergistic networks between multiple industries in an eco-industrial park framework. Applying the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS), it enables the collaborative exchange of by-products and energy surplus between companies leading to inter-industry benefits. An algal bioenergy park (ABP) is a special example of an eco-industrial park focusing on algal biofuel production. It consists of anchor tenants and support tenants. The former are industries which comprise the core companies of the ABP while the latter are the considered industries which may complement the core companies in the production of algal biofuels. To encourage mutual benefit between companies in the ABP, satisfaction of individual targets such as production level and profitability must be met. Thus, a fuzzy mathematical programming approach is proposed in this study for the optimal design of an ABP with multiple conflicting objectives. The results revealed that in considering the support tenants, the annual profit of the ABP increased by 220 % with a considerable amount of increase in the environmental emissions. The results of the study provide a rational basis for negotiations, signing contracts, and agreements between firms in an ABP. A hypothetical but realistic case study is presented to illustrate the developed model. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - The behavior of tritium contained in the biofuel produced by the fusion energy is analyzed. Hydrogen product is contaminated with tritium from breeding blanket of fusion plant within the regulation limit and released to atmosphere when used for fuel cell vehicles. In the model city, Osaka, seven-compartment model describes the behavior of exhausted tritium by adapting the environment water flow and its migration was analyzed with STELLA system dynamics code. Tritium (HTO) with a concentration of 5000 Bq//m3 exhausted from the running vehicle increases decades and reaches steady state after about 50 years, at around 40 Bq/m3 in atmosphere and 4 Bq/L in surface soil water that does not deserve health hazard, however causes contamination of large populated area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to assess the sanitary situation in agricultural biogas plants (BP) regarding pathogenic Clostridium spp. Methods and Results: The incidence of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium haemolyticum, Clostridium septicum and Clostridium chauvoei was investigated in 154 plant and animal substrates, digester sludges and digestates from full-scale BP using a method combining microbial enrichment with Real-Time PCR. The investigated clostridia were absent in the samples, except for Cl. novyi that was barely present (3·9%) and Cl. difficile that was more frequently detected (44·8%). Clostridium botulinum exposed to lab-scale digesters in sentinel chambers was reduced with D-values of 34·6 ± 11·2 days at 38°C and 1·0 ± 0·2 days at 55°C. Conclusions: These findings indicate minor relevance of clostridial pathogens in BP and an improved sanitary quality of the digestion product compared to untreated substrates concerning Cl. botulinum. However, the frequent detection of Cl. difficile opens questions on the durability of this organism in manure digestion lines. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study providing data on the reduction of Cl. botulinum during biogas processes that scientifically invalidate contrary claims by some media in the public. Furthermore, the results improve the fragmentary knowledge on the prevalence of several clostridial pathogens in agricultural biogas production. © 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has an estimated annual population growth rate of 2.7% making it the highest globally. More than two thirds of the over 800 million people in the region stay in rural areas where they depend on subsistence agriculture. Socio-economic instability, poor soil fertility and unreliable rainfall result in poor crop yields. This exposes the vulnerable to food insecurity and inadequate nutrient intake. Malnutrition is not restricted to undernutrition as in the urban areas the adoption of diets rich in carbohydrates and fats also poses health problems associated with obesity. Malnutrition causes derangements in the immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to and severity of infections among the affected population. In SSA, indigenous fruit bearing trees (IFBTs) are treasured sources of macro- and micro-nutrients, and health promoting phytochemicals. The phytochemicals have biological and pharmacological activities that mitigate some of the physiological effects of malnutrition. In this paper, the contribution of IFBTs such as Uapaca kirkiana and Adansonia digitata to household food security, rural economy and community health are highlighted. Examples of community-based projects dependent on fruit from IFBTs are given. Using this evidence the need for unlocking the seemingly hidden potential contribution of the genetically diverse IFBTs to food security is highlighted. In this regard, research should focus on how to tap into health benefits of oils from IFBTs seeds. Residual cakes from oil extraction could be developed into biofuels, bio-fertilisers and animal feed ingredients. Fruit pulp could be exploited to produce more health-promoting natural sweeteners and pectins for industrial use. This beneficiation and value addition of products from IFBTs over and above contributing to the enhancement of household food security and the rural economy would translate into increased community-based sustainable utilisation and conservation of IFBTs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes has been promoted as a key strategy to conserve biodiversity. Animal response to grassland heterogeneity resulting from spatiotemporal variation in disturbance is well documented; however, the degree to which edaphic variation generates heterogeneity detectable by grassland wildlife has proven more difficult to study in natural settings. We conducted a field experiment to study how soils directly affect vegetation structure and composition and indirectly affect bird and butterfly assemblages using plantings of tallgrass prairie species managed as agroenergy crops in Iowa, USA. The experimental design included four vegetation treatments of varying species richness replicated on three soil types. Habitat characteristics varied widely among soils. Crops on sandy loam, the driest, most acidic soil with the lowest nutrient content, developed shorter, less dense vegetation with sparse litter accumulation and more bare ground compared to crops on loam and clay loam. Birds and butterflies responded similarly to soil-induced variation in habitat characteristics. Their abundance and species richness were similar on all soils, but their assemblage compositions varied among soils in certain vegetation treatments. In low-diversity grass crops, bird assemblages using sandy loam were dominated by species preferring open ground and sparse vegetation for foraging and nesting, whereas assemblages using loam and clay loam were dominated by birds preferring tall, dense vegetation with abundant litter. In high-diversity prairie crops, the species composition of forbs in bloom varied among soils and strongly influenced butterfly assemblages. Synthesis and applications. Prairie agroenergy crops established with identical management practices developed variable habitat characteristics due to natural edaphic variation, and this heterogeneity influenced the spatial distribution of bird and butterfly assemblages due to differential habitat use among species. This finding suggests that if unfertilized prairie crops were grown for agroenergy by land managers large-scale, soil-induced habitat heterogeneity would promote wildlife diversity within and among fields, further increasing the habitat value of these crops compared to the fertilized, annual monocultures that currently dominate the agricultural landscape. Our study also highlights the need for managers to consider soil properties when selecting sites to restore grassland habitat for species of conservation concern.

AB  - The capacity of urban areas to deliver provisioning ecosystem services is commonly overlooked and underutilized. Urban populations have globally increased fivefold since 1950, and they disproportionately consume ecosystem services and contribute to carbon emissions, highlighting the need to increase urban sustainability and reduce environmental impacts of urban dwellers. Here, we investigated the potential for increasing carbon sequestration, and biomass fuel production, by planting trees and short-rotation coppice (SRC), respectively, in a mid-sized UK city as a contribution to meeting national commitments to reduce CO2 emissions. Iterative GIS models were developed using high-resolution spatial data. The models were applied to patches of public and privately owned urban greenspace suitable for planting trees and SRC, across the 73 km2 area of the city of Leicester. We modelled tree planting with a species mix based on the existing tree populations, and SRC with willow and poplar to calculate biomass production in new trees, and carbon sequestration into harvested biomass over 25 years. An area of 11 km2 comprising 15% of the city met criteria for tree planting and had the potential over 25 years to sequester 4200 tonnes of carbon above-ground. Of this area, 5·8 km2 also met criteria for SRC planting and over the same period this could yield 71 800 tonnes of carbon in harvested biomass. The harvested biomass could supply energy to over 1566 domestic homes or 30 municipal buildings, resulting in avoided carbon emissions of 29 236 tonnes of carbon over 25 years when compared to heating by natural gas. Together with the net carbon sequestration into trees, a total reduction of 33 419 tonnes of carbon in the atmosphere could be achieved in 25 years by combined SRC and tree planting across the city. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that urban greenspaces in a typical UK city are underutilized for provisioning ecosystem services by trees and especially SRC, which has high biomass production potential. For urban greenspace management, we recommend that planting SRC in urban areas can contribute to reducing food-fuel conflicts on agricultural land and produce renewable energy sources close to centres of population and demand.

AB  - Protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase (LigAB) catalyzes dioxygenation of multiple lignin derived aromatic compounds - such as protocatechuate (PCA), gallate (GA) and 3-O-methyl gallate (3OMG) - with decreasing proficiency as the molecule size increases. We predicted that phenylalanine-103 of the α subunit (Phe103α) controls substrate specificity through interaction with the C5-funtionality of bound substrates, and mutagenesis would enhance GA and 3OMG catalysis. LigAB with Phe103α mutations (F103V, F103T and F103H) displayed enhanced catalytic efficiency for dioxygenation of 3OMG, with mutants displaying 12- to 31-fold increases in kcatapp/Kmapp, making these mutant enzymes more active with 3OMG than its native dioxygenase (DesZ). The F103T and F103V point mutants also exhibited allosteric activation for the dioxygenation of PCA and GA, respectively, in the presence of vanillin, as previously observed for LigAB. The enhanced utilization of substrates by these mutants makes them potentially useful for efforts to develop engineered organisms that catabolize lignin into biofuels or fine chemicals. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The area used for bioenergy feedstock production is increasing because substitution of fossil fuels by bioenergy is promoted as an option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, agriculture itself contributes to rising atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) concentrations. In this study we tested whether the net exchanges of N2O and CH4 between soil and atmosphere differ between annual fertilized and perennial unfertilized bioenergy crops. We measured N2O and CH4 soil fluxes from poplar short rotation coppice (SRC), perennial grass-clover and annual bioenergy crops (silage maize, oilseed rape, winter wheat) in two central German regions for two years. In the second year after establishment, the N2O emissions were significantly lower in SRC (&lt;0.1 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) than grassland (0.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) and the annual crop (winter wheat; 1.5 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) at one regional site (Reiffenhausen). However, a different trend was observed in the first year when contents of mineral nitrogen were still higher in SRC due to former cropland use. At the other regional site (Gierstädt), N2O emissions were generally low (&lt;0.5 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) and no crop-type effects were detected. Net uptake of atmospheric CH4 varied between 0.4 and 1.2 kg CH4-C ha-1 yr-1 with no consistent crop-type effect. The N2O emissions related to gross energy in the harvested biomass ranged from 0.07 to 6.22 kg CO2 equ GJ-1. In both regions, Gierstädt (low N2O emissions) and more distinct Reiffenhausen (medium N2O emissions), this energy yield-related N2O emission was the lowest for SRC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to design two types of subsidies for biofuel feedstock production and water quality improvement and to analyze how each subsidy affects biomass supply and the abatement of nutrient runoff associated with the conversion of cropland to biomass production. Per-hectare (per-ha) subsidy was designed as a system that pays producers for each ha of cropland converted to switchgrass production and per-megagram (per-Mg) subsidy was a system that pays producers for each Mg of switchgrass produced. This study focuses on Oostanaula Creek watershed in East Tennessee. The analysis used a dynamic programming model coupled with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation model to predict profit-maximizing fertilizer application rates, crop yields, and nitrogen (N) runoff for a biofuel feedstock (switchgrass) and a conventional crop (corn) across 28 different landscapes in the watershed. A Monte Carlo analysis was conducted to simulate the impact of stochastic N fertilizer and corn prices and yields on subsidies over a ten-year planning horizon. A per-ha subsidy system is more cost effective and feasible than a per-Mg system because the former has significantly lower subsidy than the latter for each kilogram (kg) of N reduction and for each Mg of switchgrass harvested. Converting all of the cropland from corn to switchgrass over ten years results in 124,084 dry Mg of switchgrass and 23% reduction in nitrogen runoff for the per-ha system and 122,347 dry Mg of switchgrass and 3% reduction for the per-Mg subsidy system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sorghum is regarded a promising bioenergy crop and may be an alternative to maize for biogas use in temperate Europe in the near future. Presently, the principal shortcoming compared to maize besides chilling sensitivity during juvenile development is that current sorghum varieties fail to combine a high dry matter yield with adequate dry matter content for silage and satisfying methane yield. Our major goal was to evaluate whether early-maturing silage type Sorghum bicolor hybrids with a higher contribution of panicles and grains to total dry matter may allow an improvement of methane yield, representing a novel, alternative variety type for biogas use in temperate Europe. Our results indicate that under adequate conditions, they reach higher dry matter contents. Due to enhanced methane yields per dry matter unit which offset slightly lower dry matter yields, their methane yield per area unit is similar or superior to existing biomass type varieties. Since panicles account for up to 50% of total dry matter yield, seed set and maturity in cool environments represent critical factors for yield stability. Breeding efforts focus on chilling tolerance during flowering to avoid male sterility and on the development of appropriate parental lines combining earliness and adequate height. While selection for maturity can be reliably conducted on per se performance of parental lines, hybrid yield is predominantly determined by general combining ability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many parts of the eastern African region wood-based fuels will remain dominant sources of energy in coming decades. Pressure on forests, especially in semi-arid areas will therefore continue increasing. In this context, the role of liquid biofuels as substitutes for firewood and charcoal, to help reducing pressure on woody biomass and contributing to a better energy security of rural communities, has remained controversial among researchers and practitioners. At household level, the economic and technical feasibility of straight vegetable oil (SVO) was assessed mainly on Jatropha curcas, with unpersuasive results. So far nothing is known about the suitability as an energy carrier of Jatropha mahafalensis Jum. & H. Perrier, the only endemic representative of the Jatropha genus in Madagascar. This paper explores the potential of this plant as a biofuel feedstock in the agro-pastoral area of Soalara, in the semi-arid south-western part of Madagascar. Only hedge-based production was considered to rule out competition over land with food crops. Yield data, the length of currently existing hedges and energy consumption patterns of households were used to assess the quantitative potential and economic viability of J. mahafalensis SVO for lighting and cooking. Tests were conducted with cooking and lighting devices to assess their technical suitability at household level. The paper concludes that J. mahafalensis hedges have some potential to replace paraffin for lighting (though without much economic benefit for the concerned households), but not to replace charcoal or firewood for cooking. The paper recommends that rural energy strategies in similar contexts do not focus only on substituting current fuels with SVO, but should also take into consideration other alternatives. In the case of cooking, there seems to be substantially more potential in increasing the efficiency of current fuel production and consumption technologies (kilns and stoves); and in the case of lighting, solutions based on SVO need to be compared against other options such as portable solar devices. © 2015.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. leaf litter decomposition and subsequent nutrient release was monitored in three experimental J. curcas plantations in Zambia, comparing accessions from six countries, pruned versus non-pruned and different plant spacings. Leaf litter production was low (267-536 kg ha-1 at the end of the growing season) and contained, on average, 1.23% N, 0.14% P and 2.61% K. Litter decomposed rapidly, losing 80% of total mass between 70 and 105 days after incubation in the field and followed a negative exponential pattern with an average decomposition constant, k, of 0.08 week-1. No significant effects of plant accession, plant spacing or pruning on the decomposition rate were detected. K, P, Mg and Na had nutrient release rates exceeding mass loss, explained by their high mobility and solubility, together with high soil temperature and rainfall conditions. Others, such as Ca and Mn, were initially retained in the decaying leaf litter before later release. The rate of N release closely approached that of mass loss. J. curcas litter can be a supplemental source of nutrients in areas known for nutrient deficiency and low organic matter, which represents an additional input in intercropping systems above biofuel production. Considering that the total primary nutrient input through J. curcas litterfall to the soil is limited (for example, for nitrogen between 9.7 and 14.2 g kg-1 and for phosphorus between 0.8 and 1.9 g kg-1), organic or mineral fertilizer application remains crucial to satisfy fully the nutrient requirements of surrounding crops. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The sickle bush (Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight &amp; Arn.) comprises a woody legume shrub which is widely distributed throughout of the tropical areas of Africa, Asia and Oceania, being found as well in Cuba where it represents a difficult to control invasive plant. It holds great silvopasture and energy crop potentials. In southwestern Spain a two year field trial was conducted contemplating also another six hardwood taxa commonly used as energy crops. The sickle bush above ground dry biomass fraction was 60.4%; sickle bush displayed a high transpiration rate during hot days (3.02 kg m-2 d-1 to 6.82 kg m-2 d-1); cold winter temperatures (&lt;-2 °C) together with hot and dry summer air (&lt;20% relative humidity) committed survival and growth. The physical-chemical wood properties and the pellets thereof derived were analyzed and compared to those of the other energy crop taxa. The within other woody species normal chemical composition range coupled to a high wood density and energetic use properties (19.2 MJ kg-1 higher heating value, 29 g kg-1 ash content) all allow for an industrial use. Pellets evidenced also good physical and mechanical properties (690 kg m-3 bulk density, 42 g kg-1 moisture content). However, the mechanical durability (93.9%) was slightly less than that required by the non-industrial use standards, therefore further improvements should be studied. All of the above could encourage scrubland cuts in Cuba as a mechanical control method, in addition to the expansion of plantations within of their tropical climate based natural habitats. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study estimates a supply of juniper from private lands to determine how much of the available juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook) can be economically supplied at alternative prices if a market was to develop for using juniper as a biomass source. While juniper is native to central Oregon, current land management practices have led to a significant increase in its density on much of the landscape. There could be potential benefits related to juniper removal for private landowners, as well as social benefits associated with water and habitat enhancement. At current densities, juniper on these private lands has negative impacts that diminish biodiversity, reduce forage grass and tie up water resources. The difference in the value of cattle productivity resulting from the presence of juniper as well as any forgone net returns from the sale of juniper to the biofuel industry reflects the opportunity cost to the rancher. This opportunity cost does not capture the complete opportunity cost associated with juniper removal since it does not incorporate the enhanced benefits of biodiversity and increased water availability, and thus reflects a lower bound. The supply curves for juniper as a source for biofuel shift in response to profitable harvesting coordination between landowners, the Oregon Biofuel Producer tax credit and increased positive externalities due to juniper removal. Because of restricted road networks the available source of juniper was limited by access - only 27% of the juniper area is on private rangelands, which is the focus of this report. This study identified supply costs under alternative business models and policy assumptions for an aggregate supply of 2.75. million. tonnes and illustrated an analytic technique that could be replicated in other areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents a new database of land use categories in Brazil at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second (about 1 km2). The spatial representation of current major land uses formally combines agricultural statistics from Brazil's latest census of the year 2006 at micro-region level and the Food and Agriculture Organization 2010 forest statistics with spatial land cover data sets. Spatial allocation ("downscaling") algorithms were applied to obtain a spatial distribution of seven major land use categories. Remaining shares in each grid-cell were termed residual land, and were categorized according to legal protection status, biodiversity value, and whether they belong to the territory of the Amazon biome. We found a total of 84 Mha residual land of which 37 Mha occurred outside the territory of the Amazon biome and was neither legally protected nor categorized as highly biodiverse land. The 37 Mha "available residual land" equates to 4.4% of Brazil's geographical area and to 50% of its current cultivated land area. We assessed land quality using the Agro-ecological Zones modelling framework provides land suitability and productivity estimates of the available residual land. Nearly one-third of land emerged of prime quality and is therefore promising for biofuel feedstock production. Analysis of potential food-fuel competition suggests that until 2030 productivity improvements on current pastures could accommodate land demand for Brazil's increasing cattle herd and expanding croplands. If these productivity increases could be achieved on current agricultural land, residual land could provide areas for the sustainable expansion of biofuel feedstock production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marginal land is proposed as viable land resources for biofuel production. However, environmental impacts of perennial biomass production on marginal lands is not clear. This study defined three marginal land types and assessed their availability and potential for biofuel production in the St. Joseph River watershed. The potential impacts were evaluated using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. The total area of marginal land was estimated to be 611 km2 covering 21.7% of the watershed. 161 and 207 million liters of bioethanol could be produced from the marginal land utilizing switchgrass and Miscanthus, respectively. Converting marginal land currently under corn/soybean production to switchgrass and Miscanthus reduced water yield by 13.4-36.3% and improved water quality by reducing soil erosion by 27%-98%. Similarly, total nitrogen losses were reduced by 30-91% and total phosphorus losses were reduced by 65-76%, respectively, at the field scales under various energy crop production scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Yields, water use efficiency and economic returns (net farm revenues) of biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] were investigated over two years (2012 and 2014) under limited water resource conditions. Energy sorghum was grown under four water supply regimes: rain-fed (or dry-land, level 1), 50% (level 2), 75% (level 3) and 100% (level 4) of crop evapotranspiration rates (% ETc). Biomass yields ranged from 5.8 to 16.6Mgha-1 (dry weight) after 126 days of growth. Average water use efficiencies ranged from 3.95kgm-3 to 23.4kgm-3. Net return was approximately 410 $ ha-1 with water depths above 400ha-mm. These results suggest that it is possible to obtain more than 60Mgha-1 of sorghum biomass (wet basis) with at least 425mm of water. While biomass yield under irrigation was greater than rain-fed conditions, there were no significant differences among irrigation treatments. Biomass chemical composition did not differ significantly among water treatments suggesting that biofuel quality would not be affected by water deficits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The challenges associated with the availability of fossil fuels in the past decades intensified the search for alternative energy sources, based on an ever-increasing demand for energy. In this context, the application of anaerobic digestion (AD) as a core treatment technology in industrial plants should be highlighted, since this process combines the pollution control of wastewaters and the generation of bioenergy, based on the conversion of the organic fraction to biogas, a methane-rich gaseous mixture that may supply the energetic demands in industrial plants. In this context, this work aimed at assessing the energetic potential of AD applied to the treatment of stillage, the main wastewater from ethanol production, in an attempt to highlight the improvements in the energy balance ratio of ethanol by inserting the heating value of methane as a bioenergy source. At least 5-15% of the global energy consumption in the ethanol industry could be supplied by the energetic potential of stillage, regardless the feedstock (i.e. sugarcane, corn or cassava). The association between bagasse combustion and stillage anaerobic digestion in sugarcane-based distilleries could provide a bioenergy surplus of at least 130% of the total fossil fuel input into the ethanol plant, considering only the energy from methane. In terms of financial aspects, the economic gains could reach US$ 0.1901 and US$ 0.0512 per liter of produced ethanol, respectively for molasses- (Brazil) and corn-based (EUA) production chains. For large-scale (~1000 m3EtOH per day) Brazilian molasses-based plants, an annual economic gain of up to US$ 70 million could be observed. Considering the association between anaerobic and aerobic digestion, for the scenarios analyzed, at least 25% of the energetic potential of stillage would be required to supply the energy consumption with aeration, however, more suitable effluents for agricultural application could be produced. The main conclusion from this work indicates that anaerobic processes should be considered the core technology to treat stillage, based mainly on the attractive relation energy generation-financial return and on the possibility to keep the advantages inherent to the common fertigation when using the treated effluent in agriculture. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cultivation of Jatropha curcas in arid and semiarid non-cultivated areas could be a sustainable strategy for stimulating biofuel production without competing with food crops for land and water resources. J. curcas is considered a drought-tolerant species; however, the mechanisms that provide tolerance are unknown. Few efforts have been made to understand the connections between stomatal development and environment conditions. Here, we compared changes in stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index (SI) and their influence on gas exchange in J. curcas. Plants were cultivated in both rainy and dry regions. We describe a distinctive distribution of stomata under the adaxial and abaxial leaf epidermises, where higher SD may have caused the increase in stomatal conductance (gs) with positive effects on net photosynthetic rate (PN). However, when rain was excluded, the variation in gs was strongly related to vapour pressures deficit (VPD), and VPD was strongly related to the PN. Thus, our results suggest that J. curcas may also contribute mitigating the effect of CO2 deposition in the atmosphere, given that a remarkable change in SD and other leaf traits was observed in response to seasonal variations. Moreover, multivariate analysis highlights the high sensitivity of J. curcas plants to VPD which in turn induces rapid stomatal closure and consequent reduction of PN for long periods of time which reflect into a change in the pattern of development resulting in higher SI. These results can help us to understand the relationship between stomatal features and gas exchange in response to environment changes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second generation bioethanol obtained from native perennial grasses offers a promising alternative for biofuel production, avoiding land use competition for crops production. Spartina argentinensis is a native perennial C4 grass with high photosynthetic rates, well adapted to halo-hydromorphic soils, though its forage quality (palatability and digestibility) for livestock is quite low due to its high lignin content. Hence, cattle raisers burn these grasslands frequently in order to stimulate the emergence of new leaves with higher digestibility for cattle feeding. Lignin is the main barrier to overcome in order to efficiently hydrolyze the cellulose for bioethanol production. In this work, we evaluate different pretreatments (phosphoric acid, ligninolytic enzymes and fungal supernatants) aimed to remove lignin and improving cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. Results show that pretreatment with Pycnoporus sanguineus supernatant improves fermentable carbohydrates availability, compared with a conventional chemical pretreatment, and that 56.84% of cellulose can be hydrolyzed using this pretreatment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Improper management of cattle manure and poultry litter from confined animal farming are usually source of water pollution. However, appropriate application of these products on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) field can enhance biomass yield and promote nutrient recycling. We evaluated the effects of harvest frequency and nutrient sources on yield and quality of switchgrass for biofuel feedstock. The experiment was carried out at Perkins and Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma, from 2009 to 2011 using split plot design with four replications. The main plot treatments were two harvest frequencies single (June), and twice (June and November). The subplot treatments were nutrient sources: 1) cattle manure (CM), 2) poultry litter (PL), 3) urea (nitrogen at 150kg ha-1), 4) combined chemical fertilizer (nitrogen-P2O5-K2O) with nitrogen at 150kgha-1, P2O5 at 40kgha-1, and K2O at 20kgha-1, 5) inter-seeded Crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and 6) control. Mean biomass yield was higher (12.4Mgha-1) in 2010 than other years possibly due to optimum moisture and temperature in 2010. At Perkins in 2010, application of CM and PL increased biomass yield significantly by 30 and 23% compared with combined chemical fertilizer (12.9Mgha-1). The effect of nutrient sources on cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content was not significant at both locations. Cumulative biomass from twice harvest was similar to single harvest except in 2011 due to dry weather after the first cut. The cellulose and lignin content were significantly higher for single harvest compared with twice harvest at both locations. © 2015.

AB  - Despite environmental benefits of algal-biofuels, the energy-intensive systems for producing microalgae-feedstock may result in high GHG emissions. Trying to overcome energy-costs, this research analyzed the biodiesel production system via dry-route, based on Chlorella vulgaris cultivated in raceways, by comparing the GHG-footprints of diverse microalgae-biodiesel scenarios. These involved: the single system of biomass production (C0); the application of pyrolysis on the residual microalgal biomass (cake) from the oil extraction process (C1); the same as C0, with anaerobic cake co-digested with cattle manure (C2); the same conditions as in C1 and C2, by integrating in both cases (respectively C3 and C4), the microalgae cultivation with an autonomous ethanol distillery. The reduction of GHG emissions in scenarios with no such integration (C1 and C2), compared to CO, was insignificant (0.53% and 4.67%, respectively), whereas in the scenarios with integration with ethanol production system, the improvements were 53.57% for C3 and 63.84% for C4. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Europe, thanks to public subsidy, the production of electricity from anaerobic digestion (AD) of agricultural feedstock has considerably grown and several AD plants were built. When AD plants are concentrated in specific areas (e.g., Northern Italy), increases of feedstock' prices and transport distances can be observed. In this context, as regards low-energy density feedstock, the present research was designed to estimate the influence of the related long-distance transport on the environmental performances of the biogas-to-electricity process. For this purpose the following transport systems were considered: farm trailers and trucks.For small distances (<5. km), the whole plant silage shows the lowest impact; however, when distances increase, silages with higher energy density (even though characterised by lower methane production per hectare) become more environmentally sustainable. The transport by trucks achieves better environmental performances especially for distances greater than 25. km. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changes in direct soil organic carbon (SOC) can have a major impact on overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biofuels when using life-cycle assessment (LCA). Estimated changes in SOC, when accounted for in an LCA, are typically derived from near-surface soil depths (<30 cm). Changes in sub-surface soil depths (>30 cm) could have a large positive or negative impact on overall GHG emissions from biofuels that are not always accounted for. Here, we evaluate how sub-surface SOC changes impact biofuel GHG emissions for corn (. Zea mays L.) grain, corn stover, and switchgrass (. Panicum virgatum L.) using the (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in the Transportation) GREET model. Biofuel GHG emissions showed as much as a 154% difference between using near-surface SOC stocks changes only or when accounting for both near- and sub-surface SOC stock changes. Differences in GHG emissions highlight the importance of accounting for sub-surface SOC changes especially in bioenergy cropping systems with potential for soil C storage to deeper soil depths. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Independent but simultaneously occurring changes in U.S. agricultural and energy policies in conjunction with advances in biotechnology converged to create an economic and regulatory environment that incentivized corn acreage expansion. Advancements in Bt seed and ethanol production technologies contributed to scale efficiency gains in corn and biofuel production. These advancements were accompanied by changes in market forces that altered the balance between corn and other agricultural crop production. The causal linkages among Bt adoption, ethanol production, and corn production are explored along with a discussion of how this shift toward corn production generated unexpected economic and environmental consequences. Alternative policy solutions to mitigate the negative consequences and enhance the resiliency of U.S. agriculture are discussed. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - The mechanisms that assist in the reclamation of salt-affected soils in arid and semi-arid regions when treated with organic amendments have not been well characterized. In this experiment, the relative importance of biological and physiochemical mechanisms that aid in the reclamation of physical and chemical properties of a saline-sodic soil amended with composts and biochar were evaluated. Unsterilized and pre-sterilized soil and amendment mixtures were used to test the effects of biological and physiochemical factors. Soil and organic amendments were initially subjected to sterilization by autoclaving and gamma irradiation before incubation. Amendments were applied at a rate of 75tha-1 and treated soils were incubated for a month and then leached with reclaimed water. Soil physical and chemical characteristics such as wet aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity, cumulative Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ leached, soil pH, SAR, ECe, and ESP were analyzed. Results indicate that pre-sterilization significantly affected soil physical properties such as aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity only in compost-treated soils. Unsterilized compost-treated soils had significantly higher soil aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity than pre-sterilized soils. Soil pH was significantly lower in unsterilized soils that received composts, but other chemical properties were not affected by pre-sterilization. No significant effect of initial sterilization was observed in biochar treated soils in remediating their physical and chemical properties. Irrespective of sterilization, composts and biochar successfully remediated a saline-sodic soil leached with reclaimed water. It appears that the mode of action of biochar is physiochemical while composts provide a comprehensive reclamation when biological and physiochemical factors act together. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work discusses the utilization of flyash for synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst for transesterification. Different types of zeolites were synthesized from alkali fusion followed by hydrothermal treatment of coal flyash as source material. The synthesis conditions were optimized to obtain highly crystalline zeolite based on degree of crystallinity and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The effect of CEC, acid treatment, Si/Al ratio and calcination temperature (800, 900 and 1000. °C) on zeolite formation was also studied. Pure, single phase and highly crystalline zeolite was obtained at flyash/NaOH ratio (1:1.2), fusion temperature (550. °C), fusion time (1. h), hydrothermal temperature (110. °C) and hydrothermal time (12. h). The synthesized zeolite was ion-exchanged with potassium and was used as catalyst for transesterification of mustard oil to obtain a maximum conversion of 84.6% with 5. wt% catalyst concentration, 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction time of 7. h at 65. °C. The catalyst was reused for 3 times with marginal reduction in activity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioenergy crops have the potential to enhance soil carbon (C) pools from increased aggregation and the physical protection of organic matter; however, our understanding of the variation in these processes over heterogeneous landscapes is limited. In particular, little is known about the relative importance of soil properties and root characteristics for the physical protection of particulate organic matter (POM). We studied short-term (3-year) changes in aggregation and POM-C pools under three cropping systems (switchgrass, a triticale/sorghum double crop, continuous corn) replicated across five landscape positions along a topographic gradient in Iowa, USA. We isolated POM associated with three aggregate fractions (>. 2. mm, 0.25-2. mm, and 0.053-0.25. mm) to determine the relative influence of ten soil and three root properties. Aggregation increased in all cropping systems and was greatest under switchgrass; however cropping system effects were not consistent among positions. Total soil organic C stocks did not change, but C within both physically protected (iPOM-C) and unprotected (frPOM) C pools increased. Shifts in iPOM-C were concurrently influenced by soil properties and root traits. Soil texture had the strongest influence (65% relative importance), with finer-textured soils showing greater gains in total iPOM-C, while greater root biomass influenced (35% relative importance) accrual of total iPOM-C. Aggregate fractions varied in their iPOM-C response to soil and root variables, however individual pools similarly showed the importance of soil texture and root biomass and annual root productivity (BNPP). Changes in frPOM-C were strongly correlated with BNPP. Our data suggest that macroaggregate formation drives short-term responses of POM, which are influenced by both soil and root system properties. Crops that maximize root biomass and BNPP will lead to the largest increases in protected soil C stocks. However, C storage rates will vary across landscapes according to soil conditions, with texture as the primary influence. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Theory-based evaluation (TBE) is an effectiveness assessment technique that critically analyses the theory underlying an intervention. Whilst its use has been widely reported in the area of social programmes, it is less applied in the field of energy and climate change policy evaluations. This paper reports a recent study that has evaluated the effectiveness of the national biofuel policy (NBP) for the transport sector in Malaysia by adapting a TBE approach. Three evaluation criteria were derived from the official goals of the NBP, those are (i) improve sustainability and environmental friendliness, (ii) reduce fossil fuel dependency, and (iii) enhance stakeholders' welfare. The policy theory underlying the NBP has been reconstructed through critical examination of the policy and regulatory documents followed by a rigorous appraisal of the causal link within the policy theory through the application of scientific knowledge. This study has identified several weaknesses in the policy framework that may engender the policy to be ineffective. Experiences with the use of a TBE approach for policy evaluations are also shared in this report. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of treated wastewater to irrigate the sugar beet (Beta Vulgaris L. var. saccharifera) for bioethanol could play a strategic role to contrast the use of natural water resources and increase the productivity of the crop. The 2-year experiment (2013-2014) was performed on sugar beet irrigated with fresh water and wastewater at different steps of the reclamation process (secondary and tertiary treatments). The data obtained showed that the root sugar beet yield and ethanol production under fresh water treatment (52.2 Mg ha-1 and 5446 L ha-1) were lower respect to that obtained from the secondary and tertiary wastewater treatments (66.7 Mg ha-1 and 6785 L ha-1, and 58.7 Mg ha-1 and 6164 L ha-1, respectively), with the same irrigation volumes. These results can depend on the higher quantity of nutrient uptake when wastewater is used for irrigation. In particular, the average N applied (as nitrate and ammonium) with irrigation during the growing seasons (2013 and 2014) was corresponding to the supply of 4, 28 and 20 kg ha-1, for the fresh water, secondary, and tertiary wastewater treatments, respectively. © 2015, Italian Journal of Agronomy, All rights Reserved.

AB  - A green method is developed to increase the yield and quality of bio-oil by ultrasonic pretreatment of biomass followed by in situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil over metal (Cu, Fe and/or Zn)/γ-Al2O3. It is found that the yield of bio-oil is increased up to 10 wt% after cedar is pretreated by ultrasound before pyrolysis. Various metals (Cu, Fe and Zn) are loaded on γ-Al2O3 and applied for upgrading the bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of pretreated cedar. It is found that the catalysts promote the conversion of oxygenated compounds into aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. In particular, production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene is favored. The best catalytic activity is achieved by using 2.5 wt% Zn/γ-Al2O3 with a maximum hydrocarbon yield of 80.3%. The catalyst is reused for up to four cycles. The results show that the catalysts after regeneration by calcination at 550 °C for 30 min exhibit long-term stability for upgrading of bio-oil. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Summary: Energy supply is a key issue in isolated high mountain regions like the Eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan. This study uses an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the energy system of Alichur, an exemplary settlement in the region. Thereby, the local energy mix is evaluated, as well as the current and possible future supply of the two main resources used: Dwarf shrubs and animal manure. Finally, based on the energy system analysis, a locally adapted energy poverty index is developed. In contrast to assumptions made in the literature on the topic, we found that currently only 15 % of Alichur’s inhabitants are energy poor, 25 % are endangered by energy poverty and 60 % are energy secure. However, with decreasing access to dwarf shrubs in the future, the share of energy poor households and those endangered by energy poverty may increase to more than 70 %, leaving less than 30 % of Alichur’s households energy secure. In contrast to existing energy poverty indices, the adapted energy poverty index presented here considers social and environmental interrelationships of the case study region. It is therefore well suited for describing the energy situation of Alichur’s population. © 2015, Erdkunde, All right reserved.

AB  - Achieving regional and national goals of renewable energy production will depend on sufficient supply of biomass from private forests, the majority of which are controlled by non-industrial private forest landowners (NIPF). Considering the diversity in management objectives and changing demographic dynamics in this ownership group, it is important to understand the characteristics of landowners that may supply woody biomass. This study developed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification tree (CT) models to examine the characteristics and motivation of such NIPF landowners. Thirteen combinations of CT variable selection and split-point selection models were used in conjunction with LDA. The “importance of income” from a woody biomass harvest was the most important factor influencing NIPF landowners’ decisions in supplying woody biomass. Another significant interrelated variable was “farmer or non-farmer” forestland ownership, which was also related with “years of residency”, “availability of a multi-management plan,” and “ownership of multi-tracts of land.” CT models provided higher-level explanatory information when compared with LDA models. Study findings provide useful insight for land managers, wood procurement managers, and policy-makers in identifying the landowner groups with interest in biomass supply, and in understanding the factors influencing their decisions. © 2015, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - Clostridium thermocellum can rapidly solubilize cellulose and produces ethanol as an end product of its metabolism. As such, it is a candidate for bioethanol production from plant matter. In this study, we developed an inducible expression system for C. thermocellum based on its native celC operon. We enhanced expression over the native operon structure by placing the repressor gene, glyR3, immediately after the celC promoter, and expressing the target gene after glyR3. Upon the addition of the inducer substrate, laminaribiose, an approximately 40-fold increase in gene expression was obtained using the test gene spo0A. Furthermore, induction of the sporulation histidine kinase, clo1313_1942, increased sporulation frequency by approximately 10,000-fold relative to an uninduced control. We have also shown that the laminaribiose (β1-3-linked carbon source) utilization pathway is not catabolite repressed by cellobiose, a β1-4-linked carbon source frequently used for C. thermocellum cultivation in laboratory conditions. Selective expression of target genes has the potential to inform metabolic engineering strategies as well as increase fundamental understanding of C. thermocellum biology. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).

AB  - Main conclusion: Camelina was bioengineered to accumulate (4S)-limonene and (+)-δ-cadinene in seed. Plastidic localization of the recombinant enzymes resulted in higher yields than cytosolic localization. Overexpressing 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) further increased terpene accumulation. Many plant-derived compounds of high value for industrial or pharmaceutical applications originate from plant species that are not amenable to cultivation. Biotechnological production in low-input organisms is an attractive alternative. Several microbes are well established as biotechnological production platforms; however, their growth requires fermentation units, energy input, and nutrients. Plant-based production systems potentially allow the generation of high-value compounds on arable land with minimal input. Here we explore whether Camelina sativa (camelina), an emerging low-input non-foodstuff Brassicaceae oilseed crop grown on marginal lands or as a rotation crop on fallow land, can successfully be refactored to produce and store novel compounds in seed. As proof-of-concept, we use the cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbon (4S)-limonene and the bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (+)-δ-cadinene, which have potential biofuel and industrial solvent applications. Post-translational translocation of the recombinant enzymes to the plastid with concurrent overexpression of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) resulted in the accumulation of (4S)-limonene and (+)-δ-cadinene up to 7 mg g−1 seed and 5 mg g−1 seed, respectively. This study presents the framework for rapid engineering of camelina oilseed production platforms for terpene-based high-value compounds. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The ability of Clostridium thermocellum to rapidly degrade cellulose and ferment resulting hydrolysis products into ethanol makes it a promising platform organism for cellulosic biofuel production via consolidated bioprocessing. Currently, however, ethanol yield is far below theoretical maximum due to branched product pathways that divert carbon and electrons towards formate, H2, lactate, acetate, and secreted amino acids. To redirect carbon and electron flux away from formate, genes encoding pyruvate:formate lyase (pflB) and PFL-activating enzyme (pflA) were deleted. Formate production in the resulting Δpfl strain was eliminated and acetate production decreased by 50 % on both complex and defined medium. The growth rate of the Δpfl strain decreased by 2.9-fold on defined medium and biphasic growth was observed on complex medium. Supplementation of defined medium with 2 mM formate restored Δpfl growth rate to 80 % of the parent strain. The role of pfl in metabolic engineering strategies and C1 metabolism is discussed. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Switchgrass is a prime target for biofuel production from inedible plant parts and has been the subject of numerous investigations in recent years. Yet, one of the main obstacles to effective biofuel production remains to be the major problem of recalcitrance. Recalcitrance emerges in part from the 3-D structure of lignin as a polymer in the secondary cell wall. Lignin limits accessibility of the sugars in the cellulose and hemicellulose polymers to enzymes and ultimately decreases ethanol yield. Monolignols, the building blocks of lignin polymers, are synthesized in the cytosol and translocated to the plant cell wall, where they undergo polymerization. The biosynthetic pathway leading to monolignols in switchgrass is not completely known, and difficulties associated with in vivo measurements of these intermediates pose a challenge for a true understanding of the functioning of the pathway. Results: In this study, a systems biological modeling approach is used to address this challenge and to elucidate the structure and regulation of the lignin pathway through a computational characterization of alternate candidate topologies. The analysis is based on experimental data characterizing stem and tiller tissue of four transgenic lines (knock-downs of genes coding for key enzymes in the pathway) as well as wild-type switchgrass plants. These data consist of the observed content and composition of monolignols. The possibility of a G-lignin specific metabolic channel associated with the production and degradation of coniferaldehyde is examined, and the results support previous findings from another plant species. The computational analysis suggests regulatory mechanisms of product inhibition and enzyme competition, which are well known in biochemistry, but so far had not been reported in switchgrass. By including these mechanisms, the pathway model is able to represent all observations. Conclusions: The results show that the presence of the coniferaldehyde channel is necessary and that product inhibition and competition over cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase (CCR1) are essential for matching the model to observed increases in H-lignin levels in 4-coumarate:CoA-ligase (4CL) knockdowns. Moreover, competition for 4-coumarate:CoA-ligase (4CL) is essential for matching the model to observed increases in the pathway metabolites in caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) knockdowns. As far as possible, the model was validated with independent data. © 2015 Faraji et al.

AB  - Engineering of ethanologenic E. coli to express the haemoglobin (VHb) from the bacterium Vitreoscilla has been shown to enhance ethanol production by fermentation of pure sugars, sugars from hydrolysis of lignocellulose, components of whey, and sugars from wastewater produced during potato processing. Here, these studies were extended to see whether the same effect could be seen when a mixture of waste materials from processing of potatoes and corn into potato and corn chips were used as sugar sources. Consistent increases in ethanol production coincident with VHb expression were seen in shake flasks at both low aeration and high aeration conditions. The ethanol increases were due almost entirely to increases in the amount of ethanol produced per unit of cell mass. The VHb strategy for increasing fermentation to ethanol (and perhaps other valuable fermentation products) may be of general use, particularly regarding conversion of otherwise discarded materials into valuable commodities. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - (Figure Presented). An energy-input analysis of the life-cycle of microalgal cultivation systems was performed to study the oil-rich biomass production from fast-growing microalgae, for biodiesel production purposes. We estimated and compared the energy demands for the algal biomass cultivation in open-ponds (OP) with that required in closed-system photobioreactors (PBR) based on the new technologies. We also present the best microalgal candidates that show the highest biomass productivity and lipid yield indoors (laboratory scale), and discuss their potential to be used for full-scale biodiesel production. The results show that the energy requirements are highly dependent on the final mass concentration and/or using industrial wastes, with PBR cultivation being the largest energy consumer. Our offered scenario to minimize energy inputs and to increase algal-oil yields considers the most ideal cases, which could be the most promising model for energy-efficient biofuel production. Although biodiesel production by any of these systems is still not economically competitive with fossil fuel, recent suggestions on how to increase the efficiency of both systems are discussed, based on our energy-input assessment, with a critical evaluation of all stages for large-scale production of oil-rich microalgal biomass. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many studies have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to assess the environmental impacts and energetic suitability of microalgal biofuels. This paper presents a critical review focused on goal and scope, system boundaries, functional unit, Life Cycle Inventories (LCI) and environmental impacts of 41 LCA of algal biofuels. The comparison between these LCA has been made difficult by the heterogeneity of their underlying hypotheses and perimeters. Hence we propose to define methodological guidelines to harmonize results presentation in order to improve the validity of each new contribution and to ease its comparison to other studies. LCA allows detecting pollution transfers between production stages as well as between distinct environmental impacts. At the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level, a special attention should be paid to the perimeter of the study (e.g. inclusion of infrastructures) and to the handling of the co-products (allocation or substitution). Moreover the inventory data have to be treated in a consistent way in order to guarantee the comparability of LCI between different studies. Hence we recommend that data of all the production steps should be given at a unit process level, i.e. the smallest element for which input and output data can be quantified. At the Life Cycle Impact Assessment level, other impacts than the greenhouse gases balance have to be taken into account, like impacts related to the use of fertilizers (acidification and eutrophication) and phytosanitary products (human toxicity and ecotoxicity), impacts of direct and indirect land use change, and water consumptions. Finally, as biofuel is aiming at replacing existing energy productions, an energy balance should always be carried out; the Cumulative Energy Demand Ratio offers a convenient framework in that regard. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Algae Cluster is a group of three European Commission funded projects, each building a different demonstration algae biofuel facility up to 10 hectares in size. Each project is carrying out an independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to understand the various environmental impacts of the biofuel production. A major issue with LCA is that there is a high flexibility on defining metrics such as the boundary conditions, functional unit and impact categories. The LCA practitioners for these three projects have agreed upon a harmonised approach, with the intention of ensuring the projects are comparable. This paper details the logic behind this approach, and shares it with the community. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the three algae demonstration projects and to present a harmonized methodology for LCA of algae biofuels. With this, work by different researchers may be compared more effectively, making it easier to measure the effectiveness of different strategies in algal biofuels with regard to sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many studies have developed mathematical programming models for optimal design of supply chains for agricultural or lingocellulosic biomass-derived bioethanol production. However, because of the shortcomings of using agricultural (food supply problems) and lingo-cellulosic biomass (low biomass availability and processing yield) as feedstock, use of micro-algal biomass has been considered for use as a feedstock for biodiesel (biofuel). Thus, in this study we developed a deterministic mathematical programming model for strategic planning design of a microalgae biomass-to-biodiesel supply chain network (MBBSCN) from feedstock fields to end users that simultaneously satisfies resource constraints, demand constraints, and technology over a long-term planning horizon.The proposed deterministic model can help to determine where and how much feedstock to be transported, and where and how many refineries to be constructed to minimize the expected total cost including the co-product (naphtha and power) benefit. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model, we conducted a case study based on the Korea biodiesel market data. In this case study, the optimized (i.e., most cost-effective) supply chain design can be gained at a reliable cost of ~$US. 5.91/gal ($US. 1.56/l). In particular, this study can help to identify the technological bottlenecks and major cost drivers for the microalgae-to-diesel strategy, and can be also a guideline for development of various mathematical programming models for optimal design of microalgae biomass-derived biofuel supply chain like lingo-cellulosic biomass-based optimization studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined some management strategies of wheat cultivation system and its sustainability in using straw as an energy feedstock. According to the EU regulatory framework on biofuels, no GHG emissions should be assigned to straws when they are used for energy. Given this relevance in the current energy policy, it is advisable to include all possible marginal effects related to land use, resource utilization and management changes in the comparison of different biomass options. Coherently, an expanded life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to include the upstream cultivation phase and to make a comparison between "straw to soil" and "straw to energy". Different crop management conditions in Southern Italy were simulated, by using the CropSyst model, to estimate the long-term soil organic carbon and annual N2O soil emissions. Three wheat cropping systems were considered: the conventional single wheat system without straw removal (W0) and with partial straw removal (W1), together with a no-tillage "wheat-wheat-herbage" rotation system with partial straw removal (W2). The results of the simulations were integrated in the LCA to compare fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of straw-to-electricity with respect to the fossil-based electricity system. The "improved" rotational wheat cropping system (W2) gave the best performance in terms both of GHG savings and fossil displacement, thus stressing that straw use for energy generation in parallel with the optimization of the cropping system are key factors in long-term environmental sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - (Figure Presented). Microalgae is being investigated as a renewable transportation fuel feedstock based on various advantages that include high annual yields, utilization of poor quality land, does not compete with food, and can be integrated with various waste streams. This study focuses on directly assessing the environmental impact of two different thermochemical conversion technologies for the microalgae-to-biofuel process through life cycle assessment. A system boundary of "well to pump" (WTP) is defined and includes sub-process models of the growth, dewatering, thermochemical bio-oil recovery, bio-oil stabilization, conversion to renewable diesel, and transport to the pump. Models were validated with experimental and literature data and are representative of an industrial-scale microalgae-to-biofuel process. Two different thermochemical bio-oil conversion systems are modeled and compared on a systems level, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis. The environmental impact of the two pathways were quantified on the metrics of net energy ratio (NER), defined here as energy consumed over energy produced, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Results for WTP biofuel production through the HTL pathway were determined to be 1.23 for the NER and GHG emissions of -11.4 g CO2-eq (MJ renewable diesel)-1. Biofuel production through the pyrolysis pathway results in a NER of 2.27 and GHG emissions of 210 g CO2-eq (MJ renewable diesel)-1. The large environmental impact associated with the pyrolysis pathway is attributed to feedstock drying requirements and combustion of co-products to improve system energetics. Discussion focuses on a detailed breakdown of the overall process energetics and GHGs, impact of modeling at laboratory-scale compared to industrial-scale, environmental impact sensitivity to systems engineering input parameters for future focused research and development, and a comparison of results to literature. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose – Currently, experimental and theoretical work is being performed to ensure that biofuels from microalgae become a reality. However, there is a considerable number of discussions concerning in which processes should be focussed efforts of research and development. The purpose of this paper is to provide decision support not only to help build guidelines of research to be undertaken, but also to contribute to the design of more adequate policy and funding instruments. The key objective of this study is to determine the prospects of employing microalgae into the production of biofuels within a time scale extending to 2030. Design/methodology/approach – The Delphi method is a qualitative research aiming to support strategic future-oriented action, such as policy making in the areas of science and technology. It is especially appropriate in judgment and long-range forecasting (20-30 years) situations, when expert opinions are often the only source of information available, due to a lack of appropriate historical, economic or technical data. Findings – The Delphi method proved to be a successful research method when expert opinions are the main source of information available, due to a lack of appropriate historical, economic or technical data and the outcomes provided a clear outline of the main issues of microalgae biofuels’ market at present and in the future. Research limitations/implications – The outcomes might not represent the majority of the microalgae experts’ opinion due to the sample size. Originality/value – The work presented in this paper is especially original. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first qualitative Delphi study related to algae biofuels. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The coordination of agricultural, environmental and energy policies requires a thorough understanding of the interactions between crop, food and energy markets. This paper develops a general equilibrium model to analyze the interactions and to evaluate the price and welfare effect of biofuel mandates and subsidies. Results suggest that biofuel mandates are a primary cause of some of the major concerns associated with crop-based biofuel production, including higher food prices and lower consumer welfare. The price and welfare effects of biofuel subsidies depend on the level of the biofuel mandate. When the mandate is weak or not binding, a biofuel subsidy becomes a transfer from consumers to biofuel producers, which tends to reduce food and fuel prices because of the negative income effect. However, with a strong mandate, a biofuel subsidy will increase the prices of crops, food, and fuel when crops account for a large share of production cost and when the supply of crops is inelastic. Using parameter values consistent with empirical evidence found in the U.S., we calculated the price and welfare effects of the biofuel mandates and subsidies specified in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Results suggest that the biofuel mandates and subsidies increased the price of corn by 25–40 %, increased the price of food by 1.5–2.5 %, and lowered the price of gasoline by 5–10 %. Overall, the biofuel policies had only a small effect on consumer utility. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biodiversity experiments show that increases in plant diversity can lead to greater biomass production, and some researchers suggest that high diversity plantings should be used for bioenergy production. However, many methods used in past biodiversity experiments are impractical for bioenergy plantings. For example, biodiversity experiments often use intensive management such as hand weeding to maintain low diversity plantings and exclude unplanted species, but this would not be done for bioenergy plantings. Also, biodiversity experiments generally use high seeding densities that would be too expensive for bioenergy plantings. Here we report the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from two studies of more realistic bioenergy crop plantings in southern Michigan, USA. One study involved comparing production between switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures and species- rich prairie plantings on private farm fields that were managed similarly to bioenergy plantings. The other study was an experiment where switchgrass was planted in monoculture and in combination with increasingly species-rich native prairie mixtures. Overall, we found that bioenergy plantings with higher species richness did not produce more biomass than switchgrass monocultures. The lack of a positive relationship between planted species richness and production in our studies may be due to several factors. Non-planted species (weeds) were not removed from our studies and these non-planted species may have competed with planted species and also prevented realized species richness from equaling planted species richness. Also, we found that low seeding density of individual species limited the biomass production of these individual species. Production in future bioenergy plantings with high species richness may be increased by using a high density of inexpensive seed from switchgrass and other highly productive species, and future efforts to translate the results of biodiversity experiments to bioenergy plantings should consider the role of seeding density. © 2015 Dickson, Gross.

AB  - Biogas plants have been considered as a source for possible amplification and distribution of pathogenic bacteria capable of causing severe infections in humans and animals. Manure and biogas wastes could be sources for spore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum. In the present study, 24 liquid manure and 84 biogas waste samples from dairies where the majority of the cows suffered from chronic botulism were investigated for the presence of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) and C. botulinum spores. The prevalence of BoNT/A, B, C, D, and E in biogas wastes was 16.6, 8.3, 10.7, 7.1, and 10.8 %, respectively, while in manure, the prevalence was 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 8.3, and 4.1 %, respectively. After enrichment of samples in reinforced cultural medium, they were tested for C. botulinum BoNT/A, B, C, D, and E using ELISA (indirect C. botulinum detection). The prevalence of C. botulinum type A, B, C, D, and E samples in biogas wastes was 20.2, 15.5, 19, 10.7, and 34.8 %, respectively, while the prevalence in liquid manure was 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 8.3, and 12.5 %, respectively. In conclusion, the occurrence of BoNT and C. botulinum spores in biogas waste of diseased animals indicates an increased and underestimated hygienic risk. Application of digestates from biogas fermentations as fertilizers could lead to an accumulation of long lifespan spores in the environment and could be a possible health hazard. © 2015, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

AB  - Implementing public policies often involves navigating an array of choices that have economic and environmental consequences that are difficult to quantify due to the complexity of multiple system interactions. Implementing the mandate for cellulosic biofuel production in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and reducing hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico by reducing riverine nitrate-N loads represent two such cases that overlap in the Mississippi River Basin. To quantify the consequences of these interactions, a system of systems (SoS) model was developed that incorporates interdependencies among the various subsystems, including biofuel refineries, transportation, agriculture, water resources and crop/ethanol markets. The model allows examination of the impact of imposing riverine nitrate-N load limits on the biofuel production system as a whole, including land use change and infrastructure needs. The synergies of crop choice (first versus second generation biofuel crops), infrastructure development, and environmental impacts (streamflow and nitrate-N load) were analyzed to determine the complementarities and trade-offs between environmental protection and biofuel development objectives. For example, the results show that meeting the cellulosic biofuel target in the RFS using Miscanthus x giganteus reduces system profits by 8% and reduces nitrate-N loads by 12% compared to the scenario without a mandate. However, greater water consumption by Miscanthus is likely to reduce streamflow with potentially adverse environmental consequences that need to be considered in future decision making. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Over the past 7 years, the US Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research has funded three Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs). These centers have developed complementary and collaborative research portfolios that address the key technical and economic challenges in biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. All three centers have established a close, productive relationship with DOE’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI). This special issue of Bioenergy Research samples the breadth of basic science and engineering work required to underpin a diverse, sustainable, and robust biofuel industry. In this report, which was collaboratively produced by all three BRCs, we discuss the BRC contributions over their first 7 years to the development of renewable transportation fuels. We also highlight the BRC research published in the current issue and discuss technical challenges in light of recent progress. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) is a productive warm-season, C4 perennial grass native to most of North America having tolerance to wet, cold, and saline growing conditions. Excellent stress tolerance, along with high biomass yields, makes prairie cordgrass a good candidate as a dedicated energy crop on marginal land. However, there is little information available on genetic variation, including yield potential, of native populations in the USA. The objectives of this study were to evaluate biomass yield and to identify the nature and extent of genetic variation in natural populations of prairie cordgrass by comparing endemic strains collected throughout the USA. Forty-two prairie cordgrass populations were collected from prairie-remnant sites in 13 states and evaluated at the University of Illinois in Urbana, IL. The 4-year field study of prairie cordgrass revealed extensive variations in biomass yield and phenotypic traits associated with biomass yield among these populations. Strong correlations were observed between the phenotypic values and origins of the populations. Path coefficient analysis indicated that tiller mass, tiller density, heading date, plant height, and phytomer number positively affected biomass yield directly or indirectly. However, the phenotypic traits including biomass yield showed significant variation among years except for phytomer number and heading date. With the extensive genetic variability and high biomass yield potential demonstrated in this experiment, prairie cordgrass could become a highly productive bioenergy crop by developing a well-planned breeding program. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Miscanthus spp. are biofuel crops that are triggering growing interest worldwide due to their numerous agronomic advantages. Though breeding programs take into account usual key plant traits of agronomic interest (e.g., biomass production, adaptation to broader climatic range), they generally overlook plant attributes relating to pest and pathogen resistance and even more those that may favor or improve the combined use of biological control agents of pests. A recent study showed that the parental species, Miscanthus sacchariflorus and, to a lesser extent, Miscanthus sinensis, were less suitable and acceptable host plants for the corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis, one of the main pests of Miscanthus × giganteus in the USA, than the hybrid M. × giganteus. In the present laboratory study, we investigated the host plant-mediated effects of these three miscanthus species on various life history traits of the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes. A clear host plant effect was shown on aphid size and, consequently, on parasitoid fitness parameters. High plant resistance to aphids was shown to be more detrimental to the parasitoid than partial resistance, with M. sacchariflorus being the least suitable host plant to both aphid and parasitoid development. Selection of partial resistance, such as the one exhibited by M. sinensis, should then be preferred to support efficient aphid regulation by parasitoids. This study provides the first contribution to the evaluation of bottom-up effects of a biofuel crop on beneficial insects. It also underlines the need to conduct additional research when considering the implementation of new biomass crops. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Spatial variability in yields and greenhouse gas emissions from soils has been identified as a key source of variability in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of agricultural products such as cellulosic ethanol. This study aims to conduct an LCA of cellulosic ethanol production from switchgrass in a way that captures this spatial variability and tests results for sensitivity to using spatially averaged results. The Environment Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was used to calculate switchgrass yields, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from crop production in southern Wisconsin and Michigan at the watershed scale. These data were combined with cellulosic ethanol production data via ammonia fiber expansion and dilute acid pretreatment methods and region-specific electricity production data into an LCA model of eight ethanol production scenarios. Standard deviations from the spatial mean yields and soil emissions were used to test the sensitivity of net energy ratio, global warming potential intensity, and eutrophication and acidification potential metrics to spatial variability. Substantial variation in the eutrophication potential was also observed when nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from soils were varied. This work illustrates the need for spatially explicit agricultural production data in the LCA of biofuels and other agricultural products. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Realistic yield data are essential for evaluating the economic viability of short-rotation woody crops (SRWC). However, we lack not only realistic yield data, particularly for commercial stands, but also easily applicable methods to estimate biomass. To address these shortcomings, we evaluated 30 commercial stands in Bavaria during the first rotation (not yet coppiced) using three different methods—the quadratic mean diameter (QMD) approach, the yield appraiser (YA), and allometric power equations (APE). Of the three, APE requires the highest sampling effort, data, and expertise. APE was used to establish a baseline for bias and precision to assess the performance of the QMD and YA methods. We found that neither the QMD nor the YA produced biomass estimation results different to that of the APE. Commercial stands 5 years old or older yielded, on average, 8.9 odt ha−1 a−1, more than field trials of comparable age in the first rotation in Bavaria. This finding contradicts the common expectation that field trials yield more biomass than commercial stands. The mean annual increment in 3-year-old stands was significantly lower than that in stands 5 years old or older with comparable planting densities. Given that measured yields varied widely around the mean, economic evaluations should not use means, but take into account uncertainties. We found that YA and QMD are generally suitable biomass estimation methods for practitioners, with the QMD approach providing higher accuracy due to a lower relative bias and relative precision (−6.15 and 13.3 %) than YA (−12.97 and 21.87 %). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Macroalgal biomass has been considered as a prospective feedstock for biofuel production as, among other benefits, it is an abundant source of renewable sugars and its growth does not require arable land, fresh water, or intense care. Successful commercial deployment of macroalgae-based biorefineries, however, depends on their economic viability at industrial scales. A key objective of this study was to carry out a detailed technoeoconomic analysis (TEA) of a macroalgae biorefinery to understand the economic potential and cost drivers of macroalgae as a feedstock for the production of biofuels and biochemicals. Ethanol was used as a representative macroalgae-derived product, given the wealth of public information available to model this option, and the analysis was extended to biomass-derived sugars in order to explore the production of other fermentation-derived chemicals. Sensitivity analysis was performed on various cost drivers, such as macroalgae price, yield, solids loading, and enzyme loading during hydrolysis. With a feedstock price of $100/MT, depending on the maturity of the other key process parameters (i.e., yield, solids loading, and enzyme loading), the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) was observed to be in the range of $3.6–8.5/gal and reduced to $2.9–7.5/gal with macroalgae priced at $50/MT. For production of chemicals, sugar prices were in the range of ¢21–47/lb or ¢16–40/lb with macroalgae priced at $100/MT and $50/MT, respectively. Given the challenging economics of the macroalgae biorefinery, coproduction of alginate was used to show the importance of multiple revenue sources, though issues regarding market saturation continue to arise when dealing with products of disparate market sizes. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius Y4.1MC1 was isolated from a boiling spring in the lower geyser basin of Yellowstone National Park. This species is of interest because of its metabolic versatility. The genome consists of one circular chromosome of 3,840,330 bp and a circular plasmid of 71,617 bp with an average GC content of 44.01 %. The genome is available in the GenBank database (NC_014650.1 and NC_014651.1). In addition to the expected metabolic pathways for sugars and amino acids, the Y4.1MC1 genome codes for two separate carbon monoxide utilization pathways, an aerobic oxidation pathway and an anaerobic reductive acetyl CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway. This is the first report of a non-anaerobic organism with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. This anaerobic pathway permits the strain to utilize H2 and fix CO2 present in the hot spring environment. Y4.1MC1 and its related species may play a significant role in carbon capture and sequestration in thermophilic ecosystems and may open up new routes to produce biofuels and chemicals from CO, H2, and CO2. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - The dramatic increase of fire hazard in wildland–urban interfaces (WUIs) has required more detailed fuel management programs to preserve ecosystem functions and human settlements. Designing effective fuel treatment strategies allows to achieve goals such as resilient landscapes, fire-adapted communities, and ecosystem response. Therefore, obtaining background information on forest fuel parameters and fuel accumulation patterns has become an important first step in planning fuel management interventions. Site-specific fuel inventory data enhance the accuracy of fuel management planning and help forest managers in fuel management decision-making. We have customized four fuel models for WUIs in southern Italy, starting from forest classes of land-cover use and adopting a hierarchical clustering approach. Furthermore, we provide a prediction of the potential fire behavior of our customized fuel models using FlamMap 5 under different weather conditions. The results suggest that fuel model IIIP (Mediterranean maquis) has the most severe fire potential for the 95th percentile weather conditions and the least severe potential fire behavior for the 85th percentile weather conditions. This study shows that it is possible to create customized fuel models directly from fuel inventory data. This achievement has broad implications for land managers, particularly forest managers of the Mediterranean landscape, an ecosystem that is susceptible not only to wildfires but also to the increasing human population and man-made infrastructures. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Interaction of the the rust fungus Puccinia miscanthi with the biofuel plant Miscanthus sinensis during the teliospore phase was investigated by light and electron microscopy. P. miscanthi telia were oval-shaped and present on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. Teliospores were brown, one-septate (two-celled), and had pedicels attached to one end. Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous electron-translucent lipid globules in the cytoplasm of teliospores. Extensive cell wall dissolution around hyphae was not observed in the host tissues beneath the telia. Hyphae were found between mesophyll cells in the leaf tissues as well as in host cells. Intracellular hyphae, possibly haustoria, possessed electron-dense fungal cell walls encased by an electron-transparent fibrillar extrahaustorial sheath that had an electron-dense extrahaustorial membrane. The infected host cells appeared to maintain their membrane-bound structures such as nuclei and chloroplasts. These results suggest that the rust fungus maintains its biotrophic phase with most mesophyll cells of M. sinensis. Such a nutritional mode would permit the rust fungus to obtain food reserves for transient growth in the course of host alteration. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.

AB  - The objective of our study was to test an approach for extracting public values concerning a virtually unknown and scientifically complex topic, namely advanced lignocellulosic biofuels, in order to foster responsible innovation of this novel technology in Canada as early on in the policy-making process as possible. As advanced lignocellulosic biofuels are currently an emerging form of liquid fuel for transport, it may be beneficial to open the development of this technology to “upstream” public input. We thereby explore how a deliberative mini-public views the need for advanced lignocellulosic biofuels and their recommendations for supporting or opposing its development and production. Participants of the study engaged in four days of deliberation on their value-based considerations concerning the social acceptability of this technology. On the final day, they developed a series of collective recommendations on three participant-generated agenda items: economic sustainability, unknown environmental and health impacts, and governance issues related to responsibility for advanced biofuels policy. The results provide a novel input into interdisciplinary research aimed at better understanding what may be driving public values on wider, sometimes controversial, issues related to biofuels. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - When waste cooking oil is improperly disposed into the sewer system, economic and ecological impacts, e.g. the increased burden for wastewater treatment plants, as well as the loss of an energy-rich resource, are the result. Initially launched in Tyrol, a separate collection system for waste cooking oil from households, which harvests up to 1 kg of grease per capita and year, has been introduced in many parts of Austria and neighboring countries. In the following work, the greenhouse-gas footprints (GG footprints) of three different recycling pathways for waste cooking oil from households in Austria (1) esterification into biodiesel, 2) direct combustion in a cogeneration plant, 3) fermentation as a co-substrate) are investigated. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Biofuel mandates are being widely used by countries to achieve multiple objectives of energy security and climate change mitigation. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the US specifies arbitrarily chosen volumetric targets for different types of biofuels in the US based on their greenhouse gas intensity only. Cellulosic biofuels from high yielding energy crops like miscanthus have the potential to co-generate multiple environmental impacts, including reducing nitrate runoff, being a sink for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and providing a given volume of biofuel with less diversion of land from food crop production than corn ethanol, but at a significantly higher cost. This paper quantifies the tradeoffs between profitability, food and fuel production, GHG emissions and nitrate runoff reduction with different types of biofuels in the Sangamon watershed in Illinois and analyzes the optimal mix of biofuels as well as the policies that should supplement the mandate to achieve multiple environmental outcomes. We find that a two-thirds share of cellulosic biofuel in the mandated level could reduce nitrate run-off by 20% while reducing GHG emissions by 88-100% but would reduce profits by 15-27% depending on whether a GHG policy or a Nitrate policy is used relative to the case where the mandate is met by corn ethanol alone. Additionally, the ratio of corn stover to miscanthus used to produce cellulosic biofuels is higher under a GHG policy compared to a Nitrate policy that achieves the same level of nitrate reduction. Our results show that the optimal mix of different types of biofuels and the policy to induce it depend on the environmental objectives and the tradeoffs that society is willing to make between low cost energy security, food production and various environmental benefits. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The water footprint of energy systems must be considered, as future water scarcity has been identified as a major concern. This work presents a general life cycle network modeling and optimization framework for energy-based products and processes using a functional unit of liters of water consumed in the processing pathway. We analyze and optimize the water-energy nexus over the objectives of water footprint minimization, maximization of economic output per liter of water consumed (economic efficiency of water), and maximization of energy output per liter of water consumed (energy efficiency of water). A mixed integer, multiobjective nonlinear fractional programming (MINLFP) model is formulated. A mixed integer linear programing (MILP)-based branch and refine algorithm that incorporates both the parametric algorithm and nonlinear programming (NLP) subproblems is developed to boost solving efficiency. A case study in bioenergy is presented, and the water footprint is considered from biomass cultivation to biofuel production, providing a novel perspective into the consumption of water throughout the value chain. The case study, optimized successively over the three aforementioned objectives, utilizes a variety of candidate biomass feedstocks to meet primary fuel products demand (ethanol, diesel, and gasoline). A minimum water footprint of 55.1 ML/year was found, economic efficiencies of water range from -$1.31/L to $0.76/L, and energy efficiencies of water ranged from 15.32 MJ/L to 27.98 MJ/L. These results show optimization provides avenues for process improvement, as reported values for the energy efficiency of bioethanol range from 0.62 MJ/L to 3.18 MJ/L. Furthermore, the proposed solution approach was shown to be an order of magnitude more efficient than directly solving the original MINLFP problem with general purpose solvers. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - This paper develops an empirical model of spatial competition in order to evaluate the effects of alternative corn stover market structures on stover prices, supply of cellulosic biofuels, and firm profits. We calibrate the model to market conditions in Indiana and show that spatial competition may significantly increase feedstock cost, reduce profits of biofuels plants, and increase the price of biofuel necessary to induce a given production target. On the other hand, spatial competition causes firms to rely more on the intensive margin, increasing farmers' share of the industry's surplus.

AB  - Filamentous freshwater macroalgae have significant potential as a renewable source of bioenergy. However, the ultimate success of freshwater macroalgae as a biofuel feedstock will depend upon our ability to produce biomass at commercial-scale in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. Aquatic ecology can play an important role to achieve the scale-up of algal crop production by informing the rates of nutrients supplied to the cultivation systems, and by helping to create adaptive production systems that are resilient to environmental change. A review and analysis of data from the published literature reveals that the large-scale cultivation of freshwater macroalgae is feasible using currently available technologies such as the Algal Turf Scrubber® system (ATS™). In addition, graphical analyses of published data obtained from ATS systems of varying sizes in operation worldwide reveal that both macroalgal biomass productivity and nutrient removal rates are hyperbolically related to the areal loading rates of both total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The effectiveness and need for CO2 supplementation of macroalgal production systems like the ATS has not yet been conclusively demonstrated, however. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biorefineries aim to provide sustainable production of food and generation of low carbon energy in the next decades. Current strategies for biorefinery reply mostly on the classic terrestrial agriculture for biomass production. However, land availability, competition with food crops and total energy balance are challenging limiting factors for terrestrial bioenergy crop production. Off-shore macroalgae production could provide alternative, sustainable feedstocks for biorefineries without competition with food crops. Increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae cultivation systems could further improve the total energy balance of the marine biorefineries. In this work, based on the fundamental principle of timing differences between light harvesting and carbon fixation in algae, we developed a theoretical framework for increasing the yields of off-shore macroalgae biomass using external mechanical mixing. We show that for a given physiological parameter of macroalgae light harvesting and carbon fixation, mixing could allow for increase of the total energy gain by two orders of magnitude. The overall biorefinery to biofuel efficiency, however, is constrained by drag and macroalgae thallus size. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The brown algae Fucus vesiculosus, Laminaria saccharina and Alaria esculenta were subjected to hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for 15. min at 350. °C in batch microautoclaves. Further optimization was carried out in view of optimizing the biocrude oil yield, varying the temperature from 330 to 370. °C. The maximum conversion to biocrude was 29.4 ± 1.1. wt.% at 360. °C for A. esculenta. The reaction pathways for macroalgae HTL and its capability for recycling nutrients were also investigated. The aqueous phase showed potential for a partial recovery of the nitrogen (21.2-28.6. wt.%) and sulfur (25.8-34.6. wt.%) from the initial biomass, and an almost total recovery of potassium and sodium. Results indicate that HTL as a sole conversion method to produce biofuel as single product is not recommended for macroalgae due to the low conversion to biocrude oil. At such conditions, its use as post-treatment for the remaining biomass after extracting valuable compounds (especially from the carbohydrate fraction) might be more interesting, and is suggested as the future direction for research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scientific research and commercial projects into the use of microalgae as a source of energy have increased markedly over the last decade. The economic feasibility and overall sustainability of operations based on farming of microalgae on an industrial scale will largely depend on their geographic location. Criteria concerning selection of sites from which diverse local resources can be optimized have to be also considered. The present study leads the analysis of relevant factors (i.e. natural resources, road infrastructure, geographic characteristics and industrial activities which generate greenhouse gas emissions) that support proper decision-making process for selecting potential areas of large-scale microalgae farming in Chile. Based on an eight-step methodology, ten potential sites were identified as meeting all necessary requisites for the industry across the country. Sites cover 103,600ha, capable of producing an estimated volume of 1.5Mm3 per year of biodiesel, and replacing 17% of the annual diesel consumption in Chile. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the collective impact of human activity approaches Earth’s biophysical limits, the ethics of food become increasingly important. Hundreds of millions of people remain undernourished, yet only 60 percent of the global harvest is consumed by humans, while 35 percent is fed to livestock and 5 percent is used for biofuels and other industrial products. This essay considers the ethics of such use of edible nutrition for feedstock and biofuel. How humanity uses Earth’s land is a reflection of its values. The current land-use arrangements, which divert 40 percent of all food to feed animals or create fuels, suggest that dietary and transportation preferences of wealthier individuals are considered more important than feeding undernourished people, or the stability of the wider biotic community. © 2015 by Brian G.

AB  - Eutrophication is a phenomenon which can rapidly generate masses of marine macroalgae, particularly in areas with high nutrient pollution. Washed ashore, this biomass impairs coastal tourism and negatively affects the coastal ecosystem. The present study evaluates the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of a macroalgae mix (Rügen-Mix, RM (RM = Rügen-Mix)) originating from Rügen, Germany. To improve biomethane recovery, thermo-acidic pretreatment was applied to the biomass prior to biomethanation to disintegrate the biomass macrostructure. Acid hydrolysis was successfully triggered with 0.2 M industry-grade HCl at 80 ° C for a 2 h period, increasing biomethane recovery by +39%, with a maximum BMP of 121 mL•g-1 volatile solids (VS). To reduce the necessity for input material, HCl was replaced by the acidic waste product flue gas condensate (FGC). Improved performance was achieved by showing an increase in biomethane recovery of +24% and a maximum BMP of 108 mL•g-1 VS. Continuous anaerobic digestion trials of RM were conducted for three hydraulic retention times, showing the feasibility of monodigestion. The biomethane recovery was 60 mL and 65 mL•g-1 VS•d-1 for thermophilic and mesophilic operation, respectively. The quality of biomethanation performance aligned to the composition of the source material which exhibited a low carbon/nitrogen ratio and an increased concentration of sulfur compounds. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The cultivation of macroalgae to supply the biofuel, pharmaceutical or food industries generates a considerable amount of organic residue, which represents a potential substrate for biomethanation. Its use optimizes the total resource exploitation by the simultaneous disposal of waste biomaterials. In this study, we explored the biochemical methane potential (BMP) and biomethane recovery of industrial Laminaria japonica waste (LJW) in batch, continuous laboratory and pilot-scale trials. Thermo-acidic pretreatment with industry-grade HCl or industrial flue gas condensate (FGC), as well as a co-digestion approach with maize silage (MS) did not improve the biomethane recovery. BMPs between 172 mL and 214 mL g-1 volatile solids (VS) were recorded. We proved the feasibility of long-term continuous anaerobic digestion with LJW as sole feedstock showing a steady biomethane production rate of 173 mL g-1 VS. The quality of fermentation residue was sufficient to serve as biofertilizer, with enriched amounts of potassium, sulfur and iron. We further demonstrated the upscaling feasibility of the process in a pilot-scale system where a CH4 recovery of 189 L kg-1 VS was achieved and a biogas composition of 55% CH4 and 38% CO2 was recorded. ©2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgae research is gaining momentum because of their potential biotechnological applications, including the generation of biofuels. Genome sequencing analysis of two model microalgal species, polar free-living Coccomyxa sp. C-169 and symbiotic Chlorella sp. NC64A, revealed insights into the factors responsible for their lifestyle and unravelled biotechnologically valuable proteins. However, genome sequence analysis under-explored cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), hemethiolate proteins ubiquitously present in species belonging to different biological kingdoms. In this study we performed genome data-mining, annotation and comparative analysis of P450s in these two model algal species. Sixty-nine P450s were found in two algal species. Coccomyxa sp. showed 40 P450s and Chlorella sp. showed 29 P450s in their genome. Sixty-eight P450s (>100 amino acid in length) were grouped into 32 P450 families and 46 P450 subfamilies. Among the P450 families, 27 P450 families were novel and not found in other biological kingdoms. The new P450 families are CYP745-CYP747, CYP845-CYP863, and CYP904-CYP908. Five P450 families, CYP51, CYP97, CYP710, CYP745, and CYP746, were commonly found between two algal species and 16 and 11 P450 families were unique to Coccomyxa sp. and Chlorella sp. Synteny analysis and gene-structure analysis revealed P450 duplications in both species. Functional analysis based on homolog P450s suggested that CYP51 and CYP710 family members are involved in mem­brane ergosterol biosynthesis. CYP55 and CYP97 family members are involved in nitric oxide reduction and biosynthesis of carotenoids. This is the first report on comparative analysis of P450s in the microalgal species Coccomyxa sp. C-169 and Chlorella sp. NC64A. © 2015 The Korean Society of Phycology.

AB  - A bioethanol production optimization model is developed and implemented to assess the feasibility of producing Taiwan's target volume of cellulosic ethanol. The most strategic placement of biorefineries based on feedstock supply is also explored to optimize the allocation of agricultural wastes. To simulate different supply targets and varying maximum biorefinery capacities, the nonlinear planning model utilizes the following information: ethanol yields, quantities of feedstock materials, potential refinery locations, and transportation networks. This simulation is undertaken to satisfy a minimum cost objective function and discover the most cost-effective factors of production. Sensitivity analysis explores the possible effects of technological advancements in cellulose conversion. This study estimates that a usage rate of 90% on two million metric tons of agricultural waste would produce a potential maximum 410 million liters of bioethanol, enough to meet 40% of Taiwan's demand for transportation fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present research work, non edible oil source milk thistle (Silybum marianum (L.) Gaert) plant was investigated for biodiesel production. The extracted crude oil was 26.14% of the total seed dry weight. The free fatty acid content of oil was reduced from 0.56 mg KOH/g to 0.06 mg KOH/g by esterification before the synthesis of biodiesel. The highest conversion percentage of biodiesel was achieved 89.51% and 87.42% using solid base catalyst sodium hydroxide (0.75%) and potassium hydroxide (1.0%), respectively. The protocol for experiment was adjusted as follow: temperature (60 °C); time of reaction (2 h), steering (600 rpm) and the oil molar ratio was fixed 1:6. Qualitatively, the prepared biodiesel was quantified by GC chromatography, 13C &amp; 1H NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), AAS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The fuel properties of biodiesel were tested and compared with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mandated Environmental Protection Agency biofuel qualifications focused on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel use are limited in perspective and have the potential to encourage burden shifting. When a broader host of environmental impacts are examined, environmental trade-offs often exist when biofuels are compared to gasoline. Multivariate analysis methods examining a wide variety of weighting value systems and methodology assumptions were used to determine process design options with the lowest overall environmental impact. A multivariate environmental analysis was applied to the dilute acid pre-treatment process followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and the fermentation process for converting loblolly pine, eucalyptus, natural hardwood, switchgrass, and sweet sorghum biomass to ethanol. The influence of co-product treatment method choices, inclusion of direct land-use change, and electrical grid assumptions were examined using 16 different weighting methods to create a single score result. Biofuel system rankings based on GHG emissions following the Renewable Fuel Standards 2 (RFS2) methods were very sensitive to the co-product treatment method, inclusion of land-use change emissions, and energy grid assumptions. The multivariate analysis ranking was heavily influenced by other environmental impacts resulting from the production of process chemicals used in ethanol conversion. Weighting methods examined had no influence on the environmental preference ranking of the biofuel scenarios. Additionally, the biofuel ranking based on the RFS2 methodology was different than the ranking following the multivariate approach examining additional impacts. These findings demonstrate a robust approach to biofuel life cycle assessment (LCA) scenario analysis and suggest that the limited scope of the RFS2 environmental analysis could result in burden shifting. ©2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Modern biotechnology has the potential to substantially advance the feasibility, structure, and efficiency of future biofuel supply chains. Advances might be direct or indirect. A direct advance would be improving the efficiency of biochemical conversion processes and feedstock production. Direct advances in processing may involve developing improved enzymes and bacteria to convert lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol. Progress in feedstock production could include enhancing crop yields via genetic modification or the selection of specific natural variants and breeds. Other direct results of biotechnology might increase the production of fungible biofuels and bioproducts, which would impact the supply chain. Indirect advances might include modifications to dedicated bioenergy crops that enable them to grow on marginal lands rather than land needed for food production. This study assesses the feasibility and advantages of near-future (10-year) biotechnological developments for a US biomass-based supply chain for bioenergy production. We assume a simplified supply chain of feedstock, logistics and land use, conversion, and products and utilization. The primary focus is how likely developments in feedstock production and conversion technologies will impact bioenergy and biofuels in the USA; a secondary focus is other innovative uses of biotechnologies in the energy arenas. The assessment addresses near-term biofuels based on starch, sugar, and cellulosic feedstocks and considers some longer-term options, such as oil-crop and algal technologies. Published 2015.

AB  - The push to find alternatives to fossil fuels has driven research and consumption of biofuels. Recent actions in the United States have placed an emphasis on the use of renewable fuels for improved sustainability of government operations. In 2013, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) measured atmospheric emissions from two navigation vessels consuming three different fuel types and found that biofuels have the potential to lower atmospheric emissions. These fuels have widely different production processes, however, and a full life-cycle assessment is necessary to provide a complete picture of these biofuels. The goal of this study was to identify whether transitioning navigation vessels to operate on biodiesel would have the potential to lower human health and environmental impacts. This study focuses on the complete life cycle of these fuels in USACE marine vessels by employing a well-to-wheels life-cycle assessment comparing the impacts of a 100% soy-based biodiesel and an algal-based biodiesel blend to a conventional diesel. Overall, soybean-based biodiesel had lower impacts compared to algal-based biodiesel. Impacts from conventional diesel were generally lower than algal-based biodiesel, but impacts between conventional diesel and soybean-based biodiesel were mixed. While greenhouse gas emissions during the use phase were reduced for the biofuels (after considering only the non-biogenic fraction of carbon emission), a complete look at the life-cycle resulted in cases where emissions could be greater than conventional diesel. Biodiesel impacts depended greatly on modeling assumptions made in the life-cycle system boundaries and inventory such as allocation method and assumptions about feedstock growth and harvesting.

AB  - Converting biomass to biofuels is a key strategy in substituting fossil fuels to mitigate climate change. Conventional strategies to convert lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol address the fermentation of cellulose-derived glucose. Here we used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to uncover the nanoscale structure of cell walls in the energy crops maize and Miscanthus where the typical polymer cellulose forms an unconventional layered architecture with the atypical (1, 3)-β-glucan polymer callose. This raised the question about an unused potential of (1, 3)-β-glucan in the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. Engineering biomass conversion for optimized (1, 3)-β-glucan utilization, we increased the ethanol yield from both energy crops. The generation of transgenic Miscanthus lines with an elevated (1, 3)-β-glucan content further increased ethanol yield providing a new strategy in energy crop breeding. Applying the (1, 3)-β-glucan-optimized conversion method on marine biomass from brown macroalgae with a naturally high (1, 3)-β-glucan content, we not only substantially increased ethanol yield but also demonstrated an effective co-fermentation of plant and marine biomass. This opens new perspectives in combining different kinds of feedstock for sustainable and efficient biofuel production, especially in coastal regions.

AB  - By diverting agricultural land away from food, feed, and livestock production, increased production of biofuel feedstock crops tend to drive up prices for agricultural commodities. But by how much? This question has been heavily debated in recent years, following the food price crisis of 2007-2008. A systematic review of 121 studies that quantifies the impact of biofuel demand on agricultural commodity markets reveals that there is still considerable uncertainty around the exact magnitude of the price response. Increased demand for corn ethanol in the United States-the focus of the majority of studies-is estimated to have accounted for 14-43% of the rise in US corn prices in the period 2000-2008. The divergence in results between studies is mainly due to different assumptions regarding demand and supply elasticities for agricultural commodities, and there is very limited empirical evidence that can help reduce the uncertainty around the value of these parameters, especially outside the United States. Few studies analyze the impact of biofuel demand beyond current or near-future levels and it is argued that estimated price effects can neither be extrapolated to large-scale biofuel demand shocks, nor are most models able to capture accurately the impacts of such shocks due to weaknesses in how land markets and land transformation process are modeled. To better gauge current and future impacts of biofuel demand on agricultural commodity markets, we need better data on supply and demand responses, both in the short and long run, as well as improved modeling of land competition and land-use change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a system of systems (SoS) Biofuel model considering the interdependency among the systems involved in biofuel development, including biofuel refinery location, transportation infrastructure, agricultural production and markets, environment, and social communities. The model provides the optimal infrastructure development and land-use allocation for biofuel production in a region considering socio-economic and water quality and quantity effects. The optimal development plan quantifies economic and hydrologic outputs and specifies biofuel refinery locations and capacities, refinery operations, land allocation between biofuel and food crops, optimal shipments of products and feedstock, and transportation infrastructure. The model is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and is solved by an algorithm developed specifically to cope with the large size of the optimization problem. In addition to the development of the SoS-Biofuel model, this paper demonstrates the functionality of the model and its ability to analyze the effects of interdependency among subsystems by applying it to a watershed in Illinois. The SoS-Biofuel model is used to investigate the effects of different biofuel polices on infrastructure needs and related environmental consequences, highlighting the interdependencies inherent in the optimal development of the entire system. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - A selection of multi-stemmed, drought-tolerant mallee eucalypts, planted in belt form and integrated with crops in dryland agricultural areas of Australia, may be able to produce biomass as a commercially attractive feedstock for biofuel production. This study aimed to determine if small (40-50 cm high) bunds along mallee belts could trap otherwise underutilized surface water runoff within paddocks, thereby increasing water available to the mallee trees and their growth rates. An experiment was established in 5 year-old Eucalyptus polybractea (RT Baker) mallee belts near the town of Narrogin in the central wheatbelt area of Western Australia. Bunds led to significant (12%) increases in biomass accumulation after about 2 years and 35% increases at around 3 years. Bunds also led to significant increases in predawn leaf water potential and significant decreases in soil water deficit within 12 months, which persisted for the remainder of the 39 month trial. We suggest that the increase in biomass accumulation was largely due to increased water availability, but that increased nutrient supply from run-on and trapping of organic residues may have also had some effect on bunded plots, despite our attempts to mitigate this effect by experimentally adding nutrients to all treatments. Results show that installing bunds along mallee belts would be a cost-effective investment at sites where within-paddock runoff is likely (i.e. gently sloping and with a loamy sand or heavier soil texture). Installation costs should be offset by improved biomass production within a few years and ongoing improvements in growth over the long term. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Biomass productivity is the main favorable trait of candidate bioenergy crops. Miscanthus × giganteus is a promising species, due to its high-yield potential and positive traits including low nutrient requirements and potential for C sequestration in soils. However, miscanthus productivity appears to be mostly related to water availability in the soil. This is important, particularly in Mediterranean regions where the risk of summer droughts is high. To date, there have been no studies on miscanthus responses under different soil conditions, while only a few have investigated the role of different crop managements, such as irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the effects of contrasting soil textures (i.e. silty-clay-loam vs. sandy-loam) and alternative agricultural intensification regimes (i.e. rainfed vs. irrigated and 0, 50, 100 kg ha-1 nitrogen fertilization), on miscanthus productivity were evaluated at three different harvest times for two consecutive years. Our results confirmed the importance of water availability in determining satisfactory yields in Mediterranean environments, and how soil and site characteristics strongly affect biomass production. We found that the aboveground dry yields varied between 5 Mg ha-1 up to 29 Mg ha-1. Conversely, nitrogen fertilization played only a minor role on crop productivity, and high fertilization levels were relatively inefficient. Finally, a marked decrease, of up to -40%, in the aboveground yield occurred when the harvest time was delayed from autumn to winter. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of determining crop responses on a site-by-site basis, and that decisions on the optimal harvest time should be driven by the biomass end use and other long-term considerations, such as yield stability and the maintenance of soil fertility. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are widely distributed aquatic flowering plants. Their high growth rate, starch content and suitability for bioremediation make them potential feedstock for biofuels. However, few natural duckweed resources have been investigated in China, and there is no information about total fatty acid (TFA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) composition of duckweeds from China. Here, the genetic diversity of a natural duckweed population collected from Lake Chao, China, was investigated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The 54 strains were categorised into four species in four genera, representing 12 distinct sequence types. Strains representing Lemna aequinoctialis and Spirodela polyrhiza were predominant. Interestingly, a surprisingly high degree of genetic diversification within L. aequinoctialis was observed. The four duckweed species revealed a uniform fatty acid composition, with three fatty acids, palmitic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, accounting for more than 80% of the TFA. The TFA in biomass varied among species, ranging from 1.05% (of dry weight, DW) for L. punctata and S. polyrhiza to 1.62% for Wolffia globosa. The four duckweed species contained similar TAG contents, 0.02% mg·DW-1. The fatty acid profiles of TAG were different from those of TFA, and also varied among the four species. The survey investigated the genetic diversity of duckweeds from Lake Chao, and provides an initial insight into TFA and TAG of four duckweed species, indicating that intraspecific and interspecific variations exist in the content and composition of both TFA and TAG in comparison with other studies. © 2015 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

AB  - High irradiance arid environments are promising, yet understudied, areas for biofuel production. We investigated the productivity and environmental trade-offs of growing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) as a biofuel feedstock in the low deserts of California (CA). Using a 5.3 ha experimental field in the Imperial Valley, CA, we measured aboveground biomass production and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and H2O via eddy covariance over three growing periods between February and November 2012. Environmental conditions were extreme, with high irradiance, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and air temperature throughout the growing season. Air temperature peaked in August with a maximum of 45.7 °C. Sorghum produced an annual aboveground biomass yield of 43.7 Mg per hectare. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was highest during the summer growth period and reached a maximum of -68 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Water use efficiency, or biomass water ratio (BWR), was high (4.0 g dry biomass kg-1 H2O) despite high seasonal evapotranspiration (1094 kg H2O m-2). The BWR of sorghum surpassed that of many C4 biofuel candidate crops in the United States, as well as that of alfalfa which is currently widely grown in the Imperial Valley. Sorghum also outperformed many US biofuel crops in terms of radiation use efficiency (RUE), achieving 1.5 g dry biomass MJ-1. We found no evidence of saturation of NEE at high levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (up to 2250 μmol m-2 s-1). In addition, we found no evidence that NEE was inhibited by either high VPD or air temperature during peak photosynthetic phases. The combination of high productivity, high BWR, and high RUE suggests that sorghum is well adapted to this extreme environment. The biomass production rates and efficiency metrics spanning three growing periods provide fundamental data for future Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), which are needed to assess the sustainability of this sorghum biofuel feedstock system. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Because of climate change, insufficient soil moisture may increasingly limit crop productivity in certain regions of the world. This may be particularly consequential for biofuel crops, many of which will likely be grown in drought-prone soils to avoid competition with food crops. Biochar is the byproduct of a biofuel production method called pyrolysis. If pyrolysis becomes more common as some scientists predict, biochar will become more widely available. We asked, therefore, whether the addition of biochar to soils could significantly increase the availability of water to a crop. Biochar made from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) shoots was added at the rate of 1% of dry weight to four soils of varying texture, and available water contents were calculated as the difference between field capacity and permanent wilting point water contents. Biochar addition significantly increased the available water contents of the soils by both increasing the amount of water held at field capacity and allowing plants to draw the soil to a lower water content before wilting. Among the four soils tested, biochar amendment resulted in an additional 0.8-2.7 d of transpiration, which could increase productivity in drought-prone regions or reduce the frequency of irrigation. Biochar amendment of soils may thus be a viable means of mitigating some of the predicted decrease in water availability accompanying climate change that could limit the future productivity of biofuel crops. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol is widely believed to offer substantial environmental advantages over petroleum fuels and grain-based ethanol, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. The environmental impacts of biofuels are largely caused by precombustion activities, feedstock production and conversion facility operations. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is required to understand these impacts. This article describes a field-to-blending terminal LCA of cellulosic ethanol produced by biochemical conversion (hydrolysis and fermentation) using corn stover or switchgrass as feedstock. This LCA develops unique models for most elements of the biofuel production process and assigns environmental impact to different phases of production. More than 30 scenarios are evaluated, reflecting a range of feedstock, technology and scale options for near-term and future facilities. Cellulosic ethanol, as modeled here, has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based liquid transportation fuels, though substantial uncertainty exists. Most of the conservative scenarios estimate GHG emissions of approximately 45-60 g carbon dioxide equivalent per MJ of delivered fuel (g CO2e MJ-1) without credit for coproducts, and 20-30 g CO2e MJ-1 when coproducts are considered. Under most scenarios, feedstock production, grinding and transport dominate the total GHG footprint. The most optimistic scenarios include sequestration of carbon in soil and have GHG emissions below zero g CO2e MJ-1, while the most pessimistic have life-cycle GHG emissions higher than petroleum gasoline. Soil carbon changes are the greatest source of uncertainty, dominating all other sources of GHG emissions at the upper bound of their uncertainty. Many LCAs of biofuels are narrowly constrained to GHG emissions and energy; however, these narrow assessments may miss important environmental impacts. To ensure a more holistic assessment of environmental performance, a complete life cycle inventory, with over 1100 tracked material and energy flows for each scenario is provided in the online supplementary material for this article. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy could contribute both to the reduction of greenhouse gases and to increased energy security, but the extent of this contribution strongly depends on the cost and potential of biomass resources. For Sweden, this study investigates how the implementation of policies for CO2 reduction and for phase out of fossil fuels in road transport affect the future utilization of biomass, in the stationary energy system and in the transport sector, and its price. The analysis is based on the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which includes a comprehensive representation of the national energy system. For the analysis, the biomass supply representation of MARKAL_Sweden is updated and improved by the use of, e.g., forestry forecasting modeling and through construction of detailed biomass supply curves. A time horizon up to 2050 is applied. The results indicate a potential for significantly higher use of bioenergy. In the main analysis scenario, in which CO2 reduction of 80% by 2050 is imposed on the Swedish energy system, the total bioenergy utilization increases by 63% by 2050 compared to 2010. The largest increase occurs in the transport sector, which by 2050 accounts for 43% of the total primary bioenergy use. The high demand and strong competition significantly increase biomass prices and lead to the utilization of higher cost biomass sources such as stumps and cultivated energy forest, as well as use of pulpwood resources for energy purposes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed at the investigation of the mechanisms of acidogenesis, which is a key process during anaerobic digestion. To expose possible bottlenecks, specific activities of the key enzymes of acidification, such as acetate kinase (Ack, 0.23-0.99U mg-1 protein), butyrate kinase (Buk, &lt;0.03Umg-1 protein) and butyryl-CoA:acetate-CoA transferase (But, 3.24-7.64Umg-1 protein), were determined in cell free extracts of biogas reactor content from three different biogas reactors. Furthermore, the detection of Ack was successful via Western blot analysis. Quantification of corresponding functional genes encoding Buk (buk) and But (but) was not feasible, although an amplification was possible. Thus, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on respective gene fragments. Four new clades of possible butyrate-producing bacteria were postulated, as well as bacteria of the genera Roseburia or Clostridium identified. The low Buk activity was in contrast to the high specific But activity in the analysed samples. Butyrate formation via Buk activity does barely occur in the investigated biogas reactor. Specific enzyme activities (Ack, Buk and But) in samples drawn from three different biogas reactors correlated with ammonia and ammonium concentrations (NH3 and NH4+-N), and a negative dependency can be postulated. Thus, high concentrations of NH3 and NH4+-N may lead to a bottleneck in acidogenesis due to decreased specific acidogenic enzyme activities. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Generous amount of waste food as refused fruits and vegetables are obtained on a global scale that is usually disposed in landfill or oceans. The waste fruits are enriched with fructose, glucose and sucrose along with minor amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose that could potentially be converted to biofuels and biochemicals. With this objective, fructose was used as a model compound of waste fruits and vegetables for gasification in supercritical water using a continuous flow tubular reactor. Different parameters influencing supercritical water gasification were investigated in this study such as temperature (550-700 °C), residence time (30-75 s), feed concentration (4-10 wt%) and catalyst concentration (0.2-0.8 wt%) at a constant pressure of 25 MPa. Total gas yields, carbon gasification efficiency and hydrogen yields improved at an optimal temperature (700 °C), feed concentration (4 wt%) and residence time (60 s). Fructose gasification with 0.8 wt% KOH enhanced the selectivity for hydrogen (10.67 mol/mol) compared to those by 0.8 wt% NaOH (9.86 mol/mol) and non-catalytic gasification (3.37 mol/mol). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study presents a decision support tool (DST) to enhance methane generation at individual landfill sites. To date there is no such tool available to provide landfill decision makers with clear and simplified information to evaluate biochemical processes within a landfill site, to assess performance of gas production and to identify potential remedies to any issues. The current lack in understanding stems from the complexity of the landfill waste degradation process. Two scoring sets for landfill gas production performance are calculated with the tool: (1) methane output score which measures the deviation of the actual methane output rate at each site which the prediction generated by the first order decay model LandGEM; and (2) landfill gas indicators' score, which measures the deviation of the landfill gas indicators from their ideal ranges for optimal methane generation conditions. Landfill gas indicators include moisture content, temperature, alkalinity, pH, BOD, COD, BOD/COD ratio, ammonia, chloride, iron and zinc. A total landfill gas indicator score is provided using multi-criteria analysis to calculate the sum of weighted scores for each indicator. The weights for each indicator are calculated using an analytical hierarchical process. The tool is tested against five real scenarios for landfill sites in UK with a range of good, average and poor landfill methane generation over a one year period (2012). An interpretation of the results is given for each scenario and recommendations are highlighted for methane output rate enhancement. Results demonstrate how the tool can help landfill managers and operators to enhance their understanding of methane generation at a site-specific level, track landfill methane generation over time, compare and rank sites, and identify problems areas within a landfill site. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant, renewable source of polysaccharides that could be available in amounts sufficient to provide a source of sugars for carbon neutral biofuel production. We review the background to biofuels production in the US from corn sugars and subsequent R and D efforts to saccharify plant biomass to provide an alternative sugar source. Research efforts and programs have generally not addressed the key technical hurdles in providing a commodity-scale supply of biomass and in developing biological routes to saccharify it at high yields. Techno-economic analyses of proposed processes highlight the importance of biomass cost, the role of pretreatment on both inhibitor generation, and the contribution of enzyme costs to saccharification. Alternatives, such as the production of fatty acids by microalgae, have comparable technical hurdles. Although there is a regulatory framework for biofuels, which is discussed, a credible biological process for large-scale, cost-effective production of lignocellulosic biofuels remains elusive. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Aim: Studies of fire activity along environmental gradients have been undertaken, but the results of such studies have yet to be integrated with fire-regime analysis. We characterize fire-regime components along climate gradients and a gradient of human influence. Location: We focus on a climatically diverse region of north-western North America extending from northern British Columbia, Canada, to northern Utah and Colorado, USA. Methods: We used a multivariate framework to collapse 12 climatic variables into two major climate gradients and binned them into 73 discrete climate domains. We examined variation in fire-regime components (frequency, size, severity, seasonality and cause) across climate domains. Fire-regime attributes were compiled from existing databases and Landsat imagery for 1897 large fires. Relationships among the fire-regime components, climate gradients and human influence were examined through bivariate regressions. The unique contribution of human influence was also assessed. Results: A primary climate gradient of temperature and summer precipitation and a secondary gradient of continentality and winter precipitation in the study area were identified. Fire occupied a distinct central region of such climate space, within which fire-regime components varied considerably. We identified significant interrelations between fire-regime components of fire size, frequency, burn severity and cause. The influence of humans was apparent in patterns of burn severity and ignition cause. Main conclusions: Wildfire activity is highest where thermal and moisture gradients converge to promote fuel production, flammability and ignitions. Having linked fire-regime components to large-scale climate gradients, we show that fire regimes - like the climate that controls them - are a part of a continuum, expanding on models of varying constraints on fire activity. The observed relationships between fire-regime components, together with the distinct role of climatic and human influences, generate variation in biotic communities. Thus, future changes to climate may lead to ecological changes through altered fire regimes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - High-performance computing has facilitated development of biomass production models that capture the key mechanisms underlying production at high spatial and temporal resolution. Direct responses to increasing [CO2] and temperature are important to long-lived emerging woody bioenergy crops. Fast-growing willow (Salix spp.) within short rotation coppice (SRC) has considerable potential as a renewable biomass source, but performance over wider environmental conditions and under climate change is uncertain. We extended the bioenergy crop modeling platform, BioCro, to SRC willow by adding coppicing and C3 photosynthesis subroutines, and modifying subroutines for perennation, allocation, morphology, phenology and development. Parameterization with measurements of leaf photosynthesis, allocation and phenology gave agreement of modeled with measured yield across 23 sites in Europe and North America. Predictions for the continental USA suggest yields of ≥17Mgha-1year-1 in a 4 year rotation. Rising temperature decreased predicted yields, an effect partially ameliorated by rising [CO2]. This model, based on over 100 equations describing the physiological and biophysical mechanisms underlying production, provides a new framework for utilizing mechanism of plant responses to the environment, including future climates. As an open-source tool, it is made available here as a community resource for further application, improvement and adaptation. Willows in short rotation coppicing are emerging as major sustainable feedstocks for bioenergy. As long-lived C3 crops, they will experience significant global change. Within the BioCro framework we have developed a new model for this crop that captures the key mechanisms of response to rising atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation to predict yield and yield stability across the USA. The model, is mechanistically rich and based on over 100 equations describing the physiological and biophysical mechanisms underlying production. It showed a good ability to predict recorded yields at a range of sites in Europe and N. America given soil and climate data. High yields, exceeding those of the perennial C4 grass feedstocks Miscanthus and switchgrass were predicted across much of the north-east USA, reaching &gt;17 Mt ha-1 yr-1 at the best locations. Rising temperatures over this century decreased yields, an effect partially ameliorated by rising [CO2]. Using the BioCro framework, common to other perennial feedstocks, avoids confounding biological differences in species comparisons with differences in model structure and model assumptions. As an open-source tool, it is made available here as a community resource for further application, improvement, and adaptation. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of source separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste is an increasing waste valorization alternative instead of incineration or landfilling of untreated biodegradable wastes. Nevertheless, a significant portion of biodegradable wastes entering the plant is lost in pre-treatments and post-treatments of anaerobic digestion facilities together with other improper materials such as plastics, paper, textile materials and metals. The rejected materials lost in these stages have two main implications: (i) less organic material enters to digesters and, as a consequence, there is a loss of biogas production and (ii) the rejected materials end up in landfills or incinerators contributing to environmental impacts such as global warming or eutrophication.The main goals of this study are (i) to estimate potential losses of biogas in the rejected solid materials generated during the pre- and post-treatments of two full-scale anaerobic digestion facilities and (ii) to evaluate the environmental burdens associated to the final disposal (landfill or incineration) of these rejected materials by means of Life Cycle Assessment.This study shows that there is a lost of potential biogas production, ranging from 8% to 15%, due to the loss of organic matter during pre-treatment stages in anaerobic digestion facilities. From an environmental point of view, the Life Cycle Assessment shows that the incineration scenario is the most favorable alternative for eight out of nine impact categories compared with the landfill scenario. The studied impact categories are Climate Change, Fossil depletion, Freshwater eutrophication, Marine eutrophication, Ozone depletion, Particulate matter formation, Photochemical oxidant formation, Terrestrial acidification and Water depletion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of biogas from energy crops, organic waste and manure has augmented considerably the amounts of digestate available in Flanders. This has pushed authorities to steadily introduce legislative changes to promote its use as a fertilising agent. There is limited arable land in Flanders, which entails that digestate has to compete with animal manure to be spread. This forces many anaerobic digestion plants to further treat digestate in such a way that it can either be exported or the nitrogen be removed. Nevertheless, the environmental impact of these treatment options is still widely unknown, as well as the influence of these impacts on the sustainability of Flemish anaerobic digestion plants in comparison to other regions where spreading of raw digestate is allowed. Despite important economic aspects that must be considered, the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is suggested in this study to identify the environmental impacts of spreading digestate directly as compared to four different treatment technologies. Results suggest relevant environmental gains when the digestate mix is treated using the examined conversion technologies prior to spreading, although important trade-offs between impact categories were observed and discussed. The promising results of digestate conversion technologies suggest that further LCA analyses should be performed to delve into, for instance, the appropriateness to shift to nutrient recovery technologies rather than digestate conversion treatments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High yields are a priority in managing biomass for renewable energy, but the environmental impacts of various feedstocks and production systems should be equally considered. Mixed-species, perennial grasslands enrolled in conservation programs are being considered as a source of biomass for renewable energy. Conservation grasslands are crucial in sustaining native biodiversity throughout the US Upper Midwest, and the effects of biomass harvest on biodiversity are largely unknown. We measured the effect of late-season biomass harvest on plant community composition in conservation grasslands in three regions of Minnesota, USA from 2009 to 2012. Temporal trends in plant species composition within harvested grasslands were compared to unharvested grasslands using mixed effects models. A before-after control-impact approach using effect sizes was applied to focus on pre- and postharvest conditions. Production-scale biomass harvest did not affect plant species richness, species or functional group diversity, nor change the relative abundance of the main plant functional groups. Differences in the relative abundances of plant functional groups were observed across locations; and at some locations, changed through time. The proportion of non-native species remained constant, while the proportion of noxious weeds decreased through time in both harvested and unharvested grasslands at the central location. Ordination revealed patterns in species composition due to location, but not due to harvest treatment. Therefore, habitat and bioenergy characteristics related to grassland plant communities are not expected to change due to short-term or intermittent late-season biomass harvest. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - What are the feasibility, costs, and environmental implications of large-scale bioenegry? We investigate this question by developing a detailed representation of bioenergy in a global economy-wide model. We develop a scenario with a global carbon dioxide price, applied to all anthropogenic emissions except those from land use change, that rises from $25 per metric ton in 2015 to $99 in 2050. This creates market conditions favorable to biomass energy, resulting in global non-traditional bioenergy production of ~. 150 exajoules (EJ) in 2050. By comparison, in 2010, global energy production was primarily from coal (138 EJ), oil (171 EJ), and gas (106 EJ). With this policy, 2050 emissions are 42% less in our Base Policy case than our Reference case, although extending the scope of the carbon price to include emissions from land use change would reduce 2050 emissions by 52% relative to the same baseline. Our results from various policy scenarios show that lignocellulosic (LC) ethanol may become the major form of bioenergy, if its production costs fall by amounts predicted in a recent survey and ethanol blending constraints disappear by 2030; however, if its costs remain higher than expected or the ethanol blend wall continues to bind, bioelectricity and bioheat may prevail. Higher LC ethanol costs may also result in the expanded production of first-generation biofuels (ethanol from sugarcane and corn) so that they remain in the fuel mix through 2050. Deforestation occurs if emissions from land use change are not priced, although the availability of biomass residues and improvements in crop yields and conversion efficiencies mitigate pressure on land markets. As regions are linked via international agricultural markets, irrespective of the location of bioenergy production, natural forest decreases are largest in regions with the lowest barriers to deforestation. In 2050, the combination of carbon price and bioenergy production increases food prices by 3.2%-5.2%, with bioenergy accounting for 1.3%-3.5%. © 2015.

AB  - The accelerated growth in biofuel markets has both created and reinforced linkages between agriculture and energy. The evolution of biofuel markets over the next 10-20years and the implications for energy, agriculture, and the environment are uncertain. Building on an integrated agriculture-energy modeling framework, this study analyzes a baseline and three alternative scenarios: two scenarios based on energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and one based on assumptions regarding cellulosic biomass availability. By examining the impact of scenarios driven by (a) changes in the energy sector and (b) changes in the agricultural sector, we can compare the differential effects on biofuels markets, commodity prices and quantities in each sector, and CO2 emissions. Scenario comparisons show biofuel markets affected more by crude oil prices than natural gas prices. However, higher natural gas prices shift the biofuel production mix away from corn-grain based to more cellulosic ethanol via multiple mechanisms. Alternatively, the scenario with no cellulosic feedstock lowers total ethanol production and raises ethanol and corn prices. In terms of environmental impacts, higher ethanol levels driven by higher oil prices lead to lower CO2 emissions. In comparison, the no cellulosic scenario results in the highest CO2 trajectory relative to the baseline. © 2015.

AB  - Soil is a vital life supporting system of the Planet Earth. However, it has been estimated that around 25% the global soils are highly degraded and 44% are moderately degraded mainly due to the pollution of metals and metalloids, persistent organic pollutants, pesticides, radionuclides etc. Additionally, the pollution due to new and emerging pollutants such as antibiotics, disinfectants, flame retardants, nanoparticles etc pose an additional threat to the homeostasis of the soil system. Therefore, sustainable management of contaminated soils are essential for maintaining the ecosystem services. Though chemical and physical methods are widely pursued for the remediation of contaminated soils, phytotechnolgies (plant-based clean-up technologies) are outweighed and often preferred as a clean and carbon-neutral solution for the remediation and sustainable management of the contaminated soils. Apart from that, plant-based clean-up also provide phytoprodcuts such as biomass, biofuels and other industrially important chemicals for bio-based entrepreneurial activities during remediation. However, phytoremediation does not give desired results in soil contaminated with mixed/multiple pollutants. Furthermore, it is unclear that how changing climate will affect the plant-microbe interactions and pollutants behaviour in the soil system. Moreover, there is only limited information available on the plant-microbe-pollutants nexus under changing climate. Therefore, the present work is aimed to (i) address the difficulties in remediation of soils contaminated with multiple pollutants (ii) delineate the plant-microbe-pollutant and climate nexus and (iii) identify the key sustainability indicators for evaluating the remediated system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The conversion of biomass to energy is a complex process whose environmental sustainability must be assessed. In the present work, global and local emissions of a biogas plant are evaluated considering two alternative end uses: combustion of biogas in a combined heat and power unit or upgrading of biogas to biomethane and subsequent injection to the gas grid or use in transports. Global emissions are estimated by using the carbon footprint methodology, comparing the scenarios on the basis of the same functional unit. The results show a CO2 reduction for biogas combustion equivalent to that of biomethane used as fuel in transports. If the thermal energy produced by the biogas cogenerator is not used, the greenhouse gas balance approaches to zero. A second part of the work considers the contribution of methane losses from the upgrading process. The equivalent CO2 saving raises considerably if methane slip is limited to 0.05%, while the process results no longer sustainable for a methane loss of 4%. The evaluation of local impacts considers the emission of NOx and particulate matter (PM) generated by biogas combustion and its alternative solution. A Gaussian model of dispersion is applied and ground level iso-concentration maps are generated. The results show a variable extension of the plume which may a cause non-negligible impact of these pollutants in the surroundings of the source. Adopting biomethane as the end use solution could partly or totally avoid these local impacts. In conclusion, this work points out that adopting the biomethane solution may result environmentally sustainable in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction of NOx and PM local emission. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Life cycle (LC) of ethanol has been evaluated to determine the environmental and economical viability of ethanol that was derived from biosyngas fermentation process (gasification-biosynthesis). Four scenarios [S1: untreated (raw), S2: treated (torrefied); S3: untreated-chemical looping gasification (CLG), S4: treated-CLG] were considered. The simulated biosyngas composition was used in this evaluation process. The GHG emissions and production cost varied from 1.19 to 1.32kg-CO2e/L and 0.78 to 0.90$/L, respectively, which were found to be dependent on the scenarios. The environmental and economical viability was found be improved when untreated feedstock was used instead of treated feedstock. Although the GHG emissions slightly reduced in the case of CLG process, production cost was nominally increased because of the cost incurred by the use of CaO. This study revealed that miscanthus is a promising feedstock for the ethanol industry, even if it is grown on marginal land, which can help abate GHG emissions. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Current and future demand for food, feed, fiber, and energy require novel approaches to land management, which demands that multifunctional landscapes are created to integrate various ecosystem functions into a sustainable land use. We developed an approach to design such landscapes at a field scale to minimize concerns of land use change, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with production of food and bioenergy. This study leverages concepts of nutrient recovery and phytoremediation to place bioenergy crops on the landscape to recover nutrients released to watersheds by commodity crops. Crop placement is determined by evaluating spatial variability of: 1) soils, 2) surface flow pathways, 3) shallow groundwater flow gradients, 4) subsurface nitrate concentrations, and 5) primary crop yield. A 0.8ha bioenergy buffer was designed within a 6.5ha field to intercept concentrated surface flow, capture and use nitrate leachate, and minimize use of productive areas. Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) simulations show that on average, a switchgrass (Panicum Virgatum L.) or willow (Salix spp.) buffer within this catchment according to this design could reduce annual leached NO3 by 61 or 59% and N2O emission by 5.5 or 10.8%, respectively, produce 8.7 or 9.7Mgha-1 of biomass respectively, and displace 6.7Mgha-1 of corn (Zea mays L.) grain. Therefore, placement of bioenergy crops has the potential to increase environmental sustainability when the pairing of location and crop type result in minimal disruption of current food production systems and provides additional environmental benefits. © 2015.

AB  - A micrometeorological method, combining an inverse dispersion technique with path-integrated concentration measurements, was applied on an Austrian biogas plant over the period of more than one year to determine emissions of the whole plant. Measurement campaigns were conducted to characterize the emission response to operational activities (e.g. digestate management) and meteorological changes. When digestate storage tanks were filled, an average emission rate of 7.2kg CH4/h (approx. 4% of the calculated CH4 production) was determined, while 5.4kg CH4/h of emissions (approx. 3% of the calculated CH4 production) were quantified after the tanks had been emptied. It could be observed that besides the operation mode (e.g. filling level or agitation of the openly stored digestate, maintenance), the meteorological conditions such as wind speed and solar radiation (e.g. heat flux) can also affect the emission rate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The capacity of groundwater ecosystem to recover from contamination by organic chemicals is a vital concern for environmental scientists. A pilot-scale aquifer system was used to investigate the long-term dynamics of contaminants, groundwater geochemistry, and microbial community structure (by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR) throughout the 5-year life cycle of a surrogate ethanol blend fuel plume (10% ethanol + 50 mg/L benzene + 50 mg/L toluene). Two-year continuous ethanol-blended release significantly changed the groundwater geochemistry (resulted in anaerobic, low pH, and organotrophic conditions) and increased bacterial and archaeal populations by 82- and 314-fold respectively. Various anaerobic heterotrophs (fermenters, acetogens, methanogens, and hydrocarbon degraders) were enriched. Two years after the release was shut off, all contaminants and their degradation byproducts disappeared and groundwater geochemistry completely restored to the pre-release states (aerobic, neutral pH, and oligotrophic). Bacterial and archaeal populations declined by 18- and 45-fold respectively (relative to the time of shut off). Microbial community structure reverted towards the pre-release states and alpha diversity indices rebounded, suggesting the resilience of microbial community to ethanol blend releases. We also found shifts from O2-sensitive methanogens (e.g., Methanobacterium) to methanogens that are not so sensitive to O2 (e.g., Methanosarcina and Methanocella), which is likely to contribute to the persistence of methanogens and methane generation following the source removal. Overall, the rapid disappearance of contaminants and their metabolites, rebound of geochemical footprints, and resilience of microbial community unequivocally document the natural capacity of groundwater ecosystem to attenuate and recover from a large volume of catastrophic spill of ethanol-based biofuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Selecting the most sustainable biomass crop type for biofuel production is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving various conflicting criteria. In this paper, we propose a unique stochastic analytical hierarchy process (AHP) that can handle uncertain information and identify weights of criteria in the MCDM problem. By utilizing the beta distribution and approximating its median, we convert various types of expert evaluations including imprecise values into crisp values. We ensure consistency in each evaluation matrix before aggregating expert judgments. We then demonstrate use of the model by applying it to sustainable biomass crop selection. In order to define a comprehensive list of the selection criteria, we utilize the existing literature and opinions of experts including farmers, government specialists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and faculty members in the areas of biomass and bioenergy. The evaluation model includes three main sustainability criteria defined as economic, environmental, and social aspects associated with a total of 16 sub-criteria. We apply the proposed model to biomass alternatives including switchgrass, Miscanthus, sugarcane, corn, and wheat in Kansas. Results show the weights of economic, environmental, and social aspects to be 0.59, 0.26, and 0.15, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the score of switchgrass increases if environmental criteria are emphasized. On the other hand, wheat and corn become more favorable than other alternatives if priority is given to economic factors. The most sustainable biomass sources in different regions can be determined by applying the presented selection hierarchy. The proposed stochastic AHP methodology can also be utilized for other complex multi-criteria decision-making problems with uncertain information and multiple stakeholders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The bioeconomy is gaining growing attention as a perceived win-win strategy for environment and economy in the EU. However, the EU already has a disproportionately high global cropland footprint compared to the world average, and uses more cropland than domestically available to supply its demand for agricultural products. There is a risk that uncontrolled growth of the bioeconomy will increase land use pressures abroad. For that reason, a monitoring system is needed to account for the global land use of European consumption. The aim of this paper is to take a closer look at the tools needed to monitor global cropland footprints, as well as the targets needed to benchmark development. This paper reviews recent developments in land footprint accounting approaches and applies the method of global land use accounting to calculate the global cropland footprint of the EU-27 for the years between 2000 and 2011. It finds a slight decrease in per capita cropland footprints over the past decade (of around 1% annually, reaching 0.29. ha/cap in 2011) and advocates promoting a further decrease in per capita cropland requirements (of around 2% annually) to reach global land use targets for keeping consumption within the safe operating space of planetary boundaries by 2030. It argues that strategic land reduction targets may still go hand in hand with the growth of a smart, innovative and sustainable bioeconomy by reinforcing the need for policies that support greater efficiency across the life-cycle and reduce wasteful and excessive consumption practices. Recommendations for further improving land footprint accounting are given. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar addition to soil is a promising option for climate change mitigation and is recognized to exert beneficial effects on soil fertility. However, recent meta-analysis documented controversial effects on soil-plant interactions and on crop yields response. The data presented in this paper are the results of a field experiment on a processing tomato crop aiming to enhance the knowledge on the real applicability of biochar at farm scale in a high fertility alkaline soil. The effects of two biochar types on soil properties and on quantitative and qualitative parameters of processing tomato were evaluated. Biochar application significantly increased the soil carbon content, the soil cation exchange capacity and the availability of NH4+, P and K. Moreover, it stimulated plant growth and N, P and base cation contents at harvest, reducing the leaf water potential in the warmer period. These results demonstrate that also intensive cultivations in fertile soil can benefit from biochar amendment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is a promising bioenergy crop, but a sustainable production system for this crop has not yet been well developed. There is also concern about competing land use between crop productions for bioenergy or food use. One approach to overcoming this concern and developing sustainable production systems for bioenergy crops is potentially replacing the fallow period in wheat-based cropping systems with bioenergy crops. The agronomic and economic benefits of growing camelina in rotation with winter wheat were evaluated in a replicated rotation study from 2008 to 2011 in the Northern Great Plains (NGP), focusing on the effects on wheat yield and overall profitability of the cropping system. Average winter wheat yields were 2401 and 1858 kg ha-1 following camelina and barley, respectively, representing a 13.2 and 32.8% winter wheat yield reduction compared to the fallow-winter wheat rotation (2766 kg ha-1). Lower winter wheat yield in the alternative systems were offset by 907kgha-1 camelina and 1779kgha-1 barley yields. Economic analyses revealed that at existing market prices and production costs, the traditional fallow-winter wheat rotation provides greater net returns to growers due to substantially lower variable costs of the system. Scenario analyses that use more optimized, lower cost camelina production practices show that the net profits of camelina-wheat system could be closer to those in the fallow-wheat system. However, higher grain price and/or greater grain yield of camelina are essential to attract producers to include camelina in their cropping systems. Although the fallow-wheat system resulted in higher short-run net returns, the total biomass production and crop residue return to soil is much greater in camelina-wheat than fallow-wheat rotation, which is likely to improve soil quality and productivity in the long run. © 2015 Z.

AB  - Background and Aims: Semi-natural grasslands can combine biomass production with provision of multiple ecosystem services. Unfortunately, grassland establishment can be unpredictable and vulnerable to exotic plant invasion, potentially due to soil legacies from previous cultivation. Native plants could mitigate these legacies by changing soil attributes and facilitating other native grassland species. However, facilitation may be affected by nitrogen (N) fertilization, added during and after establishment. Methods: We conditioned soils in a former maize-soybean field for 3 years using multiple native or exotic perennial species or a maize-soybean rotation. Half of each plot received N fertilizer. Native and exotic grassland perennials were grown on these conditioned soils in the greenhouse, with N added to half of the pots, and biomass was measured. Results: Consistent facilitation of native species by other natives was not observed, nor did invasive species facilitate other invasives. Soil conditioning affected individual plant species’ biomass in several instances. Field N addition had little effect on plant biomass, while greenhouse N addition increased native more than exotic plant biomass, but did not alter the overall pattern of facilitation. Conclusions: Native plants failed to facilitate native prairie establishment in this work, suggesting resistance to conditioning on former intensive, high-input agricultural soils. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The scarcity of water in semiarid regions requires alternative sources for irrigation to improve agricultural production. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of produced water from oil exploration on the structure of soil mesofauna during the dry and rainy seasons in irrigated sunflower and castor bean fields in a Brazilian semiarid region. Three irrigation treatments were applied on plots cultivated with castor beans and sunflowers: produced water treated by filtration (filtrated) or treated by reverse osmosis (reverse osmosis) and groundwater. The mesofauna under the biofuel crops was collected and identified during the dry and rainy seasons. Although the abundance and richness of the total fauna did not differ between seasons in sunflower plots, the community was altered. In castor beans, the abundance, richness, and community of mesofauna observed in plots irrigated with produced water differed from the groundwater treatment. Irrigation with produced water promotes important changes in soil fauna community that justify their assessment for the maintenance and monitoring of agroecosystems. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Biochars derived from bamboo, coconut shell, pine wood shavings, and sugarcane bagasse were applied into Ultisol to investigate their effects on Cd(II) immobilization. After 360 days of incubation, the physical/chemical properties of the Ultisol were improved by the addition of different biochars. As a result, the maximum adsorption capacities of soil for Cd(II) were increased from 8.02 to 9.07–11.51 mmol/kg, and bamboo biochar showed the highest effect on Cd(II) immobilization. The Langmuir model (R2 &gt; 0.983) fitted the data better than the Freundlich model (R2 were 0.902–0.937). Column leaching experiments suggested that biochar can also increase the immobilization of Cd(II) under leaching conditions. Biochar mainly increased the weak/unstable binding force of Cd(II) by soil, such as ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, physical adsorption, and carbonate precipitation. In addition, a significant enhancement of surface complexation was also observed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The effects of sewage sludge (SS) and its derived biochar (SSBC) on the availability and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and potential toxic elements (PTEs) by Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) fruits grown in contaminated urban soil were investigated. Increasing application rates of SS and SSBC (2, 5, and 10 %) decreased PAH availability and, correspondingly, PAH accumulation (22–39 and 48–62 %, respectively) into tomato. SSBC was more effective in this regard. The available concentrations of PAHs (Σ16PAH) in the SSBC treatments were significantly reduced (from 30.0–47.3 %) as compared to the control treatment. The availability of high-molecular-weight PAHs (containing four to six benzene rings) was greatly affected, while low-molecular-weight PAHs (containing two to three benzene rings) was less affected by SSBC amendments. The addition of SSBC showed the least effect on bioaccumulation of naphthalene (two-ring PAH; 24.5–32.6 %), while the highest effect was observed for benzo(b)fluoranthene (five-ring PAH; 3.1–86.8 %) and benzo(g,h,i)perylene (six-ring PAH; 51.8–84.2 %). In contrast, increasing application rates of SS successively increased PTE (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) availability and accumulation (15–139 %) into tomato while SSBC successively decreased PTE availability and accumulation (17–91 %). Changes in accumulation varied with PTE and the extent to which PTE concentrations in soil was elevated. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Plants like sweet clover (Melilotus spp.) are not suitable as fodder for cattle because of harmful effects of the plant secondary metabolite coumarin. As an alternative usage, the applicability of coumarin-rich plants as substrates for biogas production was investigated. When coumarin was added to continuous fermentation processes codigesting grass silage and cow manure, it caused a strong inhibition noticeable as decrease of biogas production by 19% and increase of metabolite concentrations to an organic acids/alkalinity ratio higher than 0.3 gorganic acids gCaCO3-1. Microbial communities of methanogenic archaea were dominated by the genera Methanosarcina (77%) and Methanoculleus (11%). This community composition was not influenced by coumarin addition. The bacterial community analysis unraveled a divergence caused by coumarin addition correlating with the anaerobic degradation of coumarin and the recovery of the biogas process. As a consequence, biogas production resumed similar to the coumarin-free control with a biogas yield of 0.34 LN gvolatile solids-1 and at initial metabolite concentrations (~0.2 gorganic acids gCaCO3-1). Coumarin acts as inhibitor and as substrate during anaerobic digestion. Hence, coumarin-rich plants might be suitable for biogas production, but should only be used after adaptation of the microbial community to coumarin. © FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.

AB  - A feasibility study was performed to assess the technical and economic merits of retrofitting biogas-based cogeneration systems to district heating networks. Three district heating plants were selected as candidates for accommodating heat recovery from nearby waste treatment stations, where a massive amount of biogas can be produced on a regular basis. The scenario involves constructing cogeneration systems in each waste treatment station and producing electricity and heat. The amounts of biogas production for each station are estimated based on the monthly treatment capacities surveyed over the most recent years. Heat produced by the cogeneration system is first consumed on site by the waste treatment system to keep the operating temperature at a proper level. If surplus heat is available, it will be transported to the nearest district heating plant. The year-round operation of the cogeneration system was simulated to estimate the electricity and heat production. We considered cost associated with the installation of the cogeneration system and piping as initial investments. Profits from selling electricity and recovering heat are counted as income, while costs associated with buying biogas are expenses. Simple payback periods of 2-10 years were projected under the current economic conditions of South Korea. We found that most of the proposed scenarios can contribute to both energy savings and environmental protection. © International Solid Waste Association.

AB  - This study presents the first in-depth analysis of CO2 limitation on the biomass productivity of the biofuel candidate marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata. Net photosynthesis decreased by 60 from 125 to 50 μmolO2L-1h-1 over a 12 h light cycle as a direct result of carbon limitation. Continuous dissolved O2 and pH measurements were used to develop a detailed diurnal mechanism for the interaction between photosynthesis, gas exchange and carbonate chemistry in the photo-bioreactor. Gas exchange determined the degree of carbon limitation experienced by the algae. Carbon limitation was confirmed by delivering more CO2, which increased net photosynthesis back to its steady-state maximum. This study highlights the importance of maintaining replete carbon concentrations in photo-bioreactors and other culturing facilities, either by constant pH operation or preferably by designing a feedback loop based on the dissolved O2 concentration. Just grow it: We present the first in-depth analysis of CO2 limitation on biomass productivity of the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata.

AB  - We demonstrate the effectiveness of a new method for quantifying radiative forcing from land use and land cover change (LULCC) within an integrated assessment model, the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). The method relies on geographically differentiated estimates of radiative forcing from albedo change associated with major land cover transitions derived from the Community Earth System Model. We find that conversion of 1 km2 of woody vegetation (forest and shrublands) to non-woody vegetation (crops and grassland) yields between 0 and −0.71 nW/m2 of globally averaged radiative forcing determined by the vegetation characteristics, snow dynamics, and atmospheric radiation environment characteristic within each of 151 regions we consider globally. Across a set of scenarios designed to span a range of potential future LULCC, we find LULCC forcing ranging from −0.06 to −0.29 W/m2 by 2070 depending on assumptions regarding future crop yield growth and whether climate policy favors afforestation or bioenergy crops. Inclusion of this previously uncounted forcing in the policy targets driving future climate mitigation efforts leads to changes in fossil fuel emissions on the order of 1.5 PgC/yr by 2070 for a climate forcing limit of 4.5 Wm−2, corresponding to a 12–67 % change in fossil fuel emissions depending on the scenario. Scenarios with significant afforestation must compensate for albedo-induced warming through additional emissions reductions, and scenarios with significant deforestation need not mitigate as aggressively due to albedo-induced cooling. In all scenarios considered, inclusion of albedo forcing in policy targets increases forest and shrub cover globally. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most critical factors determining soil quality or fertility. Recent survey has reported the severe degradation of SOC by soil erosion in agricultural fields throughout the world. To maintain soil quality or productivity, biochar (BC) or anionic polyacrylamide (PAM) has been recently suggested; however, the combination effects of BC and PAM have not been reported to date. This study evaluated the effect of BC, PAM or their mixture (BC+PAM) on soil quality, plant growth, and runoff and soil loss under simulated and natural rainfalls. Applications of BC promoted growth of soybean (C3 type) and maize (C4 type) plants and maintained soil physical properties such as water retention and stability. Our findings showed that BC+PAM was the best for plant growth, even other subject amendments were not worse. Addition of BC may lead to accelerate the metabolic-performance capacity of plants, especially C3 plant, due to sufficient C source. For runoff and soil loss tests, all amendments increased runoff compared to the control possibly due to clogging soil pore by viscous PAM solution application and decreased soil loss due to clay flocculation and aggregate stabilization by PAM, and water adsorbing capacity of BC. The use of BC+PAM can be a new, excellent strategy to promote plant growth and reduce soil loss; however, optimum application method should be considered carefully prior to its practical use. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Energy-dense terpene biofuels have recently been recognized as renewable alternatives for high-density petroleum-derived fuels. While the physicochemical properties of terpene dimer fuel (TDF) have been well-documented, the propensity of these mixtures to undergo biodegradation and exacerbate the corrosion of the fuel infrastructure remains unknown. Coastal seawater/sediment incubations were amended with TDF or a blend of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons and incubated under strict anaerobic conditions. In some incubations, a model hydrocarbon-degrading sulfate-reducing bacterium (Desulfoglaeba alkanexedens, strain ALDC) was inoculated as a positive control. No increase in sulfate reduction or corrosion was observed in long-term experiments (300 days) relative to TDF-free controls when only seawater/sediment served as the inoculum. However, inoculation with the positive control organism and a mixture of C6-C12 n-alkanes increased both the sulfate reduction rate (95.2 ± 5.2 μM/day) and general corrosion, as determined by both coupon weight loss (27.9 ± 1.6 mg) and the number of pits (495 ± 62). The ratio of manganese (Mn)/weight loss (0.34) in incubations exhibiting coupon pitting was lower than those (0.53-0.68) showing only generalized coupon corrosion. Despite no indication for TDF biodegradation under all test conditions, the detection of a suite of alkylsuccinate metabolites attested to the anaerobic metabolism of the suite of n-alkanes when strain ALDC and the hydrocarbons served as amendments. These findings suggest that TDF is resistant to biodegradation and will not exacerbate the corrosion of carbon steel. If used in combination with petroleum hydrocarbons, the degree of metal corrosion would be that expected as a result of labile fuel components. However, the relatively recalcitrant nature of TDF might pose other risks if released to the environment and, thus, warrants further study. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The green economy, including biofuels and biomass production, has received considerable academic and popular press attention. Yet, documenting and measuring the economic impact of green economy activities remains a challenge, as this ill-defined economic sector’s benefits are often overstated. This article makes two unique contributions to the emerging academic literature on the green economy. First, it contributes to the applied academic literature on economic impact assessments of the green economy by documenting approaches to measure the economic impact of three alternative biomass uses: electricity generation, wood pellet manufacturing, and biofuels manufacturing. Second, it examines the regulatory influences and market volatility that challenge the long-term viability of each alternative use. © 2015 MCRSA. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine public opinion of planting genetically improved poplars on public lands in western Canada. Policy scenarios consider the use of three different breeding methods (traditional selective breeding, genomics-assisted breeding, and genetic modification), each with and without poplars being used for biofuels. We employ a choice experiment to provide alternative outcomes to policy scenarios and to investigate differences among characteristics of respondents. Overall, a majority of respondents voted in favour of policies that allowed improved poplars on public land if the fibre is used to generate biofuels. Adding biofuel production to a policy scenario increases the probability of acceptance by 17%–32%. In contrast, the various types of breeding technology do not matter as much regarding public acceptance. Responses differ among segments of the population, but these differences do not greatly influence choices. Attributes that increase the probability of acceptance are being a male, being from Alberta, and being from a population centre of 10 000–100 000 people (relative to centers that are >100 000 people). Attributes that decrease the probability of acceptance are age, being from British Columbia, and being from a population centre of <10 000 people (relative to centers that are >100 000 people). Despite these significant patterns of preferences, there is substantial uncertainty underlying the responses. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) is a promising plant for the production of biodiesel in arid regions. To improve its productivity, it is important to understand the molecular functions of key genes in Jatropha, and to seek ways to modify important agronomic traits of Jatropha via molecular breeding. However, Jatropha is notorious for its recalcitrance to transformation. Thus, an improved protocol for efficient and reproducible Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation is essential for molecular biology research and breeding in this species. Because resistance of Jatropha to A. tumefaciens infection is one of the key factors limiting transformation efficiency, we attempted to improve infection efficiency by comparing various co-culture conditions with the use of a β-glucuronidase (GUS) assay. The LBA4404 strain of A. tumefaciens was more efficient than the EHA105 strain for transformation of Jatropha. Vacuum infiltration of an A. tumefaciens suspension with Jatropha explants, combined with co-cultivation on filter-paper wicks moistened with co-culture medium instead of on solid medium, significantly improved transformation efficiency. In these conditions, GUS-positive sectors were observed in 93.0 ± 23.6% of infected explants. Moreover, a variant of the yellow fluorescent protein gene, Venus, was used as a visible marker, which proved effective for discrimination of candidate transgenic shoots from escape shoots. Transgene integration was confirmed by means of polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization analyses. Transgenic shoots were regenerated from 23% of explants from the vacuum-filter-paper treatment, which is sufficient for practical use. © 2015, The Society for In Vitro Biology.

AB  - Andromonoecious Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) has male and hermaphrodite flowers in one inflorescence. Jatropha is a potential source for biofuel raw material. The development of this plant has various constraints, such as lower fruit set that causes low seed productivity. The existence of andromonoecious Jatropha with high fruit set provides a great opportunity to overcome the obstacles. Understanding floral biology is a requirement for developing a high fruit set andromonoecious Jatropha. This study was aimed at understanding the flower’s characteristics and phenology. The andromonoecious Jatropha flower’s characteristics, number and viability of pollen, and phenology were observed and compared to those of monoecious Jatropha. Andromonoecious Jatropha had inflorescence with a dichasial cyme pattern. An inflorescence produced two main branches and several secondary and tertiary branches, where a hermaphrodite flower was found at whose ends. The number of inflorescence branches in andromonoecious Jatropha was higher than that of monoecious Jatropha. The diameter and size of the sepal and stalk in hermaphrodite flowers were found to be larger than those in male and female flowers. The development of andromonoecious Jatropha flowers was divided into 4 phases, namely initiation (0-3 dai = days after initiation), small bud (3-7 dai), large bud (7-20 dai), and flower blooming (20-39 dai) phases. The anthesis and anther dehiscence of hermaphrodite flowers occurred at the same time between 06:00 to 06:59 am, facilitating self-pollination of the hermaphrodite flowers. The average pollen viability during the anthesis phase was 96.26%, and 88.79% of them survived until the next day. © 2015, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, cyanobacteria are regarded as potential biofuel sources. Large-scale cultivation of cyanobacteria in seawater is of particular interest because seawater is a low-cost medium. In the present study, we examined differences in light-harvesting and energy transfer processes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 grown in different cultivation media, namely modified A medium (the optimal growth medium for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002) and f/2 (a seawater medium). The concentrations of nitrate and phosphate ions were varied in both media. Higher nitrate ion and/or phosphate ion concentrations yielded high relative content of phycobilisome. The cultivation medium influenced the energy transfers within phycobilisome, from phycobilisome to photosystems, within photosystem II, and from photosystem II to photosystem I. We suggest that the medium also affects charge recombination at the photosystem II reaction center and formation of a chlorophyll-containing complex. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Blending biofuels into fossil fuels allows for emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, biofuels are not yet competitive due to high production costs and investments and thus, legal requirements like blending quotas or emission thresholds must be issued if biofuels are to contribute to European CO2-reduction goals. Thereby, the aim is to establish Pareto-efficient long-term legal requirements. Against this background, we develop an optimization model for simultaneously minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value in order to analyze the overall system of biomass cultivation, (bio)fuel production and blending. The applied ε-constraint approach allows to calculate Pareto-efficient solutions. The model is applied to the German (bio)diesel market. We show that current and past European Union directives are not Pareto-efficient and cause unintended side effects. As results, information about trade-offs between the two objectives (minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value) as well as recommendations on the design of the regulation is derived. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract The study and development of efficient forest-fuel systems with different species in different climates has become one of the biggest challenges in forestry. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare productivity, costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of three different chippers in thinning, using a whole tree harvesting system. The relation between chipper productivities and GHG emissions was also examined. Trials were conducted in young pine stands in Northern Spain. Stand inventories before and after the thinning, plus a work sampling time study (64.81 h in total) of each chipper was conducted to calculate productivity. All work elements were recorded on a fixed time interval (1 min) with a hand-held field computer. Costs with regards to productive and total time were also calculated. In order to calculate the GHG emissions produced by the process of obtaining chips from timber in the forest, the three chip production systems were evaluated. The system boundary considered included the chipping, felling and forwarding phases. The amount of kg CO2e emitted was estimated from the productivity and fuel consumption data of each machine involved in the process. Results showed that chipper productivities varied between 5.78 and 7.29 odt SMH-1 (oven dry tonnes per Scheduled Machine Hours). Furthermore, the two more powerful chippers achieved a productivity not so different to the productivity of the lowest powered chipper, due to the former's organizational delays and poor forestry planning in that these chippers had to wait for replacement containers before continuing chipping at roadside, while the less powerful machine chipped continuously onto the ground, highlighting the importance of operation management. Chipping costs were 3.03, 3.10 and 4.06 € MWhchip-1. The GHG emissions evaluated were 7.09, 8.41 and 7.6 kgCO2e MWhchip-1, with the chipping phase being the greatest contributor to GHG emissions in two of the systems studied. Energy balance varied between 2.92 and 4.02%, demonstrating high efficiency since an energy input of only 2-4 % of the energy produced was required. Studies of this kind are essential to identify those factors which affect productivity and how they may influence costs and GHG emissions, in order to improve forest-fuel systems from an environmental point of view. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Activated carbon filters are used to limit engine damage by siloxanes when biogas is utilised to provide electricity. However, carbon filter siloxane removal performance is poorly understood as until recently, it had not been possible to measure siloxanes on-line. In this study, on-line Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was developed to measure siloxane concentration in real biogas both upstream (86.1-157.5 mg m-3) and downstream (2.2-4.3 mg m-3) of activated carbon filters. The FTIR provided reasonable precision upstream of the carbon vessel with a root mean square error of 10% using partial least squares analysis. However, positive interference from volatile organic carbons was observed in downstream gas measurements limiting precision at the outlet to an RMSE of 1.5 mg m-3 (47.8%). Importantly, a limit of detection of 3.2 mg m-3 was identified which is below the recommended siloxane limit and evidences the applicability of on-line FTIR for this application. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ferredoxins (FDX) are final electron carrier proteins in the plant photosynthetic pathway, and function as major electron donors in diverse redox-driven metabolic pathways. We previously showed that overexpression of a major constitutively expressed ferredoxin gene PETF in Chlamydomonas decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and enhanced tolerance to heat stress. In addition to PETF, an endogenous anaerobic induced FDX5 was overexpressed in transgenic Chlamydomonas lines here to address the possible functions of FDX5. All the independent FDX transgenic lines showed decreased cellular ROS levels and enhanced tolerance to heat and salt stresses. The transgenic Chlamydomonas lines accumulated more starch than the wild-type line and this effect increased almost three-fold in conditions of nitrogen depletion. Furthermore, the lipid content was higher in the transgenic lines than in the wild-type line, both with and without nitrogen depletion. Two FDX-overexpressing Chlamydomonas lines were assessed in a photo microbial fuel cell (PMFC); power density production by the transgenic lines was higher than that of the wild-type cells. These findings suggest that overexpression of either PETF or FDX5 can confer tolerance against heat and salt stresses, increase starch and oil production, and raise electric power density in a PMFC. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Interest in the use of biochar as soil amendment has grown recently. However, studies evaluating its potential use for reclamation of disturbed agricultural lands are lacking. We studied the effects of amending clay, loam, and sand subsoil substrates with wood biochar pyrolized at 800°C, oxidized lignite (humalite), or labile organic mix (sawdust, wheat straw, and alfalfa; LOM) on soil organic carbon (C), microbial biomass, dry aggregated size distribution and penetration resistance in greenhouse. We also considered the co-application of LOM and biochar or humalite to the subsoil substrates as treatments where C from either biochar or humalite represented a stable form of C. The amount and composition of the mix of organic amendments was determined for each subsoil so that organic C levels of reconstructed topsoil would be equivalent to that of the corresponding native topsoil in the long term. Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were grown in rotation in four sequential greenhouse studies. Results from soil analysis at the end of study II and study IV showed that subsoils amended with biochar or humalite had higher organic C than those with LOM only, regardless of soil type. Labile organic mix added alone or together with biochar or humalite to subsoil increased microbial biomass and decreased geometric mean diameter of the dry soil aggregates. The effects of biochar or humalite-only amendment on these soil properties were not significant relative to the unamended subsoil substrate. Simultaneous application of biochar or humalite with LOM can potentially be used for topsoil reconstruction and reclamation of disturbed agricultural lands, and to maintain soil quality in the long term. However, long-term field studies are required to ascertain the longevity of the desirable properties reported in this study and to assess effects associated with aging of biochar or humalite in the soil. © 2015, Agricultural Institute of Canada.

AB  - Drought is considered the main environmental factor limiting plant growth in karst habitats. For this study, seedlings of Jatrophacurcas L. and Verniciafordii H. were submitted to a 10-day drought stress period at 5 different intensities. Photosynthesis, biomass, carbonic anhydrase (CA), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activities were determined. It was discovered that photosynthesis of the V. fordii was more sensitive to drought stress, and the water-use efficiency (WUE) of the V. fordii responded earlier in order to adapt to the induced drought stress. However, the J. curcas accumulated more biomass with better photosynthetic tolerance under drought stress. As the drought stress increased, the G6PDH activity of the V. fordii was activated at 20% or 30% PEG level, the higher G6PDH activity of the V. fordii maintained the redox equilibrium of the cells and produced NADPH for the formation of unsaturated fatty acids. As a result, the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids in the V. fordii was affe ted, and its cetane number and iodine value changed; thus, the fuel properties of the biodiesel were affected. Therefore, the photosynthesis and G6PDH activity of a plant should be taken into consideration when selecting appropriate biomass energy plants in karst habitats. © 2015, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

AB  - Abstract While first generation biofuels paved the way for a vision of a renewable energy future, their competition for arable land limited widespread applicability. Second generation fuels, made from a variety of carbonaceous wastes, are considerably more "sustainable" in a land competition sense, but require a higher degree of processing to extract energy. Here we extend the idea of second-generation sustainability by investigating blends of coal and biomasses found within 20 miles of coal-fired power stations in the Northeast United States for use in co-firing scenarios that would limit long-range transport of biomass. A commercial high volatile bituminous Pennsylvanian coal was blended at 90, 80, and 50 wt% with one of three biomasses: feed corn stover from a local farm, brewer's spent grains from Redhook Brewery, or cocoa shells from the Lindt chocolate factory. The Distributed Activation Energy Model was applied to analyze the pyrolysis kinetics of the solid fuels and blends, yielding activation energies as a function of mass fraction conversion ranging from 304 to 522 kJ/mol for coal, 164 to 304 kJ/mol for the biomasses, and 218 to 530 kJ/mol for the coal-biomass blends. Overall, the peak reaction rates and temperatures for the primarily biomass decomposition stages were linearly correlated with the percent biomass in the blend. Such an additive scheme did not represent the blends' kinetics, instead over-predicting the activation energies. Synergy was noted between the fuels, in that the biomass does appear to be promoting the devolatilization of the coal at lower temperatures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water availability is a major limiting factor for sustainable production of potential biofuel crops in Maui, Hawaii, USA. It is essential to improve regional, near-real time estimates of crop water use to facilitate optimal water management. Satellite remote-sensing offers multiple methods to estimate water management, however, most approaches assume a spatially homogeneous regional meteorology, which does not apply in Hawaii due to strong orographically-induced variations in climate. Canopy ground cover (fc) and spectral reflectance were measured over two sugarcane fields on the satellite Landsat 7 overpass dates. A strong linear relationship between satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and fc was found (R2=0.97). Canopy ground cover was also found to be highly correlated to crop coefficient (Kc) which was calculated from reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and sugarcane crop evapotranspiration (ETc) observations from the Eddy Covariance towers. Spatial ET0 for the entire sugarcane plantation was determined from an automated weather station network previously installed by the commercial grower of the plantation. Regressions were used to convert the satellite NDVI to Kc maps, and then the satellite-based ETc maps were created from the satellite-based Kc maps and ET0 values computed and interpolated from the weather station network. To compare with the satellite-based crop coefficient/reference ET method, ETc and Kc were also estimated using a satellite-based surface energy balance technique, the METRIC model. These two satellite-based methods were correlated fairly well (R2=0.84 for Kc and 0.81 for ETc). Compared to the METRIC model, the satellite-based crop coefficient/reference ET method may be more practicable for estimating crop water use in Maui, where ground-based ET0 measurements are available through the on-site automated weather station network with right choice of reference ET equation. © 2015.

AB  - Biochar is increasingly been used as a soil amendment to improve water-holding capacity, reduce nutrient leaching, increase soil pH, and also as a means to reduce contamination through sorption of heavy metals or organic pollutants. The sorption behavior of three phenylurea herbicides (monuron, diuron and linuron) on five biochars (Enhanced Biochar, Hog Waste, Turkey Litter, Walnut Shell and Wood Feedstock) and an agricultural soil (Yolo silt loam) was investigated using a batch equilibration method. Sorption isotherms of herbicides to biochars were well described by the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.93–0.97). The adsorption KF values ranged from 6.94 to 1306.95 mg kg−1 and indicated the sorption of herbicides in the biochars and Yolo soil was in the sequence of linuron &gt; diuron &gt; monuron and walnut shell biochar &gt; wood feedstock biochar &gt; turkey litter biochar &gt; enhanced biochar &gt; hog waste biochar &gt; Yolo soil. These data show that sorption of herbicides to biochar can have both positive (reduced off-site transport) and negative (reduced herbicide efficacy) implications and specific biochar properties, such as H/C ratio and surface area, should be considered together with soil type, agriculture chemical and climate condition in biochar application to agricultural soil to optimize the system for both agricultural and environmental benefits. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Climate change poses a serious global challenge in the face of rapidly increasing human demand for energy and food. A recent phenomenon in which climate change may play an important role is the acquisition of large tracts of land in the developing world by governments and corporations. In the target countries, where land is relatively inexpensive, the potential to increase crop yields is generally high and property rights are often poorly defined. By acquiring land, investors can realize large profits and countries can substantially alter the land and water resources under their control, thereby changing their outlook for meeting future demand. While the drivers, actors, and impacts involved with land deals have received substantial attention in the literature, we propose that climate change plays an important yet underappreciated role, both through its direct effects on agricultural production and through its influence on mitigative or adaptive policy decisions. Drawing from various literature sources as well as a new global database on reported land deals, we trace the evolution of the global land rush and highlight prominent examples in which the role of climate change is evident. We find that climate change - both historical and anticipated - interacts substantially with drivers of land acquisitions, having important implications for the resilience of communities in targeted areas. As a result of this synthesis, we ultimately contend that considerations of climate change should be integrated into future policy decisions relating to the large-scale land acquisitions. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Further to Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, the share of biofuels in transport should rise to a minimum of 10% in Member States by 2020. In Finland, the goal is set at 20%, and it is estimated that this can be produced entirely in domestic factories, as long as the projects already underway will be successful and additional industrial-scale biofuel plants would be built. The paper reviews the state of projects underway in Finland, and outlines current research activity in promoting waste and by-product - based biofuels. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - An exergy and environmental comparison between the fuel production routes for Brazilian transportation sector, including fossil fuels (natural gas, oil-derived products and hydrogen), biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) and electricity is performed, and the percentage distribution of exergy destruction in the different units of the processing plants is characterized. An exergoeconomy methodology is developed and applied to properly allocate the renewable and non-renewable exergy costs and CO2 emission cost among the different products of multiproduct plants. Since Brazilian electricity is consumed in the upstream processing stages of the fuels used in the generation thereof, an iterative calculation is used. The electricity mix comprises thermal (coal, natural gas and oil-fired), nuclear, wind and hydroelectric power plants, as well as bagasse-fired mills, which, besides exporting surplus electricity, also produce sugar and bioethanol. Oil and natural gas-derived fuels production and biodiesel fatty acid methyl-esters (FAME) derived from palm oil are also analyzed. It was found that in spite of the highest total unit exergy costs correspond to the production of biofuels and electricity, the ratio between the renewable to non-renewable invested exergy (cR/cNR) for those fuels is 2.69 for biodiesel, 4.39 for electricity, and 15.96 for ethanol, whereas for fossil fuels is almost negligible. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the full-chain carbon cycle of oil palm to determine the CE (carbon equivalences), starting from plantation until production of end-user products including RBD (refined, bleached, and deodorized) Palm Olein as a cooking oil and PME (palm methyl ester) as biodiesel fuel. Based on the carbon categorization, the equivalent carbon emissions from RBD Palm Olein and PME productions were found to be 159 and 153 kg CE/ton product, respectively. The major emissions in the RBD Palm Olein production chain are attributed to the use of natural gas for energy spent in the industrial process and Poly Ethylene Terephthalate for product containers; whereas, those in the PME production are from methanol used in the transesterification. After identification of the carbon pathway, RBD Palm Olein exhibited a net emission of 116 kg CE/ha-y, but PME shows a net reduction of 2328 kg CE/ha-y. From energy balances and economic performances, PME is found to have higher net energy ratio, with 40% lower production cost per kg CE, than does RBD Palm Olein. Therefore, increasing the use of palm oil for biodiesel production rather than as use for cooking oil is justified as a useful tool for climate change mitigation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lipid extraction is an integral part of biodiesel production, as it facilitates the release of fatty acids from algal cells. To utilise thraustochytrids as a potential source for lipid production. We evaluated the extraction efficiency of various solvents and solvent combinations for lipid extraction from Schizochytrium sp. S31 and Thraustochytrium sp. AMCQS5-5. The maximum lipid extraction yield was 22% using a chloroform:methanol ratio of 2:1. We compared various cell disruption methods to improve lipid extraction yields, including grinding with liquid nitrogen, bead vortexing, osmotic shock, water bath, sonication and shake mill. The highest lipid extraction yields were obtained using osmotic shock and 48.7% from Schizochytrium sp. S31 and 29.1% from Thraustochytrium sp. AMCQS5-5. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid contents were more than 60% in Schizochytrium sp. S31 which suggests their suitability for biodiesel production. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The present study is aimed at developing a methodology to extract maize, a predominant energy crop, and efficiently map its spatial distribution in a Natura 2000 region of northern Germany. Following a GEOBIA approach, segmentation was performed on two hierarchical levels. Level 1 consisted of field boundaries, and level 2 represented variations within level 1. Decision rules were developed for level 2 based on spectral information, vegetation indices, standard deviations and knowledge of crop phenology. For this purpose, first, level 2 image objects were classified. Subsequently classification was shifted to level 1. Maize covered 10.6 percent of total study area. The presented methodology gives the advanced user the flexibility to integrate expert knowledge in the classifier. In addition, the implementation time of decision rules was very fast and helped to produce results with high accuracy. © 2015 American Society for Photogrammetry.

AB  - Certification for biofuels has been developed to ensure that biofuel production methods adhere to social and environmental sustainability standards. As such, requiring biofuel production to be certified has become part of EU policy through the 2009 renewable energy directive (RED), that aims to promote energy security, reduce emissions and promote rural development. According to the EU RED, in 2020 10 % of our transport energy should come from renewable sources, most of which are expected to be biofuels. In this paper I examine what biofuel certificates are, what they can achieve and what their limitations are. Methodologically, I will evaluate them using the standards of instrumental, practical and communicative rationality. With regard to instrumental rationality, I conclude that the EU RED makes an important but unjustified assumption in demanding certified biofuels for its target: that if biofuel production is sustainable, then biofuel use is too. I also argue that, where the EU assumes that biofuel certification is a sufficient means to achieve the EU RED’s goals, it is at best an insufficient means and at worst not a means at all towards achieving these goals. With regard to practical rationality, I argue that more attention needs to be paid to trade-offs between different goals in the EU RED, particularly with regard to providing investor security and not capping transport energy consumption. With regard to communicative rationality, I argue that the policy-making process of the EU RED has been seriously flawed, and that certification development processes also can improve significantly. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - The Guerbet condensation reaction is an alcohol coupling reaction that has been known for more than a century. Because of the increasing availability of bio-based alcohol feedstock, this reaction is of growing importance and interest in terms of value chains of renewable chemical and biofuel production. Due to the specific branching pattern of the alcohol products, the Guerbet reaction has many interesting applications. In comparison to their linear isomers, branched-chain Guerbet alcohols have extremely low melting points and excellent fluidity. This review provides thermodynamic insights and unravels the various mechanistic steps involved. A comprehensive overview of the homogeneous, heterogeneous and combined homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems described in published reports and patents is also given. Technological considerations, challenges and perspectives for the Guerbet chemistry are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - Since the inception of industrial revolution, metal refining plants using pyrometallurgical processes have generated the prodigious emissions of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). As the core target of such pollutants, a large number of soils are nowadays contaminated over widespread areas, posing a great threat to public health worldwide. Unlike organic pollutants, Pb and Cd do not undergo chemical or microbial breakdown and stay likely in site for longer duration after their release. Immobilization is an in-situ remediation technique that uses cost-effective soil amendments to reduce Pb and Cd availability in the contaminated soils. The Pb and Cd contamination in the soil environment is reviewed with focus on source enrichment, speciation and associated health risks, and immobilization options using various soil amendments. Commonly applied and emerging cost-effective soil amendments for Pb and Cd immobilization include phosphate compounds, liming, animal manure, biosolids, metal oxides, and biochar. These immobilizing agents could reduce the transfer of metal pollutants or residues to food web (plant uptake and leaching to subsurface water) and their long-term sustainability in heavy metal fixation needs further assessment. © 2015 Soil Science Society of China.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a Brassicaceae oilseed species being explored as a biofuel and industrial oil crop. A growing number of studies have indicated that the turnover of phosphatidylcholine plays an important role in the synthesis and modification of triacylglycerols. This study manipulated the expression of a patatin-related phospholipase AIIIδ (pPLAIIIδ) in camelina to determine its effect on seed oil content and plant growth. Constitutive overexpression of pPLAIIIδ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic 35S promoter resulted in a significant increase in seed oil content and a decrease in cellulose content. In addition, the content of major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, in 35S::pPLAIIIδ plants was increased. However, these changes in 35S::pPLAIIIδ camelina were associated with shorter cell length, leaves, stems, and seed pods and a decrease in overall seed production. When pPLAIIIδ was expressed under the control of the seed specific, β-conglycinin promoter, the seed oil content was increased without compromising plant growth. The results suggest that pPLAIIIδ alters the carbon partitioning by decreasing cellulose content and increasing oil content in camelina. © 2014 Society for Experimental Biology, Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Within the EU, Germany took a pioneering role in the production and promotion of biofuels. To explain this role the article analytically examines public discourses on biofuels. The analysis points out how the subject is interpreted and positioned by relevant actors and thus results in a specific public perception of biofuels in Germany. This perception in turn influences political decision-making processes. Since the analysis of discourses contributes to a better understanding of today’s biofuel policy in Germany, the article characterises the biofuel discourse during the genesis of this policy. Additionally, it analytically traces changes of discourse constellations in the course of the biofuel policy path. © 2015 The White Horse Press.

AB  - Pennycress has been suggested as an alternative feedstock for bioenergy. Especially, its cultivation in a double-cropping system with corn appears to be promising for a sustainable production. As an aspect of its sustainability, we studied the effect of a pennycress-corn double-cropping system on spider diversity. We used a randomized block design with 60 pitfall traps to compare the system's spider diversity with that of three commonly applied corn rotations: mustard-corn, green fallow-corn and bare fallow-corn. We sampled from 13 March to 26 June 2012, which included the corresponding cultivation changes to corn. The pennycress-corn system harboured a higher spider species richness and diversity (Shannon index) than the other three systems, driven by web-building spiders. Abundance only differed between the pennycress- and bare fallow-corn system. However, separated into foraging guilds, hunting spiders were most abundant in the mustard-corn system, whereas web-building spiders were more abundant in the pennycress-corn than in the mustard- and bare fallow-corn system. The results obtained in the present study suggest that cultivation of pennycress as a biofuel feedstock in a double-cropping system has positive (and not negative) effects on the spider diversity compared with other commonly used cultivation systems. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - In the framework of the IDAF (IGAC/DEBITS/AFrica) international program, this study aims to study the chemical composition of precipitation and associated wet deposition at the rural site of Djougou in Benin, representative of a West and Central African wet savanna. Five hundred and thirty rainfall samples were collected at Djougou, Benin, from July 2005 to December 2009 to provide a unique database. The chemical composition of precipitation was analyzed for inorganic (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, K+, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-) and organic (HCOO-, CH3COO-, C2H5COO-, C2O42-) ions, using ion chromatography. The 530 collected rain events represent a total of 5706.1mm of rainfall compared to the measured pluviometry 6138.9mm, indicating that the collection efficiency is about 93%. The order of total annual loading rates for soluble cations is NH4+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+. For soluble anions the order of loading is carbonates>HCOO->NO3->CH3COO->SO42->Cl->C2O42->C2H5COO-. In the wet savanna of Djougou, 86% of the measured pH values range between 4.7 and 5.7 with a median pH of 5.19, corresponding to a VWM (Volume Weighed Mean) H+ concentration of 6.46μeq·L-1. This acidity results from a mixture of mineral and organic acids. The annual sea salt contribution was computed for K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and SO42- and represents 4.2% of K+, 41% of Mg2+, 1.3% of Ca2+, and 7.4% of SO42-. These results show that K+, Ca2+, SO42-, and Mg2+ were mainly of non-marine origin. The marine contribution is estimated at 9%. The results of the chemical composition of rainwater of Djougou indicates that, except for the carbonates, ammonium has the highest VWM concentration (14.3μeq·L-1) and nitrate concentration is 8.2μeq·L-1. The distribution of monthly VWM concentration for all ions is computed and shows the highest values during the dry season, comparing to the wet season. Identified nitrogenous compound sources (NOx and NH3) are domestic animals, natural emissions from savanna soils, biomass burning and biofuel combustions. The second highest contribution is the calcium ion (13.3μeq·L-1), characteristic of dust aerosols from terrigenous sources, Calcium contributes up to 46% of the precipitation chemistry in Djougou. Finally, these results are compared to those obtained for other selected African sites representative of other main natural ecosystems: dry savanna and forest. The study of the African ecosystem transect indicates a pH gradient with more acidic pH in the forested ecosystem. Nitrogenous contribution to the chemical composition of rain in Lamto, wet savanna, (24%) is equivalent to the one estimated in Djougou (24%). The last contribution concerns organic acidity, which represents 7% of total ionic content of precipitation at Djougou. The relative particulate contribution PC and the relative gaseous contribution GC are calculated using the mean chemical composition measured in Djougou for the studied period. The comparison with other African sites gives 40% and 43% PC in wet savannas of Lamto (CÔte d'Ivoire) and Djougou (Benin) respectively, 20% PC in the equatorial forest of Zoetele (Cameroon) and 80% PC in dry savanna of Banizoumbou (Niger). The results shown here indicate the existence of a North-South gradients of organic, marine, terrigenous and nitrogenous contributions along the transect in West and Central Africa. © 2015.

AB  - Remediating saline-sodic soils with organic amendments is increasingly seen as a cheaper and sustainable alternative to inorganic materials. The reclamation potential of biochar, biosolids and greenwaste composts applied to a saline-sodic soil was evaluated in a laboratory leaching experiment using moderate SAR reclaimed water. Treatments included biochar, biosolids co-compost, greenwaste compost (all applied at a 75tha-1 rate), gypsum (50% soil gypsum requirement), biochar+gypsum, biosolids+gypsum, greenwaste+gypsum and a non-amended control. All treatments were subjected to a one month incubation after which, soils were filled in columns and leached using reclaimed water until 7PV of water had passed. Cumulative leachate losses of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were evaluated in addition to soil properties after leaching. Results show that leaching with moderate SAR water was effective in reducing the soil salinity and sodicity of all soils, irrespective of amendment application. However, incorporating biochar and composts significantly enhanced this effect. Salt leaching was higher in soils treated with organic amendments. Cumulative leachate losses of cations were significantly higher from biochar and compost treated soils compared to gypsum and unamended controls. Improvements in soil aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity were prominent in compost treated soils. After leaching, soil analyses indicated that organic amendments lowered significantly more soil ECe, ESP and SAR than that of the control soils and saturated the exchange complex with Ca2+. Soil pH was significantly reduced and CEC was significantly increased in only compost treated soils. Although individual organic amendment applications proved to be significant enough to remediate a saline-sodic soil, combined applications of gypsum and organic amendments were more effective in improving soil properties directly related to sodium removal including sodium leaching, hydraulic conductivity, ESP, and SAR, and therefore could have a supplementary benefit of accelerating the reclamation process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, a comparative exergy and environmental analysis of the vehicle fuel end use is presented. This analysis comprises petroleum and natural gas derivatives (including hydrogen), biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel), and their mixtures, besides of the electricity generated in the Brazilian electricity mix, intended to be used in plug in electric vehicles. The renewable and non-renewable unit exergy costs and CO2 emission cost are proposed as suitable indicators for assessing the renewable exergy consumption intensity and the environmental impact, and for quantifying the thermodynamic performance of the transportation sector. This allows ranking the energy conversion processes along the vehicle fuels production routes and their end use, so that the best options for the transportation sector can be determined and better energy policies may be issued. It is found that if a drastic CO2 emissions abatement of the sector is pursued, a more intensive utilization of ethanol in the Brazilian transportation sector mix is advisable. However, as the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the sugar cane industry is still very low, which increases the unit exergy cost of ethanol, better production and end use technologies are required. Nonetheless, with the current scenario of a predominantly renewable Brazilian electricity mix, based on more than 80% of renewable sources, this source consolidates as the most promising energy source to reduce the large amount of greenhouse gas emissions which transportation sector is responsible for. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy crop models predict harvestable biomass using known variables, and illustrate key parameters that determine the crop yield. We developed a model, using the systems software STELLA, to provide a conceptual representation of Miscanthus×. giganteus crop system and understand various parameters and their influence on the growth and loss of harvestable biomass. Using data from four locations, we developed a model and used it to predict yields comparable to reported biomass production from Champaign, IL, thus validating the model structure. Sensitivity analyses of model variables suggested that solar radiation, rainfall, temperature, soil water holding capacity, solar energy interception and conversion efficiency, evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, irrigation and harvest date significantly influenced the predicted harvestable biomass. The flexible STELLA platform also allows the stakeholders to expand and modify the model to incorporate additional variables if required and ultimately enables informed decision-making for bioenergy crop production at any location. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.

AB  - Technological paradigm shifts often come with a newly emerging industry that seeks a viable infrastructure deployment plan to compete against established competitors. Such phenomenon has been repeatedly seen in the field of transportation systems, such as those related to the booming bioenergy production, among others. We develop a game-theoretic modeling framework using a continuum approximation scheme to address the impacts of competition on the optimal infrastructure deployment. Furthermore, we extend the model to incorporate uncertainties in supply/demand and the risk of facility disruptions. Analytical properties of the optimal infrastructure system are obtained, based on which fast numerical solution algorithms are developed. Several hypothetical problem instances are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and to quantify the impacts of various system parameters. A large-scale biofuel industry case study for the U.S. Midwest is conducted to obtain additional managerial insights. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil seeks to rapidly increase its agricultural production to meet future demands, especially for sugarcane, which is an agricultural commodity and a biofuel source. In this paper, we explore how to achieve this increase without compromising existing forestlands. We propose that it is possible to substantially expand sugarcane production in Brazil while avoiding further environmental losses and the indirect land use changes often associated with them, such as deforestation. This task could be accomplished by converting existing pasturelands with agricultural potential into cropland. A great deal of pastureland exists in Brazil. Thus, we addressed the following questions in this study: (1) where are the most suitable pasturelands for sugarcane located geographically and (2) what potential do these pasturelands have for sugarcane production regarding their physical suitability and other significant factors, such as infrastructure availability and socioeconomic factors. We conducted a land suitability analysis using a spatial location model based on multicriteria decision-making and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify the cultivated pasturelands most suitable for conversion to sugarcane production in Brazil. "What if" scenarios were built to determine how changes in the subjectively derived weights of the priority criteria would modify the spatial distribution of the suitability classes relative to the MCDA model and demonstrate the robustness of the crop suitability assessment. The most suitable pastureland areas for conversion to sugarcane production were predominantly located in Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso and Pará. These zones have large contiguous areas of pasture with moderate and high agricultural potentials for sugarcane production. The total estimated area of cultivated pasturelands with moderate or high suitability for sugarcane production was 50 million hectares, which is much larger than the area currently used for sugarcane production in Brazil. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is highly complex and prone to inhibition, which can cause major issues for digester operators. The result is that there have been numerous investigations into changes in operational conditions, however to date all have focused on the qualitative sensitivities, neglecting the quantitative. This study therefore aimed to determine the quantitative sensitivities by using factorial design of experiments and small semi continuous reactors. Analysis showed total and volatile solids removals are chiefly influenced by retention time, with 79% and 59% of the observed results being attributed to retention time respectively, whereas biogas was mainly influenced by loading rate, 38%, and temperature, 22%. Notably the regression model fitted to the experimental data predicted full-scale performance with a high level of precision, indicating that small reactors are subject to the same sensitivity of full-scale digesters and thus can be used to predict changes loading, retention time, and temperature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to develop a predictive framework to assess the removal and fate of trace organic chemicals (TrOCs) during wastewater treatment by anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The fate of 27 TrOCs in both the liquid and sludge phases during AnMBR treatment was systematically investigated. The results demonstrate a relationship between hydrophobicity and specific molecular features of TrOCs and their removal efficiency. These molecular features include the presence of electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) or donating groups (EDGs), especially those containing nitrogen and sulphur. All seven hydrophobic contaminants were well removed (>70%) by AnMBR treatment. Most hydrophilic TrOCs containing EDGs were also well removed (>70%). In contrast, hydrophilic TrOCs containing EWGs were mostly poorly removed and could accumulate in the sludge phase. The removal of several nitrogen/sulphur bearing TrOCs (e.g., linuron and caffeine) by AnMBR was higher than that by aerobic treatment, possibly due to nitrogen or sulphur reducing bacteria. © 2015.

AB  - Several studies have suggested that socio-economic factors and production site characteristics are primary determinants of farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial (biofuels and oil palm) production contracts. In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tobacco is widely planted across the world especially in China, which means that a large amount of tobacco waste needs to be treated. This study investigated the biogas fermentation of tobacco stalks co-digested with different biomass feedstocks and the inactivation of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) by anaerobic digestion. Results showed that the maximum methane yield of tobacco stalks at 35°C was 0.163 m3CH4{dot operator}kg VS-1, which was from the co-digestion of tobacco stalks, wheat stalks and pig manure. The largest VS removal rate of tobacco stalks was 59.10%. Proven by indicator paper stripe, half-leaf lesion and RT-PCR, CMV could be inactivated by mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion, whereas TMV could be only inactivated by thermophilic anaerobic digestion over 20days. These results suggested that using tobacco stalks as feedstock for anaerobic digestion and applying the digested residue and slurry to Solanaceae crop land are feasible. © 2015.

AB  - Abstract Industrial oilseeds camelina (Camelina sativa L.), carinata (Brassica carinata), and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) offer great potential as biofuel feedstocks. Their positive agronomic attributes allow for cropping systems and rotations that increase biofuel production on existing lands. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive fuel property evaluation of these promising oilseeds and compare them to several traditional oils. Three industrial (camelina, carinata, pennycress) and four conventional (soybean, canola, sunflower, corn) oilseed feedstocks were evaluated and compared. Both crude and refined oils were used in the evaluation to determine refinement's effect on fuel properties. Straight vegetable oil (SVO), biodiesel (B100), triglyceride blends (TGB), and renewable diesel (R100) fuel pathways were compared to petroleum diesel for the fuel properties that were measured. The paper focuses on TGBs as an on-farm fuel pathway, since the commercial market for these oils is still emerging. The TGB blend percentage of vegetable oil to E10 gasoline was varied to show its effects on fuel properties. For several feedstock and fuel pathway combinations, this paper presents the first published fuel property results. The physical and chemical properties of TGBs were also studied through phase diagrams and NMR spectroscopy. TGBs were found to be both physically and chemically stable over the expected timescale of use. For the TGBs, several fuel properties were improved compared to SVO due to the addition of gasoline, such as viscosity, density, speed of sound, heating value, and cold flow properties. Flash point was reduced due to the volatility of the gasoline component, hence users should treat TGBs with same handling and storage precautions as gasoline. The results were similar for the industrial oils as the traditional oils in the evaluation. The results show TGB may be an ideal fuel pathway for farm-scale fuel production or for other users in remote areas using locally sourced plant oils as feedstock.

AB  - Pongamia residue (shells) is the byproduct from the biodiesel processing industry, which is a lignocellulosic biomass material. It is not suitable as feedstock in downdraft wood gasifier due to low bulk density (146kg/m3) of shells as compared to wood (more than 350kg/m3). Pelletization and gasification of pelletized shells was carried out in the present work. The heat transfer analysis in pellets of 17mm and 11.5mm was also carried out to evaluate thermal properties of this biomass. Shell pellets of 17mm and 11.5mm diameter and length in the range of 10-60mm were gasified in a 20kWe downdraft wood gasifier. The complete gasification of pellets with 17mm diameter could not be achieved because of less porosity and presence of larger thermal gradient within the pellets. The gasification efficiency was 73% for 17mm diameter pellets which is lower than that of 11.5mm diameter pellets which was 95%. The calorific value of producer gas generated from smaller diameter pellets was higher (4.66MJ/Nm3) as compared to larger diameter pellets (3.98MJ/Nm3). Tar formation during gasification of smaller diameter pellets was low as compared to larger diameter pellets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Following the diminishing hopes from the first and second generation biofuels, mainly due to the limitations of land availability, feed stock requirements, and complicated pre-treatments, third generation biofuels from microalgae are becoming a priority in the current scenario. The present study focuses on comparison and optimization of lipid accumulation efficiency in algal strain Chlorella minutissima grown under autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic modes of nutrition, employing various carbon sources obtained from cheap industrial wastes such as glucose, acetate, and glycerol. Other pertinent factors such as the effect of various nitrogen sources, effect of salinity on the cell growth, and lipid accumulations in the algal cells were also studied. The results suggested that C. minutissima can grow efficiently under autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic modes of nutrition. C. minutissima cells were capable of utilizing other non-popular carbon sources such as glycerol and acetate collected as waste products from different industries along with commonly used glucose. The maximum biomass concentration (8.9 g/L) and lipid content (36.19 %) were found in heterotrophic mode of nutrition. Our findings indicated that C. minutissima can efficiently utilize these cheaper carbon sources from industrial waste products for its growth and the production cost of various bioenergy sources can be reduced significantly. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Extensive native Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) crop areas have been planted in Central America marginal lands since 2008 as a non-edible prospective feedstock alternative to high-value, edible palm oil. Jatropha biodiesel is currently exclusively produced in the region at commercial scale utilizing alkaline catalysts. Recently, a free, soluble Thermomyces lanuginosus (TL) 1,3 specific lipase has shown promise as biocatalyst, reportedly yielding up to 96 % ASTM D6751 compliant biodiesel after 24 h transesterification of soybean, canola oils and other feedstocks. Biodiesel conversion rate and quality of enzymatically catalyzed transesterification of Jatropha oil was evaluated. Two lipases: free, soluble TL and immobilized Candida antarctica (CA) catalyzed methanolic transesterification of crude Jatropha and refined palm oil. Results: Jatropha yields were similar to palm biodiesel with NaOH as catalyst. After 24 h transesterification, Jatropha (81 %) and palm oil (86 %) biodiesel yields with TL as catalyst were significantly higher than CA (<70 %) but inferior to NaOH (>90 %). Enzymatic catalysts (TL and CA) produced Jatropha biodiesel with optimum flow properties but did not complied with ASTM D6751 stability parameters (free fatty acid content and oil stability index). Conclusions: Biodiesel production with filtered, degummed, low FFA Jatropha oil using a free liquid lipase (TL) as catalyst showed higher yielding potential than immobilized CA lipase as substitute of RBD palm oil with alkaline catalyst. However, Jatropha enzymatic biodiesel yield and stability were inferior to alkaline catalyzed biodiesel and not in compliance with international quality standards. Lower quality due to incomplete alcoholysis and esterification, potential added costs due to need of more than 24 h to achieve comparable biodiesel yields and extra post-transesterification refining reactions are among the remaining drawbacks for the environmentally friendlier enzymatic catalysis of crude Jatropha oil to become an economically viable alternative to chemical catalysis. © 2015 Bueso et al.

AB  - Purpose: Microemulsion-based biofuel (ME50) is considered a promising renewable transportation fuel as well as a feasible substitute for diesel fuel. This study investigated the life cycle environmental assessment (LCA) of ME50 production from palm oil-diesel blends with ethanol and compared it with alternative biofuels, neat biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel-diesel blends (B50). Methods: The LCA system boundary was separated into five stages: the oil palm cultivation stage, the palm oil production stage, the microemulsion production stage, the transportation stage, and the exhaust emissions in the use stage. Ten potential environmental impacts of the ME50 were evaluated, namely, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, land use, water depletion, and fossil depletion, by combining the CML 2000, IPCC 2007, Ecoindicator 99, and ReCipe methods in SimaPro (v. 7.1). Further, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the microemulsion fuel production stage were calculated following the product carbon footprint (CFP) methodology. Results and discussion: It was estimated that 1.17 t or 45,800 MJ of microemulsion biofuel emits 3142 kg of CO2eq through its life cycle. Refined palm oil and co-surfactant are crucial materials for the environmental performance of the microemulsion-based biofuel. Based on the environmental impact analyses, palm oil production from cultivation through the oil refinery exhibited the greatest environmental impacts in terms of eutrophication and water depletion. Surfactant use—a key element in the microemulsion formation—has a significant impact on land use and ecotoxicity-related impact categories. In comparing the impacts among ME50, B100, and B50, it was found that microemulsion fuel production has lower environmental impact than B100 and B50, except in terms of land use and fossil depletion. Conclusions: Based on this analysis, the major environmental impact during the microemulsion biofuel production stage results from the raw materials used. The selection of appropriate materials and formula adjustment in the microemulsion fuel formulation are key in minimizing the potential impacts from biofuel production. Therefore, microemulsion biofuel is shown to be an environmentally sound technology for green production of biofuel. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Understanding drivers of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) is essential for modeling future dynamics or development of management strategies to ameliorate or prevent further decline of natural resources. In this study, an attempt has been made to identify the main drivers behind the LULC changes that had occurred in the past four decades in Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the south-central highlands of Ethiopia. The datasets required for the study were generated through both primary and secondary sources. Combination of techniques, including descriptive statistics, GIS-based processing, and regression analyses were employed for data analyses. Changes triggered by the interplay of more than 12 drivers were identified related to social, economic, environmental, policy/institutional, and technological factors. Specifically, population growth, expansion of cultivated lands and settlements, livestock ranching, cutting of woody species for fuelwood, and charcoal making were the top six important drivers of LULC change as viewed by the local people and confirmed by quantitative analyses. Differences in respondents’ perceptions related to environmental (i.e., location specific) and socioeconomic determinants (e.g., age and literacy) about drivers were statically significant (P = 0.001). LULC changes were also determined by distances to major drivers (e.g., the further a pixel is from the road, the less likelihood of changes) as shown by the landscape level analyses. Further studies are suggested targeting these drivers to explore the consequences and future options and formulate intervention strategies for sustainable development in the studied landscape and elsewhere with similar geographic settings. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Compounds such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) are generated through the dehydration of xylose and glucose, respectively, during dilute-acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and are also potent microbial growth and fermentation inhibitors. The enzymatic reduction of these furan aldehydes to their corresponding, and less toxic, alcohols is an engineering approach that has been successfully implemented in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ethanologenic Escherichia coli, but has not yet been investigated in thermophiles relevant to biofuel production through consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). Developing CBP-relevant biocatalysts that are either naturally resistant to such inhibitors, or are amenable to engineered resistance, is therefore, an important component in making biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass feasible. Results: A butanol dehydrogenase encoding gene from Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E (Teth39-1597), previously shown to have furfural and 5-HMF reducing capabilities, was cloned into a suicide plasmid, pDCW171 and transformed into a lactate dehydrogenase mutant of Caldicellulosiruptor bescii. Integration of the gene into the C. bescii chromosome was verified via PCR amplification and stable expression was observed up to 75°C. Heterologous expression of the NADPH-dependent BdhA enzyme conferred increased resistance of the engineered strain to both furfural and 5-HMF relative to the wild-type and parental strains. Further, when challenged with 15 mM concentrations of either furan aldehyde, the ability to eliminate furfural or 5-HMF from the culture medium was significantly improved in the engineered strain. Conclusions: A genetically engineered strain of C. bescii (JWCB044) has been constructed that shows both an improved tolerance to furan aldehydes and an improved ability to eliminate furfural and 5-HMF from the culture medium. The work presented here represents the first example of engineering furan aldehyde resistance into a CBP-relevant thermophile and further validates C. bescii as being a genetically tractable microbe of importance for lignocellulosic biofuel production. © 2015 Chung et al.

AB  - Habitat degradation and subsequent biodiversity damage often take place far from the place of consumption because of globalization and the increasing level of international trade. Informing consumers and policy makers about the biodiversity impacts "hidden" in the life cycle of imported products is an important step toward achieving sustainable consumption patterns. Spatially explicit methods are needed in life cycle assessment to accurately quantify biodiversity impacts of products and processes. We use the Countryside species-area relationship (SAR) to quantify regional species loss due to land occupation and transformation for five taxa and six land use types in 804 terrestrial ecoregions. Further, we calculate vulnerability scores for each ecoregion based on the fraction of each species' geographic range (endemic richness) hosted by the ecoregion and the IUCN assigned threat level of each species. Vulnerability scores are multiplied with SAR-predicted regional species loss to estimate potential global extinctions per unit of land use. As a case study, we assess the land use biodiversity impacts of 1 kg of bioethanol produced using six different feed stocks in different parts of the world. Results show that the regions with highest biodiversity impacts differed markedly when the vulnerability of species was included. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A well-to-wheel (WTW) life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to evaluate the environmental profile of producing liquid transportation fuels via fast pyrolysis of perennial grasses: switchgrass and miscanthus. The framework established in this study consists of (1) an agricultural model used to determine biomass growth rates, agrochemical application rates, and other key parameters in the production of miscanthus and switchgrass biofeedstock; (2) an ASPEN model utilized to simulate thermochemical conversion via fast pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading of bio-oil to renewable transportation fuel. Monte Carlo analysis is performed to determine statistical bounds for key sustainability and performance measures including life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and Energy Return on Investment (EROI). The results of this work reveal that the EROI and GHG emissions (gCO2e/MJ-fuel) for fast pyrolysis derived fuels range from 1.52 to 2.56 and 22.5 to 61.0 respectively, over the host of scenarios evaluated. Further analysis reveals that the energetic performance and GHG reduction potential of fast pyrolysis-derived fuels are highly sensitive to the choice of coproduct scenario and LCA allocation scheme, and in select cases can change the life cycle carbon balance from meeting to exceeding the renewable fuel standard emissions reduction threshold for cellulosic biofuels. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Isoprene and other volatile organic compounds emitted from vegetation play a key role in governing the formation of ground-level ozone. Emission rates of such compounds depend critically on the plant species. The cultivation of biofuel feedstocks will contribute to future land use change, altering the distribution of plant species and hence the magnitude and distribution of emissions. Here we use relationships between biomass yield and isoprene emissions derived from experimental data for 29 commercially available poplar hybrids to assess the impact that the large-scale cultivation of poplar for use as a biofuel feedstock will have on air quality, specifically ground-level ozone concentrations, in Europe. We show that the increases in ground-level ozone across Europe will increase the number of premature deaths attributable to ozone pollution each year by up to 6%. Substantial crop losses (up to ∼9 Mt y-1 of wheat and maize) are also projected. We further demonstrate that these impacts are strongly dependent on the location of the poplar plantations, due to the prevailing meteorology, the population density, and the dominant crop type of the region. Our findings indicate the need for a concerted and centralized decision-making process that considers all aspects of future land use change in Europe, and not just the effect on greenhouse gas emissions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To examine the national fuel and emissions impacts from increasingly electrified light-duty transportation, we reconstructed the vehicle technology portfolios from two national vehicle studies. Using these vehicle portfolios, we normalized assumptions and examined sensitivity around the rates of electrified vehicle penetration, travel demand growth, and electricity decarbonization. We further examined the impact of substituting low-carbon advanced cellulosic biofuels in place of petroleum. Twenty-seven scenarios were benchmarked against a 50% petroleum-reduction target and an 80% GHG-reduction target. We found that with high rates of electrification (40% of miles traveled) the petroleum-reduction benchmark could be satisfied, even with high travel demand growth. The same highly electrified scenarios, however, could not satisfy 80% GHG-reduction targets, even assuming 80% decarbonized electricity and no growth in travel demand. Regardless of precise consumer vehicle preferences, emissions are a function of the total reliance on electricity versus liquid fuels and the corresponding greenhouse gas intensities of both. We found that at a relatively high rate of electrification (40% of miles and 26% by fuel), an 80% GHG reduction could only be achieved with significant quantities of low-carbon liquid fuel in cases with low or moderate travel demand growth. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates hold great potential as a feedstock for microbial biofuel production, due to their high concentration of fermentable sugars. Present at lower concentrations are a suite of aromatic compounds that can inhibit fermentation by biofuel-producing microbes. We have developed a microbial-mediated strategy for removing these aromatic compounds, using the purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. When grown photoheterotrophically in an anaerobic environment, R. palustris removes most of the aromatics from ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) treated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH), while leaving the sugars mostly intact. We show that R. palustris can metabolize a host of aromatic substrates in ACSH that have either been previously described as unable to support growth, such as methoxylated aromatics, and those that have not yet been tested, such as aromatic amides. Removing the aromatics from ACSH with R. palustris, allowed growth of a second microbe that could not grow in the untreated ACSH. By using defined mutants, we show that most of these aromatic compounds are metabolized by the benzoyl-CoA pathway. We also show that loss of enzymes in the benzoyl-CoA pathway prevents total degradation of the aromatics in the hydrolysate, and instead allows for biological transformation of this suite of aromatics into selected aromatic compounds potentially recoverable as an additional bioproduct. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels and their environmental risks have brought to the foreground energy crops as a possible source of bioenergy. Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been suggested for production of solid biofuels (briquettes) due to good physic-mechanical properties as well as positive energy and combustion characteristics. This study determined economic potential of hemp briquettes production in the Czech Republic. A field trial was conducted in 2009–2014 in Prague in order to compare biomass yield (BY) of hemp varieties Bialobrzeskie (B) and Ferimon (F) harvested in autumn and spring period. Based on obtained results this study determined production costs of hemp briquettes (CZK t-1), revenue (CZK t-1) and rate of return (%) for four scenarios (B, F harvested in autumn and B, F harvested in spring). Briquettes production costs ranged from 4,015 CZK t-1 to 4,707 CZK t-1 for B in spring and B in autumn, respectively, due to 30% lower biomass yield in spring harvest. Results indicated that hemp briquettes production was not profitable if the selling price was the same as the price of wood briquettes and with BY obtained in experiment (7.18–10.7 t ha-1 of dry matter). Briquettes production in autumn made profit of 9% for B and 7% for F when subsidies for hemp cultivation were considered. In current conditions in the Czech Republic, utilization of hemp for briquettes production did not prove to be economically feasible. © 2015, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract The cradle-to-grave environmental impacts of thermochemical ethanol from loblolly pine, eucalyptus, unmanaged hardwoods, forest residues, and switchgrass biomass feedstocks were determined and compared to gasoline. The Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Impacts (TRACI) method was implemented in SimaPro 7.3 to calculate midpoint environmental impacts. Two normalization value sets were used and weighting was performed to produce a single environmental score. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of cellulosic ethanol as compared to gasoline were 65%-77%, depending on the biomass feedstock, qualifying these biofuels as cellulosic ethanol under the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS2). Effects of direct land-use change were significant (∼ 18%) and could increase the GHG emissions for switchgrass derived ethanol above the federal GHG reduction thresholds for cellulosic ethanol. The production and use of cellulosic ethanol reduced fossil fuel consumption by between 95% and 97% and by 81% for forest and switchgrass derived ethanol, respectively. Cellulosic ethanol, however, did not reduce all environmental impact categories (e.g., eutrophication, ozone depletion respiratory effects, acidification, and smog) compared to gasoline. The fuel scenario ranking from lowest impact to highest impact consistently remained the same for GHG emissions, fossil fuel use, and the two single weight score analysis methods and was, in ascending order, forest residues with no forest establishment burdens, forest residues with forest establishment burdens, natural hardwood, pine, switchgrass, and finally gasoline. The GHG emission reductions from the use of cellulosic ethanol at the renewable fuel standards mandated production volume of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol per year by 2020 would result in 9-10 billion metric tonnes of GHG emissions avoided.

AB  - Previous research suggested that Ricinus communis may be used for soil remediation and oil production. However, the quality of the oil and bioproducts under polluted conditions need to be tested to be assured of their potential use in biofuel production with environmentally friendly bioproducts (cake, seed coats and biomass). Oil characteristics and metal concentrations in oil, cake (de-oiled seeds) and seed coats, as well as the shoot carbon content were analyzed. The oil contents of palmitic and oleic acids from plants growing in polluted mine tailings were comparable to those for plants grown under non-polluted conditions. Linoleic acid content was significantly higher in oil of plants from mine tailings, which enriches the fuel properties. Cadmium and lead were mainly concentrated in the seed coat, whereas copper in the cake. Castor bean oil had low concentrations of cadmium, lead, zinc, nickel, manganese and copper-free. Cake and seed coats can be useful for soil fertilization applications since the metal concentrations are below safety regulations. The biomass carbon was around 43 %, which suggests it may be used for biogas production. These properties make castor bean valuable for its oil and bioproducts even when growing at metal-polluted sites. However, agronomic optimization is needed in order to produce higher plant productivity. © 2014, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The rumen is a complex ecosystem enriched for microorganisms able to degrade biomass during the animal’s digestion process. The recovery of new enzymes from naturally evolved biomass-degrading microbial communities is a promising strategy to overcome the inefficient enzymatic plant destruction in industrial production of biofuels. In this context, this study aimed to describe the bacterial composition and functions in the sheep rumen microbiome, focusing on carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAE). Here, we used phylogenetic profiling analysis (inventory of 16S rRNA genes) combined with metagenomics to access the rumen microbiome of four sheep and explore its potential to identify fibrolytic enzymes. The bacterial community was dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, followed by Proteobacteria. As observed for other ruminants, Prevotella was the dominant genus in the microbiome, comprising more than 30 % of the total bacterial community. Multivariate analysis of the phylogenetic profiling data and chemical parameters showed a positive correlation between the abundance of Prevotellaceae (Bacteroidetes phylum) and organic matter degradability. A negative correlation was observed between Succinivibrionaceae (Proteobacteria phylum) and methane production. An average of 2 % of the shotgun metagenomic reads was assigned to putative CAE when considering nine protein databases. In addition, assembled contigs allowed recognition of 67 putative partial CAE (NCBI-Refseq) representing 12 glycosyl hydrolase families (Pfam database). Overall, we identified a total of 28 lignocellulases, 22 amylases and 9 other putative CAE, showing the sheep rumen microbiome as a promising source of new fibrolytic enzymes. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Jatropha spp. is an important phytogenetic resource used as food, medicine, and biofuel. in this study, we verified the taxonomic identity of Jatropha species for The Biosphere Reserve Tehuacan-Cuicatlan, and the Ecological Land Units (ELU) occupied by them. We assessed the conservation status of their habitats, and the vulnerability of Jatropha spp. populations. A total of 15 sampling sites were selected in the Reserve. The taxonomic work was based on specimens, original descriptions and type material from herbaria and those available on-line. ELUs were classified using biophysical variables, and gvSiG software. Ecological attributes were determined using a quantitative analysis by the point-centered quarter method; disturbance was estimated through site indicators, and the conservation status of the Jatropha populations was assessed using the Method for Evaluation of the Risk of Extinction of Plants in Mexico (MER). Jatropha frequently dominated the physiognomy of plant communities. The current distribution of Jatropha species in the Reserve was mainly determined by elevation, temperature, and precipitation variables. The confirmed species were Jatropha ciliata Sessé ex Cerv., Jatropha neopauciflora Pax, Jatropha oaxacana J. Jiménez Ram. & R. Torres, Jatropha rufescens Brandegee, and Jatropha rzedowskii J. Jiménez Ram., which are distributed in four of the six defined ELU. J. neopauciflora and J. rzedowskii were the most widespread species; this last species concur in four, J. oaxacana in two, while J. rufescens and J. ciliata in one ELU, being the most restricted. The richness of the genera in the associated communities ranged from 16 to 42. The maximum and minimum importance Value indexes were observed in San Nicolas Tepoxtitlan for J. neopauciflora (53.75%) and J. rze-dowskii (1.50%). The disturbance index varied from 0.22 to 0.82, with an average of 0.51, where the livestock variable had a high contribution. Considering the risk categories of MER, we concluded that J. oaxacana requires special protection, and J. ciliata and J. rufescens were species under extinction risk. The conservation status of the plant communities inhabited by populations of Jatropha spp. was moderate, taking into account the rate of disturbance. The main factors affecting the habitats of Jatropha were livestock and human activities; the floristic composition of the surrounding plant communities has low richness. These results support the urgent need of conservation strategies to avoid the loss of important wild growing species of Jatropha populations.. © 2015, Universidad de Costa Rica. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Soil salt-alkalization is a major limiting factor for crop production in many regions. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season C4 perennial rhizomatous bunchgrass and a target lignocellulosic biofuel species. The objective of this study was to evaluate relative alkali-salt tolerance among 30 switchgrass lines. Tillers of each switchgrass line were transplanted into pots filled with fine sand. Two months after transplanting, plants at E5 developmental stage were grown in either half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with 0 mM Na+(control) or half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution with 150 mM Na+ and pH of 9.5 (alkalisalt stress treatment) for 20 d. Alkali-salt stress damaged cell membranes [higher electrolyte leakage (EL)], reduced leaf relative water content (RWC), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration rate (Tr). An alkali-salt stress tolerance trait index (ASTTI) for each parameter was calculated based on the ratio of the value under alkali-salt stress and the value under non-stress conditions for each parameter of each line. Relative alkali-salt tolerance was determined based on principal components analysis and cluster analysis of the physiological parameters and their ASTTI values. Significant differences in alkali-salt stress tolerance were found among the 30 lines. Lowland lines TEM-SEC, Alamo, TEM-SLC and Kanlow were classified as alkali-salt tolerant. In contrast, three lowland lines (AM-314/MS-155, BN-13645-64) and two upland lines (Caddo and Blackwell-1) were classified as alkali-salt sensitive. The results suggest wide variations exist in alkalisalt stress tolerance among the 30 switchgrass lines. The approach of using a combination of principal components and cluster analysis of the physiological parameters and related ASTTI is feasible for evaluating alkali-salt tolerance in switchgrass. © 2015 Hu et al.

AB  - The renewed interest in the use of sugarcane (Saccharin officinarum L.) for biofuel could provide a viable market for potential Hawaiian sugarcane feedstock producers. In Hawaii, sugarcane is grown as an irrigated 2-yr cycle crop. there is however little information on crop parameter attributes of 2-yr cycle sugarcane. Th is field study on Maui, Hawaii, analyzed the relationship between sugarcane biomass accumulation and specific crop parameters. Overall, the high dry biomass yield (80.20 Mg ha–1) was the result of a high leaf area index (LAI, 7.50) and radiation use efficiency (RUE, 2.06 g MJ–1. the crop growth rate was highly correlated to LAI (R2, 0.86), and a light extinction coefficient (k) of 0.53 was estimated. Stalk density was estimated at 18 stalks m–2, with a maximum plant height of 3.6 m, and a rooting depthexceeding 2.0 m. When the crop parameters were incorporated into a biological model of Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) the model accurately simulated sugarcane yields across seven different soil types and multiple management scenarios of applied irrigation water, N and P fertilizer inputs and various planting and harvest dates. the mean simulation percent (%) errors ranged from –6.4% to 1.8%, while the calculated Fisher’s paired t test of 1.41 with 39 degrees of freedom, showed no significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) between measured and simulated yields. the ALMANAC model should be useful as a decision support tool for evaluating sugarcane management alternatives that maximize yields while optimizing water, N and P inputs. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - There exists a strong link between water security and food security. Both are affected by the water–soil–climate nexus, social and political conflicts, growing energy demand withemphasis on biofuels and the virtual water trade. Sustainable development necessitates research on site-specific and generic researchable issues on water resources and their management. In the context of food security, sustainable intensification of rainfed and irrigated croplands needs technology for an efficient conversion of blue water (rivers, lakes, ground water, and precipitation) into green water enhancing water use efficiency (WUE) and decreasing losses. the problem of excessive groundwater depletion (Ogallala in the United States, Indo-Gangetic Plains, North China Plains) must be addressed. Improving desert farming is a high priority. Water quality, affected by agriculture and industrial runoff, can cause algal bloom and anoxia in surface water. the impact of soil degradation on water quantity needs site-specific research. Water governance and policy issues are specifically relevant in water-scarce regions and trans-boundary watersheds. Growing urbanization and industrial use requires costeffective measures for safe use of gray water. the need for research focus on adaptation and mitigation of climate change, and managing the risks of extreme events cannot be overemphasized. Similar to soils, the finite world water resources must never be taken for granted. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - The cultivation in wastelands of Jatropha curcas as a biofuel crop avoids the alleged food vs. fuel dilemma. Converting wastelands into Jatropha plantation will produce changes in microbial composition which in turn may have a profound effect on biochemical activities and physico-chemical properties of soil. These changes may be permanent and the soil may attain a different equilibrium through this land use change. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial diversity of native undisturbed soil of barren rocky wasteland and soil drawn from 24 months old J. curcas plantation. Cultivation of Jatropha employing suitable agronomic practices improved soil organic carbon, available P and K. Total soil DNA extracts were used as template DNA to amplify 16S and 18S rDNA gene fragments that were further sequenced and taxonomically assigned by comparisons with gene bank resources. Diversity indices showed that the microbial diversity was higher and more evenly distributed in native soil than in Jatropha planted soil. A prominent diversity shift from Ascomycota in the native soil to Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota in the Jatropha bulk soils was observed. Interestingly, the conversion from barren land to Jatropha cultivation with recommended agricultural practices also brought about a marked decrease in population of several fungal pathogens. There was a striking increase in members of Proteobacteria (1.7-fold) as well as of Bacteroidetes in Jatropha planted soil as compared to native soil. In contrast, there was a decrease in the Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi community in Jatropha planted soil. It would be useful to follow the microbial pattern over the long term and to study the evolution of the Jatropha soil ecosystem on wastelands. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is an important non feed crop, increasingly important as a biofuel crop. It is hardy and resistant to different stress conditions in the field. In the wastelands of Gujarat (India), it is being grown for land reclamation and for socio-economic benefits. The long coastline in this state also promotes the growth of a large number of halophytes. Exploiting the genetic resource of Jatropha and halophytes for drought and salt-induced gene is an important area of research. For the isolation of genes and to study the molecular mechanism a good qualitative and quantitative RNA is a prerequisite. Jatropha leaves have latex, and therefore isolating RNA using guanidine thiocyanate or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide did not yield desirable quality of RNA. This paper reports a very simple and economical protocol for the isolation of good quality RNA from Jatropha and a few halophytes. The sodium dodecyl sulphate was used as a detergent for lysis of plant cells in the extraction buffer along with bentonite, which inhibits the ribonuclease’s activity. The addition of water saturated phenol in mortar-pestle, during grinding, facilitated better homogenisation of the tissues. Absolute RNA precipitation was obtained with the help of 2-butoxyethanol. Further this RNA was used successfully in preparation of complementary DNA and subsequently used for gene isolation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis is being developed to convert biomass into renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel dependency, yet little sociological research has been conducted on knowledge and attitudes toward the technology in rural southern communities. Our study involved participatory collaboration with conservationists, farmers and stakeholders in the Tennessee Upper Cumberland to better understand attitudes regarding biomass production and conversion by pyrolysis. We found farmers very knowledgeable of first generation biomass feedstock and fuels but not familiar with pyrolysis. Rural economic growth as a result of supplying residues and feedstock for biofuels production appeared to be the main motivation behind future farmer involvement. Findings from our study indicate that farming communities are willing to partner with scientists if familiarized with the technology and approached with transparency and equality early in the decision making process. We conclude that such collaborative learning is essential when introducing pyrolysis to rural southern communities. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Drawing on a micro-level ethnography, this paper explores the process by which a rural municipality managed to pressure the state into temporarily halting the land extension of a large-scale biofuel project in an agropastoral area of southern Madagascar. It documents how the coalition of local leaders and wealthy cattle owners behind the protest resisted threats to their land access and local domination by finding spaces of expression outside the control of local consultation, and creating alliances with influential activists. In a moral economy veering between rationales of autochthony and extraversion, the transnationalisation of the protest sent shock waves through a state apparatus divided and focused on the prospects of coming elections. By analysing the environmental, cognitive and relational mechanisms behind the emergence and repercussions of this bottom-up struggle, this paper points to the varied bargaining endowments that exist within agrarian communities as well as to the issues of authority at stake within corporate enclosure of land. In states where the rural poor have been historically marginalised from decision-making, consultation processes generally offer little space for participation. This paper demonstrates that contexts of political uncertainty open up new spaces for them to claim their rights but that gains made in such circumstances are fragile and contested. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Recent debates on land grabbing and biofuels tend to link oil palm expansion to rural dispossession, environmental degradation and rural resistance. In this paper, we examine to what extent ‘enclosure’, a central concept in two critiques – ‘environmentalism of the poor’ and ‘green grabbing’ – is intrinsically linked to oil palm expansion. We argue that where enclosure is absent, poor peasants may seek greater market integration over resistance to modernisation processes. We analyse how and why peasants engage in oil palm cultivation and how their involvement undermines green efforts to curb its expansion in Chiapas, Mexico. Our analysis suggests that an exclusive focus on enclosure as the main driving force behind contestation and agrarian social relationships is unable to explain agrarian dynamics and the multiple uses to which environmental narratives are put. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Almost 90% of our energy comes from fossil fuels, which are both limited and polluting, hence the need to find alternative sources. Biofuels can provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy for the future. Recent significant advances in genetic engineering and fermentation technology have made microbial bio-based production of chemicals from renewable resources more viable. Clostridium species are considered as promising micro-organisms for the production of a wide range of chemicals for industrial use. However, a number of scientific challenges still need to be overcome to facilitate an economically viable production system. These include the use of cheap non-food-based substrates, a better understanding of the metabolic processes involved, improvement of strains through genetic engineering and innovation in process technology. This paper reviews recent developments in these areas, advancing the use of Clostridium within an industrial context especially for the production of biofuels. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Understanding differences in source zone natural attenuation (SZNA) rates occurring among field sites impacted by the same contaminant and across field sites impacted by different contaminants is critical for developing management strategies. For example, unique site conditions can favor or inhibit biodegradation, whereas differences between contaminants can lead to variations in biodegradation potential. However, the implications of these effects for real-world release scenarios remain ambiguous. To better understand the implications of these effects, the authors investigated differences in SZNA rates at two crude oil and two denatured fuel-grade ethanol (DFE) spill sites using on-site measurements of surficial gas effluxes. At the crude oil sites, CH4 effluxes were below detection, whereas CH4 effluxes occurred at both DFE sites. Similarly, SZNA rates among sites impacted by the same contaminant were comparable, whereas order of magnitude differences existed between sites impacted by crude oil or DFE. At DFE sites, results also revealed source zone expansion in relation to the initial mass in place, suggesting that extended spatial monitoring may be required to characterize risk potential. Overall, key differences between crude oil and DFE release sites demonstrated the importance of site-specific interactions between hydrogeology and contaminant composition for mediating gas emissions and SZNA rates, and modulating gas transport regimes under field conditions.

AB  - Biofuels are non-polluting, locally available, and reliable fuels obtained from renewable sources. The rising cost of petroleum-based liquid fuels, due to the depletion of oil sources, has brought biofuels back into focus. Laticiferous and resinous plants can be used for the production of biofuels by catalytic cracking of their non-polar extracts (biocrude). In the present work six resinous species belonging to the families Rubiaceae, Simaroubaceae, Leguminoseae, Dipterocarpaceae, Pinaceae, and Compositae were selected and studied for their potential to yield biocrude, which can be processed into biofuels. Results of studies carried out on upgrading the biocrudes by catalytic cracking using a commercial catalyst are presented. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nigerian energy is primarily driven by fossil fuels, principally crude oil and natural gas. Despite being a major exporter of crude oil, ironically, refined petroleum products are in short supply in Nigeria. The country is now dependent on foreign nations for a large proportion of its refined products. The Nigerian biofuel policy was released in 2007 with the aim of spurring the indigenous production of biofuel in Nigeria to substitute for imported petroleum products. About 20 bioethanol projects have commenced in Nigeria with an additional 13 projects in the offing. All these projects planned to utilize food crops as their feedstock; hence they are regarded as first generation bioethanol projects. The article presents the benefits and barriers of emerging first-generation bioethanol projects in Nigeria.

AB  - According to the demands of energy saving and carbon emission reduction, the water vs. energy nexus has become a major concern worldwide. Brazil occupies a singular position in the global energy system. A major portion of the Brazilian occupancies has electricity and the energy system expansion that, at first, possesses adequate means for supporting the economic growing may experience some turnovers. The Brazil determination through alternative fuels was a natural choice, given its large hydropower potential and land agricultural base. In the transportation sector Brazil has developed its energy matrix towards an important rate of ethanol and biodiesel. Although those fuels are low carbon emitter, they may probably not be an affordable alternative regarding land use, food security and water footprint. In this way, considering the recent advances in the exploration of oil from Pre-salt (9-15 million barrels) and the discovery of shale gas wells up to 245 tcf, together to unfavorable social and environmental issues associated to biofuels, the Brazilian energy matrix might turn back to the fossil fuels again. These represent challenges to the Brazilian policymakers and how they will be solved will reflect not only in Brazil but also to the world at large. © 2015, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Today, almost 3 billion people in developing countries rely on biomass as primary cooking fuel, with profound negative implications for their well-being. Improved biomass cooking stoves are alleged to counteract these adverse effects. This paper evaluates take-up and impacts of low-cost improved stoves through a randomized controlled trial. The randomized stove is primarily designed to curb firewood consumption, but not smoke emissions. Nonetheless, we find considerable effects not only on firewood consumption, but also on smoke exposure and, consequently, smoke-related disease symptoms. The reduced smoke exposure results from behavioural changes in terms of increased outside cooking and a reduction in cooking time. We conclude that in order to assess the effectiveness of a technology-oriented intervention, it is critical to not only account for the incidence of technology adoption - the extensive margin - but also for the way the new technology is used - the intensive margin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus grown in cool temperate regions of North America and Europe can exhibit severe mortality in the year after planting, and poor frost tolerance of leaves. Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), a productive C4 perennial grass native to North America, has been suggested as an alternative biofuel feedstock for colder regions; however, its cold tolerance relative to M. × giganteus is uncertain. Here, we compare the cold tolerance thresholds for winter-dormant rhizomes and spring/summer leaves of M. × giganteus and three accessions of S. pectinata. All genotypes were planted at a field site in Ontario, Canada. In November and February, the temperatures corresponding to 50% rhizome mortality (LT50) were near-24°C for S. pectinata and-4°C for M. × giganteus. In late April, the LT50 of rhizomes rose to-10°C for S. pectinata but remained near-4°C for M. × giganteus. Twenty percent of the M. × giganteus rhizomes collected in late April were dead while S. pectinata rhizomes showed no signs of winter injury. Photosynthesis and electrolyte leakage measurements in spring and summer demonstrate that S. pectinata leaves have greater frost tolerance in the field. For example, S. pectinata leaves remained viable above-9°C while the mortality threshold was near-5°C for M. × giganteus. These results indicate M. × giganteus will be unsuitable for production in continental interiors of cool-temperate climate zones unless freezing and frost tolerance are improved. By contrast, S. pectinata has the freezing and frost tolerance required for a higher-latitude bioenergy crop.

AB  - Several studies have dealt with the microwave-induced pyrolysis of organic residues as an effective technology for maximizing the production of syngas at the expense of the production of oily tars. This liquid fraction is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds making it difficult to upgrade for use as a biofuel and containing hazardous compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In this study the effect of the type of residue (municipal solid wastes, sewage sludges, plastic wastes and agroresidues) and the heating mechanism on the product distribution within the oil fraction has been investigated by means of GC-MS technique. Two different approaches have been performed: direct GC-MS analysis and methanolysed-oils GC-MS analysis, the later determining the non-volatile compounds. In general, quite different distributions are attained when microwave pyrolysis is conducted, providing lighter compounds. In some cases, such as the plastic-derived oil, microwave pyrolysis lead to a potential source of chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylenes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pyrolysis experiments of paulownia wood (P. tomentose) were performed in a fixed-bed reactor under static and nitrogen atmospheres. The effects of the final pyrolysis temperature (623-873 K), heating rate (10 and 50 K min-1), particle size (0.224-1.8 mm), and sweep gas flow rate (100-300 mL min-1) were investigated on the pyrolysis conversion and product yields. The maximum pyrolysis conversion of 77.4% was obtained at a final pyrolysis temperature of 773 K. The highest liquid product yield of 54.0 wt% was obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 773 K with a heating rate of 50 K min-1, particle size of 0.425 &lt; Dp &lt;1 mm and a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL min-1. In addition, the bio-oil and fractions of the bio-oil were examined using elemental analysis and, chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. The empirical formula of the bio-oil with heating value of 28.6 MJ kg-1 was established as CH1.57O0.29. The obtained bio-oil can be considered a potential source for energy or fuels and a valuable chemical feedstock. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Photoautotrophic fatty acid production of a highly CO2-tolerant green alga Chlorococcum littorale in the presence of inorganic carbon at 295 K and light intensity of 170 μmol-photon m-2 s-1 was investigated. CO2 concentration in the bubbling gas was adjusted by mixing pure gas components of CO2 and N2 to avoid photorespiration and β-oxidation of fatty acids under O2 surrounding conditions. Maximum content of total fatty acid showed pH-dependence after nitrate depletion of the culture media and increased with the corresponding inorganic carbon ratio. Namely, [HCO3-]/([CO2]+n[ CO32-]) ratio in the culture media was found to be a controlling factor for photoautotrophic fatty acid production after the nitrate limitation. At a CO2 concentration of 5% (vol/vol) and a pH of 6.7, the fatty acid content was 47.8 wt % (dry basis) at its maximum that is comparable with land plant seed oils. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

AB  - The use of biofuels can result on a decrease of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when compared to fossil fuels. However, the expansion of biofuels crops has been either based on direct or indirect displacement of natural ecosystems or on the use of degraded or marginal lands. The former results in direct habitat loss, whereas the later results in usual agricultural impacts (e.g., soil and biotic contamination and water eutrophication). However, in some circumstances biofuels crops can result on an increase in biodiversity compared to other agricultural crops. Agricultural zoning can mitigate the impacts of land use change (LUC), either direct (dLUC) or indirect (iLUC), whereas the use of wildlife-friendly techniques can mitigate the impacts of agriculture intensification. However, in both cases long-term biodiversity monitoring programs should be established in order to help the decision making process concerning the conflict between the expansion of biofuels crops and the conservation of biodiversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This techno-economic analysis/life-cycle assessment is based on actual production by the Cornell Marine Algal Biofuels Consortium with biomass productivity&gt;23g/m2-day. Ten distinct cases are presented for two locations, Texas and Hawaii, based on a 100-ha production facility with end-to-end processing that yields fungible co-products including biocrude, animal feed, and ethanol. Several processing technologies were evaluated: centrifugation and solvent extraction (POS Biosciences), thermochemical conversion (Valicor), hydrothermal liquefaction (PNNL), catalytic hydrothermal gasification (Genifuel), combined heat and power, wet extraction (OpenAlgae), and fermentation. The facility design was optimized by co-location with waste CO2, a terraced design for gravity flow, using renewable energy, and low cost materials. The case studies are used to determine the impact of design choices on the energy return on investment, minimum fuel and feed sale prices, discounted payback period, as well as water depletion potential, human health, ecosystem quality, non-renewable resources, and climate change environmental indicators. The most promising cases would be economically competitive at market prices around $2/L for crude oil, while also providing major environmental benefits and freshwater savings. As global demands for fuels and protein continue rising, these results are important steps towards economical and environmentally sustainable production at an industrial scale. © 2015.

AB  - The European Commission has set a long-term goal to develop a competitive, resource efficient and low carbon economy by 2050. Bioeconomy is expected to play an important role in the low carbon economy. This paper provides a review of the policy framework for developing a bioeconomy in the European Union covering energy and climate, agriculture and forestry, industry and research. The Europe has a number of well-established traditional bio-based industries, ranging from agriculture, food, feed, fibre and forest-based industries. This paper proposes an analysis of the current status of bioeconomy in the European Union and worldwide until 2020 and beyond. We estimate the current bio economy market at about € 2.4 billion, including agriculture, food and beverage, agro-industrial products, fisheries and aquaculture, forestry, wood-based industry, biochemical, enzymes, biopharmaceutical, biofuels and bioenergy, using about 2 billion tonnes and employing 22 million persons. New sectors are emerging, such as biomaterials and green chemistry. The transition toward a bioeconomy will rely on the advancement in technology of a range of processes, on the achievement of a breakthrough in terms of technical performances and cost effectiveness and will depend on the availability of sustainable biomass. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The aviation industry worldwide is committed to reduce CO2 emissions. The present goal is towards Carbon Neutral Growth (CNG) by 2020 and 50% reduction in net CO2 emissions over 2005 levels by 2050. There are not easy alternatives to liquid fuels for airplanes; therefore, biofuels are necessarily part of the solution. However, the specifications for jet biofuel rule out ethanol and biodiesel, the most common biofuels in the market. There are several routes for the production of aviation biofuel allowing the use of a wide range of biomasses. The conversion and refining technology pathways will be determinant for the choice of feedstock. At present, most jet biofuel tested in airplanes are derived from oils, but not taking into account conversion technologies, the best options to start an aviation biofuel industry in Brazil are sugarcane, eucalyptus, and soybean, of the sugar, cellulose, and oil crop groups. The main reasons are the established production chains, high yields, competitive prices, and possibility of greenhouse gases abatement. Other crops may be feasible options depending on specific regional conditions, further agronomic improvements, and cost reduction. Taking as reference the energy content of ethanol, around 30Mha of land would be necessary to supply sugarcane to meet 50% of the present global consumption of jet fuel. This is less than the 64Mha of land suitable for sugarcane in Brazil, mostly replacing pasture and without using environmentally sensitive areas. This area may be less as biomass yields increase and the energy of other plant parts is more efficiently used. The opportunity costs of final products derived from the biomass feedstock may place the price of the energy of jet biofuel above that of the fossil jet fuel. Appropriate public policies and tax treatment may be necessary to stimulate an emerging aviation biofuel industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algae can be a source of third-generation gaseous transport biofuel (either biomethane or biohydrogen). An optimal system is suggested which combines dark fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and carbon dioxide biofixation. Biogas upgrading through removal of carbon dioxide is required prior to utilization as a transport biofuel. Traditional upgrading systems are energy intensive and expensive. Carbon dioxide biofixation by microalgae, with a bicarbonate/carbonate cycle, offers energy and cost savings over traditional upgrading systems. The microalgae, which remove carbon dioxide, can be used as substrate for biogas, forming an energy efficient closed loop system. The proposed system has significant advantages in reducing parasitic energy demand in upgrading biogas, enhancing the energy yield three-fold, and minimizing carbon dioxide emission. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Policymakers in the USA have provided various mechanisms to grow the domestic biofuel industry. One of the most significant policies in the USA is the volume mandate specified within the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). There are a number of other overlapping factors that impact the use of biofuels, namely the so-called blend wall, or the 10% blend limit of ethanol in gasoline, along with a complex system of tax credits. All of these policies directly affect the value of a Renewable Identification Number (RIN), the tradable compliance certificate created as part of the RFS. Regulators track RIN prices carefully because they are a measure of the cost of compliance. In this work a mixed complementarity problem (MCP) is presented to combine these market dynamics into one model. This tool was specifically designed for policymakers to compare scenarios and study the effects on key market variables including RIN, gasoline, and diesel prices, along with production quantities for a number of different finished blended fuels. Our results suggest that RIN prices will increase with an increase in the volume of biofuel mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); however the behavior of the different RIN prices depends on how the biofuel volumes are assigned among all the subcategories. Under scenarios investigated in this study, it is likely that a primary compliance strategy is to blend more biodiesel into diesel fuel. This behavior would increase the price of the D4 RIN but the premium could be mitigated by reinstating the biodiesel production tax credit. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Accurately characterizing the emissions implications of bioenergy is increasingly important to the design of regional and global greenhouse gas mitigation policies. Market-based policies, in particular, often use information about carbon intensity to adjust relative deployment incentives for different energy sources. However, the carbon intensity of bioenergy is difficult to quantify because carbon emissions can occur when land use changes to expand production of bioenergy crops rather than simply when the fuel is consumed as for fossil fuels. Using a long-term, integrated assessment model, this paper develops an approach for computing the carbon intensity of bioenergy production that isolates the marginal impact of increasing production of a specific bioenergy crop in a specific region, taking into account economic competition among land uses. We explore several factors that affect emissions intensity and explain these results in the context of previous studies that use different approaches. Among the factors explored, our results suggest that the carbon intensity of bioenergy production from land use change (LUC) differs by a factor of two depending on the region in which the bioenergy crop is grown in the United States. Assumptions about international land use policies (such as those related to forest protection) and crop yields also significantly impact carbon intensity. Finally, we develop and demonstrate a generalized method for considering the varying time profile of LUC emissions from bioenergy production, taking into account the time path of future carbon prices, the discount rate and the time horizon. When evaluated in the context of power sector applications, we found electricity from bioenergy crops to be less carbon-intensive than conventional coal-fired electricity generation and often less carbon-intensive than natural-gas fired generation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Little is known about the contributions of biomass feedstock storage to the net greenhouse gas emissions from cellulosic biofuels. Direct emissions of methane and nitrous oxide during decomposition in storage may contribute substantially to the global warming potential of biofuels. In this study, laboratory-scale bales of switchgrass and corn stover were stored under a range of moisture (13.0-32.9%) and temperature (5-35 °C) conditions and monitored for O2 consumption and CO2, CH4, and N2O production over 8 weeks. Gas concentrations and emissions rates were highly variable within and between experimental groups. Stover bales produced higher CO2 concentrations (P = 0.0002) and lower O2 (P &lt; 0.0001) during storage than switchgrass bales. Methane concentrations (1.8-2100 ppm) were inversely correlated with bale moisture (P &lt; 0.05), with emissions rates ranging from 4.4-914.9 μg kg-1 DM day-1. Nitrous oxide concentrations ranged from 0 to 31 ppm, and emissions from switchgrass bales inversely correlated with temperature and moisture (P &lt; 0.0001). Net global warming potential from each treatment (0-2.4 gCO2e kg-1 DM) suggests that direct emission of methane and nitrous oxide from aerobically stored feedstocks have a small effect on net global warming potential of cellulosic biofuels. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The European Union in general and Germany in particular want to lead the way to substantially expand renewable energies for power production. Considering the extremely ambitious objectives of the German Federal Government, a strong, nationwide increase in cultivating energy crops can be anticipated. However, the expansion of biomass production, which is already in progress, has led to several environmental and ecological objections. Aside from competing for land, for food and feed production, the expansion of monocultures for biomass and biofuel production with a concentration on maize (Zea mays) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) can be problematic for biodiversity conservation. To face these challenges, the provision and cultivation of additional crop species and cultivars for biomass production would help to avoid these problems. The designated energy crop Miscanthus × giganteus represents an alternative species for extended biomass production. This giant grass is characterized by a broad range of possible applications and a high potential in producing and providing biomass in a sustainable way. In our study, we conducted a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analysis of the cultivation potential of M. giganteus in Germany. As a result, we generated digital maps that display preferential regions for the cultivation of M. giganteus where a high productivity and quality of biomass is expected. Combining different climate- and soil-dependent scenarios, a total acreage potential of 4 million ha is predicted for Germany. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Excess nutrients from agriculture in the Mississippi River drainage, USA have degraded water quality in freshwaters and contributed to anoxic conditions in downstream estuaries. Consequently, water quality is a significant concern associated with conversion of lands to bioenergy production. This study focused on the Arkansas-White-Red river basin (AWR), one of five major river basins draining to the Mississippi River. The AWR has a strong precipitation gradient from east to west, and advanced cellulosic feedstocks are projected to become economically feasible within normal-to-wet areas of the region. In this study, we used large-scale watershed modeling to identify areas along this precipitation gradient with potential for improving water quality. We compared simulated water quality in rivers draining projected future landscapes with and without cellulosic bioenergy for two future years, 2022 and 2030 with an assumed farmgate price of $50 per dry ton. Changes in simulated water quantity and quality under future bioenergy scenarios varied among subbasins and years. Median water yield, nutrient loadings, and sediment yield decreased by 2030. Median concentrations of nutrients also decreased, but suspended sediment, which is influenced by decreased flow and in-stream processes, increased. Spatially, decreased loadings prevailed in the transitional ecotone between 97° and 100° longitude, where switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., is projected to compete against alternative crops and land uses at $50 per dry ton. We conclude that this region contains areas that hold promise for sustainable bioenergy production in terms of both economic feasibility and water quality protection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Conversion of native prairie to agriculture has increased food and bioenergy production but decreased wildlife habitat. However, enrollment of highly erodible cropland in conservation programs has compensated for some grassland loss. In the future, climate change and production of second-generation perennial biofuel crops could further transform agricultural landscapes and increase or decrease grassland area. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is an alternative biofuel feedstock that may be economically and environmentally superior to maize (Zea mays) grain for ethanol production on marginally productive lands. Switchgrass could benefit farmers economically and increase grassland area, but there is uncertainty as to how conversions between rowcrops, switchgrass monocultures and conservation grasslands might occur and affect wildlife. To explore potential impacts on grassland birds, we developed four agricultural land-use change scenarios for an intensively cultivated landscape, each driven by potential future climatic changes and ensuing irrigation limitations, ethanol demand, commodity prices, and continuation of a conservation program. For each scenario, we calculated changes in area for landcover classes and predicted changes in grassland bird abundances. Overall, birds responded positively to the replacement of rowcrops with switchgrass and negatively to the conversion of conservation grasslands to switchgrass or rowcrops. Landscape context and interactions between climate, crop water use, and irrigation availability could influence future land-use, and subsequently, avian habitat quality and quantity. Switchgrass is likely to provide higher quality avian habitat than rowcrops but lower quality habitat than conservation grasslands, and therefore, may most benefit birds in heavily cultivated, irrigation dependent landscapes under warmer and drier conditions, where economic profitability may also encourage conversions to drought tolerant bioenergy feedstocks. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The biomass production and biochemical properties of marine and freshwater species of green macroalgae (multicellular algae), cultivated in outdoor conditions, were evaluated to assess the potential conversion into high-energy liquid biofuels, specifically biocrude and biodiesel and the value of these products. Biomass productivities were typically two times higher for marine macroalgae (8.5-11.9 g m-2 d-1, dry weight) than for freshwater macroalgae (3.4-5.1 g m-2 d-1, dry weight). The biochemical compositions of the species were also distinct, with higher ash content (25.5-36.6%) in marine macroalgae and higher calorific value (15.8-16.4 MJ kg-1) in freshwater macroalgae. Lipid content was highest for freshwater Oedogonium and marine Derbesia. Lipids are a critical organic component for biocrude production by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and the theoretical biocrude yield was therefore highest for Oedogonium (17.7%, dry weight) and Derbesia (16.2%, dry weight). Theoretical biocrude yields were also higher than biodiesel yields for all species due to the conversion of the whole organic component of biomass, including the predominant carbohydrate fraction. However, all marine species had higher biomass productivities and therefore had higher projected biocrude productivities than freshwater species, up to 7.1 t of biocrude ha-1 yr-1 for Derbesia. The projected value of the six macroalgae was increased by 45-77% (up to US$7700 ha-1 yr-1) through the extraction of protein prior to the conversion of the residual biomass to biocrude. This study highlights the importance of optimizing biomass productivities for high-energy fuels and targeting additional coproducts to increase value. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In light of rising energy costs, lignocellulosic ethanol has been identified as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels. In an attempt to reach government mandated ethanol production levels, potential plant biofeedstock candidates have been investigated, and cold-tolerant, perennial accessions within the C4 grass genus Miscanthus have been identified as leading contenders in the Midwestern US. To facilitate the development of improved cultivars through marker-assisted breeding, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) study was conducted on a full-sib, F1 mapping population segregating for flowering time, height, leaf width, and yield using a genetic map consisting of 846 segregating SNP and SSR markers. This was a 3 year study investigating the genetic architecture underlying traits important to biomass production in a population of 221 progeny from a cross between M. sinensis 'Grosse Fountaine' and M. sinensis 'Undine' established in the spring of 2010; 72 QTLs with LOD scores above the genome-wide, permuted threshold equivalent to a P-value of 0.05 were identified across 13 traits. Of the 36 QTLs identified in 2011, 22 were detected again the following year. Both the use of spring emergence and vigor rating as a covariate to account for variation related to differences in establishment increased the power to detect QTLs in the 2 year establishment period. Finally, a dry period in the middle of the 2012 growing season suggested that yield declines were due to a decrease in tiller diameter. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are a potentially important source of energy for our society. Common practice in life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioenergy has been to assume that any carbon dioxide (CO2) emission related to biomass combustion equals the amount absorbed in biomass, thus assuming no climate change impacts. Recent developments show the significance of contributions of biogenic CO2 emissions during the time they stay in the atmosphere. The goal of this article is to develop a global, spatially explicit method to quantify the potential impact on human health and terrestrial ecosystems of biogenic carbon emissions coming from forest wood extraction for biofuel production. For this purpose, changes in aboveground carbon stock (ΔCforest) due to an increase in wood extraction via changes in rotation time are simulated worldwide with a 0.5° × 0.5° grid resolution. Our results show that both impacts and benefits can be obtained. When the extraction increase is reached by creating a longer rotation time, new growth is allowed resulting in carbon benefits. In a case study, we assessed the life cycle impacts of heat production via wood to determine the significance of including biogenic CO2 emissions due to changes in forest management. Impacts of biogenic CO2 dominate the total climate change impacts from a wood stove. Depending on the wood source country, climate change impacts due to heat production from wood either have an important share in the overall impacts on human health and terrestrial ecosystems, or allow for a large additional CO2 sink. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Increasing bioenergy production from forest harvest residues decreases litter input to the soil and can thus reduce the carbon stock and sink of forests. This effect may negate greenhouse gas savings obtained by using bioenergy. We used a spatially explicit modelling framework to assess the reduction in the forest litter and soil carbon stocks across Europe, assuming that a sustainable potential of bioenergy from forest harvest residues is taken into use. The forest harvest residue removal reduced the carbon stocks of litter and soil on average by 3% over the period from 2016 to 2100. The reduction was small compared to the size of the carbon stocks but significant in comparison to the amount of energy produced from the residues. As a result of these land-use-related emissions, bioenergy production from forest harvest residues would need to be continued for 60-80 years to achieve a 60% carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in heat and power generation compared to the fossil fuels it replaces in most European countries. The emission reductions achieved and their timings varied among countries because of differences in the litter and soil carbon loss. Our results show that extending the current sustainability requirements for bioliquids and biofuels to solid bioenergy does not guarantee efficient reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term. In the longer-term, bioenergy from forest harvest residues may pave the way to low-emission energy systems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Arundo donax L., commonly known as giant reed, is promising biomass feedstock that is also a notorious invasive plant in freshwater ecosystems around the world. Heretofore, the salt tolerance of A. donax had not been quantified even though anecdotal evidence suggests halophytic qualities. To test whole-plant and leaf level responses, we established a pot experiment on 80 scions propagated from an A. donax population that has naturalized on the shore of the San Francisco Bay Estuary. To quantify growth and physiological responses to salinity (NaCl), A. donax scions were divided into eight treatments and grown for 60 days across a range of salinities (0-42 dS m-1). Classic growth analysis showed &gt;80% reduction in overall growth at the highest salinities. Yet, there was zero mortality indicating that A. donax is able to tolerate high levels of salt. Declining photosynthesis rates were strongly correlated (R2 &gt; 0.97) with decreasing stomatal conductance, which was in turn closely related to increasing salinity. Leaf gas exchange revealed that stomata and leaf limitations of carbon dioxide were three times greater at high salinities. Nonetheless, even when salinities were 38-42 dS m-1 A. donax was able to maintain assimilation rates 7-12 μmol m-2 s-1. Further, by maintaining 50% relative growth at salinities ~12 dS m-1 A. donax can now be classified as 'moderately salt tolerant'. A. donax leaf gas exchange and whole-plant salt tolerance are greater than many important food crops (i.e. maize, rice), the bioenergy feedstock Miscanthus × giganteus, as well as some uncultivated plant species (i.e. Populus and Salix) that are indigenous in regions A. donax currently invades. The results of this study have implications for both agronomists wishing to expand A. donax to fields dominated by saline soils, and for others who are concerned about the spread of A. donax with altered stream hydrology or sea-level rise. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A full accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was examined in an annual coastal reclaimed saline Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system under various soil practices including soil tillage, soil ameliorant, and crop residue amendments. Seasonal fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using static chamber method, and the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was determined by the difference between soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and net primary production (NPP). Relative to no-tillage, rotary tillage significantly decreased the NPP of Jerusalem artichoke while it had no significant effects on the annual RH. Rotary tillage increased CH4 emissions, while seasonal or annual soil N2O emissions did not statistically differ between the two tillage treatments. Compared with the control plots, soil ameliorant or straw amendment enhanced RH, soil CH4, and N2O emissions under the both tillage regimes. Annual NGHGB was negative for all the field treatments, as a consequence of net ecosystem CO2 sequestration exceeding the CO2-equivalents released as CH4 and N2O emissions, which indicates that Jerusalem artichoke-fallow cropping system served as a net sink of GHGs. The annual net NGHGB and GHGI were estimated to be 11-21% and 4-8% lower in the NT than in RT cropping systems, respectively. Soil ameliorant and straw amendments greatly increased NPP and thus significantly decreased the negative annual net NGHGB. Overall, higher NPP but lower climatic impacts of coastal saline bioenergy production would be simultaneously achieved by Jerusalem artichoke cultivation under no-tillage with improved saline soil conditions in southeast China. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The climate impacts from bioenergy involve an important time aspect. Using forest residues for energy may result in high initial emissions, but net emissions are reduced over time since, if the residues were left on the ground, they would decompose and release CO2 to the atmosphere. This article investigates the climate impacts from bioenergy with special focus on the time aspects. More specifically, we analyze the climate impacts of forest residues and stumps where combustion related emissions are compensated by avoided emissions from leaving them on the ground to decompose. These biofuels are compared with fossil gas and coal. Net emissions are defined as emissions from utilizing the fuel minus emissions from a reference case of no utilization. Climate impacts are estimated using the measures radiative forcing and global average surface temperature. We find that the climate impacts from using forest residues and stumps depend on the decomposition rates and the time perspective over which the analysis is done. Over a 100 year perspective, branches and tops have lower climate impacts than stumps which in turn have lower impacts than fossil gas and coal. Over a 20 year time perspective, branches and tops have lower climate impacts than all other fuels but the relative difference is smaller. However, stumps have slightly higher climate impacts over 20 years than fossil gas but lower impacts than coal. Regarding metrics for climate impacts, over shorter time scales, approximately 30 years or less, radiative forcing overestimates the climate impacts compared with impacts expressed by global surface temperature change, which is due to the inertia of the climate system. We also find that establishing willow on earlier crop land may reduce atmospheric CO2, provided new land is available. However, these results are inconclusive since we haven't considered the effects of producing the agricultural crops elsewhere. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The present article conceptualizes morally controversial innovations as a category of innovations that raise ethical issues due to their potentially undesirable long-term consequences on society or the natural environment. Then, it analyzes the case of biofuel crops by applying an extended version of the theory of planned behavior, which includes moral norm (i.e. the personal convictions of what is wrong or right for society) and ethical self-identity (i.e. the extent to which one perceives himself/herself as an ethical person). The obtained results show that attitude and subjective norms are positively related to farmers' intention to grow biofuel crops. Yet the intention of those farmers with a higher ethical self-identity is also influenced by perceived behavioral control and moral norm. In particular, moral norm negatively affects their intention to grow biofuel crops, thus restraining the adoption of this innovation. Implications for theory, as well as for policymakers interested in promoting the diffusion of morally controversial innovations, are discussed. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Agro-food industrial wastes represent a serious environmental problem in producing countries. In addition to the traditional irrigation with wastewaters, application of solids to the land, and the extraction of valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries, a microbiological approach is also available. In this review, the most promising microbiological processes for the valorization of wine and oil by-products are presented. Recently, there has been an upsurge in the exploitation of the waste materials generated by the wine and olive oil industries. Treatments by physical and chemical methods are generally expensive, and they do not often provide complete solutions. Microbiological processes for the treatment of olive and grape residues have seen worldwide applications, and they are considered to be environmentally friendly, reliable and, in most cases, cost effective. Production of added-value products such as edible mushrooms, biofuels, organic acids, polymers and enzymes appear to be the new frontier in by-products valorization. Our study has been focused in these two major food industries in the Mediterranean area, engaged in wine and olive oil production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a potential biofuel crop and press cake is an important co-product obtained during biodiesel production. In order to assess the long-term effects of application of Jatropha press cake on soil quality parameters and to evaluate its efficacy as an organic manure, a field trial was carried out in degraded wasteland of Gujarat, India with four treatments chosen on the basis of equivalent amounts of N supply through urea, Jatropha press cake, farmyard manure (FYM) and half dose of urea. The activities of various exocellular enzymes involved in nutrient cycling, microbial biomass carbon, respiration, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and the influence of chemical composition of the organic manures on these parameters were studied following seven continuous years of application of nutrient amendments. Degradation of the phorbols, toxins present in press cake, was also studied. Except for acid phosphomonoesterase, enzyme activities were higher in FYM compared to other treatments. Lignin content was higher in FYM while the ligno-cellulosic fraction was higher by 45% in press cake as compared to FYM. Notably, carbon accumulation in soil was higher per unit of applied carbon in press cake treated soil. Ratio of microbial biomass carbon to soil organic carbon was higher in press cake amended soil. Phorbol esters were degraded to negligible amounts. The increase in yield of Jatropha following improved enzyme activities, microbial carbon and FDA hydrolysis owing to press cake application in erstwhile poor soils unequivocally establishes the scope of Jatropha press cake in reclaiming unfertile wastelands sustainably. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Ethanol production in the United States has increased significantly due to government support, which has begun to dwindle. Ethanol now seems to compete with gasoline for vehicle fuel but because ethanol is mostly sold as a blend, gasoline and ethanol could be complementary fuel sources. The study investigates the true relationship between these fuels since it has policy implications. Results of LA/AIDS estimation show the two fuels were substitutes before the rapid expansion of ethanol production but have become complements overtime due to increasing share of ethanol in fuel consumption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Growing biomass on non-agricultural land could potentially deliver renewable energy services without displacing land from food production, avoiding the social and environmental conflicts associated with bioenergy. A variety of derelict underutilized and neglected land types are possible candidates, sharing a number of challenges for agronomy, including contaminants in soils, potential uptake and dispersion through energy use. Most previous field trials have grown woody biomass species during phytoremediation. Five one-hectare brownfield sites in NE England, were each amended with c.500tha-1 of green-waste compost, planted with short-rotation coppice willow, Miscanthus, reed canarygrass and switchgrass,1 and then harvested for 3-5 years. Critical issues for the economic and environmental viability of energy production on brownfield land were investigated: The yields achieved on non-agricultural land; the potential for fuel contamination; the suitability for use and potential markets for any biomass produced. RCG appears best suited to the challenging soil conditions found on non-agricultural land, outperforming other species in ease of establishment, cost, time to maturity, yield and contamination levels. Invasive spreading and low melting ash compositions were not observed. Annual yields of 4-7odtha-1 from the second growth season were found consistently across a range of previously-developed, capped or former landfill sites, with a gross annual energy yield of 97GJha-1 at contamination levels acceptable for domestic pellets. The analogy with marginal agricultural land suggests that this species and approach could help boost biomass production while avoiding the natural capital "nexus" related to global food-fuel-land-water limits. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - A key tool for metabolic engineering is the ability to express heterologous genes. One obstacle to gene expression in non-model organisms, and especially in relatively uncharacterized bacteria, is the lack of well-characterized promoters. Here we test 17 promoter regions for their ability to drive expression of the reporter genes β-galactosidase (lacZ) and NADPH-alcohol dehydrogenase (. adhB) in Clostridium thermocellum, an important bacterium for the production of cellulosic biofuels. Only three promoters have been commonly used for gene expression in C. thermocellum, gapDH, cbp and eno. Of the new promoters tested, 2638, 2926, 966 and 815 showed reliable expression. The 2638 promoter showed relatively higher activity when driving adhB (compared to lacZ), and the 815 promoter showed relatively higher activity when driving lacZ (compared to adhB). © 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

AB  - The decline in available fossil fuel resources coupled with an ever increasing global demand for energy, have led to substantial interest in the development of renewable biofuels. Biofuels from microalgae, especially liquid fuels produced from saline microalgae lipids (oils), are seen as an important component of the future biofuels mix. In Australia, several companies and research groups are working on developing microalgal biofuels and whilst most are still in the research and development stage, recently constructed demonstration facilities highlight the potential for large-scale cultivation. Western Australia (WA) specifically, has several key advantages for large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation including abundant sunshine, extensive land area unsuitable for agriculture, an abundant water source in the Indian Ocean, existing infrastructure in several potential locations, high local demand for fuel and stable political conditions. The purpose of this study was to identify capable geographic locations for constructing large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation facilities in WA. Through the development of the Australian Algal Cultivation-Spatial Location Model (AAC-SLM) an examination of site specific parameters such as irradiance, temperature, CO2 and nutrient availability, workability of soils, land-use and access to distribution infrastructure and a viable workforce, most capable locations for large-scale microalgae cultivation were identified in the state. Results indicate that large tracts of land along the central coast of Western Australia are ideal for cultivation development and could produce up to 11% of Australia's annual automotive diesel needs across the most suitable locations. The end result provides a robust method that can be tailored to the specific requirements and data availability of other regions within Australia and in other nations as a tool to attract future development through the identification of capable cultivation locations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phosphate rock fertilization is commonly used in peatland restoration to promote the growth of Polytrichum strictum, a nurse plant which aids the establishment of Sphagnum mosses. The present study tested whether 1) phosphorus fertilization facilitates the germination of P.strictum spores and 2) biochar derived from local pig manure can replace imported phosphate rock currently used in peatland restoration. Various doses of biochar were compared to phosphate rock to test its effect directly on P.strictum stem regeneration (in Petri dishes in a growth chamber) and in a simulation of peatland restoration with the moss layer transfer technique (in mesocoms in a greenhouse). Phosphorus fertilization promoted the germination of P.strictum spores as well as vegetative stem development. Biochar can effectively replace phosphate rock in peatland restoration giving a new waste management option for rural regions with phosphorus surpluses. As more available phosphorus was present in biochar, an addition of only 3-9gm-2 of pig manure biochar is recommended during the peatland restoration process, which is less than the standard dose of phosphate rock (15gm-2). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing cropland productivity is critical to meet future global demand of food, fibers and biofuels. Recent innovations in grain crop management are aimed at designing more ecologically complex cropping systems by growing doublecrop sequences comprising a great variety of crop species. The objectives of this study were to compare (i) the pattern of resource use and the productivity in cool-season crops and their influence on the following warm-season second crops, and (ii) the overall resource capture, resource use efficiency, and productivity of various single and double cropping systems. Hence, three field experiments under rainfed conditions and computer-simulated experiments were conducted in contrasting sites in the Rolling Pampa. Seven cropping systems were evaluated, which included five double crop sequences (rapeseed/soybean, wheat/soybean, barley/soybean, field pea/soybean, and field pea/maize) and maize and soybean as single crops. Cool-season crops differed in resource use, which therefore affected differently the following second crop. The highest and the lowest yields with double cropped soybean were produced after field pea and wheat, respectively. Soybean single crop was the least productive treatment because of low resource capture and moderate resource use efficiency. Double cropping systems including soybean as second crop outperformed soybean single crop productivity due to larger resource use. Comparatively, maize single crop used fewer resources but with higher efficiency than the cropping systems including soybean, which led to higher yields when water was not limiting. Field pea/maize double crop was the most productive system, since field pea allowed for long resource use periods, while maintaining similar resource use efficiency as maize single crops. Field experiment results were confirmed by crop yield simulations based on 39 years of environmental data from the same sites. Wheat/soybean double crops expanded and contributed to raise productivity in the Pampas with available farming technologies. However, novel crop type combinations appeared as feasible ways for improving resource use balance in the growing season among the component crops. This may raise the total annual productivity or, at least, increase the grain yield of soybean, the more profitable component at present. These findings have important implications regarding the ecological intensification of commodity grain cropping systems, which can be implemented by proactive farmers in the short-term in various regions of the world. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Life cycle assessment was conducted to evaluate the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of a bioethanol production system that uses sweet sorghum stem on saline-alkali land as feedstock. The system comprises a plant cultivation unit, a feedstock transport unit, and a bioethanol conversion unit, with 1000. L of bioethanol as a functional unit. The net energy ratio is 3.84, and the net energy gain is 17.21. MJ/L. Agrochemical production consumes 76.58% of the life cycle fossil energy. The category with the most significant impact on the environment is eutrophication, followed by acidification, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity, and global warming. Allocation method, waste recycling approach, and soil salinity significantly influence the results. Using vinasse to produce pellet fuel for steam generation significantly improves energy efficiency and decreases negative environmental impacts. Promoting reasonable management practices to alleviate saline stress and increasing agrochemical utilization efficiency can further improve environmental sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Yucca aloifolia Linn (. Y. aloifolia) is a drought-resistant arid land plant that grows in most soil types. In this work, Y. aloifolia seed oil (YAO) was evaluated for the first time as a potential biodiesel feedstock, which contains 16.23% oil (w/w) whereas the acidity of the oil was 11%. Two step processes i.e. acid-catalyzed esterification to reduce the acid value of YAO and then standard base-catalyzed transesterification procedure were used to synthesis the Y. aloifolia methyl esters (Yame) at optimization conditions. YAO has a high content of linoleic acid (70.77 %) followed by oleic acid (12%), and palmitic acid (8.59%). The fuel properties of biodiesel derived from YAO including density, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, flash point, pour point, cloud point, and gross heating value were evaluated and compared with the limits of ASTM D6751 standards. The comparison showed that the biodiesel obtained from Y. aloifolia oil could be used as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) as a bioenergy crop has attracted many interests because of high oil content for biodiesel production, perennial drought tolerant, soil reclamation, desert reduction, rural development and environmental benefits. This study aims at investigating the areas for cultivation of JCL by a non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. In this regard, two categories of criteria including (1) critical and (2) non-critical economic, climatic, and social criteria are defined to evaluate the suitability of different locations for JCL cultivation in Iran. Critical criteria include long frost period, water logging condition, and low soil pH. The JCL cannot tolerate critical criteria. Locations that satisfy critical criteria are then assessed under second group criteria by the non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The acquired results show that the proposed approach can be used as powerful tool for location optimization of energy crops. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biomass supply chain is one of the most critical elements of large-scale bioenergy production and in many cases a key barrier for procuring initial funding for new developments on specific energy crops. Most productions rely on complex transforming chains linked to feed and food markets. The term ‘supply chain’ covers various aspects from cultivation and harvesting of the biomass, to treatment, transportation, and storage. After energy conversion, the product must be delivered to final consumption, whether it is in the form of electricity, heat, or more tangible products, such as pellets and biofuels. Effective supply chains are of utmost importance for bioenergy production, as biomass tends to possess challenging seasonal production cycles and low mass, energy and bulk densities. Additionally, the demand for final products is often also dispersed, further complicating the supply chain. The goal of this paper is to introduce key components of biomass supply chains, examples of related modeling applications, and if/how they address aspects related to environmental metrics and management. The paper will introduce a concept of integrated supply systems for sustainable biomass trade and the factors influencing the bioenergy supply chain landscape, including models that can be used to investigate the factors. The paper will also cover various aspects of transportation logistics, ranging from alternative modal and multi-modal alternatives to introduction of support tools for transportation analysis. Finally gaps and challenges in supply chain research are identified and used to outline research recommendations for the future direction in this area of study. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Photosynthesis for the generation of isoprene in cyanobacteria was demonstrated with Synechocystis, entailing a process where a single host microorganism acts as both photocatalyst and processor, photosynthesizing and emitting isoprene hydrocarbons. A practical aspect of the commercial exploitation of this process in mass culture is the need to prevent invading microorganisms that might cause a culture to crash, and to provide an alternative to freshwater in scale-up applications. Growth media poised at alkaline pH are desirable in this respect, as high pH might favor the growth of the cyanobacteria, while at the same time discouraging the growth of invading predatory microbes and grazers. In addition, demonstration of salinity tolerance would enable the use of seawater for cyanobacteria cultivations. However, it is not known if Synechocystis growth and the isoprene-producing metabolism can be retained under such theoretically non-physiological conditions. We applied the gaseous/aqueous two-phase photobioreactor system with Synechocystis transformed with the isoprene synthase gene (SkIspS) of Pueraria montana (kudzu). Rates of growth and isoprene production are reported under control, and a combination of alkalinity and salinity conditions. The results showed that alkalinity and salinity do not exert a negative effect on either cell growth or isoprene production rate and yield in Synechocystis. The work points to a practical approach in the design of cyanobacterial growth media for applications in commercial scale-up and isoprene production. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Switchgrass has favorable characteristics as a biofuel feedstock, and it may be feasiblygrown on sites currently forested or retired from agricultural production. It is ecologically important to understand the impacts of establishing and managing switchgrass on site nutrient cycling. Four studies conducted in the southeast United States tested switchgrass as a bioenergy cropgrown in monoculture, in alley cropping systems, and as an alternative to conventional agricultural rotations. Each trial included comparisons of switchgrass with the prevailing land uses. In each trial, nitrogen mineralization (Nmin), nitrification (Nnit), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), microbial activity, and labile carbon were measured because of their sensitivity to management practices that alter soil nutrient cycling. In all studies of loblolly pine and switchgrass, switchgrass was apparently the dominant substrate source for Cmic, and Nmin increased when juvenile loblolly pine was isolated with herbicide as the sole vegetation. However, Cmic and Nmin of loblolly pine-switchgrass alley cropping systems were similar to those observed in conventional juvenile loblolly pine plantation conditions. In a trial of converting former agricultural fields into switchgrass or cottonwood biofuel plantations, this conversion reduced Nnit, and therefore the potential for nitrogen losses compared with those for a soybean-sorghum rotation typical for such sites. © 2015 Society of American Foresters.

AB  - A global increase in the demand for crop-based biofuels may be met by cropland expansion, and could require the sacrifice of natural vegetation. Such land transformation alters the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the original system, and causes significant greenhouse-gas emissions, which should be considered when assessing the global warming performance of crop-based biofuels. As an indicator of this performance we propose the use of greenhouse-gas payback time (GPBT), that is, the number of years it takes before the greenhouse-gas savings due to displacing fossil fuels with biofuels equal the initial losses of carbon and nitrogen stocks from the original ecosystem. Spatially explicit global GPBTs were derived for biofuel production systems using five different feedstocks (corn, rapeseed, soybean, sugarcane and winter wheat), cultivated under no-input and high-input farm management. Overall, GPBTs were found to range between 1 and 162 years (95% range, median: 19 years) with the longest GPBTs occurring in the tropics. Replacing no-input with high-input farming typically shortened the GPBTs by 45 to 79%. Location of crop cultivation was identified as the primary factor driving variation in GPBTs. This study underscores the importance of using spatially explicit impact assessments to guide biofuel policy. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Understanding how large-scale bioenergy production can affect biodiversity and ecosystems is important if society is to meet current and future sustainable development goals. A variety of bioenergy production systems have been established within different contexts throughout the Pan American region, with wide-ranging results in terms of documented and projected effects on biodiversity and ecosystems. The Pan American region is home to the majority of commercial bioenergy production and therefore the region offers a broad set of experiences and insights on both conflicts and opportunities for biodiversity and bioenergy. This paper synthesizes lessons learned focusing on experiences in Canada, the United States, and Brazil regarding the conflicts that can arise between bioenergy production and ecological conservation, and benefits that can be derived when bioenergy policies promote planning and more sustainable land-management systems. We propose a research agenda to address priority information gaps that are relevant to biodiversity concerns and related policy challenges in the Pan American region. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Passive sampling technology has been extensively used for long-term VOC atmospheric concentrations' monitoring. Its performances regarding the short-term measurements and related to VOC from biogas were evaluated in this work: laboratory scale experiments have been conducted in order to check the suitability of Radiello® diffusive samplers for the assessment of 8 h-VOC levels in highly changeable meteorological conditions; in a second step a short pilot field campaign was implemented in the vicinity of a West-French landfill. First of all, it was assessed that amongst a diversified list of 16 characteristic compounds from biogas, mercaptans, some halogenated, oxygenated compounds and terpenes could not be measured accurately by this passive technique either because they are not captured by the sorbent or they are not quantitatively desorbed in the chosen mediated analytical conditions. Moreover, it has been confirmed that sampling rates (SR) related to isopentane, THF, cyclohexane, toluene, p-xylene and n-decane are influenced by environmental factors: the main influence concerns the wind speed. From 2 m s-1, when the velocity increases by 1 m s-1, the SR increases from 12 to 32% depending on the COV (considering a linear dependence between 2 and 7 m s-1). Humidity has no effect on SR, and temperature influence is rather limited to less than 3% per degree. A comprehensive uncertainty estimation, including uncertainties linked to meteorological changes, has led to global relative uncertainties comprising between 18% and 54% from one VOC to another: a quite high value comparatively to those obtained without considering meteorological condition influences. To illustrate our results, targeted VOC were quantified in the field, on a single day: concentrations range between LD to 3 μg m-3: relatively very low concentrations compared to those usually reported by literature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing requirement of food neutral biofuels demands the detection of alternative sources. The use of non-arable land and waste water streams is widely discussed in this regard. A Cyanobacterium was isolated on the area of a possible algae production side near a water treatment plant in the arid desert region al-Wusta. It was identified as Cyanobacterium aponinum PB1 and is a possible lipid source. To determine its suitability of a production process using this organism, a set of laboratory experiments were performed. Its growth behavior was examined in regard to high temperatures and increasing NaCl concentrations. A productivity of 0.1 g L−1 per day was measured at an alga density below 0.75 g L−1. C. aponinum PB1 showed no sign of altered growth behavior in media containing 70 g L−1 NaCl or less. Detection of a negative effect of NaCl on the growth using Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was not more sensitive than optical density measurement. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Transcription factors are a family of proteins that control the physiological and biochemical process of a plant. The MYB family of proteins is the largest family of transcription factors (TF) that plays an important role in controlling growth and development and stress responses. These genes have been extensively studied in many dicot and monocot plants. Among the grasses, sugarcane has a complex polyploidy genome, and only little information is available about the MYB TF family. With increasing importance of this biofuel crop, 57 R2R3-MYB, 20 MYB-like, and 1 3R1-MYB genes were computationally predicted and 51 ScMYBs were isolated by RT-PCR. Subgroup-specific conserved motifs outside the MYB domain demonstrated their phylogeny and functional conservation in sugarcane. Based on their biological process, the isolated ScMYB genes were functionally categorized into cell growth and maintenance (39.74 %), stress response (33.33 %), metabolism (14.10 %), and developmental regulation (12.82 %). Expression analysis by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed a significantly higher expression trend of ScMYB26/AS1 > ScMYB54 > ScMYB66 > ScMYB75 transcripts in response to water deficit, whereas in salt stress, ScMYB1 and ScMYB58 showed higher expression during 12 days of stress (DOS) in sugarcane leaves. Further, the stress-responsive ScMYB26/AS1 was functionally characterized by agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression in tobacco. Semi-qRT-PCR demonstrated the increased expression of introduced ScMYB26/AS1 transcript in transformed tobacco explants during stress induction. Taken together, our comparative genomics analysis and isolation of ScMYB genes from sugarcane illustrated the viable, future solid foundation for improvement of agricultural crops to stress tolerance by a transgenic approach. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Rice straw is one of the most abundant renewable energy sources available. Through anaerobic acidogenesis, the substance of rice straw can be converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs). VFAs itself is of value and is a precursor to biofuels. Hence, it can be converted to mixed alcohols by addition of hydrogen, and biodiesel can be produced as a carbon source for oleaginous microorganism. To maximize VFAs production during anaerobic digestion (AD), response surface analysis (RSM) was carried out with respect to temperature, substrate concentration, and pH variables. Optimization results showed maximal VFAs concentration of 12.37 g/L at 39.23 °C, 52.85 g/L of rice straw, and pH 10. In quantification of microbial community by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the bacterial profile showed that the growth of methanogens was effectively inhibited by methanogenic inhibitors. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing showed that members of the Ruminococcaceae family, capable of hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass, were the most dominant species in many RSM trials. This study provided a useful insight on the biological improvement of AD performance through the combinational linkage between process parameters and microbial information. © 2015 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich product obtained when plant-based biomass is heated in a closed container with little or no available oxygen. Biochar-amended soil has the potential to serve as a landfill cover material that can oxidise methane emissions for two reasons: biochar amendment can increase the methane retention time and also enhance the biological activity that can promote the methanotrophic oxidation of methane. Hydraulic conductivity, compressibility and shear strength are the most important geotechnical properties that are required for the design of effective and stable landfill cover systems, but no studies have been reported on these properties for biochar-amended landfill cover soils. This article presents physicochemical and geotechnical properties of a biochar, a landfill cover soil and biochar-amended soils. Specifically, the effects of amending 5%, 10% and 20% biochar (of different particle sizes as produced, size-20 and size-40) to soil on its physicochemical properties, such as moisture content, organic content, specific gravity and pH, as well as geotechnical properties, such as hydraulic conductivity, compressibility and shear strength, were determined from laboratory testing. Soil or biochar samples were prepared by mixing them with 20% deionised water based on dry weight. Samples of soil amended with 5%, 10% and 20% biochar (w/w) as-is or of different select sizes, were also prepared at 20% initial moisture content. The results show that the hydraulic conductivity of the soil increases, compressibility of the soil decreases and shear strength of the soil increases with an increase in the biochar amendment, and with a decrease in biochar particle size. Overall, the study revealed that biochar-amended soils can possess excellent geotechnical properties to serve as stable landfill cover materials. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Background: Large-scale algal biofuel production has been limited, among other factors, by the availability of inorganic carbon in the culture medium at concentrations higher than achievable with atmospheric CO2. Life cycle analyses have concluded that costs associated with supplying CO2 to algal cultures are significant contributors to the overall energy consumption. Results: A two-phase optimal growth and lipid accumulation scenario is presented, which (1) enhances the growth rate and (2) the triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation rate in the oleaginous Chlorophyte Chlorella vulgaris strain UTEX 395, by growing the organism in the presence of low concentrations of NaHCO3 (5 mM) and controlling the pH of the system with a periodic gas sparge of 5 % CO2 (v/v). Once cultures reached the desired cell densities, which can be "fine-tuned" based on initial nutrient concentrations, cultures were switched to a lipid accumulation metabolism through the addition of 50 mM NaHCO3. This two-phase approach increased the specific growth rate of C. vulgaris by 69 % compared to cultures sparged continuously with 5 % CO2 (v/v); further, biomass productivity (g L-1 day-1) was increased by 27 %. Total biodiesel potential [assessed as total fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced] was increased from 53.3 to 61 % (FAME biomass-1) under the optimized conditions; biodiesel productivity (g FAME L-1 day-1) was increased by 7.7 %. A bicarbonate salt screen revealed that American Chemical Society (ACS) and industrial grade NaHCO3 induced the highest TAG accumulation (% w/w), whereas Na2CO3 did not induce significant TAG accumulation. NH4HCO3 had a negative effect on cell health presumably due to ammonia toxicity. The raw, unrefined form of trona, NaHCO3Na2CO3 (sodium sesquicarbonate) induced TAG accumulation, albeit to a slightly lower extent than the more refined forms of sodium bicarbonate. Conclusions: The strategic addition of sodium bicarbonate was found to enhance growth and lipid accumulation rates in cultures of C. vulgaris, when compared to traditional culturing strategies, which rely on continuously sparging algal cultures with elevated concentrations of CO2(g). This work presents a two-phased, improved photoautotrophic growth and lipid accumulation approach, which may result in an overall increase in algal biofuel productivity. © 2015 Lohman et al.

AB  - Life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to many biofuel and bioenergy systems to determine potential environmental impacts, but the conclusions have varied. Different methodologies and processes for conducting LCA of biofuels make the results difficult to compare, in-turn making it difficult to make the best possible and informed decision. Of particular importance are the wide variability in country-specific conditions, modeling assumptions, data quality, chosen impact categories and indicators, scale of production, system boundaries, and co-product allocation. This study has a double purpose: conducting a critical evaluation comparing environmental LCA of biofuels from several conversion pathways and in several countries in the Pan American region using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and making recommendations for harmonization with respect to biofuel LCA study features, such as study assumptions, inventory data, impact indicators, and reporting practices. The environmental management implications are discussed within the context of different national and international regulatory environments using a case study. The results from this study highlight LCA methodology choices that cause high variability in results and limit comparability among different studies, even among the same biofuel pathway, and recommendations are provided for improvement. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article identifies equity outcomes associated with three biofuel systems in Brazil, Ethiopia, and Guatemala. Acknowledging that winners and losers are socially and politically generated, the article identifies some of the factors behind the distribution of winners and losers along different stages of three sugarcane–ethanol supply chains. Analyzing the outcomes for equity within each case study reveals an uneven distribution that, we argue, is related to the procedure and structure of the given sugarcane–ethanol system, and the recognition of the impacts on different actors within those structures. Increasing equity in sugarcane–ethanol systems will require greater openness in decision-making processes, in order that multiple voices are taken into account in the promotion, production, and consumption of biofuels—particularly those of smaller and less powerful actors. © The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav

AB  - This study was performed to assess morphological responses, biomass yield and bioenergy potential during the entire growth period (167 days) of sweet sorghum with different Cd stress, i.e. 0, 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, and 100 mg/kg in pot experiments. The results showed that the morphological characteristics of sweet sorghum, i.e. shoot length, leaf length and leaf numbers were not significantly changed with the Cd concentration ≤ 5 mg/kg in the soil. The aerial biomass of sweet sorghum treated by 10 mg/kg Cd was 82.71% of the control test, and was reduced to 70.67% when the Cd concentration in the soil was increased to 30 mg/kg. The root was the main location site of Cd in the sweet sorghum, thus the reutilization of the aerial biomass would not be seriously influenced. The predicted ethanol yields was 3.65, 3.05, 3.14, 2.69, 1.15, and 0.41 t/y/hm2 for 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, and 100 mg/kg Cd concentration, respectively. Due to its high biomass production and Cd accumulation capacity, sweet sorghum is a good candidate for bio-energy production in Cd-contaminated (&lt;30 mg/kg) soil.

AB  - Clostridium phytofermentans was isolated from forest soil and is distinguished by its capacity to directly ferment plant cell wall polysaccharides into ethanol as the primary product, suggesting that it possesses unusual catabolic pathways. The objective of the present study was to understand the molecular mechanisms of biomass conversion to ethanol in a single organism, Clostridium phytofermentans, by analyzing its complete genome and transcriptome during growth on plant carbohydrates. The saccharolytic versatility of C. phytofermentans is reflected in a diversity of genes encoding ATP-binding cassette sugar transporters and glycoside hydrolases, many of which may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes are frequently organized as operons that may be controlled individually by the many transcriptional regulators identified in the genome. Preferential ethanol production may be due to high levels of expression of multiple ethanol dehydrogenases and additional pathways maximizing ethanol yield. The genome also encodes three different proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments with the capacity to compartmentalize pathways that divert fermentation intermediates to various products. These characteristics make C. phytofermentans an attractive resource for improving the efficiency and speed of biomass conversion to biofuels. © 2015 Petit et al.

AB  - The two main paths to power vehicles with sunlight are to use photosynthesis to grow biomass, converting to a liquid fuel for an internal combustion engine or to generate photovoltaic electricity that powers the battery of an electric vehicle. While the environmental attributes of these two paths have been much analyzed, prior studies consider the current state of technology. Technologies for biofuel and photovoltaic paths are evolving; it is critical to consider how progress might improve environmental performance. We address this challenge by assessing the current and maximum theoretical exergy efficiencies of bioethanol and photovoltaic sun-to-wheels process chains. The maximum theoretical efficiency is an upper bound stipulated by physical laws. The current net efficiency to produce motive power from silicon photovoltaic modules is estimated at 5.4%, much higher than 0.03% efficiency for corn-based ethanol. Flat-plate photovoltaic panels also have a much higher theoretical maximum efficiency than a C4 crop plant, 48% versus 0.19%. Photovoltaic-based power will always be vastly more efficient than a terrestrial crop biofuel. Providing all mobility in the U.S. via crop biofuels would require 130% of arable land with current technology and 20% in the thermodynamic limit. Comparable values for photovoltaic-based power are 0.7% and 0.081%, respectively. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) quantifies alteration of the biosphere caused by land use change and biomass harvest. In global and regional scale assessments, the majority of HANPP is associated with agricultural biomass harvest. We adapted these methods to the watershed scale and calculated land cover change and HANPP in an agricultural watershed in 1968 and 2011. Between 1968 and 2011, forest cover remained near 50% of the watershed, but row crop decreased from 26% to 0.4%, pasture increased from 19% to 32%, and residential area increased from 2% to 10%. Total HANPP decreased from 35% of potential Net Primary Productivity (NPP) in 1968 to 28% in 2011. Aboveground HANPP remained constant at 42%. Land use change accounted for 86%–89% of HANPP. Aboveground HANPP did not change despite the major shift in agricultural land use from row crop and pasture. The HANPP and land use change in Doddies Creek watershed reflects changing land use patterns in the southeastern US, driven by a complex interaction of local to global scale processes including change in farm viability, industrialization of agriculture, and demographic shifts. In the future, urbanization and biofuel production are likely to become important drivers of HANPP in the region. At the watershed scale, HANPP can be useful for improving land use decisions and landscape management to decrease human impact on the ecosystem and ensure the flow of ecosystem services. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The importance of wood and wood byproducts as biomass feedstocks is of increasing interest as a source of ethanol and electricity. Second generation woody feedstock sources in Michigan, e.g., hybrid poplar and hybrid willow (Populus spp.), and native forests, particularly aspen and northern hardwoods, are a potential source of woody biomass for these uses. This study provides a geographic information system (GIS) framework for assessing the current spatial extent of aspen and northern hardwoods) and their proximity to roads. Additionally, the potential for expanding the area of these feedstock sources based on pre-European settlement vegetation cover is assessed. Utilizing GIS technology to compile, edit and analyze available geospatial data (e.g., present day and pre-European settlement land use/cover, soils, road infrastructure, and land ownership) for counties located in the eastern half of the Upper Peninsula and northern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan provides a robust framework for various management scenarios to be evaluated in a cost effective manner and foster better decision making. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced through steam reforming of natural gas. However, this conventional process involves environmental and energy security concerns. This has led to the development of alternative technologies for (potentially) green hydrogen production. In this work, the environmental and energy performance of biohydrogen produced in Europe via steam reforming of glycerol and bio-oil is evaluated from a life-cycle perspective, and contrasted with that of conventional hydrogen from steam methane reforming. Glycerol as a by-product from the production of rapeseed biodiesel and bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of poplar biomass are considered. The processing plants are simulated in Aspen Plus® to provide inventory data for the life cycle assessment. The environmental impact potentials evaluated include abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. Furthermore, the cumulative (total and non-renewable) energy demand is calculated, as well as the corresponding renewability scores and life-cycle energy balances and efficiencies of the biohydrogen products. In addition to quantitative evidence of the (expected) relevance of the feedstock and impact categories considered, results show that poplar-derived bio-oil could be a suitable feedstock for steam reforming, in contrast to first-generation bioglycerol. © 2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Data in the literature suggest that biochar products could be applied on a wide scale to influence soil-plant-microbe interactions. Biochar may improve physical and chemi-cal soil properties, soil water retention, clay and organic matter contents, pH levels, N and P availability, quantities of other meso-and micro-nutrients and, due to its high porosity, soil aeration and the content and ratio of oxygen. The positive effect on plant nutrition may be manifested both directly and indirectly. The more efficient growth of microorganisms in biochar-treated soils is well docu-mented. Biochar protects the soil surface from drying out, provides a more oxygen-rich environment and supplies the micro-organisms with adsorbed organic materials, im-proving the growth of both bacteria and fungi. In addition to soil properties, a higher microbial population is also promoted by higher temperature and optimal pH levels. Publications on the integration of biochar into crop production technologies report yield increases, at least in the short term. However, the quantities and activity of the micro-symbiont bacteria and P-mobilizing mycorrhizal fungi that are beneficial for crop pro-duction exhibit strong dose-and product-dependence. The efficiency of symbiosis may deteriorate in the case of environmental stress. The application of unnecessarily high rates is a cause for concern due to their nutritional and/or water-binding properties, particularly as this may lead to the multiplication of soil-borne pathogenic microorgan-isms. Biochar could therefore be a valuable soil amendment, but it can only be exploited safely if applied with caution after the detailed physical, chemical and biological analy-sis of the soil. Table 1.

AB  - Sugarcane has been widely used as a biofuel crop due to its high biological productivity, ease of conversion to ethanol, and its relatively high potential for greenhouse gas reduction and lower environmental impacts relative to other derived biofuels from traditional agronomic crops. In this investigation, we studied four sugarcane cultivars (H-65-7052, H-78-3567, H-86-3792 and H-87-4319) grown on a Hawaiian commercial sugarcane plantation to determine their ability to store and accumulate soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) across a 24-month growth cycle on contrasting soil types. The main study objective establish baseline parameters for biofuel production life cycle analyses; sub-objectives included (1) determining which of four main sugarcane cultivars sequestered the most soil C and (2) assessing how soil C sequestration varies among two common Hawaiian soil series (Pulehu-sandy clay loam and Molokai-clay). Soil samples were collected at 20 cm increments to depths of up to 120 cm using hand augers at the three main growth stages (tillering, grand growth, and maturity) from two experimental plots at to observe total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrates (NO-3) using laboratory flash combustion for TC and TN and solution filtering and analysis for DOC and NO-3. Aboveground plant biomass was collected and subsampled to determine lignin and C and N content. This study determined that there was an increase of TC with the advancement of growing stages in the studied four sugarcane cultivars at both soil types (increase in TC of 15-35 kg·m2). Nitrogen accumulation was more variable, and NO-3 (&lt;5 ppm) were insignificant. The C and N accumulation varies in the whole profile based on the ability of the sugarcane cultivar's roots to explore and grow in the different soil types. For the purpose of storing C in the soil, cultivar H-65-7052 (TC accumulation of ∼30 kg·m-2) and H-86-3792 (25 kg·m-2) rather H-78-3567 (15 kg·m-2) and H-87-4319 (20 kg·m-2) appeared to produce more accumulated carbon in both soil types. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a useful root crop for food, animal feed and various industrial materials including biofuel. Despite of its importance as an industrial crop, the genetic engineering approaches to manipulate transgenic plant development in cassava are limited. In this study, to develop new cultivar with high level of carotenoids and enhanced tolerance to environmental stresses, sweetpotato IbOr gene involved in accumulation of carotenoids was introduced into an Indonesian IDB high-yielding cassava cultivar under the control of oxidative stress-inducible SWPA2 promoter through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of friable embryogenic calli. The 19 transgenic lines were successfully generated on the basis of gDNA-PCR and IbOr transcript levels for further characterization in terms of carotenoid contents and environmental stresses. Therefore, IbOr transgenic cassava plants may be developed for enhanced biomass production with high levels of carotenoids on marginal lands. © Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology.

AB  - Second-generation bioenergy feedstocks stand poised to become a key component of the nation's agricultural and energy sectors, yet few studies have examined farm supply response using survey information. We use contingent valuation data from farmers in southwestern Wisconsin to develop ex ante supply estimates for two prospective feedstocks-corn stover and switchgrass-in terms of farmers' extensive and intensive acreage decisions. Supply response is found to be price inelastic and spatially fragmented, making widespread production unlikely in the near-term. However, heterogeneity in farmer reservation prices suggests that agglomerations or "hot spots" of feedstock supply could arise at local or regional levels. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Incremental biomass losses during the harvest and storage of energy crops decrease the effective crop yield at the biorefinery gate. These losses can affect the environmental performance of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks by indirectly increasing agricultural inputs per unit of fuel and increasing direct emissions of pollutants during biomass decomposition in storage. In this study, we expand the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREETTM) model to include parameters for harvest and storage of dry bales, bale silage, and bulk silage and examine the potential impact of the biomass supply chain on energy use and air pollutants from cellulosic ethanol from corn stover, switchgrass, and miscanthus feedstocks. A review of storage methods shows substantial differences in expected losses (4.2 to 16.0 %) and variability. Model results indicate that inclusion of feedstock harvest and storage pathways increases net fossil energy consumption (0.03–0.14 MJ/MJ) and greenhouse gas emissions (2.3–10 g CO2e/MJ) from cellulosic ethanol compared to analyses that exclude feedstock losses, depending on the storage scenario selected. Greenhouse gas emissions were highest from bulk ensiled silage and bale silage pathways, driven by direct emissions of greenhouse gasses during storage and material use, respectively. Storage of dry bales indoors or under cover minimizes emissions. This report emphasizes the need to increase the detail of biofuel production models and address areas of great uncertainty in the biomass supply chain, such as biomass decomposition emissions and dry matter losses. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - The increasing human population has led to an inevitable increase in global energy demands. In the recent decades, biofuels have emerged as one of the potential solutions to the world’s insatiable energy needs while reducing the high reliance on fossil fuels. Pongamia (Millettia pinnata), a nitrogen-fixing tree legume, has shown a great promise as an oil source for the production of biofuel with economical and environmental benefits. The generation of pongamia-derived biofuel is dependent on the success of flowering and seed development. However, molecular control of floral initiation pathways in pongamia remains largely unexplored. Photoperiod pathway has been reported to be one of the major checkpoints of plant flowering time and flower initiation. The circadian clock pathway, a part of the photoperiod pathways, is one of the key regulators of flowering time. Here, we report the identification of four pongamia circadian clock genes (ELF4, LCL1, PRR7, and TOC1) through the mapping of the pongamia transcriptome short-paired reads library, by using soybean circadian clock genes as the reference sequences. Furthermore, multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses suggested that pongamia clock genes are conserved among legume crops such as soybean, Medicago, and garden pea. Gene expression studies highlight that pongamia circadian clock genes are diurnally regulated under long-day conditions. Thus, this study reports the isolation and characterization of circadian clock genes in pongamia and enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of flowering control in pongamia. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - We evaluate how different contract designs impact risk sharing along the supply chain for the dedicated energy crop miscanthus. We model the full production and transportation system of the miscanthus supply chain because a sustainable supply chain must procure biomass in a cost-effective manner. Using this model, we estimate the financial returns and risks for both a farmer producing miscanthus and the biofuels plant purchasing miscanthus. We evaluate differences among contracts that are designed to address the miscanthus investment cost and the farmers’ opportunity costs. We find that risk can be reduced to both the farmer and the plant by offering a dollar per acre base payment combined with a dollar per ton payment. The farmer faces the lowest risk when the contract combines a dollar per acre and dollar per ton payment. Lastly, we find that indexed contracts designed to reduce annual counter-party risk associated with the risk of farmers opting out of the contract to produce competing crops actually increases overall financial risk to the farmer and plant. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - As eucalyptus cultivation increases in the southeastern United States to provide feedstock for pulpwood, landscape mulch and an emerging bioenergy market, there is concern regarding potential invasiveness. Recently, models to predict the likelihood of invasiveness have produced conflicting results. Our uncertainty about invasion risk and the relative values we hold for environmental and industry protection will influence which management options and policies are pursued. Here we synthesize the essential practices and barriers to potential eucalyptus spread relative to different stages of the invasion process. Additionally, we offer a discussion of social and economic implications of the possible policies and regulatory techniques for mitigating future problems, with an emphasis on the often-recommended precautionary approach. We highlight future research needs and emphasize a landscape level, collaborative adaptive management approach. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - To show the relationship between socioeconomic development and wood consumption for the investigation of future changes in wood demand in countries where socioeconomic development is expected, we analyzed panel data on per capita GDP, the human development index (HDI), and other factors in relation to per capita wood consumption for 33 OECD and 6 BRIICS countries. An increasing linear trend was found between per capita GDP and per capita consumption for sawn wood. However, the consumption declined over time when the same economic level was attained. In the case of plywood, reconstituted panels, and paper/paperboard, the results suggest that an environmental Kuznets curve, represented as an inverted-U curve, exists between per capita GDP and per capita consumption, confirming a tendency for consumption to reach saturation and then decline as economic development progresses. For wood fuel, an increasing linear trend was confirmed between economic level and per capita consumption, indicating the recent promotion of biofuel in developed countries. However, economic level alone might not be sufficient for explaining the demand for wood. The consumption of sawn wood, plywood, reconstituted panels, and paper/paperboard declined over time for a given HDI level. Rising population density and urbanization can contribute to a decrease in per capita wood consumption, whereas the larger the country’s forest area, the greater per capita wood consumption. In particular, there is an increasing tendency to use the latest forms of wood fuel under sustainable forest management. © 2015, The Japanese Forest Society and Springer Japan.

AB  - The utilization of crop residues in the production of second-generation biofuels has the potential to boost the bioenergy sector without affecting food commodity prices. However, policies leading to large-scale biomass removal should carefully balance the consequences, both environmental and in terms of emissions, on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks depletion. Using a recently developed simulation platform, SOC changes were estimated at European level (EU + candidate and potential candidate countries) under two scenarios of low (R30) and high (R90) maize stover removal for cellulosic ethanol production (i.e. 30 and 90 % of stover removal, respectively). Additionally, mitigation practices for SOC preservation, namely the introduction of a ryegrass cover crop (R90_C) and biodigestate return to soil (R90_B), were explored under the highest rate of stover removal. The results showed that 15.3 to 50.6 Mt year−1 of stover (dry matter) would be potentially available for ethanol production under the lower and high removal rates considered. However, large-scale exploitation of maize residues will lead to a SOC depletion corresponding to 39.7–135.4 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 (under R30 and R90, respectively) with greater losses in the long term. In particular, every tonne of C residue converted to bioethanol was predicted to have an additional impact on SOC loss almost ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 CO2 eq. ha−1 year−1, considering a continuous biofuel scenario by 2050. The mitigation practices evaluated could more than halve SOC losses compared to R90, but not totally offsetting the negative soil C balance. There is a pressing need to design policies at EU level for optimum maize biofuel cultivations that will preserve the current SOC stock or even generate C credits. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels are often presented as an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels; however, empirical analysis that is widely reported in the literature shows that biofuel production can have negative environmental and social impacts. The potential for these negative impacts can be avoided through careful planning of biofuel feedstock production and processing. This report focuses on how green technologies and practices can be introduced into ethanol production to reduce its environmental footprint. The research site of this study is located in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand. Emissions from ethanol production were estimated using life cycle greenhouse gas emission analysis. The analysis covered land use change, cultivation of cassava and sugarcane, ethanol processing, and transportation. Farming data from the study sites in 2013 was used to estimate emissions from crop cultivation and the transportation of cassava and sugarcane to the ethanol plants. Emissions from ethanol production processing were estimated from production data from a combined sugar milling and molasses ethanol factory and a cassava flour and ethanol factory. The estimated emissions from sugarcane farming (32 g CO2eq/MJ ethanol) were much higher than for cassava farming (5 g CO2eq/MJ ethanol) due to greater application of chemical fertilizer and burning during harvesting. The research estimated that the application of green agricultural technologies for sugarcane farming –non-burning, drainage management in irrigated areas, reduced use of chemical fertilizer, and increased use of green compost – would reduce emissions per year by 17 g CO2eq/MJ ethanol. The ethanol production from cassava generated high emissions from the burning of coal in the internal boilers of the ethanol production processing plant (56 g CO2eq/MJ ethanol). Utilisation of the waste to generate electricity and biogas would reduce emissions by 14 -26 g CO2eq/MJ ethanol per year by reducing dependence on coal and conventional sources of electricity. The research concluded that the green technologies and practices studied could contribute to both lower GHG emissions and better environmental outcomes from biofuel production. © 2015, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Energy and water systems are interconnected. This work first characterizes 2010 primary energy demand for direct water services and local freshwater demand for energy on Maui Island, Hawaii, then investigates scenarios for future changes in these demands. The goal of this manuscript is to dissect the relationship and trends of energy-water connections to inform policymaking decisions related to water and energy planning. Analysis proceeds by inventorying water and energy flows and adjusting to a 2010 base year, then applying intensity factors for energy or water used at a given stage for a given sector to determine absolute energy and water demands for the isolated system of Maui Island. These bottom-up, intensity-based values are validated against published data where available. Maui consumes about 0.05% of its freshwater for energy (versus >6% for the US on average) and about 32% of its electricity (19% of its on-island primary energy) for direct water services (versus 8% of primary energy for the US on average). These values could change with policy choices like increased instream flows, higher wastewater treatment standards, electricity fuel mix changes, desalination, or increased biofuels production. This letter contributes a granular assessment of both energy for water and water for energy in a single isolated system, highlighting opportunities to address energy-water interdependencies in a context that could be relevant in other communities facing similar choices. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Water use by plant communities across years of varying water availability indicates how terrestrial water balances will respond to climate change and variability as well as to land cover change. Perennial biofuel crops, likely grown mainly on marginal lands of limited water availability, provide an example of a potentially extensive future land cover conversion. We measured growing-season evapotranspiration (ET) based on daily changes in soil profile water contents in five perennial systems - switchgrass, miscanthus, native grasses, restored prairie, and hybrid poplar - and in annual maize (corn) in a temperate humid climate (Michigan, USA). Three study years (2010, 2011 and 2013) had normal growing-season rainfall (480-610 mm) whereas 2012 was a drought year (210 mm). Over all four years, mean (±SEM) growing-season ET for perennial systems did not greatly differ from corn (496 ±21 mm), averaging 559 (±14), 458 (±31), 573 (±37), 519 (±30), and 492 (±58) mm for switchgrass, miscanthus, native grasses, prairie, and poplar, respectively. Differences in biomass production largely determined variation in water use efficiency (WUE). Miscanthus had the highest WUE in both normal and drought years (52-67 and 43 kg dry biomass ha-1 mm-1, respectively), followed by maize (40-59 and 29 kg ha-1 mm-1); the native grasses and prairie were lower and poplar was intermediate. That measured water use by perennial systems was similar to maize across normal and drought years contrasts with earlier modeling studies and suggests that rain-fed perennial biomass crops in this climate have little impact on landscape water balances, whether replacing rain-fed maize on arable lands or successional vegetation on marginal lands. Results also suggest that crop ET rates, and thus groundwater recharge, streamflow, and lake levels, may be less sensitive to climate change than has been assumed. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bioethanol is a very environmentally friendly liquid biofuel that is not only renewable, but also sustainable. It is currently deemed as a highly suitable additive and substitute energy source to replace fossil based fuel. In this study, bioethanol was produced from sago hampas by using commercial amylase, cellulase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae via sequential saccharification and simultaneous fermentation (SSSF), a modified version of the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process. SSSF was performed on sago hampas at 2.5 and 5.0% (w/v) feedstock load for five days. The samples taken from the SSSF broths were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for ethanol, glucose and acetic acid production. From the results obtained, SSSF with 5.0% sago hampas loading exhibited the highest ethanol production at 14.13 g/L (77.43% of theoretical ethanol yield), while SSSF using 2.5% sago hampas loading produced ethanol at 6.45 g/L (69.24% of theoretical ethanol yield). This study has shown that ethanol not only can be produced from sago hampas using different enzyme mixtures and S. cerevisiae via SSSF, but yields were also high, making this process highly promising for the production of cheap and sustainable ethanol as fuel.

AB  - Terrestrial carbon sequestration potential is widely considered as a realistic option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, this potential may be threatened by global changes including climate, land use, and management changes such as increased corn stover harvesting for rising production of cellulosic biofuel. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) at regional or global scale. This study simulated the corn production and spatiotemporal changes of SOC in the U.S. Temperate Prairies, which covers over one-third of the U.S. corn acreage, using a biogeochemical model with multiple climate and land-use change projections. The corn production (either grain yield or stover biomass) could reach 88.7-104.7 TgC as of 2050, 70-101% increase when compared to the base year of 2010. A removal of 50% stover at the regional scale could be a reasonable cap in view of maintaining SOC content and soil fertility especially in the beginning years. The projected SOC dynamics indicated that the average carbon sequestration potential across the entire region may vary from 12.7 to 19.6 g C/m2/yr (i.e., 6.6-10.2gTgC/yr). This study not only helps understand SOC dynamics but also provides decision support for sustainable biofuel development.

AB  - Microalgae and cyanobacteria are rich sources of many valuable compounds, including important bioactive and biotechnologically relevant chemicals. Their enormous biodiversity, and the consequent variability in the respective biochemical composition, make microalgae cultivations a promising resource for many novel chemically and biologically active molecules and compounds of high commercial value such as lipids and dyes. The nature of the chemicals produced can be manipulated by changing the cultivation media and conditions. Algae are extremely versatile because they can be adapted to a variety of cell culture conditions. They do not require arable land, can be cultivated on saline water and wastewaters, and require much less water than plants. They possess an extremely high growth rate making these microorganisms very attractive for use in biofuel production – some species of algae can achieve around 100 times more oil than oil seeds. In addition, microalgae and cyanobacteria can accumulate various biotoxins and can contribute to mitigate greenhouse gases since they produce biomass through carbon dioxide fixation. In this review, we provide an overview of the application of microalgae in the production of bioactive and other chemicals. © 2015, Science Reviews 2000 Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies investigated the patient-care (in-hospital) and outside-the-hospital energy consumptions for delivering the hemodialysis (HD) service. A life cycle inventory methodology was used for this patient-based analysis for two hospitals located in Wichita, Kansas. It was found that, for both hospitals, the actual HD machines consumed approximately 3.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy per HD, only 8% to 16% of the total energy used for delivering the HD service (in hospital). This increases to 9.6 to 28.9 kWh of hospital billable energy for the whole system of HD machine, auxiliaries, and dialysis water treatment. Converting these hospital direct electrical energy values to natural resource energy (nre) then adding the cradle-to-gate natural resource energy for the manufacturing and supply chain of all the HD consumables, the total is 78 to 149 kWh nre/HD. The nre measures all the direct fuel burned to generate energy and is thus directly related to emissions to the air, water, and land and is a direct secondary impact on public health from HD. The ratio of outside-the-hospital energy to direct hospital HD electrical energy consumption is 4:1 to 7:1, so a broader base exists for improvement than just the hospital. © 2014 by Yale University.

AB  - Ecological footprint (EF) is a metric that estimates human consumption of biological resources and products, along with generation of waste greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in terms of appropriated productive land. There is an opportunity to better characterize land occupation and effects on the carbon cycle in life cycle assessment (LCA) models using EF concepts. Both LCA and EF may benefit from the merging of approaches commonly used separately by practitioners of these two methods. However, few studies have compared or integrated EF with LCA. The focus of this research was to explore methods for improving the characterization of land occupation within LCA by considering the EF method, either as a complementary tool or impact assessment method. Biofuels provide an interesting subject for application of EF in the LCA context because two of the most important issues surrounding biofuels are land occupation (changes, availability, and so on) and GHG balances, two of the impacts that EF is able to capture. We apply EF to existing fuel LCA land occupation and emissions data and project EF for future scenarios for U.S. transportation fuels. We find that LCA studies can benefit from lessons learned in EF about appropriately modeling productive land occupation and facilitating clear communication of meaningful results, but find limitations to the EF in the LCA context that demand refinement and recommend that EF always be used along with other indicators and metrics in product-level assessments. © 2015, Yale University.

AB  - Ethanol is a biofuel produced in Brazil through fermentation of sugarcane, requiring vast plantation areas and water availability. The present work aimed at testing isotopic markers as tools for ethanol source appointment or certification of origin. For this, oxygen and hydrogen isotopic patterns were determined in plant-water, soil-water, rainwater, and water from reservoirs and some rivers in four sugarcane crop areas. The isotopic fingerprint of carbon and hydrogen in ethanol produced in the respective mills was also determined. Samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 in crop areas of the state of Amazonas (North), Mato Grosso (Center-West), São Paulo (Southeast) and Rio Grande do Sul (South). The substantial and complex influence of the hydrological cycle on the ethanol δD and the small δ13C variations constrain the use of isotopes for the intended objectives. © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Crop residues are potentially significant sources of feedstock for biofuel production in the United States. However, there are concerns with maintaining the environmental functions of these residues while also serving as a feedstock for biofuel production. Maintaining soil organic carbon (SOC) along with its functional benefits is considered a greater constraint than maintaining soil erosion losses to an acceptable level. We used the biogeochemical model DayCent to evaluate the effect of residue removal, corn stover, and wheat and barley straw in three diverse locations in the USA. We evaluated residue removal with and without N replacement, along with application of a high-lignin fermentation byproduct (HLFB), the residue by-product comprised of lignin and small quantities of nutrients from cellulosic ethanol production. SOC always decreased with residue harvest, but the decrease was greater in colder climates when expressed on a life cycle basis. The effect of residue harvest on soil N2O emissions varied with N addition and climate. With N addition, N2O emissions always increased, but the increase was greater in colder climates. Without N addition, N2O emissions increased in Iowa, but decreased in Maryland and North Carolina with crop residue harvest. Although SOC was lower with residue harvest when HLFB was used for power production instead of being applied to land, the avoidance of fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere by utilizing the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of crop residue to produce ethanol (offsets) reduced the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because most of this residue carbon would normally be lost during microbial respiration. Losses of SOC and reduced N mineralization could both be mitigated with the application of HLFB to the land. Therefore, by returning the high-lignin fraction of crop residue to the land after production of ethanol at the biorefinery, soil carbon levels could be maintained along with the functional benefit of increased mineralized N, and more GHG emissions could be offset compared to leaving the crop residues on the land. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a crucial index for developing sustainable bioenergy cropping systems. The objective of this study was to examine switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) NUE by using a low-cost organic amendment under different harvest frequencies. Aerobically digested biosolids were applied at 0, 153, 306, and 459 kg N ha−1 in a small plot study, and lime-stabilized biosolids were applied at 0, 77, and 154 kg N ha−1 in a field-scale study in Virginia, USA. Switchgrass was harvested once or twice per season. Switchgrass N concentration and N removal were measured to estimate switchgrass NUE, annual N recovery (ANR), and partial factor productivity (PFP). Across N rates, biosolid application increased biomass N concentration and removal by 29 % and 84 % and decreased NUE, ANR, and PFP in the plot study, but effects were inconsistent in the field study. Low NUE, ANR, and PFP obtained with a single, end-of-season harvest were likely functions of low feedstock N concentrations. Switchgrass harvested in summer had highest N concentrations. Cutting twice per season removed more N than cutting once; the resulting increase in NUE reflects differences in feedstock N concentrations rather than differences in yield. Our results suggest that biosolids can be applied as an alternative N source to support plant growth, and cutting once per season is preferable in sustainable biofuel production systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The economic, social and environmental costs of food waste are being increasingly recognised. Food waste consists of both edible and inedible components. Whilst wastage of edible food is problematic for obvious reasons, there are also costs associated with the disposal of the inedible fraction to landfill. This is the third in a series of papers examining the costs of food waste throughout the value chain in South Africa. The previous papers focused on the edible portion of food waste. In this paper, costs associated with inedible food waste in South Africa are estimated, in terms of the value foregone by not recovering this waste for use in downstream applications, such as energy generation or composting; as well as costs associated with disposal to landfill. Opportunity costs are estimated at R6.4 (US$0.64). billion per annum, or R2668 (US$266) per tonne. Adding this to the previous estimate for edible food waste of R61.5. billion per annum (in 2012 prices; equivalent to R65. billion in 2013 prices) results in a total opportunity cost of food waste in South Africa (in terms of loss of a potentially valuable food source or resource) of R71.4 (US$7.14). billion per annum, or R5667 (US$567) per tonne. Thereafter, estimates of the costs associated with disposal of this food waste to landfill, including both financial costs and externalities (social and environmental costs), are taken into account. These costs amount to R255 (US$25) per tonne, giving rise to a total cost of food waste in South Africa of R75. billion (US$7.5. billion) per annum, or R5922 (US$592) per tonne. This is equivalent to 2.2% of South Africa's 2013 GDP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The performance of anaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge with un-dewatered grease trap waste was assessed using modified biochemical methane potential tests under mesophilic conditions (35°C). Methane potentials, process inhibition and chemical behavior of the process were analyzed at different grease trap waste feed ratios on volatile solids basis. Nonlinear regression analyses of first order reaction and modified Gompertz equations were performed to assist in interpretation of the experimental results. Methane potential of un-dewatered grease trap waste was measured as 606mL CH4/g VSadded, while methane potential of municipal wastewater sludge was only 223mL CH4/g VSadded. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion of grease trap waste without dewatering yields less methane potential than concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste because of high wastewater content of un-dewatered grease trap waste. However, anaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge and grease trap waste still yields over two times more methane potential and approximately 10% more volatile solids reduction than digestion of municipal wastewater sludge alone. The anaerobic co-digestion process inhibitions were reported at 70% and greater concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste additions on volatile solids basis in previous studies; however, no inhibition was observed at 100% un-dewatered grease trap waste digestion in the present study. These results indicate that anaerobic co-digestion of un-dewatered grease trap waste may reduce the inhibition risk compared to anaerobic co-digestion of concentrated/dewatered grease trap waste. In addition, a mathematical model was developed in this study for the first time to describe the relationship between grease trap waste feed ratio on volatile solids basis and resulting methane potential. Experimental data from the current study as well as previous biochemical methane potential studies were successfully fit to this relationship and allowed estimation of key performance parameters that provide additional insight into the factors affecting biochemical methane potential. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract An evaluation of the investment required to implement a second generation bioethanol production chain is presented in this study. An integrated agro-industrial system can be an appropriate solution to accomplish the European requirement for the partial substitution of bioethanol for gasoline by 2020. A biorefinery system is hypothesized within the Province of Siena (Italy), fed by residual energy and material flows from local productions: straw from agriculture and residual geothermal heat from geothermal electricity generation; the output is calibrated to replace 10% of gasoline consumption within the Provincial area. The physical consistency of the investment required to implement the production process, as well as the benefit of the biofuel-gasoline substitution, have been evaluated by means of the emergy methodology. Emergy is a thermodynamics-based indicator that contributes to identify and measure all the inputs supporting a given system, expressed in a common unit (solar emergy Joules - semj). Results show that the benefit of saving gasoline, in emergy terms, almost doubles the emergy investment to produce biofuel. The case of a biorefinery fed by natural gas instead of local residual geothermal heat is also presented. The Unit Emergy Investment (UEI) of bioethanol produced in a biorefinery that uses residual straw and geothermal heat is 9.16E + 08 semj/g (the case of the Province of Siena); it is 1.84E + 09 semj/g (in case natural gas is used to fuel the process). Finally, the comparison between the UEI of bioethanol evaluated in this study and UEV of bioethanol calculated in other studies is presented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biorefineries that plan to use switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) biomass exclusively will encounter both temporal (across years) and spatial (across locations within a given year) variability in feedstock production. Long term land leases could be employed to facilitate feedstock availability for the expected life of the biorefinery. If the quantity of land leased is based on average yields, in some years more biomass will be produced than can be processed. In other years feedstock production on the leased land may be insufficient to prevent biorefinery downtime. An optimal strategy for identifying which land to lease and seed to switchgrass, while considering yield variability and the opportunity cost of biorefinery downtime, is the focus of the research. The objective is to determine for a given biorefinery location the least-cost quantity, quality, and location of land to lease for alternative estimates of biorefinery downtime cost due to variable switchgrass yields. Fifty years of weather data are used to simulate switchgrass yield distributions for a case study region. An innovative mathematical programming model is developed and used to reveal the cost-efficient D (Downtime Cost) L (Land to Lease) frontier for a 2Ggd-1 biomass capacity biorefinery. If interyear storage is not permitted, 60,492ha would be required to insure that the biorefinery run at full capacity every year given the estimated yield distributions. However, for some circumstances, it would be optimal to produce switchgrass on only 49,464ha and idle the biorefinery for some days in low biomass production years. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Producing biofuel from plant crops is considered a potentially viable alternative to the use of fossil fuels, as well as a means of reducing CO2 emissions. In this regard, the use of marginal soils such as abandoned farmland and non-conventional water resources, including recycled urban wastewater (RWW), is posited as a viable and sustainable system for growing such crops. The present study evaluates the sustainability of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) irrigated with RWW in abandoned farming soils on the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), which is one of the most arid parts of the European Union. The evaluation of the crop was carried out during its first 48 months and compared the effects of two irrigation systems - surface drip irrigation (SDI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) - and two irrigation doses - 75% of ETp (dose A) and 100% de ETp (dose B) - on the growth, productivity and nutritional status of JCL, as well as on the soil quality. The results indicate that SSDI does not offer significant advantages compared to SDI in terms of nutritional status, growth or productivity. However, the amount of water used for irrigation does significantly influence JCL growth (199 vs. 220cm plant height for doses A and B, respectively) but not productivity (815 vs. 1000kg seedha-1 for doses A and B, respectively). Irrespective of the irrigation system and dose applied, RWW irrigation led to a significant increase in soil salinity. For example, in topsoil (0-20cm), average values of 42.0dSm-1 and 6.8mgL-1 of electrical conductivity and soluble boron were reached, respectively. The sustainability of the system under experimental conditions is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biojet fuels have been claimed to be one of the most promising and strategic solutions to mitigate aviation emissions. This study examines the environmental competence of Bio-Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (Bio-SPKs) against conventional Jet-A, through development of a life cycle GHG model (ALCEmB - Assessment of Life Cycle Emissions of Biofuels) from "cradle-grave" perspective. This model precisely calculates the life cycle emissions of the advanced biofuels through a multi-disciplinary study entailing hydrocarbon chemistry, thermodynamic behaviour and fuel combustion from engine/aircraft performance, into the life cycle studies, unlike earlier studies. The aim of this study is predict the "cradle-grave" carbon intensity of Camelina SPK, Microalgae SPK and Jatropha SPK through careful estimation and inclusion of combustion based emissions, which contribute ≈70% of overall life cycle emissions (LCE). Numerical modelling and non-linear/dynamic simulation of a twin-shaft turbofan, with an appropriate airframe, was conducted to analyse the impact of alternative fuels on engine/aircraft performance. ALCEmB revealed that Camelina SPK, Microalgae SPK and Jatropha SPK delivered 70%, 58% and 64% LCE savings relative to the reference fuel, Jet-A1. The net energy ratio analysis indicates that current technology for the biofuel processing is energy efficient and technically feasible. An elaborate gas property analysis infers that the Bio-SPKs exhibit improved thermodynamic behaviour in an operational gas turbine engine. This thermodynamic effect has a positive impact on aircraft-level fuel consumption and emissions characteristics demonstrating fuel savings in the range of 3-3.8% and emission savings of 5.8-6.3% (CO2) and 7.1-8.3% (LTO NOx), relative to that of Jet-A. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how local promoters framed the development of the ethanol industry in Kansas, in the Midwestern U.S, by attaching it to locally salient discourses related to the environment, economic development, energy independence, and the cultural importance of agricultural production. We use a framing analysis to examine the discourse and cultural politics of the promotion of ethanol production in four regional and one state level newspaper, supplemented by data from key informant interviews conducted to understand how both the promises and the impacts of the ethanol industry are reframed at the local level. We argue that by linking ethanol production to localized economic and environmental benefits, and to national security and energy independence agendas, the discourse promoting biofuels development in the local media sidelined any discussion of climate mitigation or conservation agendas associated with biofuels production, and reframed natural resource issues to justify local claims for continued water mining for agricultural production. In particular, water use in biofuels production is naturalized as an entitlement for agriculture and ethanol producers. Our research adds to the rural studies literature that examines how powerful discourses and ideologies interact to advance an agenda that may actually be counter to economic and environmental futures in rural communities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The manipulation of habitat through thinning and logging activities may have cascading effects on fauna because of direct and indirect changes to key habitat features. However, the combined effect of thinning and logging on fauna has not been investigated for Australian forests, despite the widespread use of thinning as a silvicultural management tool in selectively logged forests, and the emerging interest in thinning for biofuels. We therefore surveyed reptiles, birds and key habitat variables at sites selected to sample four management classes reflecting categories of thinning and/or logging activity in cypress pine Callitris glaucophylla forests of the Brigalow Belt bioregion of Australia. Habitat structure and assemblages of reptile and bird species were distinct across the four management classes, reflecting long-term cumulative impacts of small- and/or large-diameter tree removal in a dynamic system, but the response of various functional groups of species was mixed. Recovery of some habitat elements (e.g. small trees) to a state that maintains densities of most fauna species appears to be relatively rapid, but depends on the combined effect of thinning and logging. Other habitat elements, such as large cypress trees which were reduced by logging and unaffected by thinning, require longer time frames to mature and therefore will be critical resources to maintain during future management activities in cypress forests. Overall, it appears that thinning activities affect fauna and therefore must be considered when making decisions about forest management. We suggest management of production forests aims for a mosaic of thinning and/or logging combinations across the landscape, but emphasise the importance of retaining or restoring unthinned and unlogged areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Modern biomass energy sources account for less than 2% of primary world energy supplies while major economies have enabled legislation that aims to increase bioenergy production. In response to controversies over first generation biofuel, it has been argued that 'marginal land' should be used to produce dedicated energy crops (DECs). However, defining marginality of agricultural land is complex, and moreover, DECs would have to out-compete current agricultural production in these areas. Utilising a bio-economic farm-level modelling approach we investigate the impact that crop yield penalties resulting from production in marginal land contexts have on financially optimal farm-level crop plans. Where farm businesses choose to de-invest in own farm machinery, yield reductions of less than 10% for winter wheat result in a financially optimal switch to 100% miscanthus production. By contrast, in the presence of own farm machinery, winter wheat yield penalties of 30% are required before 100% miscanthus production is financially optimal. However, under circumstances where DECs also suffer yield penalties on marginal land, the financially optimal crop mix includes combinable crops. The results demonstrate that the optimal crop mix is dependent upon the relative combinable and DEC yields, together with farm-level decisions towards machinery ownership. The focus of much policy attention relating to production of DECs on 'marginal land' is therefore argued to be incomplete. Policies which encourage farmers to de-invest in own farm machinery, or incentivise the purchase of specific DEC machinery, may play an important role in assisting the development of DEC production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study a prospective life cycle assessment of biorefinery system from vetiver leaves was carried out to know the environmental benefits of this system over conventional systems considering the geographical context of India. The composition of vetiver leaves from the experimental analysis revealed that vetiver is rich in cellulose (32.6%), hemicellulose (31.5%) and lignin (17.3%) that could be used as a feedstock for biorefinery. The comparative life cycle assessment results show that the carbon dioxide emission and fossil oil depletion could be reduced by 95% and 23% respectively in case of standalone bioethanol system, and 99% and 17% respectively in case of bioethanol and furfural system compared to that of conventional petrol and furfural systems. The sensitivity study indicates that the impact could be further reduced if vetiver biomass is used as a source of energy in biorefinery plant instead to the coal. © 2015.

AB  - Microbial contamination of growth reactors is a major concern for microalgal biofuel production. In this study, the oleaginous, CO2-tolerant microalga Scenedesmus dimorphus was combined with a wastewater-derived microbial community and grown in replicated sequencing batch photobioreactors. The reactors were sparged with either ambient air or 20% v/v CO2. In the initial growth cycles, air and the 20% CO2 reactors were similar in terms of growth and microbial community structure. Beyond the fourth growth cycle, however, the ambient air reactors had larger decreases in cell density and growth rate, and increases in species richness and non-algal microorganisms compared to the 20% CO2 reactors. Both qPCR and rDNA sequence analyses demonstrated a greater loss in S. dimorphus enrichment in the ambient-air reactors compared to the 20% CO2 reactors. These results demonstrate that environmental parameters can be used to delay the adverse impacts of microbial contamination in open, mixed-culture microalgae bioreactors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Warm-season prairie grasses are promising bioenergy crops that exhibit conservative nitrogen use and cycling, which promise to reduce expensive N amendments and contributions to environmental N pollution associated with annual cropping systems. However, efforts to maximize crop yields with fertilizer may reduce N conservation in these systems. We used two perennial grass systems of differing diversity levels - a restored tallgrass prairie and a Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) monoculture-to determine the effects of N fertilizer level and harvest timing on biomass yields, N concentrations and N removal at harvest. To address plant N conservation, we measured N resorption efficiency (proportion of N resorbed), resorption proficiency (minimum N level attained after senescence), and timing of resorption under different N fertilizer rates. Yield responses to N fertilizer were not consistent between cropping system, year, or harvest timing, and were generally weak, resulting in an average of only 1.27 times more biomass compared to unfertilized plots. In contrast, fertilized plots removed 1.67 times more N relative to unfertilized plots, as N removal was largely driven by increases in biomass N concentrations rather than increases in yield. N resorption was affected by fertilizer in switchgrass, but not in selected prairie species. Fertilized switchgrass plants took longer to reach their maximum resorption levels and had reduced resorption proficiency, despite higher resorption efficiencies. Our results suggest that striving to increase biomass yields with N fertilizer may be an imprudent approach to sustainable bioenergy production, because yield responses are highly variable and N conservation mechanisms are compromised. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel plants such as Jatropha curcas L. have potential to support the livelihoods of rural communities and contribute to sustainable rural development in Africa, if risks and uncertainties are minimized. Yet, recent papers have warned of the risk of biological invasions in such tropical regions as a consequence of the introduction of exotic biofuel crops. We investigated the seed dispersal risk and invasiveness potential of both J. curcas monoculture plantations and live fences into adjacent cultivated and uncultivated land use systems in Sissili province, Burkina Faso. Invasiveness potential was assessed through (i) detecting evidence of natural regeneration in perimeters around J. curcas plantations and live fences, (ii) assessing seed dispersal mechanisms, and (iii) assessing seedling establishment potential through in situ direct seed sowing. Spontaneous regeneration around the plantation perimeters of the three sites was very low. Individual seedling density around J. curcas live fences was less than 0.01 m−2 in all sites. Seventy percent of the seedlings were found close to the live fence and most of them derived from the same year (96 %), which indicates low seed-bank longevity and seedling survival. J. curcas can be dispersed by small mammals and arthropods, particularly rodents and ants. In some sites, such as in Onliassan, high secondary seed dispersal by animals (up to 98 %) was recorded. There were highly significant differences in germination rates between seeds at the soil surface (11 %) and those buried artificially at 1–2-cm depth (64 %). In conclusion, we failed to find convincing evidence of the spreading of J. curcas or any significant impact on the surrounding environment. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This paper examines the potential role for Power to Gas (P2G) as applied to an island energy system with high levels of renewable electricity penetration. P2G systems require both a supply of green electricity and a source of CO2. Cheap electricity is essential for a financially sustainable P2G system. Using a PLEXOS model it was determined that deploying 50MWe of P2G capacity on the 2030 Irish electrical grid may reduce absolute levels of curtailed wind by 5% compared to the base case. CO2 capture is expensive. The cheapest method of sourcing CO2 for a P2G system is to employ a methanation process whereby biogas from anaerobic digestion is mixed with hydrogen from surplus electricity. Anaerobic digestion in Ireland has a potential to produce biomethane to a level of 10.2% of energy in transport (19.2PJ/a). The potential CO2 resource from anaerobic digestion could allow for a further 8.9% of energy in transport (16.6PJ/a) from P2G production. An optimal model is proposed including for co-location of a biogas system with a P2G system. The model includes for demand-driven biogas concepts allowing electrical grid balancing and the supply of gaseous transportation fuel. Biofuel obligation certificates allows for a financially viable industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The replacement of diesel by biofuels is considered unrealistic because of the land used to produce their feedstock. One appointed solution is the use of algae which have higher productivity per unit area when compared with other feedstocks. In light of this, the total area, including water and land required for the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Brazil was determined using international policies and targets, the present and future diesel demand, the current biodiesel production (released by international organizations), and specific data of algae productivity from the literature.GIS software was used to locate possible cities where algae cultivation could occur nearby. Bearings on the availability of area (flat and unoccupied zones), favourable climate, proximity to the process inputs (such as nutrients (preferably from municipal waste water treatment), CO2 and water sources) and political boundaries were used as assessment criteria. It was possible to identify seven suitable cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants in the EU, two in the USA and thirteen in Brazil.It was also shown that it is possible to attain targets required by current policies and replace diesel with algae-derived diesel based on attainable cultivation areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Agave species can grow well in semi-arid marginal agricultural lands around the world. Selected Agave species are used largely for alcoholic beverage production in Mexico. There are expanding research efforts to use the plentiful residues (bagasse) for ethanol production as the beverage manufacturing process only uses the juice from the central core of mature plants. Here, we investigate the potential of over a dozen Agave species, including three from cold semi-arid regions of the United States, to produce biofuels using the whole plant. Results: Ethanol was readily produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae from hydrolysate of ten whole Agaves with the use of a proper blend of biomass degrading enzymes including inulinase that overcomes inhibition of most of the species tested. As an example, US grown Agave neomexicana produced 119 ± 11 mg ethanol/g biomass. Unlike yeast fermentations, Clostridium beijerinckii produced n-butanol plus acetone from all species tested. Butyric acid, a precursor of n-butanol, was also present due to incomplete conversion during the screening process. Since Agave contains high levels of free and polyfructose which are readily destroyed by acidic pretreatment, a two-step procedure was developed to depolymerize polyfructose while maintaining its fermentability. The hydrolysate from before and after dilute acid processing was used in C. beijerinckii fermentations with selected Agave species with A. neomexicana producing 144 ± 4 mg fermentation products/g biomass. Conclusions: Results showed Agave's potential to be a source of fermentable sugars beyond the existing beverage species to now include many species previously unfermentable by yeast, including cold-tolerant lines. This development should stimulate development of Agave as a dedicated feedstock for biofuels in semi-arid regions throughout the globe. © 2015 Mielenz et al.

AB  - Atmospheric pollution over South Asia attracts special attention due to its effects on regional climate, water cycle and human health. These effects are potentially growing owing to rising trends of anthropogenic aerosol emissions. In this study, the spatio-temporal aerosol distributions over South Asia from seven global aerosol models are evaluated against aerosol retrievals from NASA satellite sensors and ground-based measurements for the period of 2000-2007. Overall, substantial underestimations of aerosol loading over South Asia are found systematically in most model simulations. Averaged over the entire South Asia, the annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) is underestimated by a range 15 to 44% across models compared to MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer), which is the lowest bound among various satellite AOD retrievals (from MISR, SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aqua and Terra). In particular during the post-monsoon and wintertime periods (i.e., October-January), when agricultural waste burning and anthropogenic emissions dominate, models fail to capture AOD and aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) compared to ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sunphotometer measurements. The underestimations of aerosol loading in models generally occur in the lower troposphere (below 2 km) based on the comparisons of aerosol extinction profiles calculated by the models with those from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data. Furthermore, surface concentrations of all aerosol components (sulfate, nitrate, organic aerosol (OA) and black carbon (BC)) from the models are found much lower than in situ measurements in winter. Several possible causes for these common problems of underestimating aerosols in models during the post-monsoon and wintertime periods are identified: the aerosol hygroscopic growth and formation of secondary inorganic aerosol are suppressed in the models because relative humidity (RH) is biased far too low in the boundary layer and thus foggy conditions are poorly represented in current models, the nitrate aerosol is either missing or inadequately accounted for, and emissions from agricultural waste burning and biofuel usage are too low in the emission inventories. These common problems and possible causes found in multiple models point out directions for future model improvements in this important region. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Rapid expansion in biomass production for biofuels and bioenergy in the Americas is increasing demand on the ecosystem resources required to sustain soil and site productivity. We review the current state of knowledge and highlight gaps in research on biogeochemical processes and ecosystem sustainability related to biomass production. Biomass production systems incrementally remove greater quantities of organic matter, which in turn affects soil organic matter and associated carbon and nutrient storage (and hence long-term soil productivity) and off-site impacts. While these consequences have been extensively studied for some crops and sites, the ongoing and impending impacts of biomass removal require management strategies for ensuring that soil properties and functions are sustained for all combinations of crops, soils, sites, climates, and management systems, and that impacts of biomass management (including off-site impacts) are environmentally acceptable. In a changing global environment, knowledge of cumulative impacts will also become increasingly important. Long-term experiments are essential for key crops, soils, and management systems because short-term results do not necessarily reflect long-term impacts, although improved modeling capability may help to predict these impacts. Identification and validation of soil sustainability indicators for both site prescriptions and spatial applications would better inform commercial and policy decisions. In an increasingly inter-related but constrained global context, researchers should engage across inter-disciplinary, inter-agency, and international lines to better ensure the long-term soil productivity across a range of scales, from site to landscape. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Across the Americas, biofuels production systems are diverse due to geographic conditions, historical patterns of land tenure, different land use patterns, government policy frameworks, and relations between the national state and civil society, all of which shape the role that biofuels play in individual nations. Although many national governments throughout the Americas continue to incentivize growth of the biofuels industry, one key challenge for biofuels sustainability has been concern about its social impacts. In this article, we discuss some of the key social issues and tensions related to the recent expansion of biofuels production in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. We argue that a process of “simplification” of ecological and cultural diversity has aided the expansion of the biofuels frontier in these countries, but is also undermining their viability. We consider the ability of governments and non-state actors in multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI) to address social and environmental concerns that affect rural livelihoods as a result of biofuels expansion. We analyze the tensions between global sustainability standards, national level policies for biofuels development, and local level impacts and visions of sustainability. We find that both government and MSI efforts to address sustainability concerns have limited impact, and recommend greater incorporation of local needs and expertise to improve governance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This paper presents an ecotoxicological evaluation of soil fertilized with biogas digestate (BD) or mining waste (MS). The study was performed under pot experiment conditions. BD was added at a dose of 1.5 and 3 % to the soil. MS was applied at a dose of 10 and 20 %. Samples were collected at the beginning of the experiment and after 180 and 360 days from the start of the study. In addition, a parallel experiment with the addition of CaO was done. This was designed to eliminate the adverse effect of low soil pH on the test organisms. A battery of ecotoxicological tests was used based on tests with plants (Phytotoxkit F), microorganisms (Microtox®), and crustaceans (Daphtoxkit F). In most cases, the obtained results showed that the investigated wastes had a stimulating effect on the growth of Lepidium sativum roots. The highest content of BD was an exception since it inhibited the growth of L. sativum roots. After adding BD and MS, both the luminescence of Vibrio fischeri and the mortality of Daphnia magna was at a similar level to that in the control soil. An exception was the significant increase in the mortality of D. magna after 48 h for soil with 3 % BD. The tests performed after 6 and 12 months showed that, with time, the toxicity of the waste-amended soil fluctuated, but ultimately decreased in most cases compared to the control. The effect of the addition of CaO on the examined toxicity parameters was different and depended on the experimental variant. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Pakistan has limited indigenous resources of fossil fuel and the deficit is being filled through imports of crude oil and petroleum product. The country presently produces bio ethanol predominantly from molasses, a byproduct of the refining of sugarcane. Since promotion of 1st-generation biofuels appears unsustainable because of the potential stress on food commodities, crop residues present a major opportunity for cleaner production through promotion of 2nd generation bio ethanol. Based on the evaluation of the availability of lignocellulosic biomass in Pakistan, this study forecasts the annual yield of five lignocellulosic feedstocks i.e. cotton stalks, sugarcane tops, rice straw, maize stalks and wheat straw from 2013 to 2030 in Pakistan with the help of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interface System Model. Based on the availability of biomass feedstock, the study forecasts the maximum theoretical potential for production of bio ethanol from these crop residues up to 2030. Our study also analyses the parameters affecting the basic price for the crop residue collection. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: This paper introduces a Special Issue of Hydrological Sciences Journal containing 10 research papers which present current applications of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for water resources assessment. First, an overview of selected, recently published papers with application of SWAT is given. The papers address the following topics: nutrients and related best management practices (BMPs); sediments and related BMPs; impoundment and wetlands; irrigation; bioenergy crops; climate change impact; and land-use change impacts. Then, papers from this Special Issue are briefly described, covering the themes: surface runoff and sediments; nonpoint-source pollution; surface water and groundwater; impacts of climate and land-use change; and large-scale SWAT applications. The presented model applications of SWAT were conducted across a variety of spatial scales, physiographic regions and climatic zones. This collection of papers demonstrates that applications of SWAT for water resources assessment are growing in number and cover drainage basins in many regions worldwide. Editor M.

AB  - Agricultural policy objectives in developed nations include counteracting overproduction, increasing economic and social well-being, and environmental protection. Such policies, however, often work at cross-purposes. While vast financial resources have been invested in farm programs, little research connects historic trends in agricultural policy with land-use patterns in agricultural landscapes. We connect the legislative history of US farm bills with land-use decisions as observed on the historical agricultural landscape in three townships in Iowa, USA, 1933-2002. With a high proportion of agricultural land, increasing biofuels development, and high participation in federal conservation programs, Iowa presents an ideal case study to explore the relationship between policy and historical land use. Using data from the US Census of Agriculture and historical aerial photography, we conduct our analysis within a framework that identifies alternating eras of US farm policy in terms of legislative focus on conservation vs. production. We describe the impact of US farm policy on the following indicators: maize and soybean area, production, and productivity; hectares in idled land, pasture, and hay ground; and adoption of soil conservation practices. Patterns of agricultural and conservation land use support the idea of alternating conservation-production eras of US farm policy. Three important patterns emerge: (1) despite reductions in maize hectares that correspond with conservation-oriented policy eras, supply management policies have failed to control maize production due to increased productivity; (2) as pasture and hay hectares decline, government set-aside programs are increasingly important for perennial vegetation within agricultural landscapes; and (3) although soil conservation practices have generally increased as agricultural land use has intensified, persistent links between poor environmental quality and farm programs suggest that implementation alone will not achieve environmental quality goals. Environmental improvement likely requires a shift from policies focused on the quantity of commodities produced to policies focused on pattern and process of production in multifunctional agricultural landscapes, and we discuss how policies that promote extensification abroad might inform domestic agricultural policy reform. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A coalition of organizations and representatives of civil society from across Asia, Africa, and Latin America expressed their concerns about the impact of Europe's biofuels policies, particularly on escalating demand for palm oil, implying an unsustainable global land footprint. Around 90% of the world's palm oil is grown in Indonesia and Malaysia. The growth of palm oil plantations in Latin America and Africa indicated that it has led to land grabbing and conflict, along with loss of clean water supplies, food sovereignty and cultural integrity. The coalition urge all member states of the European Parliament to vote for biofuels policy reforms that will ensure the protection of people and environment from the affected regions from the impacts of palm oil expansion.

AB  - In February 2015, Europe's parliamentarians approved a cap of 6% on biofuels made from food crops used in transport fuels, which is tighter that 2014's 7% proposal. Negotiations between the European Parliament, the European Council, and the European Commission aim to come up with a draft text for incorporation into legislation. Early discussions between the three groups have seen the Council wanting to adopt the 7% cap while the Parliament wants to stick with the 6% cap. Disagreements over accounting for indirect land-use change are another issue. Proposals for the 6% cap provoked a mixed response from industry and non-governmental organizations.

AB  - The final step of the biogas production process, the methanogenesis, is frequently dominated by members of the genus Methanoculleus. In particular, the species Methanoculleus bourgensis was identified to play a role in different biogas reactor systems. The genome of the type strain M. bourgensis MS2T, originally isolated from a sewage sludge digestor, was completely sequenced to analyze putative adaptive genome features conferring competitiveness within biogas reactor environments to the strain. Sequencing and assembly of the M. bourgensis MS2T genome yielded a chromosome with a size of 2,789,773bp. Comparative analysis of M. bourgensis MS2T and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1 revealed significant similarities. The absence of genes for a putative ammonium uptake system may indicate that M. bourgensis MS2T is adapted to environments rich in ammonium/ammonia. Specific genes featuring predicted functions in the context of osmolyte production were detected in the genome of M. bourgensis MS2T. Mapping of metagenome sequences derived from a production-scale biogas plant revealed that M. bourgensis MS2T almost completely comprises the genetic information of dominant methanogens present in the biogas reactor analyzed. Hence, availability of the M. bourgensis MS2T genome sequence may be valuable regarding further research addressing the performance of Methanoculleus species in agricultural biogas plants. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using microalgae biomass as feedstock for anaerobic digestion together with other biomasses (primary and secondary sludge) normally generated in WWTP. Raw microalgae biomass anaerobic biodegradability (33%) was higher than that of secondary sludge (23%). Thermal pretreatment enhanced 62% and 16% methane yield for Chlorella vulgaris and secondary sludge, respectively. When both substrates were codigested, methane yields remained low. On the other hand, primary sludge supported the highest anaerobic biodegradability (97%) and when combined with thermally pretreated C. vulgaris, methane yields were higher (13-17%) than the ones expected theoretically. Despite the high protein content of those substrates and the high nitrogen mineralization, no ammonia inhibition was detected. Thereby, this study showed that algae biomass is a potential cosubstrate for biogas production together with municipal wastewater sludge. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Large areas of land have been impacted by acidic mine drainage. These sites could potentially be re-vegetated for growing energy plants. Conventional phytoremediation method may fail because the pH of some mine drainage and contaminated soils can reach 2.0. Thus, it is necessary to screen acid-tolerant plants as pioneers to rehabilitate those severely acidified areas. Materials and methods: In the first phase of this study, seven levels of low pH media were used to estimate the acid-tolerant ranges of three plant species for 1 month. In the second phase, 50 commonly cultured plant species from 17 families, native in Guangdong Province of China or introduced from Australia, were evaluated for acid tolerance at three pH levels which were chosen based on results in the first phase. Results and discussion: We found that Acacia auriculiformis could survive and nodulate at pH ≥2.0, Acacia confusa and Melaleuca armillaris could survive at pH ≥2.5 but A. confusa nodulate at pH >3.5. In the second phase, 12 plant species, in addition to A. auriculiformis, can survive in pH 2.0 media. Conclusions: No family or genus commonality in acid tolerance was found. Two of these tolerant species, i.e., A. auriculiformis and Jatropha carcas, could potentially be planted as an economically and ecologically viable option for acid mine remediation due to their potential function as biofuel feedstock. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microalgae biofuel production has been extensively evaluated through resource, economic and life cycle assessments. Resource assessments consistently identify land as non-limiting and highlight the need to consider siting based on combined geographical constraints of land and other critical resources such as water and carbon dioxide. Economic assessments report a selling cost of fuel that ranges between $1.64 and over $30gal-1 consistent with large variability reported in the life cycle literature, -75 to 534gCO2-eqMJ-1. Large drivers behind such variability stem from differences in productivity assumptions, pathway technologies, and system boundaries. Productivity represents foundational units in these assessments with current assumed yields in various assessments varying by a factor of 60. A review of the literature in these areas highlights the need for harmonized assessments such that direct comparisons of alternative processing technologies can be made on the metrics of resource requirements, economic feasibility, and environmental impact. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, various methods including soxhlet, Bligh & Dyer (B&D), and ultrasonic-assisted B&D were investigated for the extraction of lipid from algal species Chlorella vulgaris. Relative polarity/water content and impolar per polar ratios of solvents were considered to optimize the relative proportions of each triplicate agent by applying the response surface method (RSM). It was found that for soxhlet, hexane-methanol (54-46%, respectively) with total lipid extraction of 14.65% and chloroform-methanol (54-46%, respectively) with the extraction of 19.87% lipid were the best set of triplicate where further addition of acetone to the first group and ethanol to the second group did not contributed to further extraction. In B&D, however, chloroform-methanol-water (50%-35%-15%, respectively) reached the all-time maximum of 24%. Osmotic shock as well as ultrasonication contributed to 3.52% of further extraction, which is considered to promote the total yield up to almost 15%. From the growth data and fatty acid analysis, the applied method was assessed to be appropriate for biodiesel production with regard to selectivity and extraction yield. © 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - An expected global increase in bioenergy-crop cultivation as an alternative to fossil fuels will have consequences on both global climate and local air quality through changes in biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced through the substitution of next-generation bioenergy crops such as eucalyptus, giant reed, and switchgrass for fossil fuels, the choice of species has important ramifications for human health, potentially reducing the benefits of conversion due to increases in ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels as a result of large changes in biogenic emissions. Using the Community Earth System Model we simulate the conversion of marginal and underutilized croplands worldwide to bioenergy crops under varying future anthropogenic emissions scenarios. A conservative global replacement using high VOC-emitting crop profiles leads to modeled population-weighted O3 increases of 5-27 ppb in India, 1-9 ppb in China, and 1-6 ppb in the United States, with peak PM2.5 increases of up to 2 μg m-3. We present a metric for the regional evaluation of candidate bioenergy crops, as well as results for the application of this metric to four representative emissions profiles using four replacement scales (10-100% maximum estimated available land). Finally, we assess the total health and climate impacts of biogenic emissions, finding that the negative consequences of using high-emitting crops could exceed 50% of the positive benefits of reduced fossil fuel emissions in value. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sorghum is a staple food for half a billion people and, through growth on marginal land with minimal inputs, is an important source of feed, forage and increasingly, biofuel feedstock. Here we present information about non-cellulosic cell wall polysaccharides in a diverse set of cultivated and wild Sorghum bicolor grains. Sorghum grain contains predominantly starch (64-76%) but is relatively deficient in other polysaccharides present in wheat, oats and barley. Despite overall low quantities, sorghum germplasm exhibited a remarkable range in polysaccharide amount and structure. Total (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan ranged from 0.06 to 0.43% (w/w) whilst internal cellotriose:cellotetraose ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.9:1. Arabinoxylan amounts fell between 1.5 and 3.6% (w/w) and the arabinose:xylose ratio, denoting arabinoxylan structure, ranged from 0.95 to 1.35. The distribution of these and other cell wall polysaccharides varied across grain tissues as assessed by electron microscopy. When ten genotypes were tested across five environmental sites, genotype (G) was the dominant source of variation for both (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan and arabinoxylan content (69-74%), with environment (E) responsible for 5-14%. There was a small G×E effect for both polysaccharides. This study defines the amount and spatial distribution of polysaccharides and reveals a significant genetic influence on cell wall composition in sorghum grain. © 2015 .

AB  - Black carbon (BC), composed of char and soot, is an important component of soil organic carbon (SOC), and these materials are potentially important for the global carbon cycle and global climate. A thermal-optical reflectance method was used to determine the spatial patterns of SOC, BC, char and soot in nine soil types collected from 152 sites in the Qinghai Lake catchment. All of the analytes showed large spatial variability: SOC, BC and char were most abundant in bog soils and least abundant in aeolian soils, while soot concentrations in alpine frost desert and in aeolian soils were about half of those in the other soils. The average BC concentration in the 0-20-cm soil layers was 1.3gkg-1, and BC amounted to 5.6% of the SOC. Char, SOC and BC all decreased with soil depth, but soot showed little variation. The proportions of BC to SOC and char to BC showed contrasting trends in four soil profiles; the former increased and the latter decreased with depth. The quantity of SOC sequestered in topsoils of the catchment area was estimated to be 191Tg; BC accounted for approximately 4.8% of this, and char made up approximately 85% of the total BC stock. The burning of animal dung for domestic cooking apparently was an important source of soil BC: combustion of other biofuels and fossil fuels was the other main source. © 2015 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Summary Microalgae are emerging platforms for production of a suite of compounds targeting several markets, including food, nutraceuticals, green chemicals, and biofuels. Many of these products, such as biodiesel or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), derive from lipid metabolism. A general picture of lipid metabolism in microalgae has been deduced from well characterized pathways of fungi and land plants, but recent advances in molecular and genetic analyses of microalgae have uncovered unique features, pointing out the necessity to study lipid metabolism in microalgae themselves. In the past 10 years, in addition to its traditional role as a model for photosynthetic and flagellar motility processes, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has emerged as a model organism to study lipid metabolism in green microalgae. Here, after summarizing data on total fatty acid composition, distribution of acyl-lipid classes, and major acyl-lipid molecular species found in C. reinhardtii, we review the current knowledge on the known or putative steps for fatty acid synthesis, glycerolipid desaturation and assembly, membrane lipid turnover, and oil remobilization. A list of characterized or putative enzymes for the major steps of acyl-lipid metabolism in C. reinhardtii is included, and subcellular localizations and phenotypes of associated mutants are discussed. Biogenesis and composition of Chlamydomonas lipid droplets and the potential importance of lipolytic processes in increasing cellular oil content are also highlighted. Significance Statement Increasing societal and economic pressure for finding alternative fuels has pushed microalgal biofuel to the spotlight of both academic and industrial research. The need to improve oil yields begs for more basic research on lipid metabolism in microalgal cells. We summarize here 40 years of research on lipids in the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Summary Developing renewable energy sources is critical to maintaining the economic growth of the planet while protecting the environment. First generation biofuels focused on food crops like corn and sugarcane for ethanol production, and soybean and palm for biodiesel production. Second generation biofuels based on cellulosic ethanol produced from terrestrial plants, has received extensive funding and recently pilot facilities have been commissioned, but to date output of fuels from these sources has fallen well short of what is needed. Recent research and pilot demonstrations have highlighted the potential of algae as one of the most promising sources of sustainable liquid transportation fuels. Algae have also been established as unique biofactories for industrial, therapeutic, and nutraceutical co-products. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii's long established role in the field of basic research in green algae has paved the way for understanding algal metabolism and developing genetic engineering protocols. These tools are now being utilized in C. reinhardtii and in other algal species for the development of strains to maximize biofuels and bio-products yields from the lab to the field. Significance Statement The use of photosynthetic microorganisms to produce valuable products is increasing. Creating designed for purpose green algae will be a significant part of this new photosynthetic bio-manufacturing platform. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Stream buffers increase the complexity of agroecosystems, providing wildlife habitat, sediment and nutrient sinks to improve water quality, and potentially lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels. The establishment of stream buffers can be difficult, with weeds competing with desired species and increasing weed pressure in the production fields and contaminating feedstocks. Our objective was to evaluate the success of establishing two different feedstock alternatives, alfalfa (ALF; Medicago sativa L., cultivar Ladak) and tall wheatgrass (TWG; Agropyron elongatum Podp., cultivar Alkar), plus a mix of alfalfa and tall wheatgrass (MIX) at two sites within each of three precipitation zones in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). We evaluated productivity, stand establishment, and weed infestation using a split plot, randomized complete block design. Establishment of targeted species was most successful and productivity was highest in the intermediate precipitation zone. Lignocellulosic feedstock produced by TWG (7.52 ± 2.07 Mg ha-1 [3.35 ± 0.92 tn ac-1]) and MIX (7.45 ± 2.00 Mg ha-1 [3.32 ± 0.89 tn ac-1]) produced significantly more lignocellulosic feedstock than ALF (1.68 ± 0.79 Mg ha-1 [0.75 ± 0.35 tn ac-1]) and SG (2.62 ± 0.99 Mg ha-1 [1.17 ± 0.44 tn ac-1]). The best competition against invasive annual species was obtained in the TWG and MIX treatments, with tall wheatgrass providing the bulk of biomass in either treatment. Productivity was acceptable where naturally occurring subirrigation was present and contributed to crop germination and establishment in the low precipitation zone, but weed pressure was substantial and caused near to complete crop failure in the driest plots. A high level of weed management will be required to produce monocultures of lignocellulosic feedstocks in stream buffers.

AB  - The paper analyzes biodiesel chains of rapeseed (Brassica napus) and carinata (Brassica carinata) cultivated in Central and Southern Italy, assessing the impact on Global Warming Potential by means of the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The production chains differed in use of the oilcake, as animal feed for rapeseed and as biofumigant for B. carinata. The allocation of emissions across co-products was first calculated on the basis of their energy content according to the criterion proposed by European Commission for biofuel production. The resulting impacts were then compared to those obtained through the substitution approach (system expansion method), which considers emissions that are saved by replacing the equivalent conventional product with co-product bio-based materials i.e. soybean meals, nematicidal fumigants, fertilizers and glycerol. The results showed that this method is sensitive to pointing out the importance of the valorization of co-products to the sustainability of bioenergy supply chain. Among the different options taken into consideration, in the case of the B. carinata biodiesel chain, the substitution of conventional fumigants and fertilizers with biofumigants and amendments is able to determine a global net saving of 134 g CO2eq per MJ of biodiesel, reversing the sustainability assessment obtained through the energy allocation method. Overall, the results suggest that, when planning future biorefineries, environmental assessment should take the substitution approach into account in order for valorization of co-products and diversification of processes to be rewarded. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Excessive water usage and CO2 emissions resulting from industrial systems and processes have significantly raised environmental concerns. Although biofuels help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, the biofuel industry itself consumes a considerable amount of water and produces CO2 emissions during ethanol production. In this paper, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) capacitated lot-sizing model for analyzing the economic and environmental feasibility of ethanol production using multiple biomass sources. The model minimizes the cost of ethanol production while penalizing its possible adverse environmental impacts such as CO2 emissions and excessive water usage. The overall cost of ethanol production includes production, setup, and inventory holding costs with penalties for environmental impacts minus the income from ethanol tax credits and electricity generated from waste heat. We perform a sensitivity analysis and analyze results to improve our understanding of the economic viability of ethanol production and associated environmental effects. Results show that switchgrass is the most profitable and preferred biomass type when there is an unlimited supply of all biomass sources, while wheat and corn become more preferable in the case of a limited biomass supply. Compared to low- and medium-demand cases, when there is high demand, total costs increase significantly due to multiple production setup costs, excessive water usage, and CO2 emissions under limited biomass supply. The solution of the proposed model also indicates that if ongoing technology investments in the conversion rate succeed, the total cost of ethanol production can decrease by up to 21 percent. Finally, results show that the proposed MILP model provides valuable insights and strategies for future investors, decision-makers, and the government to achieve sustainable and economically viable biofuel production using various biomass types. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To mitigate climate change and to ensure energy security, society is searching for alternatives to fossil fuels. Biomass is an interesting renewable resource, because it can be used both as energy and as feedstock for material and chemical production. The aim of this article is to present the environmental impacts associated with products from a biorefinery in Norway (Borregaard). More specifically, the article shows results from studies on the products ethanol 96%, ethanol 99%, cellulose, liquid lignin, lignin powder and vanillin, and identifies the processes which contribute most in each impact category and product. Comparative emissions are also shown for at least one product alternative. The study has been carried out using the life cycle assessment method from "cradle to gate". The functional unit is 1 tonne product for cellulose, lignin and vanillin and 1 m3 product for ethanol. All of the products are based on the same raw materials (timber and wood chips). The infrastructure of the biorefinery has been included. The study has, as far as possible, avoided allocation by analysing and modelling the processes at a detailed level. Where necessary, energy allocation, using dry weight energy content, has been applied. Climate change, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical ozone creation, ozone depletion and cumulative energy demand have been selected as environmental impact categories. Different processes relating to the biorefinery have significance for the various environmental impact categories. This has made it difficult to single out the processes to be studied further. Oil combustion is the most important process in relation to climate change. Infrastructure is not important for either impact category. The global warming potential for bioethanol from Borregaard is in the lower range when compared with earlier studies. To conclude, this article demonstrates that the biofuel under study is, even at worst, comparable to that produced using other bioethanol production processes. The other products are also substitutes for fossil derived chemicals, but as the available literature lacks data for such chemicals, the environmental profiles for these have not been compared. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Whether allegiance to party or the preferences of constituents are most important in an elected representative's voting decision has been a long-running question in political science. This study contributes to this debate through an evaluation of biofuels policy in the U.S. Congress. Results indicate that in this policy area the House and Senate balance these influences differently, with partisanship playing a significant role in the House but not in the Senate. Analysis of voting on this issue indicates that there are important distinctions between how a legislator views the overall partisan preferences of constituents in their district or state versus how they view the interests of particular groups of constituents; when the concentration of agricultural interests in a legislator's district or state is great enough, it can override the effects of party for this issue, which suggests that legislators are especially concerned with specific constituency groups in their district or state that would stand to gain or lose from a policy. The proposition that a legislator is most likely to do that which benefits him or her most regardless of the available science relevant to a policy is a useful starting point for understanding what has been found in this research project. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - We analyze the economic impacts of policies supporting biodiesel production in Colombia, such as subsidies and mandates for compulsory fuel mixtures. In the major biodiesel source being palm oil, we seek to establish the impact of these policies on oil palm producer incomes, prices and production levels of crude palm oil (CPO) and biodiesel, as well as the impacts on demand for land for oil palm plantation expansion. We also calculate the so-called “deadweight costs”, to account for the social costs derived from the inefficiencies of government interventions in the biodiesel markets. The analysis is done using a partial equilibrium models for the two interrelated sectors, the production of palm oil and biodiesel, and the demand for new land needed to cope with the additional palm oil needed. The model was calibrated for 2009 to simulate for the 2010–2020 period. The results of the simulations reveal that the subsidies alone are themselves not effective tools to achieve the government objectives defined in the Biofuels Program in Colombia. Subsidies need to be complemented by increased blending mandates to ensure that palm cultivation and production of biodiesel investments are profitable enough that producers would bet on such business. Additionally, we find that producers of palm oil benefit most from subsidies in the short term; however, in the long-term it is the biodiesel entrepreneurs who will appropriate the larger share of growth revenue of the entire production chain. The social costs of the Biofuels Program are small in the short term, and represent only between 0.2% and 0.7% of the tax expenditure. However, in the long term they would become significant, and would account for around 4.1% to 6.1% of the tax payers' expense. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cellulase produced from the marine fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum through solid state fermentation (SSF) was investigated for its saccharification potential of seaweed biomass using the common green seaweed Ulva fasciata. The seaweed substrate, containing inoculated fungus with 60% moisture content, cultured at 25 °C and pH 4 for four days, showed optimum enzyme production. The enzyme, assayed for carboxymethyl cellulase and filter paper assay, showed an activity of 10.20 ± 0.40 U/g and 9.60 ± 0.64 U/g on a dry weight basis, respectively. Further, ionic liquid tolerance of the enzyme was studied in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium trifluromethanesulfonate. At 10% v/v concentration, the enzyme retained 72.17 to 85.04% activity in all the ionic liquids. The pre-incubation of enzyme in the same ionic liquids for 24 h, the activity got slightly enhanced and ranged between 73.80 and 93.70%. The hydrolysis of U. fasciata feedstock with enzyme (10. U/g) for 24 h at 40 °C and pH 4 gave maximum yield of sugar 112 ± 10 mg/g dry weight. On fermentation, an ethanol yield of 0.47 g/g reducing sugar was obtained, corresponding to 93.81% conversion efficiency. These findings indicate that cellulase produced from a marine fungus can be employed for saccharification of cellulosic feedstock for the production of renewable biofuels from marine macroalgal feedstock. Since bioethanol yields obtained compare very favorably with those from land crops, the strategy employed in this study warrants further exploration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pseudochoricystis ellipsoidea MBIC 11204 is a unicellular green alga that accumulates, under certain stress conditions, lipids consisting primarily of triacylglycerols. The spread of P. ellipsoidea cells from an outdoor raceway pond into the surrounding area was investigated over 35 days by detecting the psbA gene of this alga in water-containing vessels installed at variable distances (between 0 and 150 m) from the raceway pond. psbA was detected even in vessels placed 150 m apart, demonstrating the ability of P. ellipsoidea to spread via wind. Based on this finding, we evaluated the survival and growth of P. ellipsoidea in various environmental water samples. P. ellipsoidea grew well in water containing > 2 mg/L nitrate, but growth was not observed in water containing 3 mg/L of ammonia if the nitrate concentration was < 1 mg/L. The addition of nitrate to produce the final concentration of 3 mg/L improved the growth, demonstrating that nitrate is the growth-limiting nutrient in these water samples. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2009, the European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive (RED) mandated that 20% of the EU's final energy consumption consist of renewable sources by 2020, and included sustainability criteria for liquid biofuels. Discussions around extending criteria to solid and gaseous biomass, including wood pellets, have been ongoing. Continued investment in forest bioenergy feedstock production is partly dependent on the stability of global market demand and the economic viability of feedstock production and trade. For trans-boundary governance mechanisms such as the RED to be efficient, a proper assessment of the specific forest and land policy contexts of wood pellet exporters that the mechanism will affect, such as Canada, the USA, and Russia, is crucial. This paper builds on sustainability criteria for biodiversity protection and assurance of sustainable forest management (SFM) for woody biomass that are currently under discussion for inclusion in the RED and compares them with national and local regulations of those three countries. This illustrates potential challenges in the establishment of sustainability criteria related to: differences in land definitions, delineation and reporting systems; lack of a uniform definitional paradigm for SFM; and difficulties in establishing efficient monitoring/auditing systems. Regulators wanting to implement supra-national sustainability schemes such as the EU RED need to be aware of challenges that such schemes carry and make efforts to reduce or eliminate pitfalls. There is also a need to assess the aggregated effects of these various tools, and a need for communication, collaboration and outreach among stakeholders. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The potential for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to be utilized for biofuel production was strengthened by developing it for growth in elevated salinity via the selective breeding method of genome shuffling. A population was constructed via random mutagenesis and subjected to multiple rounds of sex and growth in increasing salinity. This sexual line was capable of growth in up to 700. mM NaCl, unlike its progenitor, which could only grow in 300. mM NaCl. An asexual control line was capable of growth in 500. mM NaCl. Palmelloid aggregations increased in size and the concentration of final biomass decreased as a function of NaCl concentration, which poses considerations for future strain development. The sexual line maintained sexual efficiencies of up to 50% over the course of selection. This investigation achieved significant strain improvement of C. reinhardtii and demonstrated the clear advantage of its ability to participate in laboratory controlled and reproducible high efficiency sex. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We analyze the economic and emissions impacts on U.S. commercial aviation of the Federal Aviation Administration's renewable jet fuel goal when met using advanced fermentation (AF) fuel from perennial grasses. These fuels have recently been certified for use in aircraft and could potentially provide greater environmental benefits than aviation biofuels approved previously. Due to uncertainties in the commercialization of AF technologies, we consider a range of assumptions concerning capital costs, energy conversion efficiencies and product slates. In 2030, estimates of the implicit subsidy required to induce consumption of AF jet fuel range from $0.45 to $20.85 per gallon. These correspond to a reference jet fuel price of $3.23 per gallon and AF jet fuel costs ranging from $4.01 to $24.41 per gallon. In all cases, as renewable jet fuel represents around 1.4% of total fuel consumed by commercial aviation, the goal has a small impact on aviation operations and emissions relative to a case without the renewable jet fuel target, and emissions continue to grow relative to those in 2005. Costs per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent abated by using biofuels range from $42 to $652. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Some recent accidents involving the bioenergy production and feedstock supply chain raised concern on the safety of such technologies. A survey of major accidents related to the production of bioenergy (intended as biomass, bioliquids/biofuels and biogas) was carried out, and a data repository was built, based on past accident reports available in the open literature and in specific databases. Data analysis shows that major accidents are increasing in recent years and their number is growing faster than bioenergy production. The results obtained represent an early warning concerning the major accident hazard of bioenergies, and suggest the importance of risk awareness and safety culture in bioenergy production, in the perspective of a safe and sustainable exploitation of renewable resources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of crop residues for bioenergy production needs to be carefully assessed because of the potential negative impact on the level of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The impact varies with environmental conditions and crop management practices and needs to be considered when harvesting the residue for bioenergy productions. Here, we defined the sustainable harvest limits as the maximum rates that do not diminish SOC and quantified sustainable harvest limits for wheat residue across Australia's agricultural lands. We divided the study area into 9432 climate-soil (CS) units and simulated the dynamics of SOC in a continuous wheat cropping system over 122 years (1889 - 2010) using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). We simulated management practices including six fertilization rates (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1) and five residue harvest rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%). We mapped the sustainable limits for each fertilization rate and assessed the effects of fertilization and three key environmental variables - initial SOC, temperature, and precipitation - on sustainable residue harvest rates. We found that, with up to 75 kg N ha-1 fertilization, up to 75% and 50% of crop residue could be sustainably harvested in south-western and south-eastern Australia, respectively. Higher fertilization rates achieved little further increase in sustainable residue harvest rates. Sustainable residue harvest rates were principally determined by climate and soil conditions, especially the initial SOC content and temperature. We conclude that environmental conditions and management practices should be considered to guide the harvest of crop residue for bioenergy production and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions during the life cycle of bioenergy production. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The airline industry has a strong interest in developing sustainable aviation fuels, in order to reduce their exposure to increasing oil prices and cost liability for greenhouse gas emissions. The feasibility and cost of producing sustainable biomass-based jet fuels at a sufficient scale to materially address these issues is an enormous challenge. This paper builds directly on the biophysical study by H.T. Murphy, D.A. O'Connell, R.J. Raison, A.C. Warden, T.H. Booth, A. Herr, A.L. Braid, D.F. Crawford, J.A. Hayward, T. Javonovic, J.G. McIvor, M.H. O'Connor, M.L. Poole, D. Prestwidge, N. Raisbeck-Brown &amp; L. Rye, In review, which examined a 25 year scale-up strategy to produce 5% of projected jet fuel demand in Australia in 2020 (470 mL) in the Fitzroy region of Queensland, Australia. The strategy was based on the use of a mixed ligno-cellulosic biomass feedstock and assumed, for the sake of exploring and quantifying the scenario, a simplified two-step conversion process - conversion of biomass to crude bio-oil within the region, and upgrade to jet fuel at a central Brisbane facility. This paper provides details on the costs of production in this scenario, focusing on two different strategies for biomass utilization, and two types of novel small-medium scale conversion technologies. The cost analyses have taken into account technology learning curves, different economies of scale and key cost sensitivities. The cost of biomass-based jet fuels is estimated to be between 0.70 and 1.90 $ L-1 when the efficiency of conversion of biomass to biocrude and subsequently to aviation fuel is varied by ±10% of published values, with an average value of 1.10 $ L-1. This is within the range of the projected 2035 conventional jet fuel price of 1.50 $ L-1. Therefore, biomass-based jet fuel has the potential to contribute to supply of Australia's jet fuel needs in the future. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Understanding and predicting the effects of land-use change to short rotation forestry (SRF) on soil carbon (C) is an important requirement for fully assessing the C mitigation potential of SRF as a bioenergy crop. There is little current knowledge of SRF in the UK and in particular a lack of consistent measured data sets on the direct impacts of land use change on soil C stocks. The ECOSSE model was developed to simulate soil C dynamics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in mineral and organic soils. The ECOSSE model has already been applied spatially to simulate land-use change impacts on soil C and GHG emissions. However, it has not been extensively evaluated under SRF. Eleven sites comprising 29 transitions in Britain, representing land-use change from nonwoodland land uses to SRF, were selected to evaluate the performance of ECOSSE in predicting soil C and soil C change in SRF plantations. The modelled C under SRF showed a strong correlation with the soil C measurements at both 0-30 cm (R = 0.93) and 0-100 cm soil depth (R = 0.82). As for the SRF plots, the soil C at the reference sites have been accurately simulated by the model. The extremely high correlation for the reference fields (R ≥ 0.99) shows a good performance of the model spin-up. The statistical analysis of the model performance to simulate soil C and soil C changes after land-use change to SRF highlighted the absence of significant error between modelled and measured values as well as the absence of significant bias in the model. Overall, this evaluation reinforces previous studies on the ability of ECOSSE to simulate soil C and emphasize its accuracy to simulate soil C under SRF plantations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We compare two types of fuel market regulations - a renewable fuel mandate and a fuel emission standard - that could be employed to simultaneously achieve multiple outcomes such as reduction in fuel prices, fuel imports and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We compare these two types of regulations in a global context taking into account heterogeneity in carbon content of both fossil fuels and renewable fuels. We find that although neither the ethanol mandate nor the emission standard is certain to reduce emissions relative to a business-as-usual baseline, at any given level of biofuel consumption in the policy region, a mandate, relative to an emission standard, results in higher GHG emissions, smaller expenditure on fuel imports, lower price of ethanol-blended gasoline and higher domestic fuel market surplus. This result holds over a wide range of values of model parameters. We also discuss the implications of this result to a regulation such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard given recent developments within the US such as increase in shale and tight oil production and large increase in average vehicle fuel economy of the automotive fleet. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable production of lignocellulosic biofuels requires a sufficient supply of biomass feedstocks. Agave and Opuntia represent highly water-use efficient bioenergy crops that are suitable for expanding feedstock production into semi-arid marginal lands. These feedstocks have garnered interest as dedicated biofuel feedstocks because of their high water- and fertilizer-use efficiency and not competing with major food crops or conventional biofuel feedstocks. To better understand the potential of these feedstocks, the biomass composition of Agave tequilana and Opuntia ficus-indica was analyzed. Previous extraction procedures and analytical methods have led to variable estimates of the chemical compositions of the biomass of these species. Therefore, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) standard methods were used in the present study. A. tequilana showed higher mass fractions of water-soluble constituents, structural carbohydrates, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin than O. ficus-indica. In contrast, O. ficus-indica had higher protein, water, and ash mass fractions than A. tequilana. Both species had lower lignin mass fractions, thus yielding lower heating values, but had higher water and ash mass fractions than most woody biomass feedstocks. The high water mass fractions of these species (85-94%) could prove advantageous for biomass deconstruction and aqueous phase catalytic conversion processes as less exogenous water inputs would be needed. Lastly, solid-state NMR analysis revealed that both A. tequilana and O. ficus-indica had high amorphous and para-crystalline cellulose mass fractions (>80%), indicating that these biomass feedstocks would be far less recalcitrant to deconstruction than traditional lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture is the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in the stream systems of the Corn Belt region in the Midwestern US. This region is comprised of two large river basins, the intensely row-cropped Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which are considered the key contributing areas for the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, in this area it is of utmost importance to ensure that intensive agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production can coexist with a healthy water environment. To address these objectives within a river basin management context, an integrated modeling system has been constructed with the hydrologic Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, capable of estimating river basin responses to alternative cropping and/or management strategies. To improve modeling performance compared to previous studies and provide a spatially detailed basis for scenario development, this SWAT Corn Belt application incorporates a greatly refined subwatershed structure based on 12-digit hydrologic units or 'subwatersheds' as defined by the US Geological Service. The model setup, calibration and validation are time-demanding and challenging tasks for these large systems, given the scale intensive data requirements, and the need to ensure the reliability of flow and pollutant load predictions at multiple locations. Thus, the objectives of this study are both to comprehensively describe this large-scale modeling approach, providing estimates of pollution and crop production in the region as well as to present strengths and weaknesses of integrated modeling at such a large scale along with how it can be improved on the basis of the current modeling structure and results. The predictions were based on a semi-automatic hydrologic calibration approach for large-scale and spatially detailed modeling studies, with the use of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) and the SWAT-CUP interface, followed by a manual water quality calibration on a monthly basis. The refined modeling approach developed in this study led to successful predictions across most parts of the Corn Belt region and can be used for testing pollution mitigation measures and agricultural economic scenarios, providing useful information to policy makers and recommendations on similar efforts at the regional scale. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The primary alternative to petroleum-based fuels is ethanol, which may be blended with gasoline in the United States at concentrations up to 15% for most automobiles. Efforts to increase the amount of ethanol in gasoline have prompted concerns about the potential toxicity of inhaled ethanol vapors from these fuels. The well-known sensitivity of the developing nervous and immune systems to ingested ethanol and the lack of information about the neurodevelopmental toxicity of ethanol-blended fuels prompted the present work. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were exposed for 6.5. h/day on days 9-20 of gestation to clean air or vapors of gasoline containing no ethanol (E0) or gasoline blended with 15% ethanol (E15) or 85% ethanol (E85) at nominal concentrations of 3000, 6000, or 9000. ppm. Estimated maternal peak blood ethanol concentrations were less than 5. mg/dL for all exposures. No overt toxicity in the dams was observed, although pregnant dams exposed to 9000. ppm of E0 or E85 gained more weight per gram of food consumed during the 12. days of exposure than did controls. Fuel vapors did not affect litter size or weight, or postnatal weight gain in the offspring. Tests of motor activity and a functional observational battery (FOB) administered to the offspring between post-natal day (PND) 27-29 and PND 56-63 revealed an increase in vertical activity counts in the 3000- and 9000-ppm groups in the E85 experiment on PND 63 and a few small changes in sensorimotor responses in the FOB that were not monotonically related to exposure concentration in any experiment. Neither cell-mediated nor humoral immunity were affected in a concentration-related manner by exposure to any of the vapors in 6-week-old male or female offspring. Systematic concentration-related differences in systolic blood pressure were not observed in rats tested at 3 and 6. months of age in any experiment. No systematic differences were observed in serum glucose or glycated hemoglobin A1c (a marker of long-term glucose homeostasis). These observations suggest a LOEL of 3000. ppm of E85 for vertical activity, LOELs of 9000. ppm of E0 and E85 for maternal food consumption, and NOELs of 9000. ppm for the other endpoints reported here. The ethanol content of the vapors did not consistently alter the pattern of behavioral, immunological, or physiological responses to the fuel vapors. The concentrations of the vapors used here exceed by 4-6 orders of magnitude typical exposure levels encountered by the public. © 2015.

AB  - In the present paper we use the output of multiple expert elicitation surveys on the future cost of key low-carbon technologies and use it as input of three Integrated Assessment models, GCAM, MARKAL_US and WITCH. By means of a large set of simulations we aim to assess the implications of these subjective distributions of technological costs over key model outputs. We are able to detect what sources of technology uncertainty are more influential, how this differs across models, and whether and how results are affected by the time horizon, the metric considered or the stringency of the climate policy. In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions. Climate-constrained scenarios, stress the relevance, in addition to that of nuclear energy, of biofuels, as they represent the main source of decarbonization of the transportation sector and bioenergy, since the latter can be coupled with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to produce negative emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use change can have significant impacts on soil and aboveground carbon (C) stocks and there is a clear need to identify sustainable land uses which maximize C mitigation potential. Land-use transitions from agricultural to bioenergy crops are increasingly common in Europe with one option being Short Rotation Forestry (SRF). Research on the impact on C stocks of the establishment of SRF is limited, but given the potential for this bioenergy crop in temperate climates, there is an evident knowledge gap. Here, we examine changes in soil C stock following the establishment of SRF using combined short (30 cm depth) and deep (1 m depth) soil cores at 11 sites representing 29 transitions from agriculture to SRF. We compare the effects of tree species including 9 coniferous, 16 broadleaved and 4 Eucalyptus transitions. SRF aboveground and root biomass were also estimated in 15 of the transitions using tree mensuration data allowing assessments of changes in total ecosystem C stock. Planting coniferous SRF, compared to broadleaved and Eucalyptus SRF, resulted in greater accumulation of litter and overall increased soil C stock relative to agricultural controls. Though broadleaved SRF had no overall effect on soil C stock, it showed the most variable response suggesting species-specific effects and interactions with soil types. While Eucalyptus transitions induced a reduction in soil C stocks, this was not significant unless considered on a soil mass basis. Given the relatively young age and limited number of Eucalyptus plantations, it is not possible to say whether this reduction will persist in older stands. Combining estimates of C stocks from different ecosystem components (e.g., soil, aboveground biomass) reinforced the accumulation of C under coniferous SRF, and indicates generally positive effects of SRF on whole-ecosystem C. These results fill an important knowledge gap and provide data for modelling of future scenarios of LUC. © 2014 NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.

AB  - Indirect land-use changes (iLUC) have challenged the rationale of decarbonising the transport of the European Union (EU) through biofuels. As a contribution to existing literature, I map the groups of actors connected with the EU's biofuel development through a cluster analysis and, further, examine their opinions about how iLUC should be governed. My analysis does not only reveal the heterogeneous interpretations of iLUC and its governance. It also illustrates how the iLUC directive proposal of the European Commission has two challenges related to making successful climate policy integration in a globally operating, multi-scalar assemblage of actors. Firstly, the scientific basis of policy-formulation was called into question when the actors explicated the limitations of the iLUC models by utilising their distinctive situated knowledge of iLUC. Secondly, the instruments that were proposed in the directive do not recognise how iLUC impacts could dampen through developing land-use practices, which was not a majority view within the actors of the European biofuel assemblage. I end this article by suggesting that acknowledging actors' capacity to influence the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originating from land-use changes might mitigate the tensions between the EU's climate policy targets and those affected by such policies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, n-butanol (nB) was used as the common solvent and crude canola (Cn), soybean (Sb), sunflower (Sf), corn (Cr), olive (Ol), and hazelnut oil (Hn) as the vegetable oil components were used for making microemulsification of diesel fuel (D)-vegetable oil blends. The blend ratios of 70% vol. D, 20% vol. vegetable oil and 10% vol. nB were determined to increase concentration of biofuels in ternary blends. Six different ternary blends were prepared via the splash blending method. Engine performance tests of the ternary blends were carried out on a four-cylinder, four-cycle turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine at full load with various engine speeds. Test fuels were kept stationary at ambient temperature and the long-term stabilities were observed at 60days. There were not any phase separations in the ternary blends. Fuel properties of the test fuels were examined and determined to be in agreement with the fuel standards. According to engine performance test results of the ternary blends, brake torque, brake power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and exhaust gas temperatures decreased while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased as compared to those of diesel fuel. In terms of basic exhaust gas emissions, ternary blends increased nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions while reducing hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as compared to diesel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is still not proven that treatment of sewage in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is (in every case) environmentally friendly. To address this matter, we have applied a state-of-the-art life cycle assessment (LCA) to an energy self-sufficient WWTP in Strass (Austria), its supply chain and the valorization of its 'products': produced electricity out of biogas from sludge digestion and the associated stabilized digestate, applied as agricultural fertilizer. Prominent aspects of our study are: a holistic environmental impact assessment, measurement of greenhouse gas emissions (including N2O), and accounting for infrastructure, replacement of conventional fertilizers and toxicity of metals present in the stabilized digestate. Additionally, the environmental sustainability improvement by implementing one-stage partial nitritation/anammox (e.g. DEMON®) and co-digestion was also assessed. DEMON on the digesters reject water leads to a considerable saving of natural resources compared to nitritiation/denitritation (about 33% of the life cycle resource input), this through the lowering of sludge consumption for N-removal, and thus increasing electricity production via a higher sludge excess. However, its N2O emission could be restrained through further optimization as it represents a large share (30-66%) of the plants' damaging effect on human health, this through climate change. The co-substrate addition to the digester resulted in no significant improvement of the digestion process but induced net electricity generation. If respective amounts of conventional fertilizers are replaced, the land application of the stabilized digestate is environmentally friendly through prevention of natural resource consumption and diversity loss, but possibly not regarding human health impact due the presence of toxic heavy metals, mainly Zn, in the digestate. The outcomes show that the complete life cycle results in a prevention of resource extraction from nature and a potential mitigation of diversity loss (though for some impact categories no quantification of associated diversity loss is possible) but it also leads to a damaging effect on human health, mainly via climate change and heavy metal toxicity. Since it is for now impossible to aggregate the impact to these different aspects in a sound manner, it is not yet possible to consider in this case the studied system as environmentally friendly. Generally, the field of LCA needs further development to present a better and single outcome. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata L.) has the potential to be a feedstock for bioethanol. It is native to North America, and has extensive genetic diversity. Eleven natural populations of prairie cordgrass harvested in 2011 and 2012 were studied. Compositions of the samples showed significant differences within the same year, and between the two years. Two highest, one medium and two lowest glucan concentration samples from each year were selected to evaluate ethanol yield after dilute acid pretreatment and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae SR8 that can ferment both glucose and xylose. Up to 88% of theoretical ethanol yields were achieved. Our research demonstrates the potential of prairie cordgrass as a dedicated energy crop with ethanol yields of 205.0-275.6. g/kg biomass and 1748-4368. L/ha, depending on feedstock composition and biomass yield. These ethanol yields are comparable with those of switchgrass, corn stover and bagasse. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the costs, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the biomass supply chain for large scale biofuel production. Two types of energy crop were considered, switchgrass and loblolly pine, as representative of herbaceous and woody biomass. A biomass logistics model has been developed to estimate the feedstock supply system from biomass production through transportation. Biomass in the form of woodchip, bale and pellet was investigated with road, railway and waterway transportation options. Our analysis indicated that the farm or forest gate cost is lowest for loblolly pine whole tree woodchip at $39.7/dry tonne and highest for switchgrass round bale at $72.3/dry tonne. Switchgrass farm gate GHG emissions is approximately 146kgCO2e/dry tonne, about 4 times higher than loblolly pine. The optimum biomass transportation mode and delivered form are determined by the tradeoff between fixed and variable costs for feedstock shipment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L.) is a potential renewable source of carbohydrates for use in microbial conversion to biofuels. Xylan comprises approximately 30% of the switchgrass cell wall. To understand the limitations of commercial enzyme mixtures, alkali-extracted, isolated switchgrass xylan was hydrolyzed by the action of two commercial enzyme cocktails, in the presence and absence of an additional α-arabinofuranosidase enzyme. The two most abundant enzymatic digestion products from each commercial enzyme treatment were separated and characterized by LC-MSn, linkage analysis, and NMR. The most abundant oligosaccharide from each commercial cocktail was susceptible to hydrolysis when supplemented with a GH62 α-arabinofuranosidase enzyme; further characterization confirmed the presence of (1→3)-α-arabinose linkages. These results demonstrate the lack of the required selectivity for arabinose-containing substrates in the commercial enzyme preparations tested. One product from each condition remained intact and was found to contain (1→2)-β-xylose-(1→3)-α-arabinose side chains; this linkage acts as a source of oligosaccharide recalcitrance. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cellulose synthase, encoded by the cesA gene, is responsible for the synthesis of cellulose in nature. We show that the cell wall of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 naturally contains cellulose. Cellulose occurs as a possibly laminated layer between the inner and outer membrane, as well as being an important component of the extracellular glycocalyx in this cyanobacterium. Overexpression of six genes, cmc-ccp-cesAB-cesC-cesD-bgl, from Gluconacetobacter xylinus in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 resulted in very high-yield production of extracellular type-I cellulose. High-level cellulose production only occurred when the native cesA gene was inactivated and when cells were grown at low salinity. This system provides a method for the production of lignin-free cellulose from sunlight and CO2 for biofuel production and other biotechnological applications. © 2015 SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

AB  - A variety of catalytic and noncatalytic protein domains are deployed by select microorganisms to deconstruct lignocellulose. These extracellular proteins are used to attach to, modify, and hydrolyze the complex polysaccharides present in plant cell walls. Cellulolytic enzymes, often containing carbohydrate-binding modules, are key to this process; however, these enzymes are not solely responsible for attachment. Few mechanisms of attachment have been discovered among bacteria that do not form large polypeptide structures, called cellulosomes, to deconstruct biomass. In this study, bioinformatics and proteomics analyses identified unique, discrete, hypothetical proteins ("ta¯pirins," origin from Ma¯ori: to join), not directly associated with cellulases, that mediate attachment to cellulose by species in the noncellulosomal, extremely thermophilic bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor. Two ta¯pirin genes are located directly downstream of a type IV pilus operon in strongly cellulolytic members of the genus, whereas homologs are absent from the weakly cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species. Based on their amino acid sequence, ta¯pirins are specific to these extreme thermophiles. Ta¯pirins are also unusual in that they share no detectable protein domain signatures with known polysaccharide-binding proteins. Adsorption isotherm and trans vivo analyses demonstrated the carbohydrate-binding module-like affinity of the ta¯pirins for cellulose. Crystallization of a cellulose-binding truncation from one ta¯pirin indicated that these proteins form a long β-helix core with a shielded hydrophobic face. Furthermore, they are structurally unique and define a new class of polysaccharide adhesins. Strongly cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species employ ta¯pirins to complement substrate-binding proteins from the ATP-binding cassette transporters and multidomain extracellular and S-layer-associated glycoside hydrolases to process the carbohydrate content of lignocellulose. © 2015, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc.

AB  - Farming is using more of the land surface, as population increases and agriculture is increasingly applied for non-nutritional purposes such as biofuel production. This agricultural expansion exerts an increasing impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In order to understand the impact of such processes, the Community Land Model (CLM) has been augmented with a CLM-Crop extension that simulates the development of three crop types: maize, soybean, and spring wheat. The CLM-Crop model is a complex system that relies on a suite of parametric inputs that govern plant growth under a given atmospheric forcing and available resources. CLM-Crop development used measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from AmeriFlux sites to choose parameter values that optimize crop productivity in the model. In this paper, we calibrate these parameters for one crop type, soybean, in order to provide a faithful projection in terms of both plant development and net carbon exchange. Calibration is performed in a Bayesian framework by developing a scalable and adaptive scheme based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). The model showed significant improvement of crop productivity with the new calibrated parameters. We demonstrate that the calibrated parameters are applicable across alternative years and different sites. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Energy use, water use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were assessed for the transformation of cassava roots into starch by two small-scale (ST1, ST2: 1-2 t starch per day) and one large-scale (VLT: 100-200 t starch per day) technologies. The goal of the study was to identify hotspots of energy use and GHG emissions, as well as sustainable practices, with a view to uncover opportunities to improve the environmental performance of cassava starch production. VLT required 2527 MJ/t starch, mainly (77%) from biogas used to dry starch, but was the most efficient in terms of water use (10 m3/t starch) due to the practice of water recycling between unit operations. ST1 and ST2 were similar in terms of electricity use (212 MJ/t starch), and were able to rely on solar energy to dry starch, due to the small volumes of production. In contrast, water use varied from 21 to 62 m3/t starch due to differences in the design of the rasping and starch recovery (extraction) operations. GHG emissions were 149, 93 and 105 kg CO2eq/t starch for VLT, ST1 and ST2 respectively. For ST1 and ST2, methane emissions from untreated wastewater were the main contribution to GHG emissions. For VLT, methane was captured to produce biogas and to dry starch, and the main contribution to GHG emissions was the use of non-renewable grid electricity. Biogas technology was adopted in the past 12 years in the case of VLT. Previously fuel oil was used instead of biogas, which resulted in GHG emissions of 539 kg CO2eq/t starch. VLT used markedly more electricity than ST1 and ST2, which was necessary to ensure the high output and consistent starch quality. Strategies to reduce the impacts of cassava starch production could focus on (1) increasing the energy efficiency of the drying operation, in order to make more biogas available for other uses such as production of renewable electricity; (2) improving the design of some unit operations with regards to water and energy efficiency; and (3) promoting the transfer and adoption of water recycling practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify research priorities to guide transportation stakeholders in their practice, education, and research. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review of published, conference proceedings, agency reports, books, and web site documents was conducted, aiming at the identification of the diverging strategies and practices undertaken by transportation stakeholders in order to be able to generate initial meaningful insights about a sustainable transportation system. Findings – Sustainable transportation systems are in certain way a new paradigm where a business-as-usual approach is not possible. Vehicle makers produce more energy efficient vehicles. Nevertheless, fossil fuel is still the predominant source of energy. Regarding the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, non-motorized transport modes are preferable over motorized transport modes, and public transportation modes preferable to private transportation modes. It is also import to include environmental consideration along the design, construction, maintenance, and operation of the transportation infrastructure. While vehicles powered by alternate fuel such as biofuel, electricity, and/or fuel cell are becoming more popular, shifting to more sustainable transport modes would also require changes on commuter behaviors and individual preferences. Practical implications – The paper discusses the efforts that are underway for decoupling transport and CO2 emissions, being useful for transportation stakeholders to implement or improve the effectiveness of their potential or current sustainability transport initiatives through the identification of strategies, opportunities, and barriers. Originality/value – Although there is plenty of good information about sustainability and transportation modes in literature, most of the articles analyzed focus on specific factors of the whole transportation system. The originality/value of this paper is found in the holistic perspective, here presented, of the state of the art issues that a sustainable transport system would encompass. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Landoltia punctata is a widely distributed duckweed species with great potential to accumulate enormous amounts of starch for bioethanol production. We found that L. punctata can accumulate starch rapidly accompanied by alterations in endogenous hormone levels after uniconazole application, but the relationship between endogenous hormones and starch accumulation is still unclear. Results: After spraying fronds with 800 mg/L uniconazole, L. punctata can accumulate starch quickly, with a dry weight starch content of up to 48% after 240 h of growth compared to 15.7% in the control group. Electron microscopy showed that the starch granule content was elevated after uniconazole application. The activities of key enzymes involved in starch synthesis were also significantly increased. Moreover, the expression of regulatory elements of the cytokinin (CK), abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) signaling pathways that are involved in chlorophyll and starch metabolism also changed correspondingly. Importantly, the expression levels of key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis were up-regulated, while transcript-encoding enzymes involved in starch degradation and other carbohydrate metabolic branches were down-regulated. Conclusion: The increase of endogenous ABA and CK levels positively promoted the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and chlorophyll content, while the decrease in endogenous GA levels inactivated α-amylase. Thus, the alterations of endogenous hormone levels resulted in starch accumulation due to regulation of the expression of genes involved in the starch metabolism pathway. © 2015 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Purpose: A bibliometric analysis of life cycle assessment (LCA)-related research literature is reported in this study. Based on databases of Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Science (CPCI-S), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH), this study aims to evaluate the research trends of LCA-related research literature from 1998 to 2013 by using bibliometric techniques. Methods: The documents were analyzed according to their type, language(s), subject(s), journal(s), citation analysis of articles, authors’ address information, and keyword distribution, etc. H-index and impact factor (IF) were applied to characterize the LCA publications. Furthermore, co-word analysis and social network analysis (SNA) were employed to evaluate the interactions in this research field. The findings showed that the pace of publishing in this field increased exponentially over past 16 years. Results and discussion: A total of 6616 records were obtained from the four databases. Journal articles are the most frequently used document type representing 74.33 % (4918) of the records, and English is the dominant language with 5914 records (97.53 %). The most common subject category is environmental sciences, and the most productive journal is International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. The USA, focusing on “energy,” “industrial ecology,” and “greenhouse gas emissions,” is the most productive country in the research field of LCA. Technology University of Denmark is the most productive institute all over the world over the past 16 years. According to the ranking of keywords, “greenhouse gas,” “energy”, and “biofuel” are the hotspots of LCA research. The main purpose of LCA is sustainability assessment whereas climate change is one of the most outstanding environmental issues. Conclusions: By identifying global hotspots in the LCA research, this study provides a useful reference to researchers for the future research directions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: The BioValueChain model facilitates the calculation of environmental impacts throughout the value chain for production of biogas from organic waste and manure in Norway. This paper describes the methodology of the model, presents the results based on general data and performs a sensitivity analysis for the input data. Methods: The model is based on life cycle assessment methodology and defines the boundaries of the system and a set of default parameter values which can easily be changed to obtain relevant results for a specific region or a specific biogas plant. Results and discussion: The general results from application of the model show that the application of biogas and digestate, including the assumption regarding which products are substituted, has significance for the results. The sensitivity analysis reveals that results for global warming potential (GWP) appear to be less sensitive for the different parameter values than the other environmental indicators. Increased biogas production from source separated organic household waste and manure from cattle and pigs appears to be an appropriate greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation measure for Norwegian conditions if the biogas substitutes fossil fuels and if the digestate substitutes mineral fertiliser. Conclusions: The results underline the need for the use of specific data, especially for transport distances, biogas potential and efficiency of biogas plant. Furthermore, in order to decrease the uncertainty of the results, more research is required into ways of modelling and quantifying direct emissions from the storage and application of manure and digestate on land. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Microalgae have the potential to produce triacylglycerol (TAG) and starch, which provide alternative sources of biofuel. A problem in using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model for TAG production has been that this alga lacks phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is thought to be important for TAG synthesis in plants. We found that C. debaryana is one of the rare species of Chlamydomonas having PC. Here we show that this strain, grown under complete photoautotrophic conditions, accumulated TAG and starch up to 20 and 250 pg per cell, respectively, during the stationary phase without nutrient deprivation. Addition of nutrients in this state did not cause loss of TAG, which was found in dilution with fresh medium. The photosynthetically produced TAG contained a high level of monounsaturated fatty acids, which is a preferred property as a material for biodiesel. The oil bodies were present in the cytoplasm, either between the cytoplasmic membrane and the chloroplast or between the chloroplast and the nucleus, whereas the starch granules were present within the chloroplast. Oil bodies were also deposited as a broad layer in the peripheral space of the cytoplasm outside the chloroplast, and might be easily released from the cells by genetic, chemical or mechanical manipulation. These results suggest that C. debaryana is a promising seed organism for developing a good biofuel producer. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - Boreal peatlands in Canada comprise a substantial store of soil organic carbon (peat), and this peat is vulnerable to extensive burning during periods of extended drying. Increased frequency of extreme weather events in boreal regions is expected with future climate change, and the conditions that would support sustained smouldering peat combustion within peatlands may be more common. Organic soils tend to burn by smouldering combustion, a very slow-moving process in fuels such as those found in peatlands. Thus the most extreme conditions for carbon loss to the atmosphere due to the burning of peat likely occur when widespread propagation of flaming combustion leads to widespread initiation of smouldering. To investigate the potential for large-scale, high-intensity fire spread across forested bogs, we examined the fuel conditions in forested bogs necessary to support active crown fire. We measured surface and canopy fine fuels (those available to contribute to the propagating energy flux of the main flaming front) across a postfire chronosequence of forested boreal bog from central Alberta, Canada. We found that fuel load of fine surface material remained relatively constant across the chronosequence and at levels large enough to support crown fire initiation. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) regeneration begins to fill in the crown space with increasing time since disturbance and achieves crown bulk densities similar to black spruce upland forests. We estimated that after about 80 years, the black spruce canopy has developed enough available fuel to support active crown fire on between 10% to 40% of days in a typical fire season in central Alberta, Canada. Broad-scale propagation of high-intensity fire across a peatland when coincident with drought-induced lower moisture in deep peatland layers has the potential to lead to a substantial release of stored terrestrial carbon. © 2015, (publisher).

AB  - Given the complexity of generating energy from biomass, the need has arisen for support tools to assist in balancing energy and forestry policies which are sufficiently flexible to address the issues of planning and management at small and large scales.The present study aims to adapt WISDOM GIS methodology for application in the autonomous region of Asturias (Northern Spain) and thereby, by creating a geodatabase, to contribute to a support tool for investigating the potential of woodfuel. This will aid the public administration by providing information on woodfuel supply and demand at the regional, municipality and site-specific level, and thus assist in decision making in terms of formulating new energy strategies.In terms of supply (tyear-1), in this work, woodfuel from forest area is defined as the crown fraction only (branches and leaves), although in the case of Eucalyptus spp., bark is also included as it is remains on-site following extraction of eucalypts for the pulp industry. Non-Forest Direct Supply was calculated on the basis of the relevant categories froman agricultural land use inventory and average woodfuel productivity. In addition, physical and legal constraints related to accessibility of the woodfuel were considered, the former applying restriction filters with values weighted depending on the interaction between slope map, road networks and centres of population, and the latter considering legal limitations in protected areas. In addition, unused waste from the wood processing industry was included. To calculate total woodfuel demand (tyear-1) for energy generation (heat and electricity), both the residential and industrial sector were taken into account.All data was georeferenced through Geographic Information Systems (GISs), which allow operations between raster maps to be performed to generate numeric and spatial results focusing on logistics and biomass strategies, depending on the inputs data and scale employed for each scenario considered. In addition, the application of the methodology at the site-specific level illustrates the practical implementation at the small scale of the geodatabase created, by evaluating the woodfuel available to feed, in case 1, a wood-fired power plant in a specific proposed location and, in case 2, this plant combined with a second plant in a different municipality, both cases also taking into consideration industrial demand. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The United States shale gas boom has precipitated global interest in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources. Recently, government ministers in the United Kingdom started granting licenses that will enable companies to begin initial exploration for shale gas. Meanwhile, concern is increasing among the scientific community about the potential impacts of shale gas and other types of unconventional natural gas development (UGD) on human health and the environment. Although significant data gaps remain, there has been a surge in the number of articles appearing in the scientific literature, nearly three-quarters of which has been published since the beginning of 2013. Important lessons can be drawn from the UGD experience in the United States. Here we explore these considerations and argue that shale gas development policies in the UK and elsewhere should be informed by empirical evidence generated on environmental, public health, and social risks. Additionally, policy decisions should take into account the measured effectiveness of harm reduction strategies as opposed to hypothetical scenarios and purported best practices that lack empirical support. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, certain attempts to promote sustainable transport have fallen victim to the impact of ‘unintended consequences’ on decision-making and policy outcomes. The pressure that European Union biofuel targets place on global food production and the role they play in facilitating deforestation are well-known examples. This paper highlights how policy-makers’ failure to consider evidence relating to the potential impacts of biofuel mandates in the early 2000s led to a host of complex problems developing over subsequent years. Drawing on the concept of problem ‘framing’, the article then examines the extent of policy learning that has taken place since the Biofuels Directive was implemented in 2003. While acknowledging that not all eventualities can be prepared for, the article highlights the importance of enhanced communication and collaboration across different levels and departments of government in policy-making processes as a means of promoting learning, especially when dealing with complex cross-cutting and international social, environmental and economic problems. © 2015 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - This article discusses contemporary agrarian transformation in southern Ethiopia from the perspective of how policies of agricultural commercialisation engender new patterns of rural social differentiation and politicisation of the land issue in the rural setting. By presenting a case of biofuels production through contract farming in Wolaita, the paper sheds light on the historical trajectory of agrarian transformation to elucidate the tensions of the current project of commercialisation. The article concludes that commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is a crucial feature of the country's strategy for socio-economic and political transformation and constitutes one of the main defining aspects of the self-declared ‘developmental state’ in Ethiopia. The current trajectory in Wolaita sees tangible rural social differentiation for the first time since the 1975 land reform. Beyond the success or failure of individual cases, commercialisation reflects two main layers of tension, present also elsewhere in Ethiopia's rural areas. The first has to do with the relationship between bureaucratic centralism and economic liberalisation; the second emerges from the implications of rural social stratification to the redefinition of the ruling elite's political consensus. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Paulownia tree first arrived in the USA in the early nineteenth century and quickly transitioned from an exotic oddity to a beloved ornamental by some and a reviled invasive species by others. Many gardeners and horticulturalists praised the tree for its rapid growth and beautiful lavender blossoms. Critics thought the non-native tree a threat to native flora and sought its eradication. One species, Paulownia tomentosa, is invasive and has been especially vilified by organizations ranging from the National Park Service and National Forests Service to the US Department of Agriculture. Another species, Paulownia elongata, started to gain attention as a viable domestic tree crop in the 1980s. Demand derived primarily from Asian countries, especially Japan where the tree had been traditionally used for dowry chests, furniture, and musical instruments. Due to over harvesting, Japan had suffered a severe shortage to the extent that Paulownia made up a large chunk of the country's wood imports. P. elongata and various hybrids are currently grown by Americans ranging from diversified farmers to businessmen and even former president Jimmy Carter. Paulownia growers believe that the tree's value expands beyond furniture and other carvings to environmental possibilities such as biofuels, biomass, electricity, and even air purification. Deemed a pest by some and a profitable commodity by others, the Paulownia has become a permanent part of the American landscape but measures must be taken to contain P. tomentosa and keep P. elongata from becoming invasive. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A break-even analysis of low carbon vehicle/fuel systems is conducted for the U.S. for the year 2020, taking into consideration both private and external costs. All comparisons are made with respect to the conventional gasoline car as the baseline. Interestingly, the social cost of carbon prevailing in the literature is not high enough to justify the prioritization of low carbon vehicle/fuel technologies and the only way forward if such a track were to be chosen would be a political decision not necessarily grounded on economic principles. Nonetheless potential policies for the most financially viable alternative vehicle/fuel systems are considered. © 2015, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Allan G. J. The regional economic impacts of biofuels: a review of multisectoral modelling techniques and evaluation of applications, Regional Studies. The regional economic impact of biofuel production depends upon a number of interrelated factors: the specific biofuels feedstock and production technology employed; the sector's embeddedness in the rest of the economy, through its demand for local resources; and the extent to which new activity is created. These issues can be analysed using multisectoral economic models. Some studies use input–output (IO) and social accounting matrix (SAM) modelling frameworks, whilst a nascent computable general equilibrium (CGE) literature has begun to examine the regional impact of biofuel development. This paper reviews, compares and evaluates these approaches for modelling the regional economic impacts of biofuels. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Cell milking is a 100% renewable green energy for CO2 by extraction of biofuels inside the cytosol of photosynthetic micro-organisms as microalgae and bacteria. The cells are exposed to a hydrophobic solvent forming holes and cracks through their membranes from which the biofuels can leak out. In protein folding, the goal would be to find pathways to the unique functional protein conformer. However, in the lipid-bilayer interaction with the solvent for milking, the objective is to block the pathways for damaged membrane conformations of low free energy with undesired nanostructures, using the solvent properties, as shown with an ab initio structural bioinformatic model. Statistical thermodynamics is used to compute the free energy (including entropy) from the molecular dynamics trajectory of the biomolecular system with many conformational changes. This model can be extended to the general problem of biomolecules folding as for proteins and nucleic acids. Using an adaptation of the Einstein diffusion law, the conformational change dynamics of the lipid bilayer depends on the two diffusion coefficients of the solvent: D1 before the irreversible folding transition time and the much smaller D2 thereafter. In contrast to the n-hexane and n-heptane hydrocarbons of smaller size, the residual D2 = 4.7 × 10-7 cm2/s of the n-decane solvent, with the highest partition coefficient among the three extractors, is the only to present a D2 value that is significantly below the critical threshold of 10-6 cm2/s. Therefore, the membrane would resist to long hydrocarbons and the exposed cells would remain viable for milking. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Sucrose synthase (SUS) converts sucrose and uridine di-phosphate (UDP) into UDP-glucose and fructose. UDP-glucose is used by the cellulose synthase to produce cellulose for cell wall biosynthesis. For lignocellulosic feedstocks such as switchgrass, the manipulation of cell walls to decrease lignin content is needed to reduce recalcitrance of conversion of biomass into biofuels. Of perhaps equal importance for bioenergy feedstocks is increasing biomass. Four SUS genes were identified in switchgrass. Each gene contained 14 or 15 introns. PvSUS1 was expressed ubiquitously in the tissues tested. PvSUS2 and PvSUS6 were highly expressed in internodes and roots, respectively. PvSUS4 was expressed in low levels in the tissues tested. Transgenic switchgrass plants overexpressing PvSUS1 had increases in plant height by up to 37%, biomass by up to 13.6%, and tiller number by up to 79% compared to control plants. The lignin content was increased in all lines, while the sugar release efficiency was decreased in PvSUS1-overexpressing transgenic switchgrass plants. For switchgrass and other bioenergy feedstocks, the overexpression of SUS1 genes might be a feasible strategy to increase both plant biomass and cellulose content, and to stack with other genes to increase biofuel production per land area cultivated. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Using US and global data we estimate auto-regressive models of US and global food prices as a function of oil prices, GDP per capita and biofuels production. Our model results show: (1) biofuels production and crude oil prices have a statistically significant effect on food prices in the US and globally; (2) during the global food price spike in 2008, increases in US biofuels production and the US crude oil price accounted for 38 and 41 %, respectively, of the increase in US food prices; (3) during the global food price spike in 2008, increases in global biofuels production and the global crude oil price accounted for 19 and 40 %, respectively, of the increase in global food prices; (4) an independently projected global oil price to 2040 and a projected annual growth in global biofuels production would increase the global food price index in 2040 by 47 percentage points compared to a reference case of constant biofuels production; (5) an independently projected global oil price to 2040 would increase the global food price by 41 percentage points compared to the reference case where global oil price remains at its 2013 level. In sum, we demonstrate that both higher oil prices and increased biofuels production have raised food prices, and that this has contributed to global poverty and chronic undernourishment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Feeding the world’s population while ensuring environmental sustainability is one of the world’s ‘grand challenges’. While population and income will remain the most important drivers of global food production, their relative importance will be reversed by 2050, with income growth becoming the dominant force. Energy prices are a wildcard, with continued low prices dampening demand for biofuels and encouraging intensification of production. In contrast, a return to high oil prices could greatly increase pressure to expand cropland. Regional water shortages are likely to constrain irrigated agriculture in many key river basins. However, at global scale, international trade will moderate the impacts of water scarcity on food supplies and prices. The key determinant of global food prices in 2050 will be the rate of overall technological progress in agriculture. Here, there are two competing views of the world. Pessimists point to the slowing rate of yield growth in many key breadbaskets, suggesting this will be exacerbated by climate change. In contrast, optimists argue that overall productivity growth has continued to rise – fueled by record public R&D investments in China, India and Brazil, as well as by the private sector. Reduced food waste and post-harvest losses offers another potential source of food supply. However, future agricultural land use is likely to face increasing competition from environmental services, including carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Understanding these competing demands for global resources will require greater inter-disciplinary research effort, supported by improved global geospatial data and analytical frameworks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - This research article is based on the production of biofuels from the marine macro red alga Melanothamnus afaqhusainii and marine macro green alga Ulva fasciata from the Karachi coast. M. afaqhusainii was investigated for biodiesel as well as for bioethanol whereas U. fasciata was investigated only for bioethanol. Two types of biodiesels namely fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) were prepared by the transesterification of algal oil. The carbohydrates from both algae were extracted by distilled water and subjected to different biochemical tests. It was hydrolyzed by various methods including acidic and basic as well as by using ammonia, hydrogen peroxide and mixture of organic solvents in the presence of AlCl 3. The comparative study of these methods revealed their efficiency order as NaOH (10%)/heating (method-2) > NaOH (10%)/H2O2 in microwave oven (method-5) > ammonia (50%)/reflux (method-6). After hydrolysis, the presence of carbohydrates in the hydrolyzed samples was investigated by different biochemical tests including Molisch Test, Iodine Test, Benedict's Test, Tollen Test, Barfoed's Test, Fehling's solution Test, Osazone Test, Seliwanoff's Test and Bial's Test. In addition, the presence of glucose was confirmed by glucometer and Combur Test. The detailed investigation of carbohydrates was carried out that resulted in the identification of reducing sugars, polysaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides including glucose. The hydrolyzed samples were fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ground and paratial anaerobic conditions. The bioethanol so formed by fermentation was directly converted to UV active derivatives namely ethyl benzoate and benzyl acetate. They were confirmed by TLC examination in comparison with standard ethyl benzoate and benzyl acetate. UV spectrophotometer was used for the determination of total sugar and bioethanol on the basis of absorbance by comparing with standards. This valuable research will be fruitful to overcome the current environmental threats. © 2015, Chemical Society of Pakistan. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although mainly used for other purposes, and historically mainly established at the expense of tropical forests, oil palm can be the most land efficient feedstock for biodiesel. Large parts of Brazil are suitable for oil palm cultivation and a series of policy initiatives have recently been launched to promote oil palm production. These initiatives are however highly debated both in the parliament and in academia. Here we present results of a high resolution modelling study of opportunities and risks associated with oil palm production for biodiesel in Brazil, under different energy, policy, and infrastructure scenarios. Oil palm was found to be profitable on extensive areas, including areas under native vegetation where establishment would cause large land use change (LUC) emissions. However, some 40-60 Mha could support profitable biodiesel production corresponding to approximately 10% of the global diesel demand, without causing direct LUC emissions or impinging on protected areas. Pricing of LUC emissions could make oil palm production unprofitable on most lands where conversion would impact on native ecosystems and carbon stocks, if the carbon price is at the level $125/tC, or higher. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Cultivation of corn and soybeans in the United States reached record high levels following the biofuels boom of the late 2000s. Debate exists about whether the expansion of these crops caused conversion of grasslands and other carbon-rich ecosystems to cropland or instead replaced other crops on existing agricultural land. We tracked crop-specific expansion pathways across the conterminous US and identified the types, amount, and locations of all land converted to and from cropland, 2008-2012. We found that crop expansion resulted in substantial transformation of the landscape, including conversion of long-term unimproved grasslands and land that had not been previously used for agriculture (cropland or pasture) dating back to at least the early 1970s. Corn was the most common crop planted directly on new land, as well as the largest indirect contributor to change through its displacement of other crops. Cropland expansion occurred most rapidly on land that is less suitable for cultivation, raising concerns about adverse environmental and economic costs of conversion. Our results reveal opportunities to increase the efficacy of current federal policy conservation measures by modifying coverage of the 2014 US Farm Bill Sodsaver provision and improving enforcement of the US Renewable Fuels Standard. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In the temperate zone, alley cropping is promoted as a climate change-resilient agroforestry practice for the provision of biogenic energy carriers. However, little information is available on the potential of such cropping systems as feedstock for biofuel production. In a field trial in Central Europe, the triennial performance of alley cropping systems was assessed. The systems consisted of clover-grass, a native diversity-oriented grassland mixture and multi-rows of willows. They were compared to a willow and grassland control adjacent to the trial area. Three different conversion technologies were applied to grassland feedstock and analyzed for relevant quality parameters. Net energy balances were calculated to determine the potential of the cropping systems and the associated controls as providers of biogenic energy carriers. The grassland control had the highest triennial yield (18 t DM ha−1), whereas pure willow stands were less productive with 7 t DM ha−1. Alley cropping was intermediate with 12 t DM ha−1 on average. Net energy yield of the clover-grass based systems was highest in the grassland control for all conversion technologies, whereas values of the diversity-based systems in the control and the alley cropping system achieved similar values. This study only investigated the first 3 years after establishment, when growth rates of shrub willows were still low. Thus, more research is needed to evaluate the long-term performance of agroforestry systems with shrub willows and herbaceous crops. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is considered one of the most promising routes to convert the pyrolysis bio-oils produced from lignocellulose into biofuels very similar to those derived from petroleum. This work reports results obtained in the catalytic HDO of anisole over non-conventional hydrotreating catalysts based on metallic Ni and Co supported on micro-mesoporous carriers of different acidity. Anisole has been chosen as representative of those compounds, containing a methoxy-phenyl group, which are abundant in lignocellulose pyrolysis bio-oils. The effect of both metal phase and support properties on their performance as HDO catalysts has been studied. With this aim, three supports with different textural and acidic properties have been employed: hierarchical ZSM-5, mesostructured pure silica SBA-15 and mesostructured Al-SBA-15. The reactions have been carried out in a stainless steel high pressure batch reactor at 220 °C and with 50 bar of pure hydrogen. The interaction of the metallic species (Ni or Co) with the porous supports, as well as their dispersion, is strongly affected by the support nature and the presence of Al. Thus, it has been found a synergetic effect between the acid sites of the supports and the metallic active phases, which favors and enhances the HDO of anisole. In the case of the acidic supports, Ni-based catalysts (Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni/h-ZSM-5) show larger anisole conversions compared to Co-based materials. The strong interaction with the acidic supports of the latter hinders the total Co reduction prior to the reaction, being probably the major reason of their lower activity. Hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodearomatization and isomerization reactions take place extensively over Ni/h-ZSM-5, revealing it is a promising catalyst for bio-oil processing in order to attain high quality fuel production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The catalytic valorization of microalgae, a sustainable feedstock to alleviate dependence on fossil fuel and offset greenhouse gases emissions, is of great significance for production of biofuels and value-added chemicals from aquatic plants. Here, an interesting catalytic process is reported to convert microalgae (Chlorococcum sp.) into 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) and ethylene glycol (EG) in water over nickel-based catalysts. The influences of reaction temperature, initial H2 pressure and reaction time on the product distribution were systematically investigated by using a batch reactor. Under optimal reaction conditions (at 250 °C for 3 h with 6.0 MPa of H2 pressure), microalgae were directly and efficiently converted over a Ni-MgO-ZnO catalyst and the total yield of polyols was up to 41.5%. The excellent catalytic activity was attributed to the smaller size and better dispersion of Ni particles on the MgO-ZnO supporter based on the characterization results as well as its tolerance to nitrogen-containing compounds. Besides, the reaction pathway was proposed based on the formation of reaction intermediates and the results of model compound conversion. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - Multiple entry selections of big bluestems and three native C4 grass species, including switchgrass, miscanthus, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) mixture grass, were evaluated for their chemical composition and ethanol yields via diluted sulfuric acid pretreatment following simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Big bluestem and switchgrass had a similar glucan content that was significantly higher than miscanthus and CRP grass. Big bluestem had the highest average mass recovery (55.56%) after acid pretreatment, and miscanthus had the lowest mass recovery (46.3%). A positive correlation was observed between glucan recovery and mass recovery. No significant difference in average efficiency of SSF was observed among four native grasses, but ethanol yields from big bluestem entries, which averaged 26.2%, were consistently greater than the other three grasses. The highest ethanol yield among the 10 entries was from big bluestem cultivar KAW (27.7%). Approximately 0.26kg ethanol with 9.4g/L concentration can be produced from 1kg of big bluestem biomass under current processing conditions. A negative relationship exists between lignin content and the efficiency of SSF with R=-0.80, and a positive relationship exists between ethanol yield and glucan content with R=0.71. © 2015.

AB  - Scenario-based analysis is conducted on the long-term projections of liquid biofuels in China for transport fuels. The key influencing factors during each period are assessed. Driven by the transport energy demand growth, increasing price of crude oil and technological progress, liquid biofuels are expected to develop rapidly in the medium and long term. Meanwhile, it is projected that the utilization of liquid biofuels will be full of uncertainties, with wide range of 45 Million ton of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to 120 Mtoe by 2050. At different times, critical factors significantly differ. In the long term (2030-2050), the development of liquid biofuels is highly dependent on the availability of biomass resources. In the medium term (2020-2030), biomass availability and feedstock price are critical. In the near term (current-2020), the feedstock price of 1.5 generation liquid biofuels is critical. In 2050, the utilization of liquid biofuels can reduce 1-7% of overseas oil dependence ratio, 100-370 million tons of CO2 emission. Market-based instruments, i.e., carbon pricing policy and excise tax preferences, can stimulate the medium- and long-term development of biofuels. However, in the near-term, subsidies are highly necessary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environmental performance of second-generation biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass, such as crop residues, is foreseen to be superior to that of first-generation biofuels such as maize bioethanol. Moreover, using a legume as an intercrop can reduce costly N fertilizers inputs and can increase the N content of the straw mixture. Therefore, we studied cereal-legume intercrops as a source of food grain and straw bioethanol. We grew field pea and four cultivars of durum wheat, triticale, oat, and barley. Crops were grown during 2 years as a sole crop, in additive intercrop with 100 % of the sole crop density for the cereal and 50 % of sole crop density for the legume, and in replacement intercrop with 50 % of the sole crop density for each crop. Tall cereal cultivars were preferred over shorter cereals for an extra production of straw. Results show that growth resources were used up to 23–26 % more efficiently in intercrop than in sole crop for grain and straw production. Tall cereal cultivars suppressed legume yields in intercrops, thus reducing potential intercrop advantages. Pea in intercrop increased straw mixture N by 54 % the first year and by 91 % the second year, versus cereal alone. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - In future decades, food demand for an increased population with elevated standards of living poses a huge challenge, particularly in the sense of the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. We have analyzed agricultural data from the past 50 years, and found that the current agricultural practices will have negative effects on global food production: total agricultural area has decreased since 2000, fertilizer and pesticide consumption increased while their efficiency decreased, and available water sources are already being used for irrigation. Expansion of biofuel production, cultivation limitations of genetically modified organisms, and the trend of increasing living standards will all intensify the risks of a global food crisis in the coming decades. Crop yield and environmental protection will then have to be traded off if there are no feasible solutions at country or regional scales, and it is crucial for agricultural sustainability to increase crop yields and simultaneously decrease environmental impacts of agriculture intensification. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Chile needs to diversify its energy supply, and should establish policies that encourage the production and use of biofuels. The demand for energy resources increases with population growth and industrial development, making it urgent to find green alternatives to minimize the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of traditional fuels. However, it is required that sophisticated strategies consider all externalities from the production of biofuels and should be established on the basis of protecting the environment, reducing GHG emissions and to avoid violating human rights. This article presents the Chilean reality, based on ethical principles that should be guarded to regulate the bioenergy market. These principles are: (1) human rights, (2) environmental sustainability, (3) climate change mitigation, (4) right to a fair reward, and (5) equitable distribution. It is concluded that in Chile the concentration of land and water for the development of extractive industries; and for agricultural and forestry purposes, contradicts the principle of human rights. The unequal distribution of income is also highlighted as part of a cycle of social injustice, with a high Gini coefficient (0.52). However, the policy of biofuels can be strengthened with the early use of second generation feedstock, the introduction of fair trade and regulation by the state to encourage participation of small farmers, and allows a position for Chile at the forefront of bioenergy production. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Biomass quality assessment is of great importance when one in the biomass industry needs to produce another energy product, such as biofuel or bioenergy, for instance. Usually, the biomass quality is determined using expensive devices, such as mass spectrometers, or complex chemical tests that may need several days to complete. Because of the high costs of such methods, people tend to forsake biomass quality assessment and move on to directly produce bioproducts from any kind of biomass. In this paper, a cheap and fast solution for biomass type identification is proposed and investigated. The quality of biomass can be inferred at a coarse level from the type of biomass. In the proposed approach, biomass type identification is treated as a texture classification problem. A texture classification system developed for mobile devices which is able to distinguish between four types of biomass texture images is presented in this paper. Several state of the art texture classification systems based on machine learning are evaluated in a series of experiments on a data set of biomass texture images. The experiments are conducted to determine the system that can offer the best trade-off between accuracy and speed, since the goal is to implement it on a mobile device with limited processing power and memory. In the end, the selected system can identify the type of biomass from pictures taken with a mobile device camera in a few seconds directly on the respective mobile device. The utility of the system is demonstrated through an iOS application that is freely available for download in the App Store at http://appstore.com/biomassid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methane production capacity in mesophilic conditions of waste from two food industry plants was assessed in a semi-pilot (6. L, fed-batch) and pilot (300. L, semi-continuous) scale. This was carried out in order to evaluate the convenience of producing heat and electricity in a full scale anaerobic digester. The pilot test was performed in order to obtain more reliable results for the design of the digester. Methane yield, returned from the pilot scale test, was approximately 80% of that from the smaller scale test. This outcome was in line with those from other studies performed in different scales and modes and indicates the success of the pilot scale test. The net electricity produced from the digester accounted for 30-50% of the food industry plants' consumption. The available thermal energy could cover from 10% to 100% of the plant requirements, depending on the energy demand of the processes performed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - North American publics are currently much more supportive of second-generation biofuels than of conventional biofuels like corn-based ethanol. But what is the likely future trajectory of consumer acceptance of advanced biofuels? This study considers whether increased awareness of the potential unintended consequences of increasing the production of advanced biofuels could lead to a decline in public support for the technology. Using an experiment embedded in an original survey of Canadian adults, we test for the effect of two anti-biofuels arguments on Canadians' support for policies meant to encourage the production of biofuels. We find that support for biofuels policies was reduced in our experiment when respondents were exposed to an argument about the potential impact of biofuels production on food prices and when they were told that the use of woody biomass as a feedstock for the production of cellulosic biofuels might lead to an increase in commercial logging. In both cases, however, support was reduced only among respondents who did not perceive climate change to pose a significant risk. Overall, our results suggest that public support for advanced biofuels is potentially vulnerable to arguments that focus on the unintended consequences of producing biofuels from non-food feedstocks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Long-term information on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a biomass energy crop grown on marginally saline soil and the associated impacts on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and best management practices (BMPs) are limited. In this study, we employed the DAYCENT model, based on a 4-year switchgrass field experiment, to evaluate the long-term biomass yield potential and environmental impacts, and further to develop BMPs for switchgrass in a semi-arid region.The model showed that long-term (14-year) annual mean biomass yields were 9.6 and 5.2Mgha-1 for irrigated and rainfed switchgrass systems, respectively. The simulated biomass yields correlated well with field-measured biomass with r2 values of 0.99 and 0.89 for irrigated and rainfed systems, respectively. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) accumulated rapidly after switchgrass establishment, with mean accrual rates of 0.99-1.13MgCha-1yr-1 and 0.04-0.08MgNha-1yr-1, respectively. Based on the outputs of numerous long-term model simulations with variable irrigation water supplies and N rates, the irrigation regime and N rate with the highest yield to input ratio were chosen as BMPs. The DAYCENT model predicted-BMP was irrigating every 14 days at 70% potential evapotranspiration combined with an N rate of 67kgha-1yr-1. Switchgrass established and produced biomass reasonably well in this semi-arid region; however, appropriate irrigation and N fertilization were needed for optimal biomass yield. Switchgrass had a great potential to sequester C into soils with low N2O emissions while supplying significant quantities of biomass for biofuel synthesis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii) are two woody species which dominate uncultivated lands in the south central Great Plains, USA (Texas, Oklahoma) and may have potential for bioenergy utilization. In this study, these two biomasses were gasified in an adiabatic, updraft fixed-bed gasifier using air as medium. The products include low heating value gas and liquid tar yield. The effects of fuel moisture content and the equivalence ratio (ER) on liquid yields including heavy tar and light tar and higher heating value (HHV) of the producer gas were investigated. It was found that updraft gasifiers produce a large amount of tar, in a range of 100g/Nm3 of gas produced. As the equivalence ratio (ER) increased (i.e. more rich char conditions), peak temperature (Tpeak) within the bed decreased due to the lesser partial oxidization. The liquid yield showed peak value with change in moisture content between 6 and 24%. Heavy tar is a very high quality fuel with a higher heating value of over 29MJ/kg on a dry, ash-free (DAF) basis which is a slightly higher than that of ethanol. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels are likely to play an increasingly important role in the transportation sector in the coming decades. To ensure the sustainability of the biofuel chain, regulatory criteria and reduction targets for greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions have been defined in different legislative frameworks (e.g. the European Renewable Energy Directive, RED). The provided calculation methods, however, leave room for interpretation regarding methodological choices, which could significantly affect the resulting emission factors. In this study, GHG reduction factors for a range of biofuels produced in a Danish biorefinery system were determined using five different emission allocation principles. The results show that emission savings ranged from -34 % to 71 %, indicating the need for a better definition of regulatory calculation principles. The calculated emission factors differed significantly from default values provided in the literature, suggesting that case-specific local conditions should be taken into consideration. A more holistic LCA-based approach proved useful in overcoming some of the issues inherent in the regulatory allocation principles. On this basis, indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions were shown to have the same magnitude as the direct emissions, thus indicating that the overall system should be included when assessing biofuel sustainability criteria. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Domestic and industrial sludge generated at wastewater treatment facilities is considered a potential biomass source for producing biodiesel. However, transportation of large amounts of sludge from wastewater treatment facilities to a biorefinery is expensive. The objective of this paper is to identify the proper transportation mode to use as a function of the volume shipped and transportation distances. Currently, sludge is mainly shipped by truck and pipeline. We estimated that the fixed and variable cost components of pipeline transportation for a volume such as 480m3/day and a distance of 100miles are $0.116/m3 and $0.089/m3/mile, respectively. We estimated the biomass (sludge) transportation cost per gallon of biodiesel, and observed the changes in these costs as a function of distance traveled and volume shipped. The outcomes of this study have the potential to help biofuel plants make better biomass transportation decisions, and consequently reduce the price of biodiesel significantly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Woody biomass harvested from old-growth forests results in a significant "carbon debt" when used as a feedstock for transportation fuel. This is because previously stored forest carbon is released to the atmosphere as CO2. The debt is eventually repaid provided that the life cycle CO2 emissions of the biofuel are lower than the conventional fuel that is displaced. Managed forests are an alternative to old-growth forests with the potential to reduce the carbon debt associated with woody biomass-derived fuels. This work is the first to quantify the carbon debt incurred by transportation biofuels derived from woody biomass from managed forests. The breakeven time of this carbon debt is computed along with breakeven times for radiative forcing, temperature change, and economic damages. In the case of biofuel production for 30years, we find that breakeven times for carbon, radiative forcing, and temperature change are 59, 42, and 48years, respectively. If cumulative economic damages are computed for discount rates of 1-2%, the breakeven time is greater than 100years, while damages never break even at discount rates above 2%. Breakeven times decrease if the prevailing harvest cycle is left unchanged, but increase if biofuel production is sustained indefinitely. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic crop residue biomass, in surplus, is of vital importance due to its multifaceted utilization potential on- and off-site to agricultural systems; therefore, its management is essential for sustainable agriculture. The malpractice of open crop residue burning leading to the brown cloud phenomenon and contributing significantly to atmospheric heterogeneity through enhanced gaseous and particulate emissions is of greater off-late concern. Available traditional crop residue management (CRM) technologies have not achieved wider adaptation; therefore, recently thermochemical conversion has been foreseen as an interesting tool for potential CRM under changing climate scenario. Biochar, a by-product of thermochemical processes, has been evaluated as a potential soil ameliorant and C sequestration agent. As soil ameliorant, it improves soil basic properties directly along with subdued release of greenhouse gases from agroecosystems, provides adsorption surface to agrochemicals and improves essential nutrient dynamics. Since the potential benefits of biochar in soil are governed by initial pyrolysis conditions and soil types; therefore, its wider utilization potential as suitable tool in sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation needs to be critically analyzed before its specific recommendation to an agroecosystem. The present review provides a critical insight on current research on various aspects, particularly ecological, of crop residue biochar starting from the feedstock sources, pyrolysis conditions and changes after application. Additionally, a brief account is given on the agronomic relevance and major constraints of biochar amendment as an ecological engineering tool for sustainable agriculture. After reviewing various aspects of crop residue as feedstock, we recommend its use as a blend, rather than sole use, along with several other lignocellulosic materials under pyrolysis process as well as ameliorating agent. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A multi-level spatial optimization (MLSOPT) approach is developed for solving complex watershed scale optimization problems. The method works at two levels: a watershed is divided into small sub-watersheds and optimum solutions for each sub-watershed are identified individually. Subsequently sub-watershed optimum solutions are used for watershed scale optimization. The approach is tested with complex spatial optimization case studies designed to maximize crop residue (corn stover) harvest with minimum environmental impacts in a 2000km2 watershed. Results from case studies indicated that the MLSOPT approach is robust in convergence and computationally efficient compared to the traditional single-level optimization frameworks. The MLSOPT was 20 times computationally efficient in solving source area based optimization problem while it was 3 times computationally efficient for watershed outlet based optimization problem compared to a corresponding single-level optimizations. The MLSOPT optimization approach can be used in solving complex watershed scale spatial optimization problems effectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The most important global demand is the energy supply from alternative source. Ethanol may be considered an environmental friendly fuel that has been produced by feedstock. The production of ethanol by microalgae represent a process with reduced environmental impact with efficient CO2 fixation and requiring less arable land. This work studied the production of ethanol from green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through the cellular metabolism in a light/dark cycle at 25°C in a TAP medium with sulfur depletion. The parameters evaluated were inoculum concentration and the medium supplementation with mixotrophic carbon sources. The combination of C. reinhardtii and Rhodobacter capsulatus through a hybrid or co-culture systems was also investigated as well. C. reinhardtii maintained in TAP-S produced 19.25±4.16g/L (ethanol). In addition, in a hybrid system, with medium initially supplemented with milk whey permeated and the algal effluent used by R. capsulatus, the ethanol production achieved 19.94±2.67g/L. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exposure to surface ozone has detrimental impacts on vegetation and crop yields. In this study, we estimate ozone impacts on crop production and subsequent impacts on land use in the 2005-2050 period using results of the TM5 atmospheric chemistry and IMAGE integrated assessment model. For the crops represented in IMAGE, we compute relative yield losses based on published exposure-response functions. We examine scenarios with either constant or declining emission factors in a weak climate policy future (radiative forcing target of 6.0W/m2 at the end of the century), as well as co-benefits of stringent climate policy (targeted at 2.6W/m2). Without a large decrease in air pollutant emissions, higher ozone concentrations could lead to an increase in crop damage of up to 20% locally in 2050 compared to the situation in which the changes in ozone are not accounted for. This may lead to a 2.5% global increase in crop area, and a regional increase of 8.9% in Asia. Implementation of air pollution policies could limit crop yield losses due to ozone to maximally 10% in 2050 in the most affected regions. Similar effects can be obtained as a result of co-benefits from climate policy (reducing ozone precursor emissions). We also evaluated the impact of the corresponding land-use changes on the carbon cycle. Under the worst-case scenario analysed in this study, future ozone increases are estimated to increase the cumulative net CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2050 by about 3.7PgC, which corresponds to about 10% of baseline land use emissions over the same period. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Arundo donax has become one of the most promising species for cellulose paste, biomass, and second-generation biofuel production. Because this species is not able to produce viable seeds, micropropagation is the best method for large scale production. Several studies have demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve the acclimatization of micropropagated plantlets, enhancing their growth and survival. In this study, we evaluated the effect of AMF during the acclimatization period of A. donax plantlets and its posterior establishment to the field. Plantlets were inoculated with mycorrhiza-based biofertilizer (AEGIS SYM®) that contained Rhizophagus intraradices and Funneliformis mosseae. The inoculum was applied at the time of transplantation of plantlets to 28-cm3 cell trays filled with commercial nutrient-rich agricultural substrate. The results showed that during acclimatization, mycorrhized plantlets (AM) present higher number of leaves and height increments as compared to non-mycorrhized plantlets (control). Moreover, at the end of the hardening process, AM plantlets presented higher height, number of leaves, biomass, shoot:root ratio and chlorophyll a and b content than control plantlets. After open field establishment, AM plantlets presented greater size, number of stems and survival rate. These results demonstrate that inoculating micropropagated A. donax with AMF enhances its growth and development as well as produces better quality plantlets, which can be very useful for the large-scale production of this energetic crop. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phytoremediation is the most environmentally friendly remediation technology for mitigating agricultural land contamination. However, phytoremediation is a slow process. If the harvested plants cannot provide economic benefits, phytoremediation technology may not be applicable. In this study, peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and rape plants (Brassica campestris L.) were planted on Pb-contaminated farmland with a Pb concentration of 5600mgkg-1. The objectives were to investigate the effect of Pb-contaminated soil on peanut growth, estimate Pb-removal efficiency and evaluate the economic benefits of using peanut products as biomass energy or for other purposes. All these efforts were for the assessment of the feasibility of using peanut plants for the Pb-contaminated land phytoremediation. The study found that biomass energy yield and Pb removal rate were both higher for peanuts than for rapeseed plants. Planting peanuts produced 38.35tha-1y-1 of dry matter, and removed 17.6kgha-1y-1 of Pb. As a biofuel, peanut dry matter can generate a heat value of 654.5GJha-1y-1, which is comparable to that produced by burning 31.3t of raw coal. The output of peanut kernel was 6.3tha-1y-1 with Pb content less than the European Union's maximum limit for animal feeds, and would be valuable as animal feed. A period of 317 years would be required to remove all phytoavailable-Pb from this site by using peanuts. This study concluded that using peanut plants is feasible for the phytoremediation, which can be supported by revenues derived from the crops in Pb-contaminated farmland. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Europe, the use of biodiesel may increase rapidly in the coming decades as a result of policies aiming to increase the use of renewable fuels. Therefore, the production of biofuels from energy crops is expected to increase as well as the use of fertilisers to grow these crops. Since fertilisers are an important cause of eutrophication, the use of biodiesel may have an effect on the water quality in rivers and coastal seas. In this study we explored the possible effects of increased biodiesel use on coastal eutrophication in European seas in the year 2050. To this end, we defined a number of illustrative scenarios in which the biodiesel production increases to about 10-30% of the current diesel use. The scenarios differ with respect to the assumptions on where the energy crops are cultivated: either on land that is currently used for agriculture, or on land used for other purposes. We analysed these scenarios with the Global NEWS (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) model. We used an existing Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Scenario for 2050, Global Orchestration (GO2050), as a baseline. In this baseline scenario the amount of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exported by European rivers to coastal seas decreases between 2000 and 2050 as a result of environmental and agricultural policies. In our scenarios with increased biodiesel production the river export of N and P increases between 2000 and 2050, indicating that energy crop production may more than counterbalance this decrease. Largest increases in nutrient export were calculated for the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Differences in nutrient export among river basins are large. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines impacts of regional factors affecting biomass and process input supply chains and ongoing technology development on the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ethanol production from corn stover in the U.S. Corn stover supply results in GHG emissions from-6 gCO2eq./MJ ethanol (Macon County, Missouri) to 13 gCO2eq./MJ ethanol (Hardin County, Iowa), reflecting location-specific soil carbon and N2O emissions responses to stover removal. Biorefinery emissions based on the 2011 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) process model are the single greatest emissions source (18 gCO2eq./MJ ethanol) and are approximately double those assessed for the 2002 NREL design model, due primarily to the inclusion of GHG-intensive inputs (caustic, ammonia, glucose). Energy demands of on-site enzyme production included in the 2011 design contribute to reducing the electricity co-product and associated emissions credit, which is also dependent on the GHG-intensity of regional electricity supply. Life cycle emissions vary between 1.5 and 22 gCO2eq./MJ ethanol (2011 design) depending on production location (98%-77% reduction vs. gasoline). Using system expansion for co-product allocation, ethanol production in studied locations meet the Energy Independence and Security Act emissions requirements for cellulosic biofuels; however, regional factors and on-going technology developments significantly influence these results. © 2014.

AB  - This article examines land-use, market and welfare implications of lignocellulosic bioethanol production in Hawai'i to satisfy 10% and 20% of the State's gasoline demand in line with the State's ethanol blending mandate and Alternative Fuels Standard (AFS). A static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to evaluate four alternative support mechanisms for bioethanol. Namely: i) a federal blending tax credit, ii) a long-term purchase contract, iii) a state production subsidy financed by a lump-sum tax and iv) a state production subsidy financed by an ad valorem gasoline tax. We find that because Hawaii-produced bioethanol is relatively costly, all scenarios are welfare reducing for Hawaii residents: estimated between-0.14% and-0.32%. Unsurprisingly, Hawaii's economy and its residents fair best under the federal blending tax credit scenario, with a positive impact to gross state product of $49 million. Otherwise, impacts to gross state product are negative (up to-$63 million). We additionally find that Hawaii-based bioethanol is not likely to offer substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings in comparison to imported biofuel, and as such the policy cost per tonne of emissions displaced ranges between $130 and $2100/tonne of CO2e. The policies serve to increase the value of agricultural lands, where we estimate that the value of pasture land could as well. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Complete conversion of the major sugars of biomass including both the C5 and C6 sugars is critical for biofuel production processes. Several inhibitory compounds like acetate, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural are produced from the biomass pretreatment process leading to 'hydrolysate toxicity,' a major problem for microorganisms to achieve complete sugar utilization. Therefore, development of more robust microorganisms to utilize the sugars released from biomass under toxic environment is critical. In this study, we use continuous culture methodologies to evolve and adapt the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis to improve its ethanol productivity using corn stover hydrolysate. Results: A turbidostat was used to adapt the Z. mobilis strain 8b in the pretreated corn stover liquor. The adaptation was initiated using pure sugar (glucose and xylose) followed by feeding neutralized liquor at different dilution rates. Once the turbidostat reached 60% liquor content, the cells began washing out and the adaptation was stopped. Several 'sub-strains' were isolated, and one of them, SS3 (sub-strain 3), had 59% higher xylose utilization than the parent strain 8b when evaluated on 55% neutralized PCS (pretreated corn stover) liquor. Using saccharified PCS slurry generated by enzymatic hydrolysis from 25% solids loading, SS3 generated an ethanol yield of 75.5% compared to 64% for parent strain 8b. Furthermore, the total xylose utilization was 57.7% for SS3 versus 27.4% for strain 8b. To determine the underlying genotypes in these new sub-strains, we conducted genomic resequencing and identified numerous single-nucleotide mutations (SNPs) that had arisen in SS3. We further performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on genes potentially affected by these SNPs and identified significant down-regulation of two genes, ZMO0153 and ZMO0776, in SS3 suggesting potential genetic mechanisms behind SS3's improved performance. Conclusion: We have adapted/evolved Z. mobilis strain 8b for enhanced tolerance to the toxic compounds present in corn stover hydrolysates. The adapted strain SS3 has higher xylose utilization rate and produce more ethanol than the parent strain. We have identified transcriptional changes which may be responsible for these phenotypes, providing foundations for future research directions in improving Z. mobilis as biocatalysts for the production of ethanol or other fuel precursors. © 2015 Mohagheghi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Large-scale bioenergy production will affect the hydrologic cycle in multiple ways, including changes in canopy interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and the quantity and quality of surface runoff and groundwater recharge. As such, the water footprints of bioenergy sources vary significantly by type of feedstock, soil characteristics, cultivation practices, and hydro-climatic regime. Furthermore, water management implications of bioenergy production depend on existing land use, relative water availability, and competing water uses at a watershed scale. This paper reviews previous research on the water resource impacts of bioenergy production—from plot-scale hydrologic and nutrient cycling impacts to watershed and regional scale hydro-economic systems relationships. Primary gaps in knowledge that hinder policy development for integrated management of water–bioenergy systems are highlighted. Four case studies in the Americas are analyzed to illustrate relevant spatial and temporal scales for impact assessment, along with unique aspects of biofuel production compared to other agroforestry systems, such as energy-related conflicts and tradeoffs. Based on the case studies, the potential benefits of integrated resource management are assessed, as is the need for further case-specific research. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - I highlight new and emerging threats to tropical forests, the world's most biologically diverse ecosystems. The drivers of tropical forest destruction and key perils to biodiversity have changed over the past decade and will continue to evolve in the future. Industrial drivers of forest conversion, such as logging, large-scale soy and cattle farming, oil-palm plantations, and oil and gas development, have escalated in importance, buoyed by rapid globalization, economic growth, and rising standards of living in developing nations. Biofuels are likely to grow rapidly as a driver of future forest destruction. Climate change is similarly emerging as a potentially serious driver of change in the tropics, and many species, including certain amphibians, primates, and plants, are being harmed by emerging pathogens. In general, old-growth forests are vanishing rapidly and being replaced by fragmented, secondary, and selectively logged forests, particularly in impoverished tropical countries. Road expansion continues apace and is increasingly imperiling the world's last tropical frontiers. Human population growth, especially in developing nations, remains an important underlying threat to forests. These various environmental dangers often operate in concert, magnifying their impacts and posing an even greater threat to tropical forests and their biodiversity.

AB  - Liquefaction bio-oil from sewage sludge using different organic solvent (methanol, ethanol or acetone) at temperature of 260-380°C was characterized in terms of its elemental and chemical composition, and was further upgraded by microemulsion technology. The bio-oil obtained had high carbon content of 67.60-73.58% and was mainly composed of esters when methanol or ethanol was used as liquefaction solvent, or esters, ketones, alcohols and phenols when acetone was used, meaning its great potential to be used as fuel. Diesel extraction procedure found that ethyl esters were the least diesel-solvable compounds in diesel among the main components of the liquefaction bio-oil, while methyl esters were extracted completely. The bio-oil obtained with methanol as solvent, compared to acetone or ethanol, and the bio-oil obtained at higher liquefaction temperature was easier to be upgraded by water/diesel microemulsion in terms of Span 80 consumption. In addition, the stability mechanism of the component of liquefaction bio-oil in the water/diesel/bio-oil microemulsion was proposed. The diesel-insolvable fractions, e.g. part of ethyl esters, were probably solubilized in the water phase or inserted between surfactants; while the diesel-solvable fractions, e.g. methyl esters, part of ethyl esters, ketones, alcohols and phenols, were probably dissolved in the diesel phase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass for bioenergy is debated for its potential synergies or tradeoffs with other provisioning and regulating ecosystem services (ESS). This biomass may originate from different production systems and may be purposefully grown or obtained from residues. Increased concerns globally about the sustainable production of biomass for bioenergy has resulted in numerous certification schemes focusing on best management practices, mostly operating at the plot/field scale. In this study, we compare the ESS of two watersheds in the southeastern US. We show the ESS tradeoffs and synergies of plantation forestry, i.e., pine poles, and agricultural production, i.e., wheat straw and corn stover, with the counterfactual natural or semi-natural forest in both watersheds. The plantation forestry showed less distinct tradeoffs than did corn and wheat production, i.e., for carbon storage, P and sediment retention, groundwater recharge, and biodiversity. Using indicators of landscape composition and configuration, we showed that landscape planning can affect the overall ESS supply and can partly determine if locally set environmental thresholds are being met. Indicators on landscape composition, configuration and naturalness explained more than 30% of the variation in ESS supply. Landscape elements such as largely connected forest patches or more complex agricultural patches, e.g., mosaics with shrub and grassland patches, may enhance ESS supply in both of the bioenergy production systems. If tradeoffs between biomass production and other ESS are not addressed by landscape planning, it may be reasonable to include rules in certification schemes that require, e.g., the connectivity of natural or semi-natural forest patches in plantation forestry or semi-natural landscape elements in agricultural production systems. Integrating indicators on landscape configuration and composition into certification schemes is particularly relevant considering that certification schemes are governance tools used to ensure comparable sustainability standards for biomass produced in countries with variable or absent legal frameworks for landscape planning. © 2015 Meyer et al.

AB  - Biodiesel production from algae offers a promising prospect for practical applications among the still developing biofuel technologies. The fact that algae are capable of producing much more yield provides an edge over other types of biofuel. Though algal biofuel research is still developing and its practical application is yet to be ascertained, promising work on laboratory- and pilot-scale algae harvesting systems has been extensively reported. Because algae harvesting and drying are vital elements in biofuel production, recent advances on various algae harvesting, dewatering, and drying technologies are reviewed and discussed. Challenges and prospects of algae harvesting and drying are also outlined. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a review of strategy developed by University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore in Biofuel Park, Hassan (Government of Karnataka, initiative to develop biofuel programme in India) for promoting sustainable biodiesel production using oil extracted from tree borne oil species. The main aim of this study was to analyze the current strategy, identify the limitations and propose sustainable biodiesel production strategies for rural Karnataka. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents critical analysis of current Biofuel Park strategy using strength weakness opportunities and threat (SWOT) method. The data for SWOT analysis were collected from Biofuel Park log books, followed by interviews with around 50 associations of biofuel feed stock growers. Further, to evolve sustainable strategies, a case study was carried out at a local village assessing sustainability of biodiesel production and use from four local tree species oil namely; Pongamia pinnata, Azadiractha indica, Madhuca indica and Simarouba glauca. The evolved strategies were brainstormed with local farming community and the deliberations were used to lay a road map for implementing the evolved strategies. Findings – The strategies proposed in the paper would help in sustainability of villages with respect to local energy needs and generate employment. The roadmap proposed would minimise green house gas (GHG) emission compared to Biofuel Park model/strategy and minimise biomass displacement. Originality/value – This paper fulfils a need to study biofuel strategies adopted by government bodies, analyse the same for sustainability and propose alternatives to overcome the limitations of the practiced strategy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Biofuel use is one of many means of addressing global change caused by anthropogenic release of fossil fuel carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere. To make a meaningful reduction in fossil fuel use, bioethanol must be produced from the entire plant rather than only its starch or sugars. Enzymes produced by fungi constitute a significant percentage of the cost of bioethanol production from non-starch (i.e., lignocellulosic) components of energy crops and agricultural residues. We, and others, have reasoned that fungi that naturally deconstruct plant walls may provide the best enzymes for bioconversion of energy crops. Results: Previously, we have reported on the isolation of 106 fungi from decaying leaves of Miscanthus and sugarcane (Appl Environ Microbiol 77:5490-504, 2011). Here, we thoroughly analyze 30 of these fungi including those most often found on decaying leaves and stems of these plants, as well as four fungi chosen because they are well-studied for their plant cell wall deconstructing enzymes, for wood decay, or for genetic regulation of plant cell wall deconstruction. We extend our analysis to assess not only their ability over an 8-week period to bioconvert Miscanthus cell walls but also their ability to secrete total protein, to secrete enzymes with the activities of xylanases, exocellulases, endocellulases, and beta-glucosidases, and to remove specific parts of Miscanthus cell walls, that is, glucan, xylan, arabinan, and lignin. Conclusion: This study of fungi that bioconvert energy crops is significant because 30 fungi were studied, because the fungi were isolated from decaying energy grasses, because enzyme activity and removal of plant cell wall components were recorded in addition to biomass conversion, and because the study period was 2 months. Each of these factors make our study the most thorough to date, and we discovered fungi that are significantly superior on all counts to the most widely used, industrial bioconversion fungus, Trichoderma reesei. Many of the best fungi that we found are in taxonomic groups that have not been exploited for industrial bioconversion and the cultures are available from the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures in Utrecht, Netherlands, for all to use. © 2015 Shrestha et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Background: Conversion of plant cell walls to bioethanol and bio-based chemicals requires pretreatment as a necessary step to reduce recalcitrance of cell walls to enzymatic and microbial deconstruction. In this study, the sweet sorghum stems were subjected to various hydrothermal pretreatment processes (110°C to 230°C, 0.5 to 2.0 h), and the focus of this work is to systematically evaluate the degraded products of polysaccharides and lignins in the liquor phase obtained during the pretreatment process. Results: The maximum yield of xylooligosaccharides (52.25%) with a relatively low level of xylose and other degraded products was achieved at a relatively high pretreatment temperature (170°C) for a short reaction time (0.5 h). Higher temperature (>170°C) and/or longer reaction time (>0.5 h at 170°C) resulted in a decreasing yield of xylooligosaccharides, but increased the concentration of arabinose and galactose. The xylooligosaccharides obtained are composed of xylopyranosyl residues, together with lower amounts of 4-O-Me-α-D-GlcpA units. Meanwhile, the concentrations of the degraded products (especially furfural) increased as a function of pretreatment temperature and time. Molecular weights of the water-soluble polysaccharides and lignins indicated that the degradation of the polysaccharides and lignins occurred during the conditions of harsh hydrothermal pretreatment. In addition, the water-soluble polysaccharides (rich in xylan) and water-soluble lignins (rich in β-O-4 linkages) were obtained at 170°C for 1.0 h. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that the hydrothermal pretreatment condition had a remarkable impact on the compositions and the chemical structures of the degraded products. An extensive understanding of the degraded products from polysaccharides and lignins during the hydrothermal pretreatment will be beneficial to value-added applications of multiple chemicals in the biorefinery for bioethanol industry. © 2015 Sun et al.

AB  - Drawing on in-depth qualitative research exploring EU biofuels policy, this article aims to advance understandings of the role and influence of policy entrepreneurs within Kingdon’s (2011) multiple streams framework (MSF). Focusing on one entrepreneurial policy official, the article analyses both, the particular discursive techniques this official deployed in seeking to influence EU biofuels policy, and the wider contextual factors that impinged on those techniques’ ability to actually attain policy influence. Persuasive framing is shown to have enabled the entrepreneur to influence initial agenda setting processes, whilst boundary work is shown to have enabled the same official to subsequently defend an existing policy in the face of widespread criticism. Critical interactions between all three streams of the MSF, however, were outside the control of this policy entrepreneur, implying that discursive techniques alone are insufficient to open (or close) policy windows. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The agrofuel boom has brought about some of the most significant transformations in the world food system in recent decades. A rich and diverse body of agrarian political economy research has emerged that elucidates the conflicts and redistributional shifts engendered by these transformations. However, less attention has been given to differences within agri-food capital. This paper contributes to the existing literature on agrofuels, by showing how one cluster of agri-food corporations and farmers within the US has benefited from soaring ethanol production at the expense of another cluster. More specifically, I delineate and chart the pecuniary trajectories of two corporate-led distributional coalitions that have vied over the course taken by the US ethanol sector: the ‘Agro-Trader nexus’ and the ‘Animal Processor nexus’. My main finding is that the US ethanol boom has been a vector of redistribution: increasing the earnings of the Agro-Trader nexus and corn growers while reducing the earnings of the Animal Processor nexus and livestock farmers. This finding points to the limits and contradictions of agrofuels capitalism and the acute tensions that exist at the heart of the corporate food regime. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Green algae belong to a group of photosynthetic organisms that occupy diverse habitats, are closely related to land plants, and have been studied as sources of food and biofuel. Although multiple green algal genomes are available, a global comparative study of algal gene families has not been carried out. To investigate how gene families and gene expression have evolved, particularly in the context of stress response that have been shown to correlate with gene family expansion in multiple eukaryotes, we characterized the expansion patterns of gene families in nine green algal species, and examined evolution of stress response among gene duplicates in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Results: Substantial variation in domain family sizes exists among green algal species. Lineage-specific expansion of families occurred throughout the green algal lineage but inferred gene losses occurred more often than gene gains, suggesting a continuous reduction of algal gene repertoire. Retained duplicates tend to be involved in stress response, similar to land plant species. However, stress responsive genes tend to be pseudogenized as well. When comparing ancestral and extant gene stress response state, we found that response gains occur in 13% of duplicate gene branches, much higher than 6% in Arabidopsis thaliana. Conclusion: The frequent gains of stress response among green algal duplicates potentially reflect a high rate of innovation, resulting in a species-specific gene repertoire that contributed to adaptive response to stress. This could be further explored towards deciphering the mechanism of stress response, and identifying suitable green algal species for oil production. © 2015 applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated.

AB  - This study investigated the anaerobic digestion capability of five plants and the effects of copper (Cu) and S,S’-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS, a chelator widely used in chelant-assisted phytoremediation) on biogas production to determine a feasible disposal method for plants used in remediation. The results showed that in addition to Phytolacca americana L., plants such as Zea mays L., Brassica napus L., Elsholtzia splendens Nakai ex F. Maekawa, and Oenothera biennis L. performed well in biogas production. Among these, O. biennis required the shortest period to finish anaerobic digestion. Compared to normal plants with low Cu content, the plants used in remediation with increased Cu levels (100 mg kg−1) not only promoted anaerobic digestion and required a shorter anaerobic digestion time, but also increased the methane content in biogas. When the Cu content in plants increased to 500, 1000, and 5000 mg kg−1, the cumulative biogas production decreased by 12.3%, 14.6%, and 41.2%, respectively. Studies also found that EDDS conspicuously restrained biogas production from anaerobic digestion. The results suggest that anaerobic digestion has great potential for the disposal of contaminated plants and may provide a solution for the resource utilization of plants used in remediation. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Few of the numerous published studies of the emissions from biofuels-induced "indirect" land use change (ILUC) attempt to propagate and quantify uncertainty, and those that have done so have restricted their analysis to a portion of the modeling systems used. In this study, we pair a global, computable general equilibrium model with a model of greenhouse gas emissions from land-use change to quantify the parametric uncertainty in the paired modeling system's estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from ILUC induced by expanded production of three biofuels. We find that for the three fuel systems examined-US corn ethanol, Brazilian sugar cane ethanol, and US soybean biodiesel-95% of the results occurred within ±20 g CO2e MJ-1 of the mean (coefficient of variation of 20-45%), with economic model parameters related to crop yield and the productivity of newly converted cropland (from forestry and pasture) contributing most of the variance in estimated ILUC emissions intensity. Although the experiments performed here allow us to characterize parametric uncertainty, changes to the model structure have the potential to shift the mean by tens of grams of CO2e per megajoule and further broaden distributions for ILUC emission intensities. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sustainable biofuel production from renewable biomass will require the efficient and complete use of all abundant sugars in the plant cell wall. Using the cellulolytic fungus Neurospora crassa as a model, we identified a xylodextrin transport and consumption pathway required for its growth on hemicellulose. Reconstitution of this xylodextrin utilization pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that fungal xylose reductases act as xylodextrin reductases, producing xylosyl-xylitol oligomers as metabolic intermediates. These xylosyl- xylitol intermediates are generated by diverse fungi and bacteria, indicating that xylodextrin reduction is widespread in nature. Xylodextrins and xylosyl-xylitol oligomers are then hydrolyzed by two hydrolases to generate intracellular xylose and xylitol. Xylodextrin consumption using a xylodextrin transporter, xylodextrin reductases and tandem intracellular hydrolases in cofermentations with sucrose and glucose greatly expands the capacity of yeast to use plant cell wall-derived sugars and has the potential to increase the efficiency of both first-generation and next-generation biofuel production. © 2015, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

AB  - Growing heterotrophic algae in reactors with sugar as the energy and carbon source rather than sunlight and carbon dioxide is an approach being commercialized today. However, the full environmental impacts of this fuel pathway have not been explored. The objective of this analysis was to compare the life cycle impacts of algal biodiesel produced heterotrophically to a phototrophic pathway featuring algae grown in ponds. A third, hybrid approach utilizing algae capable of both phototrophy and heterotrophy was also explored. Sugar beet and sugarcane were examined as feedstocks for the heterotrophic process. The results indicate that a reduction in the global warming potential (GWP) and an improvement in the net energy ratio (NER) for algal biodiesel could be possible for the heterotrophic and hybrid pathways relative to the phototrophic, but only if reactor cultivation can be performed efficiently and with sugarcane as the feedstock. For example, the NER varies from 0.6 to 1.6 for the heterotrophic pathway, depending on reactor performance, compared to 1.3 for the phototrophic pathway. Sugar crops used as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation present concerns about land constraints that are less of an issue for the phototrophic pathway. No pathway presented a clear advantage for the water stress impact metric. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This article discusses the impact of oxygen (O2) enrichment on rotary kiln lump lime production. A predictive simulation tool is utilized to investigate the effect of O2 enrichment on the following key parameters of the lime process: kiln temperature profile, product quality, specific energy consumption and kiln production capacity. Three fuel mixes-100% coal, 90% coal and 10% waste derived fuel oil, and 90% coal and 10% sawdustare simulated at three oxygen levels. The oxygen levels represent three scenarios: no enrichment (21% O2), moderate enrichment (23% O2), and moderate-to-high enrichment (25% O2). This work is a part of the on-going efforts to reduce the environmental impact of industrial production. Reducing emissions, utilizing biofuels and waste derived fuels, full utilization of raw materials, and energy efficiency are areas of importance for industry. In the long term, oxyfuel technology, i.e., combustion with recirculated kiln gases and pure oxygen, could allow for near-zero emission production and carbon sequestration from industry and power production. In the short term, emission reductions in lime production must be achieved through other means, such as energy efficiency. As a step on the path to a near-zero emission lime plant, this paper describes an investigation of the influence of oxygen enrichment in rotary kiln lime production. The simulated results show positive effects of O2 enrichment, and the simulation results have been used by the kiln operator for in-house training. Results indicate that oxygen enrichment applied to lime production can reduce energy consumption and emissions. © 2015 American Society for Engineering Education. All rights reserved.

AB  - Progeny studies of Jatropha curcas and Pongamia pinnata were carried with respect to bioproductivity, pod and seed characters which is one of the selection methods in tree improvement programmes. Variations in bioproductivity and biodiesel parameters of both the plants were compared every 6 months for 4 years of investigation and analyzed by analysis of variance and correlation coefficient by Pearson’s method using software Graphpad instat 3.06 (for Windows and Mac). P. pinnata has better germination rate (71.4 %), 100 pod weight (PW) (311.59 g) and 100 seed weight (SW) (173.46 g) as compared to J. curcas for germination rate (43.2 %), 100 PW (111.29 g) and 100 SW (67.46 g). P. pinnata has strong correlation for plant height to canopy growth (CG) (0.948), collar diameter (CD) (0.994), number of branches per plant (NBP) (0.995) and to number of leaves per branch (NLB) (0.862) as compared to J. curcas which showed good correlation among plant height to CG (0.976), CD (0.970), NBP (0.988), NLB (0.920) and to number of pods per branch (0.657). However, J. curcas depicted negative correlation for pod breadth to seed length (SL) (−0.447), seed breadth (−0.248) and to seed thickness (ST) (−0.364) and among the 100 PW to SL (−0.199), ST (−0.220) and to 100 SW (−0.704). About 4 kg of P. pinnata seeds were required for each liter of crude oil which yields 896 ml of biodiesel on transesterification as compared to 5.66 kg of J. curcas seeds for a liter of crude oil, producing about 663 ml of biodiesel. The quality of biodiesel meets the major specification of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for biodiesel. The crude glycerin and seed cake obtained as byproduct during biodiesel production were also measured which can be purified and used in composting, animal feeds, pharmaceuticals and cosmetic industries. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage plays a major role in the global carbon cycle and is affected by many factors including land use/management changes (e.g., biofuel production-oriented changes). However, the contributions of various factors to SOC changes are not well understood and quantified. This study was designed to investigate the impacts of changing farming practices, initial SOC levels, and biological enhancement of grain production on SOC dynamics and to attribute the relative contributions of major driving forces (CO2 enrichment and farming practices) using a fractional factorial modeling design. The case study at a crop site in Iowa in the United States demonstrated that the traditional corn-soybean (CS) rotation could still accumulate SOC over this century (from 4.2 to 6.8 kg C/m2) under the current condition; whereas the continuous-corn (CC) system might have a higher SOC sequestration potential than CS. In either case, however, residue removal could reduce the sink potential substantially. Long-term simulation results also suggested that the equilibrium SOC level may vary greatly (∼5.7 to ∼11 kg C/m2) depending on cropping systems and management practices, and projected growth enhancement could make the magnitudes higher (∼7.8 to ∼13 kg C/m2). Importantly, the factorial design analysis indicated that residue management had the most significant impact (contributing 49.4%) on SOC changes, followed by CO2 Enrichment (37%), Tillage (6.2%), the combination of CO2 Enrichment-Residue removal (5.8%), and Fertilization (1.6%). In brief, this study is valuable for understanding the major forces driving SOC dynamics of agroecosystems and informative for decision-makers when seeking the enhancement of SOC sequestration potential and sustainability of biofuel production, especially in the Corn Belt region of the United States. © 2014.

AB  - The high oil content and suitable fatty acid composition of the seeds are two arguments to promote Jatropha curcas L. as a promising biodiesel crop. For seed yielding crops as J. curcas, it can be expected that successful pollination is a key process affecting oil yield and oil quality. Field experiments were conducted in Zambia to study the effects of different pollination treatments (autonomous autogamy, open natural, open pollen supplemented, self, and cross-pollination) on seed morphology, seed oil content (g), seed oil concentration (%), and oil fatty acid composition of J. curcas in 2- and 5-year-old plantations. For this experiment, 100 inflorescences per plantation were selected. Autonomous autogamy and self-pollination treatments reduced oil yield with 70 and 29 % respectively, compared to open pollination. Cross- and self-pollinations resulted in longer seeds than open pollination but did not affect oil content and concentration. The oil has high unsaturated fatty acid content (80 %) and is composed of nine fatty acids. Pollination treatments had an effect on fatty acid composition of oil from mature trees (5 years old), but had not for 2-year-old trees. The oleic acid content, a determinant fatty acid component for quality biodiesel production was lower for artificial self-pollination (9 % reduction) compared to open pollination. This research demonstrates that overall oil yield and quality are the highest under natural pollination. This shows the importance of safeguarding the quality and effectiveness of open natural pollination. This can be done by enhancing the presence of insects identified as J. curcas pollinators, particularly those pollinators enhancing cross-pollination. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The energy and the world food crises have ignited interest in algal culture for making biodiesel, bioethanol, biobutanol and other biofuels using the land that is not suitable for agriculture. Algal fuel is an alternative to fossil fuel that uses algae as its source of natural deposits. Microalgal lipids are the oils of the future for sustainable biodiesel production. One of the most important roles in obtaining oil from microalgae is the choice of species. A total of fifteen microalgal isolates, obtained from brackish and fresh waters, were assayed at the laboratory for their ability to high biomass productivity and lipid content. Only three microalgae were selected as the most potent isolates for biomass and lipid production. They have been identified as Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus quadri and Trachelomonas oblonga. All of them were cultivated on BG11 media and harvested by centrifugation. The dry weight of the three isolates was recorded as 1.23, 1.09 and 0.9 g/l while the lipid contents were 37%, 34% and 29%, respectively which can be considered a promising biomass production and lipid content. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - Globally, due to rising mobility in the future, the fuel demand will continue to increase significantly. Thus, in addition to other options, like efficiency increase, traffic reduction and relocation of transportation tasks as well as electro mobility, biofuels are strongly required to cover at least part of the expected additional fuel consumption in the years to come. But the respective options are controversially discussed. Thus, for benchmarking different biofuel options and concepts, a methodical approach for the technical, economic and environmental analysis and evaluation of future biofuel concepts has been developed. This easily transferable multi-criteria approach is based on technical development prospects along the overall fuel supply chain and applied for selected biofuel options (i.e. ethanol, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, synthetic natural gas) based on lignocelluloses' biomass (i.e. willow as short rotation crop) provided in Central Europe. For each of these investigated biofuel options, reference concepts are developed relevant for the short, medium and long term taking into account detectible technical development prospects. They are analysed and evaluated according to selected technical, economic and environmental parameters. Finally, an overall assessment is done for all concepts. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Giant Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus; M × g) is a key candidate energy crop for use in biomass to liquid fuel production. It is a naturally seed sterile triploid lacking genetic variation, the basis for selection. Therefore, induced mutation techniques are particularly important in M × g. The objective of this research was to induce variation in Freedom, an elite cultivar, through in vitro chemical mutagenesis. A previously-optimized in vitro propagation protocol for Freedom was used following the in vitro mutagenesis procedure. Immature inflorescence explants (2-3mm) and calli (2-3mm3) were treated with five mutagenic dose treatments [0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, and 3% (v/v) of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) for 90min] along with 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a carrier agent to determine the optimum mutagen dosage. The dose at which 50% of the calli/explants recovered (RP50) after the mutagen treatment was used as the optimum EMS dose. Calli and explants of M × g were treated with RP50, 2×RP50, and 3×RP50 EMS dosages, and subsequent regenerants that arose from explants/calli were transferred to soil. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to identify variants in the regenerated plants. Results showed variability among regenerants originating from EMS mutagenic treatments. Putative mutants of M × g may be useful for bioenergy research and functional genomics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Regional resource self-sufficiency has been proposed as a way to improve food security by lessening the demand on long-distance transport. An online tool, the Carrying Capacity Dashboard, was developed for Australian conditions in order to gauge self-sufficiency at three different scales: regional, state and national. It allows users to test a variety of societal behaviours such as diet, biofuel production, farming systems and ecological protection practices. Analysis developed from the Dashboard tests the effects of various resource consumption patterns on land carrying capacity. Findings reveal that Australia’s current carrying capacity is estimated to be over 40 million, but if calculated on a regional basis, this is reduced by almost half. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In Social-Economic-Natural Complex Ecosystem (SENCE) theory, regional metabolism is seen as an integral part of a complex network of interconnected natural, economic and societal subsystems. Analyzing regional metabolism within this network assists observers to understand the concept in a broader context. Some qualitative tools such as simple matrix operations have been adopted to explore such networks but related research is highly fragmented. Here the emphasis is put on a qualitative network model (QNM) that integrates the existing tools into a unified analytical framework. The tools in the QNM are organized into three levels: (1) dominance analysis focuses on how to measure the performance of each component of a network; (2) consistency analysis is used to test whether the interactions between network components are contradictory to the desired development direction for regional metabolism; and (3) sustainability analysis returns three sustainability benchmarks for regional metabolism. With the aid of these tools, QNM can comprehensively explore such networks from multiple perspectives. To test the QNM construct, we conducted a case study on the regional metabolism of bio-fuels from locally grown plant crops, a hotspot in regional environmental research. In the case study we screened key components for inconsistent variables, identified the relationships between components, and rated the sustainability of the regional bio-fuel metabolism system suggested by the model. This study demonstrated that our research approach can inform bio-fuel policy making. The QNM is helpful in the understanding of regional metabolism in the broader context of SENCE theory and may be used to improve regional environmental management and policy-making. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Core-shell Fe3O4@silica magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with a strong base, triazabicyclodecene (TBD), were successfully synthesized for harvesting microalgae and for one-pot microalgae-to-fatty acid methyl ester (FAME, or so-called biodiesel) conversion. Three types of algae oil sources (i.e., dried algae, algae oil, and algae concentrate) were used and the reaction conditions were optimized to achieve the maximum biodiesel yield. The results obtained in this study show that our TBD-functionalized Fe3O4@silica nanoparticles could effectively convert algae oil to biodiesel with a maximum yield of 97.1 %. Additionally, TBD-Fe3O4@silica nanoparticles act as an efficient algae harvester because of their adsorption and magnetic properties. The method presented in this study demonstrates the wide scope for the use of covalently functionalized core-shell nanoparticles for the production of liquid transportation fuels from algal biomass. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Native warm-season grasses (NWSG) currently are being promoted for livestock forage and biofuels feedstock in the Mid-South. However, there are no published data on how NWSG managed with livestock in the Mid-South may affect habitat for wildlife. We conducted a study to evaluate habitat for grassland songbirds and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in response to two cattle grazing treatments in NWSG pastures across three sites in Tennessee, 2010 and 2011. We evaluated vegetation composition and structure along with invertebrate availability during the primary nesting season for grassland songbirds and the typical brood-rearing season for the northern bobwhite. Grazing treatments included full-season (May to August) grazing and early-season (30 days beginning in May) grazing, after which subsequent growth was taken as a biofuel harvest postdormancy. Forage treatments included big bluestem/indiangrass mixture, switchgrass, and eastern gamagrass. Vegetation composition was dominated by the planted forages in all pastures. All forage types and both grazing treatments provided suitable structure for grassland songbirds and bobwhite during the primary nesting season. Full-season grazing maintained suitable structure through the brooding period, with greater openness at the ground level and angle of obstruction, as well as optimal vegetation height (<60 cm). Structure within early-season grazing treatments became dense after cattle were removed with less openness at ground level than what brooding bobwhites typically use. Invertebrate biomass was sufficient in all forage types and grazing treatments to support bobwhite broods. We recommend livestock producers in the Mid-South use full-season grazing that maintains grass height of approximately 40 cm in production stands of NWSG to maximize benefits for grassland birds and northern bobwhite. © 2015 Society for Range Management.

AB  - This article develops a "polymorphic" approach to policy analysis, that is, an approach that draws on multiple forms of spatial reasoning. Specifically, the proposed framework deploys scale and network not merely as epistemological devices that make sense of "horizontal" and "vertical" politico-institutional structures, but as co-constitutive ontological processes that involve an ever-shifting interplay among legacies, rhythms, and events. This polymorphic approach, we argue, facilitates the identification and the examination of the mobilization of social networks and of the attendant cross-scalar interactions that must be articulated whenever a given policy is framed as a sensible and politically viable place-based solution. The novel conceptual framework is then applied to the empirical investigation of the formulation of the complex moral, political, and economic environment that enabled the emergence of Ontario's controversial Ethanol in Gasoline Regulation. Our polymorphic approach reveals how this regulation is a (failed) attempt to reconcile Canada's legacy as a resource-based economy and Ontario's legacy as a manufacturing-based economy where value is added, with the need for more rational and less harmful resource extraction and for greener fuels that can sustain the current order. We build on the lessons drawn from this case study to suggest that our approach has wider applicability in that it can help create a process-oriented, dynamic, and multi-dimensional geography of policy-making. © The authors 2015.

AB  - Biogas slurry, as a quality organic fertilizer, is widely used on large scale livestock farmland in Southwest China. In the present study, slurry collected from anaerobic tank of dairy farm was used to irrigate farmland having typical purple soil in Chongquing, China. The study revealed that irrigation with biogas slurry increased soil ammonium nitrogen and soil nitrate by 47.8 and 19 % respectively as compared to control check. The average soil available phosphorus and soil phosphorus absorption co-efficientchanged slightly. Relative enzyme activities of N and P transformation were indicated by catalase, urease, invertase and phosphatase activity. Irrigation period and irrigation quantity were selected as variable factor. Catalase, invertase and urease activity was highest when irrigation period and irrigation quantitiy was 4 days and 500 ml; whereas highest phosphatase activity increased significantly in purple irrigated by biogas slurry. The result of the present study is helpful in finding optimum irrigation conditions required for enzyme activity within defined range. itfurther reveals that biogas slurry enriches soil with various nutrients by enhancing N, P content and enzyme activities as well as it also deals with large number of biogas slurry for protecting the environment. ©Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - A major constrain for sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) establishment as a reliable biofuel feedstock is the fast biomass degradation immediately after harvest due the high content of soluble sugars and their rapid fermentation that considerably decrease the actual ethanol yield. Such a drawback does not allow storing of sorghum for a reasonable period forcing the industry to process it immediately with consequent problems of handling, logistic, and plant size. Therefore, an appropriate harvesting and storage technique to prevent sweet sorghum juice degradation is urgently needed to ensure economic benefits to farmers. An efficient and cost-effective way to overcome this obstacle could be an on-farm storing system of undistilled ethanol from sweet sorghum juice, while the remaining bagasse could be ensiled and exploited for complementary energy generation. The objective of this study was to evaluate different harvest methods and storage techniques aiming to a low cost and efficient on-farm processing systems to store sweet sorghum biomass. Harvesting in the hard dough stage and defoliating the plants before juice extraction resulted in higher ethanol yield. The use of commercially available fructophilic yeasts allows maximizing undistilled ethanol yield and on-farm storing for about 1 year without spoilage. The residual bagasse was ensiled and inoculated with Lactobacillus bacteria commonly used in forage conservation which significantly improved its quality as feedstock for biogas fermenters. In conclusion, the integration of low-cost harvesting and storage techniques with the valorization of sweet sorghum by-products are worthwhile management strategies to be further developed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Simulating regional variations in gross primary production (GPP) and yields of major land cover types is complex due to differences in plant physiological properties, landscape topography, and climate gradients. In our study, we analyzed the inter-annual and inter-regional variation, as well as the effect of summer drought, on gross primary production and crop yields of 9 major land uses within the state-funded Bioenergy Region Bayreuth in Germany. We developed a simulation framework using a process based model which accounts for variations in both CO2 gas exchange, and in the case of crops, growth processes. The results indicated a severe impact of summer drought on GPP, particularly of forests and grasslands. Yields of winter crops, early planted summer grain crops as well as the perennial 2nd generation biofuel crop Silphium perfoliatum, on the other hand, were buffered despite drought by comparatively mild winter and spring temperatures. We estimated regional yield increases from SW to NE, suggesting a comparative advantage for these crops in the cooler and upland part of the region. In contrast, grasslands and annual summer crops such as maize and potato did not exhibit any apparent regional pattern in the simulations. The 2nd generation bioenergy crop exhibited significantly higher GPP and yields compared to the conventional bioenergy crop maize, suggesting that cultivation of S. perfoliatum should be increased for economic and environmental reasons, but additional study of the growth of S. perfoliatum is still required. © 2014, The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - Bioenergy cropping, like all agricultural practices, may lead to the release of greenhouse gases. This study was aimed at determining biomass and energy yields of reed canary grass (RCG) (Phalaris arundinacea), galega (Galega orientalis) and a mixture of these, and to relate these to fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, emitted from the soils. Plots including a bare fallow as control were established in 2008. Gases emitted from the soil surface were collected in closed chambers from May 2011 to May 2013, except during periods of snow cover, and analysed by gas chromatography. Seasonal and annual cumulative emissions of N2O and CO2 equivalents per unit energy yield were calculated. Soil moisture content, nitrate (NO3 −)-N and ammonium (NH4 +)-N were also determined. Both species composition and crop yields affected energy yields and N2O emission from the soil. The annual cumulative emissions from mixture were marginally lower than those from fertilized RCG soils. Fertilized RCG produced twice as much biomass and correspondingly higher nitrogen and energy yields, so its low emission of N2O per Mg of dry matter was not significantly different from that of the mixtures. Cropping an RCG–galega mixture for biofuel may replace N fertilizer input since it resulted in lowering N2O fluxes, but requires management to maintain grass as the major component in order to minimize N2O emissions. In a time of climate change, low-input bioenergy crops may be a suitable strategy for land left uncropped after ploughing for one season or longer. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is applied as a powerful analytic technique for the evaluation of the chemical composition of combustion aerosols emitted by off-road engines fuelled by diesel and biofuels. Particles produced by burning diesel, heated rapeseed oil (RO), RO with ethylhexylnitrate, and heated palm oil were sampled from exhausts of representative in-use diesel engines. Multicomponent composition of diesel and biofuel particles reveal the chemistry related to a variety of functional groups containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. The most intensive functionalities of diesel particles are saturated C–C–H and unsaturated C=C–H aliphatic groups in alkanes and alkenes, aromatic C=C and C=C–H groups in polyaromatics, as well as sulfates and nitrated ions. The distinguished features of biofuel particles were carbonyl C=O groups in carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes, esters, and lactones. NO2, C–N and -NH groups in nitrocompounds and amines are found to dominate biofuel particles. Group identification is confirmed by complementary measurements of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon, and water-soluble ion species. The relationship between infrared bands of polar oxygenated and non-polar aliphatic functionalities indicates the higher extent of the surface oxidation of biofuel particles. Findings provide functional markers of organic surface structure of off-road diesel emission, allowing for a better evaluation of relation between engine, fuel, operation condition, and particle composition, thus improving the quantification of environmental impacts of alternative energy source emissions. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial warm season grass capable of growth on marginal lands without major inputs of water and fertilizers. However, full utilization of its agronomic potential as a bioenergy crop requires improvement of its stand establishment, disease resistance, and prevention of the biomass yield variation from year to year. Our program focuses on the utilization of beneficial bacterial endophytes to enhance switchgrass performance under a low-input production system on marginal lands. We demonstrated earlier that inoculation of switchgrass cv. Alamo with a growth promoting endophyte, Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN (PsJN), can significantly enhance seedling vigor and plant growth under both in vitro and greenhouse conditions. In this study, we tested the effects of PsJN bacterization of switchgrass seedlings on stand establishment, plant growth, and biomass yield in three field experiments conducted over 2 years on highly fertile prime land, and on a former tobacco farm with low fertility soil. PsJN bacterization improved growth and development of switchgrass seedlings, significantly stimulated plant root and shoot growth, and tiller number on the low fertility soil (p < 0.001), and enhanced biomass accumulation on both poor (p < 0.001) and rich (p < 0.05) soils, with more effective stimulation of plant growth in low fertility soil than in high fertility soil. The study indicates the potential for the use of PsJN and/or other beneficial bacterial endophytes in the development of low-input switchgrass feedstock production systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - U.S. energy policy has seen a dramatic shift toward renewable fuels within the last 10 years. While much research has been conducted in regards to U.S. biofuel policies, a significant arena of debate has been neglected. A key argument in favor of domestic biofuel production is that it is a renewable path towards energy independence. However the inputs used in the production of biofuel feedstock, primarily fertilizer nutrients, are anything but renewable. With simple calculations, this paper shows that the U.S.’s current biofuel policy is heavily dependent on non-renewable nutrient inputs. Thus, the question of how renewable the current plant-based biofuels are needs to be asked. © 2015, International Atlantic Economic Society.

AB  - Laminaria japonica, brown algae, was used as a feedstock for fast pyrolysis in a bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) reactor by manipulating the pyrolysis temperature, feeding rate, and ratio of the fluidizing velocity to the minimum fluidizing velocity (U/Umf), which exhibited optimum operating conditions of a feeding rate of 600 g/h, a U/Umf of 18.3 and a pyrolysis temperature of 425 °C. The maximum yield of L. japonica-derived bio-oil (approximately 35 wt%) was lower than that of lignocellulose. When fractionated, the L. japonica-derived bio-oil was found to be composed of several major compounds, including cyclic aliphatic compounds, which were very different from aromatic molecules, the major compounds of lignocellulose-derived bio-oil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seaweed may be a source of third generation gaseous biofuel, in the form of biomethane. The scientific literature is sparse on the relative suitability of different varieties of seaweed to produce biomethane. This paper assesses the BMP (biochemical methane potential), ultimate analysis and theoretical yields of ten species of seaweed which may be found in commercial quantities around the coastline of Ireland. Saccharina latissima reported the highest BMP yield (ca. 342L CH4 kgVS-1). S.latissima if farmed, may produce 10,250m3 CH4 ha-1yr-1 (365GJha-1yr-1) which is in excess of all land based liquid biofuel systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The NBP (National Biofuel Policy) of Malaysia was established in 2006 to promote the sustainable production and utilization of environmentally friendly biofuels. Despite numerous government incentives and subsidies, biodiesel exports have declined significantly over the years. This paper seeks to critically examine challenges afflicting the biodiesel industry in Malaysia by analysing the key policies, framework and institutions in the country. High feedstock prices, competition with food, engine compatibility, fuel subsidies and crude oil prices were identified as the challenges hindering biodiesel development in Malaysia. The authors propose that environmental, socioeconomic and technological reforms are required to address the challenges and improve the long term prospects of the Malaysian biodiesel industry. Furthermore, the utilization of biodiesel in the Real sector, biodiesel infrastructure investments and technological innovations will safeguard Malaysia's energy security, promote cleaner environment, improve living standards and stimulate stakeholder participation in the future development, diffusion and adoption of biodiesel in Malaysia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Potential global biodiversity impacts from near-term gasoline production are compared to biofuel, a renewable liquid transportation fuel expected to substitute for gasoline in the near term (i.e.,from now until c. 2030). Petroleum exploration activities are projected to extend across more than 5.8billion ha of land and ocean worldwide (of which 3.1 billion is on land), much of which is in remote, fragile terrestrial ecosystems or off-shore oil fields that would remain relatively undisturbed if not for interest in fossil fuel production. Future biomass production for biofuels is projected to fall within 2.0 billion ha of land, most of which is located in areas already impacted by human activities. A comparison of likely fuel-source areas to the geospatial distribution of species reveals that both energy sources overlap with areas with high species richness and large numbers of threatened species. At the global scale, future petroleum production areas intersect more than double the area and a higher total number of threatened species than future biofuel production. Energy options should be developed to optimize provisioning of ecosystem services while minimizing negative effects, which requires information about potential impacts on critical resources. Energy conservation and identifying and effectively protecting habitats with high-conservation value are critical first steps toward protecting biodiversity under any fuel production scenario. © Published in 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Biomass Scenario Model (BSM) is a system-dynamics simulation model intended to explore the potential for rapid expansion of the biofuels industry. The model is not predictive - it uses scenario assumptions based on various types of data to simulate industry development, emphasizing how incentives and technological learning-by-doing might accelerate industry growth. The BSM simulates major sectors of the biofuels industry, including feedstock production and logistics, conversion, distribution, and end uses, as well as interactions among sectors. The model represents conversion of biomass to biofuels as a set of technology pathways, each of which has allowable feedstocks, capital and operating costs, allowable products, and other defined characteristics. This study and the BSM address bioenergy modeling analytic needs that were identified in recent literature reviews. Simulations indicate that investments are most effective at expanding biofuels production through learning-by-doing when they are coordinated with respect to timing, pathway, and target sector within the biofuels industry. Effectiveness metrics include timing and magnitude of increased production, incentive cost and cost effectiveness, and avoidance of windfall profits. Investment costs and optimal investment targets have inherent risks and uncertainties, such as the relative value of investment in more-mature versus less mature pathways. These can be explored through scenarios, but cannot be precisely predicted. Dynamic competition, including competition for cellulosic feedstocks and ethanol market shares, intensifies during times of rapid growth. Ethanol production increases rapidly, even up to Renewable Fuel Standards-targeted volumes of biofuel, in simulations that allow higher blending proportions of ethanol in gasoline-fueled vehicles. © This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae is a promising technology offering production of biofuels in a sustainable way. Thanks to the supercritical conditions applied, the recycling of water and nutrients including carbon capture becomes feasible1-2. Through HTL, the target bio-oil is generated together with process water containing valuable nutrients. In this study we have provided an environmentally friendly and resource efficient strategy to produce renewable microalgae biomass. Feasibility test on microalgae cultivation, using the nutrient-rich effluent from the HTL of same algal biomass, was performed in a 5L, flat panel airlift (FPA)-photobioreactor (PBR). 1g(DW) L-1d-1 of microalgae was the productivity average achieved with the diluted aqueous solution (25-fold). This is comparable to the productivity obtained with the standard growth medium even if an adaptation time of four days was necessary. Our results show that the nutrient rich HTL aqueous product of microalgal biomass conversion can replace to a great extent mineral salts of the culture medium. Together with an efficient water management, the nutrient recovery applied here promotes the recycling and prevents the release of waste materials and therefore shows the potential for driving the system towards a nutrient neutral production of biomass for biofuels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The primary focus of research and development toward algal biofuels has been the production of fuel from the lipid fraction, with the non-lipid biomass used for production of biogas, electricity, animal feed, or fertilizer. Since the non-lipid fraction comprises approximately half of the algal biomass, the development of processes to produce additional liquid fuel or higher value products is of interest. We evaluated several hydrolysis methods for the deconstruction of cell wall carbohydrates in residual algal biomass. The hydrolysate, which contains the released sugars, can be used as a fermentation feedstock. For all methods, hydrolysis rates and yields of released sugars were measured. The effects of temperature, acid concentration, and biomass loading on acid hydrolysis were studied. Combined severity factors, indicators of treatment intensities, were evaluated for their correlation to the hydrolysis outcome. An optimal enzyme mixture, which released sugars with an acceptable yield and rate, was found. The ability of the resulting hydrolysates to support the growth of an industrial yeast strain was tested and the levels of common fermentation inhibitors were examined. Of the conditions tested, the highest yield of released sugar (243.2. mg/g. biomass) was obtained with a one-step sulfuric acid process with 10% acid concentration at 90. °C for 5. h, while the maximum sugar release rate was obtained with 10% hydrochloric acid under the same conditions. This is the first process for conversion of residual algal biomass that does not require pretreatment and that results in a hydrolysate on which yeast can be grown with no added nutrients. Adapting a biorefinery concept by conversion of algal residue to value-added products may improve the process economics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There have recently been significant advances in bio-based production of chemicals from renewable resources. Microorganisms belonging to the genus Clostridium have been considered as one of the promising hosts for the production of desired chemicals of wide industrial use. Clostridium strains have capability to utilize diverse carbon sources, including C5 and C6 substrates, which thus allows production of chemicals from inexpensive and abundant biomass such as corn stover, straw, and woody waste. In addition, Clostridium strains naturally produce various chemicals, such as acetic acid, butyric acid, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 1,3-propanediol, 2,3-butanediol, and acetone. Recently, several important strategies for the metabolic engineering of Clostridium have been developed not only for the enhanced production of these natural products and but also for the production of non-natural isobutanol production. Here, we review the strategies employed for the development of metabolically engineered Clostridium strains for the production of such chemicals and provide future perspectives. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Three lipid extraction methods of hexane Soxhlet (Sox-Hex), Halim (HIP), and Bligh and Dyer (BD) were applied on freeze-dried (FD) and oven-dried (OD) Chlorella vulgaris biomass to evaluate their effects on lipid yield, fatty acid profile, and algal biodiesel quality. Among these three methods, HIP was the preferred one for C. vulgaris lipid recovery considering both extraction efficiency and solvent toxicity. It had the highest lipid yields of 20.0 and 22.0 % on FD and OD biomass, respectively, with corresponding neutral lipid yields of 14.8 and 12.7 %. The lipid profiling analysis showed that palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids were the major fatty acids in the algal lipids, and there were no significant differences on the amount of these acids between different drying and extraction methods. Correlative models applied to the fatty acid profiles concluded that high contents of palmitic and oleic acids in algal lipids contributed to balancing the ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and led to a high-quality algal biodiesel. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of integrating dairy and bioenergy systems on land use, net energy intensity (NEI), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A reference dairy farm system representative of Wisconsin was compared with a system that produces dairy and bioenergy products. This integrated system investigates the effects at the farm level when the cow diet and manure management practices are varied. The diets evaluated were supplemented with varying amounts of dry distillers grains with solubles and soybean meal and were balanced with different types of forages. The manure-management scenarios included manure land application, which is the most common manure disposal method in Wisconsin, and manure anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas. A partial life cycle assessment from cradle to farm gate was conducted, where the system boundaries were expanded to include the production of biofuels in the analysis and the environmental burdens between milk and bioenergy products were partitioned by system expansion. Milk was considered the primary product and the functional unit, with ethanol, biodiesel, and biogas considered co-products. The production of the co-products was scaled according to milk production to meet the dietary requirements of each selected dairy ration. Results indicated that land use was 1.6m2, NEI was 3.86MJ, and GHG emissions were 1.02kg of CO2-equivalents per kilogram of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) for the reference system. Within the integrated dairy and bioenergy system, diet scenarios that maximize dry distillers grains with solubles and implement AD had the largest reduction of GHG emissions and NEI, but the greatest increase in land use compared with the reference system. Average land use ranged from 1.68 to 2.01m2/kg of FPCM; NEI ranged from -5.62 to -0.73MJ/kg of FPCM; and GHG emissions ranged from 0.63 to 0.77kg of CO2-equivalents/kg of FPCM. The AD contributed 65% of the NEI and 77% of the GHG emission reductions. © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - This study focuses on the fire characteristics and carbon mass balance of dead leaves open burning from prescribed fires in mixed deciduous forest (MDF) in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. The leaf litter fuel load and leaf litter consumed in MDF was 5.31±1.51 and 3.23±1.87 t/ha respectively. The only top layer of biomass fuel was burnt due to the compactness and the leaf litter load is composed of a mixture of tree and bamboo leaves that the later had low heating value. In addition, the combustion factor of leaf litter burning was lesser than 60% and the low level of fireline intensity was 42 kW/min. Carbon analysis in leaf litter fuel consumed and residues after burning was 120.68±40.38 and 11.81±0.44 gC/m2. The amount of carbon output to oxidize to the atmosphere was 108.87±39.95gC/m2 that is 11 times higher than residues after burned. Mixed deciduous forest fires released carbon into the atmosphere for more than 90% of carbon in leaf litter consumed and 10% of carbon on ground soil by residues after burnt form.

AB  - Research efforts have recently been increasing to evaluate giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus L.) as a bioenergy feedstock and to develop recommendations for efficient management practices. The objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization on the yield and nutrient removal of giant miscanthus and the change in soil nutrient concentration during establishment of giant miscanthus in the Piedmont and Mountain Regions of North Carolina. Research sites were established at Mills River and Oxford, NC, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Yield and tissue nutrient content were determined after senescence. Giant miscanthus produced biomass dry yields of up to 24 Mg ha−1 during the third growing season. Fertilization with 45 kg N ha−1 increased yield by 46 % in 2010 at Oxford, but did not affect yield at Oxford in 2009 or at Mills River from 2008 to 2010. Fertilization with 147 kg P ha−1 increased yield by 32 % in 2008 at Mills River, but did not affect yield in 2009 or 2010 at either site. Mehlich-3 P concentration in the upper 20 cm of soil decreased after initial P applications, with no changes in the 0 P control plots detected during this study. Giant miscanthus successfully established at Mills River and Oxford, NC with minimal N and P fertilizer inputs on soils with low initial P concentration. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Plant cell walls have protective and structural functions conferring resistance to degradation. The lignin and hemicellulose network surrounding the cellulose microfibrils is insoluble unless subjected to harsh treatments. As lignin, pectin and xylan are effective barriers to cellulose extraction and hydrolysis, reducing their presence in cell walls improves saccharification. Microorganisms that can depolymerise lignin are of extreme interest to the biofuel industry. White rot fungi can be effective in pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass prior to saccharification. Here, we show the cumulative effects of pretreating biomass with two white rot fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes cingulata, on tobacco lines with reduced lignin or xylan, caused by suppression of the CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE, CINNAMATE-4-HYDROXYLASE, TOBACCO PEROXIDASE 60 or UDP-GLUCURONATE DECARBOXYLASE and on Arabidopsis thaliana with reduced de-esterified homogalacturonan content, obtained by overexpressing a pectin methyl esterase inhibitor or constitutively expressing the Aspergillus nigerPOLYGALACTURONASE II gene. Tests were extended to fresh material from an Arabidopsis mutant for a cell wall peroxidase. We demonstrate that fungal pretreatment is a reliable method of improving cellulose accessibility in biofuel feedstocks, fresh material and cell wall residues from different plants. These results contribute to the understanding of the consequences of primary and secondary cell wall perturbations on lignocellulosic biomass accessibility to white rot fungi and on saccharification yield. A comparison of the effects of P. chrysosporium and T. cingulata on tobacco saccharification also highlights the limitation of current knowledge in this research field and the necessity to systematically test culture conditions to avoid generalisations. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Emphasis is trending toward future bioenergy production being derived from cellulosic materials rather than starch from seed crops. The majority of research on perennial biomass production for conversion to ethanol or other biofuel has used warm-season grasses as the feedstock material. Some cool-season grasses also have great potential for biomass production, even in the southern prairie region. A study was conducted for 4 years to evaluate the dry matter production potential of several cool-season grass cultivars in west-central Kansas. Ten cultivars were grown at two locations, one an upland soil and the other a lowland soil, and harvested in late June from 2007 to 2010 when fully headed with mature seed. Three cultivars, one tall [Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Barkw. &amp; D.R. Dewey], intermediate [T. intermedium (Host) Barkw. &amp; D.R. Dewey], and western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Love], had the greatest biomass production with 4,525–4,840 kg ha−1 dry matter averaged over four years at an upland location. At a lowland location, three cultivars, either intermediate or tall wheatgrasses, averaged 5,340–5,490 kg ha−1 dry matter over the 4 years. During the particularly moist spring of 2007, three cultivars at the upland location and eight cultivars at the lowland location produced over 9,000 kg ha−1 dry matter. All cultivars increased in plant stand frequency from 2006 to 2011, except for the western wheatgrass and Russian wildrye [Psathyrostachys juncea (Fisch.) Nevski] cultivars that already had a high frequency before the first biomass harvest. These grasses may add versatility to production systems by not only serving as complementary forage for grazing or hay, but also by providing an alternative feedstock for cellulosic ethanol and combustion energy production. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a Brassicaceae that was commonly cultivated in Europe until the nineteenth century. Recently, it has received much interest as an alternative oil seed crop because of its particular oil composition and low requirements in terms of agronomic inputs and its resistance to some Brassicaceae-chewing insects. However, little is known about the consequences of its reintroduction on piercing-sucking insect pests that are not Brassicaceae specialists but that are likely to transmit phytoviruses. In this context, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the potential colonization of camelina by four major aphid species of northern France. Orientation tests, feeding behavior assessed by electrical penetration graph, and demographic bioassays showed that the polyphagous species Aphis fabae (Scop) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) were able to land, feed, and reproduce on the plant. They even fed and performed better on camelina than the Brassicaceae specialist Brevicoryne brassicae (L.). Surprisingly, to a lesser extent, C. sativa could also be a suitable host for the cereal specialist Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). The colonization ability of camelina by the different aphids is discussed in terms of the degree of specialization and physicochemical characteristics of the plant. Camelina may therefore constitute a reservoir for aphid species issued from surrounding crops and their associated pathogens. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - One of the most energy effcient systems of biofuel production uses the sugar extracted from sugarcane (Saccharum offcinarum L.) for fermentation into ethanol; while sugarcane will not grow in Canada, corn (Zea mays L.), another C4 crop can. The overall objective of our study was to determine if there was corn germplasm, adapted to the short-season regions of Canada, with high stalk sugar content. Thirty-nine genotypes from diverse backgrounds were evaluated for stalk sucrose accumulation and associated traits (juice percentage, plant height, weight, and moisture) in field trials from 2007 to 2009. Genotypic differences for stalk sucrose and juice percentage were highly significant. Mean stalk sucrose ranged from 5.1 to 16.4 Brix (oBx) and fresh biomass from 45 to 135 Mg ha–1 suggesting the presence of exploitable genetic variation. Mean stalk sucrose concentration was significantly higher in plants where pollination was prevented. Calculated sucrose yield of experimental hybrids ranged from 4.3 to 6.0 Mg ha–1. At the current conversion effciency, the products of sucrose and fresh biomass can be translated into 3600 L ha–1 ethanol plus 47 Mg ha–1 silage, indicating that this high stalk sugar corn (or “sugarcorn”) would be a valuable and an economically viable crop for Canada and elsewhere. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Summary: A key objective in microbial biofuels strain development is to maximize carbon flux to target products while minimizing cell biomass accumulation, such that ideally the algae and bacteria would operate in a photo-catalytic state. A brief period of such a physiological state has recently been demonstrated in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803 ΔglgC strain incapable of glycogen storage. When deprived of nitrogen, the ΔglgC excretes the organic acids alpha-ketoglutarate and pyruvate for a number of days without increasing cell biomass. This study examines the relationship between the growth state and the photo-catalytic state, and characterizes the metabolic adaptability of the photo-catalytic state to increasing light intensity. It is found that the culture can transition naturally from the growth state into the photo-catalytic state when provided with limited nitrogen supply during the growth phase. Photosynthetic capacity and pigments are lost over time in the photo-catalytic state. Reversal to growth state is observed with re-addition of nitrogen nutrient, accompanied by restoration of photosynthetic capacity and pigment levels in the cells. While the overall productivity increased under high light conditions, the ratio of alpha-ketoglutarate/pyruvate is altered, suggesting that carbon partition between the two products is adaptable to environmental conditions. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The interaction between scientific and technological knowledge facilitates exploration of new technological opportunities; however, gaps between them typically impede exploration of these opportunities. Scientific papers and technological patents record modern and advanced knowledge in scientific discovery and technological development; therefore, comparing their statuses can identify the gaps and explore potential technological opportunities. Because microalgal biofuels are a promising alternative energy resource devoid of territorial land use problems, this study applies text mining and an algorithm that can cluster objects of high-dimensional data to microalgal biofuel papers and patents, and explores their potential technological opportunities. The results demonstrate that a text-based clustering approach is appropriate for identifying scientific and technological applications for microalgal biofuels. The results indicate that microalgal photosynthesis and light utilization have abundant scientific outcomes for technological engineers to potentially apply. Technological opportunities exist in synthesis, harvesting, extraction, and lipid conversion. Scientific knowledge underlying biofuels accompanying high-value co-products of production require sustained exploration and reporting through research. These needs represent potential technological opportunities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent studies have introduced the metric GWPbio, an indicator of the potential global warming impact of CO2 emissions from biofuels. When a time horizon of 100 years was applied, the studies found the GWPbio of bioenergy from slow-growing forests to be significantly lower than the traditionally calculated GWP of CO2 from fossil fuels. This result means that bioenergy is an attractive energy source from a climate mitigation perspective. The present paper provides an improved method for quantifying GWPbio. The method is based on a model of a forest stand that includes basic dynamics and interactions of the forest's multiple carbon pools, including harvest residues, other dead organic matter, and soil carbon. Moreover, the baseline scenario (with no harvest) takes into account that a mature stand will usually continue to capture carbon if not harvested. With these methodological adjustments, the resulting GWPbio estimates are found to be two to three times as high as the estimates of GWPbio found in other studies, and also significantly higher than the GWP of fossil CO2, when a 100-year time horizon is applied. Hence, the climate impact per unit of CO2 emitted seems to be even higher for the combustion of slow-growing biomass than for the combustion of fossil carbon in a 100-year time frame. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Increasing demand for food and biofuel feedstocks may substantially affect soil nutrient budgets, especially in the United States where there is great potential for corn (Zea mays L) stover as a biofuel feedstock. This study was designed to evaluate impacts of projected stover harvest scenarios on budgets of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) currently and in the future across the conterminous United States. The required and removed N, P, and K amounts under each scenario were estimated on the basis of both their average contents in grain and stover and from an empirical model. Our analyses indicate a small depletion of soil N (-4 ± 35 kg ha-1) and K (-6 ± 36 kg ha-1) and a moderate surplus of P (37 ± 21 kg ha-1) currently on the national average, but with a noticeable variation from state to state. After harvesting both grain and projected stover, the deficits of soil N, P, and K were estimated at 114-127, 26-27, and 36-53 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in 2006-2010; 131-173, 29-32, and 41-96 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in 2020; and 161-207, 35-39, and 51-111 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in 2050. This study indicates that the harvestable stover amount derived from the minimum stover requirement for maintaining soil organic carbon level scenarios under current fertilization rates can be sustainable for soil nutrient supply and corn production at present, but the deficit of P and K at the national scale would become larger in the future. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The recent increase in corn ethanol production has drawn attention to the environmental sustainability of biofuel production. Environmental assessments of second-generation biofuel crops (SGBC) have focused primarily on greenhouse gas emissions and water quality. However, expanding the production of cellulosic biomass resources, especially those that require dedicated agricultural land, is also likely to have impacts on biodiversity. We developed an optimization framework for projecting the spatial pattern of SGBC expansion in the United States and intersected these predictions with occurrence data for at-risk species. In particular, we focused on two candidate perennial grass feedstocks, Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), and Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus). Tradeoffs between biodiversity and economic profitability are assessed using county level data sets of SGBC yield, agricultural land availability, land rents, and at-risk species occurrences. Results show that future SGBC expansion is likely to occur outside of the Corn Belt, where conventional biofuel feedstocks are currently grown. The set of at-risk species that could potentially be impacted is therefore likely to be different from the at-risk species prevalent in the agroecological landscapes of the Upper Midwest that are dominated by corn and soy production. The total number and type of potentially impacted taxa is influenced by several factors, including the total demand for cellulosic biomass, the type of agricultural land used for production, and the method for defining at-risk species. SGBC production is also concentrated in fewer counties when a national species conservation constraint is combined with a biofuel production mandate. This analysis provides a foundation for future research on species conservation in bioenergy production landscapes and highlights the importance of incorporating biodiversity into broader environmental assessments of biofuel sustainability. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Liquid biofuel production will likely have its greatest impact through the large-scale changes in land use that will be required to meet the production of this energy source. In this study, we develop a framework which integrates species distribution models, land cover, land capability and various biodiversity conservation data to identify natural areas with (i) a potentially high risk of transformation for biofuel production and (ii) potential impact to biodiversity conservation areas. The framework was tested in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, a region which has been earmarked for the cultivation of biofuels. We expressly highlight the importance of biodiversity conservation data that enhance the protected area network to limit potential losses by comparing the overlap of areas likely to become cultivated with (i) protected areas; (ii) biodiversity hot spots not currently protected; and (iii) 'ecological corridors' (areas deemed important for the migration of species and linkages between important biodiversity areas). Results indicate that the introduction of spatial filters reduced available land from 54% to 45%. Including all biodiversity scenarios reduced available land to 15% of the Eastern Cape should avoiding conflict with biodiversity conservation areas be prioritized. The assumption that agriculturally marginal land offers a unique opportunity to be converted to biofuel crops does not consider the biodiversity value attached to these areas. We highlight that decisions relating to large-scale transformation and changes in land cover need to take account of broader ecological processes. Determining the spatial extent of threats to biodiversity facilitates the analysis of spatial conflict. This article demonstrates a proactive approach for anticipating likely habitat transformation and provides an objective means of mitigating potential conflict with existing land use and biodiversity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The development of second-generation energy crops on marginal land relies on the identification of plants with suitable physiological properties. In this study, we measured and compared leaf photosynthesis and water use efficiency of 22 populations from three Miscanthus species, M. lutarioriparius, M. sacchariflorus, and M. sinensis, planted in two experimental fields located in Qingyang of the Gansu Province (QG) and Jiangxia of the Hubei Province (JH) in China. QG is located in the Loess Plateau, one of the world's most seriously eroded regions particularly abundant in semiarid marginal land. At both locations, M. lutarioriparius produced the highest biomass and had the highest photosynthetic rates (A), with the growing-season average of A reaching nearly 20 μmol m-2 s-1. Native to JH, M. lutarioriparius maintained a relatively high photosynthetic rate into the late growing stage in QG, for example, 15 μmol m-2 s-1 at temperature as low as 11.6 °C in October. All three species had higher water use efficiency (WUE) in semiarid QG than in warmer and wetter JH. In the late growing stage of M. lutarioriparius, instantaneous WUE (A/E) of the species nearly tripled in QG comparing to JH. Being able to maintain remarkably high photosynthetic rates when transplanted to a colder and drier location, these M. lutarioriparius populations serve as suitable wild progenitors for energy crop domestication in the Loess Plateau and other areas with the similar climates. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Many climate change mitigation strategies rely on strong projected growth in biomass energy, supported by literature estimating high future bioenergy potential. However, expectations to 2050 are highly divergent. Examining the most widely cited studies finds that some assumptions in these models are inconsistent with the best available evidence. By identifying literature-supported, up-to-date assumptions for parameters including crop yields, land availability, and costs, we revise upper-end estimates of potential biomass availability from dedicated energy crops. Even allowing for the conversion of virtually all 'unused' grassland and savannah, we find that the maximum plausible limit to sustainable energy crop production in 2050 would be 40-110 EJ yr-1. Combined with forestry, crop residues, and wastes, the maximum limit to long-term total biomass availability is 60-120 EJ yr-1 in primary energy. After accounting for current trends in bioenergy allocation and conversion losses, we estimate maximum potentials of 10-20 EJ yr-1 of biofuel, 20-40 EJ yr-1 of electricity, and 10-30 EJ yr-1 of heating in 2050. These findings suggest that many technical projections and aspirational goals for future bioenergy use could be difficult or impossible to achieve sustainably. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Perennial grasses have been proposed as viable bioenergy crops because of their potential to yield harvestable biomass on marginal lands annually without displacing food and to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction by storing carbon in soil. Switchgrass, miscanthus, and restored native prairie are among the crops being considered in the corn and agricultural regions of the Midwest and eastern United States. In this study, we used an extensive dataset of site observations for each of these crops to evaluate and improve the DayCent biogeochemical model and make predictions about how both yield and GHG fluxes would respond to different management practices compared to a traditional corn-soy rotation. Using this model-data integration approach, we found 30-75% improvement in our predictions over previous studies and a subsequent evaluation with a synthesis of sites across the region revealed good model-data agreement of harvested yields (r2 &gt; 0.62 for all crops). We found that replacement of corn-soy rotations would result in a net GHG reduction of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 with average annual yields of 3.6, 9.2, and 17.2 Mg of dry biomass per year for native prairie, switchgrass, and miscanthus respectively. Both the yield and GHG balance of switchgrass and miscanthus were affected by harvest date with highest yields occurring near onset of senescence and highest GHG reductions occurring in early spring before the new crops emergence. Addition of a moderate length rotation (10-15 years) caused less than a 15% change to yield and GHG balance. For policy incentives aimed at GHG reduction through onsite management practices and improvement of soil quality, post-senescence harvests are a more effective means than maximizing yield potential. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Annual row cropping systems converted to perennial bioenergy crops tend to accrue soil C, likely a function of increased root production and decreased frequency of tillage; however, very little is known about the mechanisms governing the accrual and stability of this additional soil C. To address this uncertainty, we assessed the formation and stability of aggregates and soil organic C (SOC) pools under switchgrass, giant miscanthus, a native perennial grass mix and continuous corn treatments in Michigan and Wisconsin soils differing in both texture and mineralogy. We isolated different aggregate size fractions, >2 mm, 0.5-2 mm, and <0.5 mm, using a procedure intended to minimize alterations to aggregate biological and chemical properties. We determined SOC, permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), and microbial activities (i.e. enzyme activities and soil respiration rates) associated with these aggregates. Soil type strongly influenced the trajectory of aggregate formation and stabilization with differences between sites in mean aggregate size, stability, SOC and microbial activity under perennial vs. corn cropping systems. At the Michigan site, soil microbial activities were highest in the >2 mm aggregates, and higher under the perennial grasses compared to corn. Contrastingly, in Wisconsin soils, microbial activities were highest in the <0.5 mm aggregates and evidence for soil C accrual under perennial grasses was observed only in a fast turnover pool in the <0.5 mm aggregate class. Our results help explain cross-site variability in soil C accrual under perennial bioenergy crops by demonstrating how interactions between belowground productivity, soil type, aggregation processes and microbial communities influence the rates and extent of SOC stabilization. Bioenergy cropping systems have the potential to be low-C energy sources but first we must understand the complex interactions controlling the formation and stabilization of SOC if we are to maximize soil C accrual. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Spathaspora passalidarum NN245 (NRRL-Y27907) is an ascomycetous yeast that displays a higher specific fermentation rate with xylose than with glucose. Previous studies have shown that its capacity for xylose fermentation increases while cell yield decreases with decreasing aeration. Aeration optimization plays a crucial role in maximizing bioethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Here, we compared the kinetics of S. passalidarum NN245 and Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis NRRL Y-7124 fermenting 15% glucose, 15% xylose, or 12% xylose plus 3% glucose under four different aeration conditions. The maximum specific fermentation rate for S. passalidarum was 0.153g ethanol/g CDW·h with a yield of 0.448g/g from 150g/L xylose at an oxygen transfer rate of 2.47mmol O2/Lh. Increasing the OTR to 4.27mmol O2/Lh. decreased the ethanol yield from 0.46 to 0.42g/g xylose while increasing volumetric ethanol productivity from 0.52 to 0.8g/Lh. Both yeasts had lower cells yields and higher ethanol yields when growing on xylose than when growing on glucose. Acetic acid accretions of both strains correlated positively with increasing aeration. S. passalidarum secreted lower amounts of polyols compared to S. stipitis under most circumstances. In addition, the composition of polyols differed: S. passalidarum accumulated mostly xylitol and R,R-2,3-butanediol (BD) whereas S. stipitis accumulated mostly xylitol and ribitol when cultivated in xylose or a mixture of 12% xylose and 3% glucose. R,R-2,3-BD accumulation by S. passalidarum during xylose fermentation can be as much as four times of that by S. stipitis, and R,R-2,3-BD is also the most abundant byproduct after xylitol. The ratios of polyols accumulated by the two species under different aeration conditions and the implications of these observations for strain and process engineering are discussed. Biotechnol.

AB  - Organic loading conditions are an important factor influencing reactor performances in methanogenic bioreactors. Yet the underlying microbiological basis of the process stability, deterioration, and recovery remains to be understood. Here, structural responses of the bacterial and archaeal populations to the change of organic loading conditions in a thermophilic anaerobic digester were investigated by process analyses and 16S rRNA gene-based molecular approaches. The biogas was produced stably without the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) at low organic loading rates (OLRs) in the beginning of reactor operation. Increasing OLR in stages disrupted the stable reactor performance, and high OLR conditions continued the deteriorated performance with slight biogas production and high accumulation of VFAs. Thereafter, the gradual decrease of OLR resulted in the recovery from the deterioration, giving rise to the stable performance again. The stable performances before and after the high OLR conditions conducted were associated with compositionally similar but not identical methanogenic consortia. The bacterial and archaeal populations were synchronously changed at both the transient phases toward the deteriorated performance and in recovery process, during which the dynamic shift of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens including the recently identified Methanomassiliicoccus might contribute to the maintenance of the methanogenic activity. The distinctive bacterial population with a high predominance of Methanobacterium formicicum as archaeal member was found for the deteriorated performance. The results in this study indicate the coordinated reorganization of the bacterial and archaeal populations in response to functional states induced by the change of organic loading conditions in the anaerobic digester. © 2014 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - This paper describes a novel surface immobilization method for live-cell imaging of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for continuous monitoring of lipid droplet accumulation. Microfluidics allows high-throughput manipulation and analysis of single cells in precisely controlled microenvironment. Fluorescence imaging based quantitative measurement of lipid droplet accumulation in microalgae had been difficult due to their intrinsic motile behavior. We present a simple surface immobilization method using gelatin coating as the "biological glue." We take advantage of hydroxyproline (Hyp)-based non-covalent interaction between gelatin and the outer cell wall of microalgae to anchor the cells inside the microfluidic device. We have continuously monitored single microalgal cells for up to 6 days. The immobilized microalgae remain viable (viability was comparable to bulk suspension cultured controls). When exposed to wall shear stress, most of the cells remain attached up to 0.1dyne/cm2. Surface immobilization allowed high-resolution, live-cell imaging of mitotic process in real time-which followed previously reported stages in mitosis of suspension cultured cells. Use of gelatin coated microfluidics devices can result in better methods for microalgae strain screening and culture condition optimization that will help microalgal biodiesel become more economically viable.

AB  - Currently, Jatropha seeds are mainly used to produce biodiesel, and a resultant press cake is obtained as a by-product. Jatropha press cake fractionation and conversion into various potential products using biorefinery, could improve the economic value of Jatropha seed. The objectives of this study were to calculate the potential generated income and economic value of products from Jatropha. These were classified into two product groups: 1) Rural products, and 2) Industrial products. The potential generated income is the summation of the net profit and the labour costs. Using the national gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as a reference, we calculated and compared the potential economic value, which expresses the number of people that could obtain a certain income for every hectare of Jatropha plantation, in five selected countries. These countries consisted of four developing countries: Tanzania, Mali, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia, and a developed country, the Netherlands. This study shows that the potential generated income from rural products per hectare of (imported) Jatropha was much lower than the income of one person in Indonesia and the Netherlands. In Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Mali, the potential economic value per hectare Jatropha suggests that manufacturing rural products can generate potential income for one person. Manufacturing industrial products can generate potential income for one person in the Netherlands and approx. 7-39 people in Indonesia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Mali. In conclusion, the potential generated income is highly dependent on the GDP per capita and the price of the selected products in each country. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper undertakes an environmental evaluation of bioethanol production, using wheat cultivated in Belgium. Cultivation steps are modelled using Belgian specific data. Wheat transformation in ethanol relies on industrial data. GHG emissions of the whole life cycle are calculated and compared with the default values given by the European Renewable Energy Directive. Belgian wheat bioethanol achieves a 5% higher GHG reduction than the one mentioned in the European directive but impact repartition is different with a higher importance of cultivation step in our case. Belgian wheat bioethanol complies with the current sustainability criteria but is also able to conform to further ones. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the importance of N fertilizers and associated emissions known as main important parameters. These analyses reveal non negligible variations and then a range of available GHG reduction when using wheat bioethanol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Most long-term global energy scenarios rely on biomass for a variety of possible uses, but there is unlikely to be enough to replace the majority of fossil fuel use in all sectors. Improving the understanding of the sustainable and realistic potential for biomass is crucial.We present a comprehensive, country-based, bottom-up assessment of the land-based global biofuel (bioethanol and biodiesel) potential, taking into account a range of scenarios with varying yield gradients, land-use change and technology development, covering energy from both lignocellulosic and food crops as well as residues from agriculture and forestry. We have also gone beyond many other studies by analysing the potential for food crop based biofuels as well as lignocellulosic-sourced biofuels.We find a global biofuel supply potential increasing from 15-70EJ final transport fuel energy (30-140EJ primary energy) currently to 40-190EJ (130-400EJ) in 2070, depending on the development of land-use, productivity and technology mix. Over 3/4 of this potential comes from energy crops: up to 70% could come from food crops and at least 10% from lignocellulosic crops. The remaining quarter would be from agricultural and forestry residues. For comparison, current (2010) total global energy use (fuel, heat and electricity) stands at 365EJ final energy (530EJ primary energy). Depending on demand developments, countries such as Brazil or Russia could become net bioenergy exporters in the second half of the century, while others, such as India or Nigeria, may become net importers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of copper (Cu) fungicides in agriculture has led to Cu accumulation in European topsoils. This study is the first to investigate the in situ efficacy of biochar and biochar-compost as Cu immobilizers, reducing Cu uptake by plants and increasing microbial abundance and activity, in a temperate vineyard topsoil (0-10cm). After application of biochar, compost and biochar-compost in April 2011, plant and soil samples were taken in November 2011, April 2012, August 2012, and November 2012. Similar amounts of exchangeable Cu fractions (CuDTPA) in all treatments showed that there was no significant effect on Cu immobilization in soil. In contrast, cover crops grown between vine rows were observed to take up a significant amount of Cu (38.7mg Cu kg-1), reducing soil Cu concentrations over time. Treatments with biochar and/or compost initially increased total carbon, with compost and biochar-compost additionally increasing extractable organic carbon in soil. Compost and biochar-compost significantly increased microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), enzyme activities (phosphatase, arylsulfatase) and bacterial taxa abundances (Actinobacteria, α-Proteobacteria, β-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes). A high abundance of gram+ Actinobacteria in all treatments suggested that they are adapted to heavy metals, likely due to their specific cell membrane structures. Additionally, each treatment was characterized by a specific microbial community composition. Compost and biochar-compost increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes, while control and biochar increased Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria. In conclusion, biochar and/or compost were not viable Cu remediation options, but compost and biochar-compost provided ecosystem services by reinforcing the microbial community. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is widely recognized that a lack of social acceptance is likely to hinder the ability of governments to achieve policy targets concerning renewable energies. In this paper, we discuss the results of a pre- and post-test online survey that was conducted as part of the 2012 "Advanced Biofuels" deliberative democracy public engagement event in Montréal, Québec. The event sough to foster public learning and discussion in order to produce socially acceptable policy input for one type of renewable energy: advanced lignocellulosic biofuels. Survey results show that the majority of participants were strongly supportive of advanced lignocellulosic biofuel development in Canada after the deliberative event. By the end of the event, support also grew for current Canadian biofuel policies and many agreed that increasing biofuel production should be widely supported by the Canadian public. However, despite this support, about two thirds of participants revealed that they did not feel included in government decisions about biofuels. The gap between support after inclusive deliberation and expressed exclusion from Canadian government decisions points to the importance of fostering future citizen engagements in this area of renewable energy policy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The literature on food-biofuel price volatility spillovers is growing. Published articles so far have widely ignored nonlinearities and the influence of exogenous variables on volatility patterns. This article allows for these issues when characterizing EU biodiesel industry price dynamics. While Brazilian and US ethanol markets have been thoroughly investigated, less attention has been paid to EU biodiesel markets. Pure EU biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices are the object of our research. Two different methods are applied to model these data: a parametric approach and Long et al.'s (2011) semiparametric approach. Empirical results suggest significant asymmetries in volatility spillovers between pure biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices. Rapeseed stock levels and euro/dollar exchange rates are found to play a significant role in reducing food and biofuel price volatilities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (WOSR) is an important oil and protein crop in Europe, used in biofuel production and as protein source in livestock farming. In contrast to cereals, WOSR seed yields are still increasing in most countries but yield stability was not improved during the last decades.In our study, we analyzed the effects of weather conditions during different growth stages on maximum seed yield, maximum oil yield, number of seeds per m2 and 1000-seed weight to get further information on yield formation processes.Field trials performed at 34 environments (site×year combinations) representing different soil characteristics and climate regions in Germany were used for the analysis. About 40% of seed yield variability could be explained by weather conditions during specific growth phases. The most important phenological phases thereby were: onset of pods and seeds (BBCH 50-65) and seed development (BBCH 71-79). During onset of pods and seeds, yield was significantly influenced by temperature, radiation and drought stress. Assimilate availability during this phase determines the number of seeds per m2 (sink size). After flowering, only temperature significantly affected WOSR yield. Temperature is the major parameter determining the duration of growth stages. Lower temperature elongates the time of assimilate production and translocation to the seeds. During this growth stage, seed weight is determined. In our data sets, low sink size was not yield limiting due to compensatory effects between the yield components number of seeds per m2 and 1000-seed weight. Yield response pattern suggests that WOSR yield is predominantly source-limited, especially during the late reproductive phase. © 2015.

AB  - Arundo donax L. (Poaceae), giant reed, is a rhizomatous shrubby grass that is cultivated in subtropical and warm temperate regions for a multitude of uses. Recently, it has been identified as a leading sustainable, non-food crop for lignocellulosic biofuels due to its low ecological and agronomic demands. Lack of cold hardiness may limit its diffusion into colder areas of the transition zone. The objectives of this study were to (i) quantify freeze tolerance (LT50) of cold-acclimated and non-acclimated Arundo donax L. plants using reproducible, controlled environment conditions, (ii) determine the effect of prolonged exposure to freeze stress on tolerance by keeping plants at a constant, sublethal temperature and (iii) study the relationship of non-structural carbohydrates (total soluble sugars, glucose, fructose and sucrose) and proline accumulation with cold hardiness. In vitro-propagated plants of the Honduran and Hungarian ecotypes of Arundo donax L. were chosen for this study. Cold acclimation treatment was imposed for 1 week using a controlled environment chamber set at 10°C and with a 12-h photoperiod of 200 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation. Freeze tolerance ranged from -12·8°C (Honduran) to -16·4°C (Hungarian ecotype). In all the organs analysed, total soluble sugars significantly increased during cold acclimation, with concentrations between 1·8- and 4·7-fold higher than in non-acclimated plants. The higher concentrations of sugars and proline in cold-acclimated plants were positively associated with enhanced giant reed freeze tolerance (2·9°C lower). Our results confirm that during cold acclimation, metabolic changes related to increased freezing tolerance occur in giant reed. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Four high silica zeolites, i.e., HSZ-385, 890, 960, and 990 were utilized for the selective catalytic conversion of bio-oil from Fallopia japonica to certain chemicals in a fixed-bed reactor. The Beta-type HSZ-960 zeolite showed the highest selectivity to hydrocarbons, especially to aromatics as well as PAH compounds with the lowest unwanted chemicals while HSZ-890 showed high selectivity to aromatics. NH3-Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) analysis indicated that different amounts of acid sites in different zeolites determined the catalytic activity for the oxygen removal from bio-oil, in which the acid sites at low temperature (LT) region gave more contribution within the utilized temperature region. The reusability test of HSZ-960 showed the stability of hydrocarbons yield at higher temperature due to the significant contribution of coke gasification which assisted further deoxygenation of bio-oil. These results provide a guidance to select suitable zeolite catalysts for the upgrading of bio-oil in a practical process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are an attractive biofuel feedstock because of their high lipid to biomass ratios, lipid compositions that are suitable for biodiesel production, and the ability to grow on varied carbon sources. While algae can grow autotrophically, supplying an exogenous carbon source can increase growth rates and allow heterotrophic growth in the absence of light. Time course analyses of dextrose-supplemented Chlorella vulgaris batch cultures demonstrate that light availability directly influences growth rate, chlorophyll production, and total lipid accumulation. Parallel photomixotrophic and heterotrophic cultures grown to stationary phase reached the same amount of biomass, but total lipid content was higher for algae grown in the presence of light (an average of 1.90. mg/mL vs. 0.77. mg/mL over 5. days of stationary phase growth). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Greasy sludge was selected as feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high lipid content (44.4%) and low unsaponifiable matter. Maximum methyl esters yield (61%) was reached when processing the wet sludge using sulfuric acid as catalyst and n-hexane, followed by dried-greasy sludge catalyzed by Novozym®435 (57% methyl esters). Considering the economic point of view, the process using acid catalyst was more favorable compared to Novozym®435 catalyst due to the high cost of lipase. In general, greasy sludge (wet or dried) showed high potential to produce biodiesel. However, further technical adjustments are needed to make biodiesel production by in situ transesterification using acid and enzymatic catalyst feasible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Theory suggests that the influence of science on policy will be greater when scientific discourse is aligned with the language and meaning of wider social concerns. Seeking to assess whether scientists may be guided by such propositions in a controversial environmental policy arena, we examine the language and content of public-facing, UK scientific research grant abstracts on biofuels for the period 2007-2011, comparing these to stakeholder position statements and newspaper articles of the same period. We find that UK scientists have indeed broadly reflected societal concerns about biofuels during this period. However we also find that both science and society have paid less attention to procedural issues. We comment on the implications of the findings for the role of science in environmental policy development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Advanced biofuels, such as those obtained from microalgae, are widely accepted as better choices for achieving goals of incorporating renewables and non-food fuel sources into the transportation sector, and for overcoming land use issues due to biofuel crops. Main challenges are currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biofuels, since there are still some technical problems to overcome (e.g. the high energy consumption associated with biomass processing) and the majority of economic and financial analyses are based on pilot-scale projects. Therefore, this article presents the results of a Delphi study aiming to identify the main obstacles and most critical issues affecting the potential of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biodiesel and its incorporation into the fuel market. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first Delphi study with this objective. The respondents are worldwide market specialists in the survey themes that ranged from biofuels economics to their environmental sustainability. One of the key findings is that most of the experts believe that production of microalgae biofuels will achieve its full commercial scale until 2020, and that from 2021 till 2030 it could represent from 1% to 5% of the worldwide fuel consumption. The study results also showed that environmental issues are where expert opinion differs more. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The impact of energy crops and biofuel production on development, social welfare and conservation of ecosystems and ecological services has constituted a heated debate. At the center of these controversies is the development of agro-industrial plantations, particularly oil palm. To contribute to a better informed debate, we use existing data to analyze the socioeconomic impacts of the expansion of oil palm plantations in Colombia, the major producer of Latin America. We used the official database of socioeconomic indicators of municipalities for the period 1993-2009, and apply several descriptive and multivariate analyses. The results of the study confirm several issues found in the international literature: oil palm municipalities present lower levels of unmet basic needs and bigger fiscal incomes in comparison to municipalities where this crop is not cultivated. However, in Colombia depending on the region and time period, violence and land tenure concentration are higher in oil palm municipalities, which may help to explain the persistence of inequity and poverty in some areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The sustainability of biofuels produced from food crops has become a focus of public and scientific scrutiny in the past few years. In the case of ethanol production, advanced technologies aim at avoiding controversy by using instead cellulosic biomass contained in wastes, residues and dedicated energy crops. However, despite the positive expectations that drive the development of the so-called "cellulosic" ethanol, sustainability challenges remain to be elucidated. Expecting to contribute to closing the gap in the field of the social assessment of biofuels, this paper reports and analyses the results of a Delphi survey that explored the perception of biofuel experts from different countries on potential social impacts of cellulosic ethanol. The complexity of appraising impacts emerges as one important conclusion of the study along with the realisation that these will be context-specific. Except for the case of municipal solid waste used as feedstock, such a technological transition might not be able to ameliorate the issues already faced by conventional ethanol, especially when production is based in poorer countries. This is because impacts of cellulosic ethanol depend upon both the technical dimension of its production and the socio-political context of locations where production might take place. © 2014 Elsevier Inc..

AB  - Climate and land use changes greatly modify hydrologic regimes. In this paper, we modelled the impacts of biofuel cultivation in the US Great Plains on a 1061-km2 watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. The model was calibrated to monthly discharges spanning 2002-2010 and for the winter, spring, and summer seasons. SWAT was then run for a climate-change-only scenario using downscaled precipitation and a projected temperature for 16 general circulation model (GCM) runs associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios A2 scenario spanning 2040-2050. SWAT was also run on a climate change plus land use change scenario in which Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) replaced native range grasses, winter wheat, and rye (89% of the basin). For the climate-change-only scenario, the GCMs agreed on a monthly temperature increase of 1-2°C by the 2042-2050 period, but they disagreed on the direction of change in precipitation. For this scenario, decreases in surface runoff during all three seasons and increases in spring and summer evapotranspiration (eT) were driven predominantly by precipitation. Increased summer temperatures also significantly contributed to changes in eT. With the addition of switchgrass, changes in surface runoff are amplified during the winter and summer, and changes in eT are amplified during all three seasons. Depending on the GCM utilized, either climate change or land use change (switchgrass cultivation) was the dominant driver of change in surface runoff while switchgrass cultivation was the major driver of changes in eT. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Winter annual crops such as winter rye (Secale cereale L) can produce biomass feedstock on seasonally fallow land that continues to provide high-value food and feed from summer annuals such as corn and soybeans. As energy double crops, winter grasses are likely to be harvested while still immature and thus structurally different from the fully senesced plant material typically used for biofuels. This study investigates the dynamic trends in biomass yield, composition, and biological solubilization over the course of a spring harvest season. Results: The water soluble fraction decreased with increasing maturity while total carbohydrate content stayed roughly constant at about 65%. The protein mass fraction decreased with increasing maturity, but was counterbalanced by increasing harvest yield resulting in similar total protein across harvest dates. Winter rye was ground and autoclaved then fermented at 15 g/L total solids by either (1) Clostridium thermocellum or (2) simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF) using commercial cellulases (CTec2 and HTec2) and a xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. Solubilization of total carbohydrate dropped significantly as winter rye matured for both C. thermocellum (from approximately 80% to approximately 50%) and SSCF (from approximately 60% to approximately 30%). C. thermocellum achieved total solubilization 33% higher than that of SSCF for the earliest harvest date and 50% higher for the latest harvest date. Potential revenue from protein and bioethanol was stable over a range of different harvest dates, with most of the revenue due to ethanol. In a crop rotation with soybean, recovery of the soluble protein from winter rye could increase per hectare protein production by 20 to 35%. Conclusions: Double-cropping winter rye can produce significant biomass for biofuel production and feed protein as coproduct without competing with the main summer crop. During a 24-day harvest window, the total carbohydrate content remained relatively constant while the early-harvest yielded much higher carbohydrate solubilization for both C. thermocellum fermentation and SSCF. C. thermocellum fermentation achieved higher carbohydrate solubilization than SSCF across all growth stages tested. Although winter rye's yield, composition, and biological reactivity change rapidly in the spring, it offers a substantial and stable income across the harvest season and thus flexibility for the farmer. © 2015 Shao et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Microalgae hold great promise as a source of biofuels and biochemicals. The main obstacles to their industrial application are the high cultivation and downstream costs related to media and harvesting. In the work, we explored the multiple potentials of seawater to address key issues relating to the cultivation of Scenedesmus obliquus. Seawater can sufficiently replace some of the key elements in BG11 medium such as MgSO4, CaCl2, and NaCO3, and its use can significantly reduce the quantity of water required for the preparation of culture media. Among our results, the total chlorophyll content in cells grown in modified BG11 using 10 % (v/v) seawater was increased 1.47-fold without sacrificing biomass or lipid production. More than 70 % of the total algal biomass was auto-flocculated within one hour when cells were grown in seawater-supplemented media, which compares very favorably with a yield of only 3 % from cells grown in BG11. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Over half of all wood harvested worldwide is used as fuel, supplying ∼9% of global primary energy. By depleting stocks of woody biomass, unsustainable harvesting can contribute to forest degradation, deforestation and climate change. However, past efforts to quantify woodfuel sustainability failed to provide credible results. We present a spatially explicit assessment of pan-tropical woodfuel supply and demand, calculate the degree to which woodfuel demand exceeds regrowth, and estimate woodfuel-related greenhouse-gas emissions for the year 2009. We estimate 27-34% of woodfuel harvested was unsustainable, with large geographic variations. Our estimates are lower than estimates from carbon offset projects, which are probably overstating the climate benefits of improved stoves. Approximately 275 million people live in woodfuel depletion 'hotspots' - concentrated in South Asia and East Africa - where most demand is unsustainable. Emissions from woodfuels are 1.0-1.2 Gt CO2e yr- (1.9-2.3% of global emissions). Successful deployment and utilization of 100 million improved stoves could reduce this by 11-17%. At US$11 per tCO2e, these reductions would be worth over US$1 billion yr - in avoided greenhouse-gas emissions if black carbon were integrated into carbon markets. By identifying potential areas of woodfuel-driven degradation or deforestation, we inform the ongoing discussion about REDD-based approaches to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Background: Diatoms are an ecologically relevant group of microalgae that are not commonly considered for bio-oil production even if they are responsible for massive blooms at sea. Seventeen diatom species were screened for their capacity to produce biomass and lipids, in relation to their growth rate. Triglyceride levels were also assessed as a preferential source of biofuels. Results: Using statistical analysis, two centric diatoms, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Cyclotella cryptica, were selected as good candidates for oil production. Lipid levels significantly increased when the two diatoms were cultivated in a two-stage process under nitrogen limitation. The effect was less pronounced in cultures where silicon was reduced to 20% of the standard supply. Nitrogen limitation did not affect growth rates but led to lipid remodeling and de novo synthesis of triacylglycerols. Conclusions: Triacylglycerols in T. weissflogii and C. cryptica can account for up to 82% and 88% of total glycerolipids, thereby suggesting that the two species are promising candidates for large-scale experimentation for biofuel production. © 2015 d'Ippolito et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Background: Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica L.) has emerged as a novel potential source of biodiesel in China, but the molecular regulatory mechanism of oil accumulation in Siberian apricot seed kernels (SASK) is still unknown at present. To better develop SASK oil as woody biodiesel, it is essential to profile transcriptome and to identify the full repertoire of potential unigenes involved in the formation and accumulation of oil SASK during the different developing stages. Results: We firstly detected the temporal patterns for oil content and fatty acid (FA) compositions of SASK in 7 different developing stages. The best time for obtaining the high quality and quantity of SASK oil was characterized at 60 days after flowering (DAF), and the representative periods (10, 30, 50, 60, and 70 DAF) were selected for transcriptomic analysis. By Illumina/Solexa sequencings, approximately 65 million short reads (average length∈=∈96 bp) were obtained, and then assembled into 124,070 unigenes by Trinity strategy (mean size∈=∈829.62 bp). A total of 3,000, 2,781, 2,620, and 2,675 differentially expressed unigenes were identified at 30, 50, 60, and 70 DAF (10 DAF as the control) by DESeq method, respectively. The relationship between the unigene transcriptional profiles and the oil dynamic patterns in developing SASK was comparatively analyzed, and the specific unigenes encoding some known enzymes and transcription factors involved in acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) formation and oil accumulation were determined. Additionally, 5 key metabolic genes implicated in SASK oil accumulation were experimentally validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our findings could help to construction of oil accumulated pathway and to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanism of increased oil production in developing SASK. Conclusions: This is the first study of oil temporal patterns, transcriptome sequencings, and differential profiles in developing SASK. All our results will serve as the important foundation to further deeply explore the regulatory mechanism of SASK high-quality oil accumulation, and may also provide some reference for researching the woody biodiesel plants. © 2015 Niu et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - In this work, neutral lipids (NLs) extraction capacity and selectivity of six solvents were firstly compared. In addition, an eco-friendly solvent combination of ethyl acetate and ethanol (EA/E) was proposed and tested for lipid extraction from Chlorella sp. cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds and effect of extraction variables on lipid yield were intensively studied. Results indicated that lipid extraction yield was increased with solvent to biomass ratio but did not vary significantly when the value exceeded 20:1. Lipid yield was found to be strongly dependent on extraction temperature and time. Finally, fatty acid profiles of lipid were determined and results indicated that the major components were octadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid, demonstrating that the lipid extracted from the Chlorella sp. cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds by EA/E was suitable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2015.

AB  - Climate and land use changes are key drivers of current biodiversity trends, but interactions between these drivers are poorly modeled, even though they could amplify or mitigate negative impacts of climate change. Here, we attempt to predict the impacts of different agricultural change scenarios on common breeding birds within farmland included in the potential future climatic suitable areas for these species. We used the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) to integrate likely changes in species climatic suitability, based on species distribution models, and changes in area of farmland, based on the IMAGE model, inside future climatic suitable areas. We also developed six farmland cover scenarios, based on expert opinion, which cover a wide spectrum of potential changes in livestock farming and cropping patterns by 2050. We ran generalized linear mixed models to calibrate the effects of farmland cover and climate change on bird specific abundance within 386 small agricultural regions. We used model outputs to predict potential changes in bird populations on the basis of predicted changes in regional farmland cover, in area of farmland and in species climatic suitability. We then examined the species sensitivity according to their habitat requirements. A scenario based on extensification of agricultural systems (i.e., low-intensity agriculture) showed the greatest potential to reduce reverse current declines in breeding birds. To meet ecological requirements of a larger number of species, agricultural policies accounting for regional disparities and landscape structure appear more efficient than global policies uniformly implemented at national scale. Interestingly, we also found evidence that farmland cover changes can mitigate the negative effect of climate change. Here, we confirm that there is a potential for countering negative effects of climate change by adaptive management of landscape. We argue that such studies will help inform sustainable agricultural policies for the future. © 2015 Princé et al.

AB  - In a joint NRL/Manila Observatory mission, as part of the Seven SouthEast Asian Studies program (7-SEAS), a 2-week, late September 2011 research cruise in the northern Palawan archipelago was undertaken to observe the nature of southwest monsoonal aerosol particles in the South China Sea/East Sea (SCS/ES) and Sulu Sea region. Previous analyses suggested this region as a receptor for biomass burning from Borneo and Sumatra for boundary layer air entering the monsoonal trough. Anthropogenic pollution and biofuel emissions are also ubiquitous, as is heavy shipping traffic. Here, we provide an overview of the regional environment during the cruise, a time series of key aerosol and meteorological parameters, and their interrelationships. Overall, this cruise provides a narrative of the processes that control regional aerosol loadings and their possible feedbacks with clouds and precipitation. While 2011 was a moderate El Ninõ-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) La Ninã year, higher burning activity and lower precipitation was more typical of neutral conditions. The large-scale aerosol environment was modulated by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and its associated tropical cyclone (TC) activity in a manner consistent with the conceptual analysis performed by Reid et al. (2012). Advancement of the MJO from phase 3 to 6 with accompanying cyclogenesis during the cruise period strengthened flow patterns in the SCS/ES that modulated aerosol life cycle. TC inflow arms of significant convection sometimes span from Sumatra to Luzon, resulting in very low particle concentrations (minimum condensation nuclei CN &lt; 150 cm-3, non-sea-salt PM2.5 &lt; 1 μg m-3). However, elevated carbon monoxide levels were occasionally observed suggesting passage of polluted air masses whose aerosol particles had been rained out. Conversely, two drier periods occurred with higher aerosol particle concentrations originating from Borneo and Southern Sumatra (CN &gt; 3000 cm-3 and non-sea-salt PM2.5 10-25 μg m-3). These cases corresponded with two different mechanisms of convection suppression: lower free-tropospheric dry-air intrusion from the Indian Ocean, and large-scale TC-induced subsidence. Veering vertical wind shear also resulted in aerosol transport into this region being mainly in the marine boundary layer (MBL), although lower free troposphere transport was possible on the western sides of Sumatra and Borneo. At the hourly time scale, particle concentrations were observed to be modulated by integer factors through convection and associated cold pools. Geostationary satellite observations suggest that convection often takes the form of squall lines, which are bowed up to 500 km across the monsoonal flow and 50 km wide. These squall lines, initiated by cold pools from large thunderstorms and likely sustained by a veering vertical wind shear and aforementioned mid-troposphere dry layers, propagated over 1500 km across the entirety of the SCS/ES, effectively cutting large swaths of MBL aerosol particles out of the region. Our conclusion is that while large-scale flow patterns are very important in modulating convection, and hence in allowing long-range transport of smoke and pollution, more short-lived phenomena can modulate cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations in the region, resulting in pockets of clean and polluted MBL air. This will no doubt complicate large scale comparisons of aerosol-cloud interaction. © 2015 Author(s).

AB  - We develop an integrated framework to determine and compare greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities and production costs of cellulosic ethanol derived from corn stover, switchgrass, and miscanthus grown on high and low quality soils for three representative counties in the Eastern United States. This information is critical for assessing the cost-effectiveness of utilizing cellulosic ethanol for mitigating GHG emissions and designing appropriate policy incentives to support cellulosic ethanol production nationwide. We find considerable variations in the GHG intensities and production costs of ethanol across feedstocks and locations mostly due to differences in yields and soil characteristics. As compared to gasoline, the GHG savings from miscanthus-based ethanol ranged between 130% and 156% whereas that from switchgrass ranged between 97% and 135%. The corresponding range for GHG savings with corn stover was 57% to 95% and marginally below the threshold of at least 60% for biofuels classified as cellulosic biofuels under the Renewable Fuels Standard. Estimates of the costs of producing ethanol relative to gasoline imply an abatement cost of at least $48 Mg-1 of GHG emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent) abated and can be used to infer the minimum carbon tax rate needed to induce consumption of cellulosic ethanol. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Initially an explanation is given for how the expert interviews were conducted and structured within this main empirical chapter. The strategy for identifying the experts that were interviewed is elaborated upon the evaluation of the recorded and transcribed interviews by applying qualitative data analysis software is explained followed by a presentation of the reasons for the success of sugarcane over decades and centuries and its significance for the Brazilian agriculture and rural areas. From the initial governmental program Pro-Álcool to the recent crisis of the sugarcane sector the last three decades are explained in more detail. Yet the main focus of Chap. 4 is the empirical analysis of the data compiled. The qualitative data is presented as statements from the expert interviews and then matched with insights, statistical and other data from the literature review. With reference to the innovation system approach there are five 'physical' technologies (mechanization; cogeneration; new technologies; second generation biofuels and genetically modified cultivars) that are analyzed in detail. An assessment of the 'social' technologies with a national and international perspective (institutions, strategies and politics; laws, regulations and enforcement; industrial cooperation; concentration and internationalization; certification and market demand) follows. Subsequently these technologies and innovations and their interdependencies are evaluated in order to understand whether the sugarcane complex can be classified as an innovation system. The chapter concludes with analysis of the impacts of innovation on ecological, economic and social aspects in order to cover the multi-dimensionality of sustainability. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Background: The native ability of Clostridium thermocellum to rapidly consume cellulose and produce ethanol makes it a leading candidate for a consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) biofuel production strategy. C. thermocellum also synthesizes lactate, formate, acetate, H2, and amino acids that compete with ethanol production for carbon and electrons. Elimination of H2 production could redirect carbon flux towards ethanol production by making more electrons available for acetyl coenzyme A reduction to ethanol. Results: H2 production in C. thermocellum is encoded by four hydrogenases. Rather than delete each individually, we targeted hydrogenase maturase gene hydG, involved in converting the three [FeFe] hydrogenase apoenzymes into holoenzymes. Further deletion of the [NiFe] hydrogenase (ech) resulted in a mutant that functionally lacks all four hydrogenases. H2 production in δhydGδech was undetectable, and the ethanol yield nearly doubled to 64% of the maximum theoretical yield. Genomic analysis of δhydG revealed a mutation in adhE, resulting in a strain with both NADH- and NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activities. While this same adhE mutation was found in ethanol-tolerant C. thermocellum strain E50C, δhydG and δhydGδech are not more ethanol tolerant than the wild type, illustrating the complicated interactions between redox balancing and ethanol tolerance in C. thermocellum. Conclusions: The dramatic increase in ethanol production suggests that targeting protein post-translational modification is a promising new approach for simultaneous inactivation of multiple enzymes. © 2015 Biswas et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Biofuel production from food crops leads to debates about the increase in food prices and security of the food supply. On the other hand, biofuels derived from cellulosic (energy) crops offer positive environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mixed-integer optimization model to investigate the trade-offs and competition between biofuel and food production using switchgrass and corn. This model maximizes total economic and environmental benefits and provides optimal decisions regarding land allocations to food and energy crops, seeding time, harvesting time and amount, and budget allocations to farm operations. A piecewise linear lower approximation is developed to linearize the nonlinear revenue curve of corn grain sales. Spatio-temporal environmental impacts such as soil erosion prevention, carbon sequestration and emissions, and nitrogen pollution are included in the model. The application of the model in Kansas indicates that switchgrass is more profitable than corn in cropland, while it requires Conservation Research Program (CRP) incentives for production on marginal land unless priority is given to the environment. In order to ensure food security, our study advises managers and policy makers to provide CRP incentives or to adjust the sustainability factor, which restricts cropland availability for biofuel production. Our spatio-temporal optimization model can also be adapted to different regions with alternative energy and food crops under various management scenarios.

AB  - Exploring and developing sustainable and efficient technologies for biofuel production are crucial for averting global consequences associated with fuel shortages and climate change. Optimization of sugar liberation from wastewater algae through acid hydrolysis was determined for subsequent fermentation to acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4. Acid concentration, retention time, and temperature were evaluated to determine optimal hydrolysis conditions by assessing the sugar and ABE yield as well as the associated costs. Sulfuric acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.5. M, retention times of 40-120. min, and temperatures from 23. °C to 90. °C were combined to form a full factorial experiment. Acid hydrolysis pretreatment of 10% dried wastewater microalgae using 1.0. M sulfuric acid for 120. min at 80-90. °C was found to be the optimal parameters, with a sugar yield of 166.1. g for kg of dry algae, concentrations of 5.23. g/L of total ABE, and 3.74. g/L of butanol at a rate of USD $12.54 per kg of butanol. © 2014.

AB  - This work studies the supply allocation problem, using a Stackelberg game, for an established timberlands supply chain with an additional decision of new biorefinery investments. In a timberlands system, harvester and manufacturer decision makers have separate objectives to maximize their respective profits. This interaction is represented with a turn based Stackelberg game. The harvesters decide first on the quantity harvested, and the manufacturers decide on how much to utilize. This game is modeled with a bilevel mathematical program. The novel feature of this paper's bilevel formulation is the inclusion of parametric uncertainty in a two stage model. The first stage problem involves logistical decisions around biorefinery investments, such as location and capacity, while the second stage problem involves a bilevel timberlands model with parameter uncertainty. Studying this problem formulation revealed interesting insights for solving multiperiod problems with bilevel stages as well as the decision maker's behavior for the timberlands model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many environmentalists are concerned that renewable bioenergy, such as corn or wood ethanol will not reduce carbon emissions but will deplete forests. Using a general stylized forest sector management model, our study examines the economic potential of traditional industrial forests and supplemental dedicated fuelwood plantations to produce biomass on submarginal lands not suitable for most crop agriculture. The study finds that forests can economically produce large levels of biofuel without compromising crop production, thereby avoiding price pressures that lead to cropland conversion and carbon emissions. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Irrigation represents one of the main strategies to enhance and stabilize agricultural productivity, by mitigating the effects of rainfall vagaries. In the face of the projected growth in population and in biofuel demands, as well as shifts in climate and dietary habits, a more sustainable management of water resources in agroecosystems is needed. The field of ecohydrology, traditionally focusing on natural ecosystems, has the potential to offer the necessary quantitative tools to assess and compare agricultural enterprises across climates, soil types, crops, and irrigation strategies, accounting for the unpredictability of the hydro-climatic forcing. Here, agricultural sustainability and productivity are assessed with reference to water productivity (defined as the ratio between yield and total supplied water), yields, water requirements, and their variability—a crucial element for food security and resource allocation planning. These synthetic indicators are quantified by means of a probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development. The model results allow the interpretation of patterns of water productivity observed in Zea mays (maize) and Triticum aestivum (wheat), grown under a variety of soils, climates, and irrigation strategies. Employing the same modeling framework, the impact of rainfall pattern and irrigation strategy on yield and water requirements is further explored. The obtained standard deviations of yield and water requirements suggest the existence of a nonlinear tradeoff between yield stabilization and variability of water requirements, which in turn is strongly impacted by irrigation strategy. Moreover, intermediate rainfall amounts are associated to the highest variability in yields and irrigation requirements, although allowing the maximum water productivity. The existence of these tradeoffs between productivity, reliability, and sustainability poses a problem for water management, in particular in mesic climates. © 2014, Society for Mathematical Biology.

AB  - Mining activities result in extensive soil degradation by removing the top soil, disturbing soil structure and altering microbial communities. Rehabilitation of spent mine sites through revegetation thus requires proper soil amendments. In this study, a pot trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a jarrah biochar on the growth and nutrient status of a native legume, Acacia tetragonophylla, grown in a mixture of topsoil and mine rejects. Two biochar application rates (37 and 74 t ha−1) and two types of biochar, namely nutrient-enriched and non-enriched, were tested. We measured the soil pH and electrical conductivity, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and C and N isotope composition (δ13C and δ15N) of soil and plants, the foliar phosphorus content and the growth and leaf biomass of the plants. Whilst no significant effect of biochar was observed on plant growth, biochar amendment affected soil properties and plant nutritional status. The highest rate of biochar application increased soil pH, C content and C/N ratio, and decreased soil δ13C. Biochar application also enhanced photosynthetic N use efficiency, as showed by the increase in foliar C/N ratio, and biological N fixation rates, as indicated by foliar δ15N. These positive effects were not observed when biochar was nutrient-enriched due to the associated increase in soil N. Revegetation of mine sites with acacia in combination with biochar amendment constitutes a plausible alternative to the wide use of N fertiliser through the supply of additional N to the system, even though other nutrients may be required in order to enhance plant early growth. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Renewable energy sources such as biomasses can play a pivotal role to ensure security of energy supply and reduce greenhouse gases through the substitution of fossil fuels. At present, bioenergy is mainly derived from cultivated crops that mirror the environmental impacts from the intensification of agricultural systems for food production. Instead, biomass from perennial herbaceous species growing in wetland ecosystems and marginal lands has recently aroused interest as bioenergy for electricity and heat, methane and 2nd-generation bioethanol. The aim of this paper is to assess, at local scale, the energy potential of wetland vegetation growing along the minor hydrographic network of a reclamation area in Northeast Italy, by performing energy scenarios for combustion, methane and 2nd-generation ethanol. The research is based on a cross-methodology that combines survey analyses in the field with a GIS-based approach: the former consists of direct measurements and biomass sampling, the latter of spatial analyses and scaling up simulations at the minor channel network level. Results highlight that biomass from riparian zones could represent a significant source of bioenergy for combustion transformation, turning the disposal problem to cut and store in situ wetland vegetation into an opportunity to produce sustainable renewable energy at local scale. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Context: Understanding the consequences of changes in land use and land cover is among the greatest challenges in sustainability science, yet key themes related to land cover change are often left out of sustainability assessment tools. Because sustainability teaching is expanding at a rapid rate, incorporation of interdisciplinary, rigorous, quantitative tools to distinguish sustainable and unsustainable landscape change are needed. Objective: As a heuristic exercise, we contrast and synthesize two approaches to quantifying sustainability using a case study of palm oil and tropical deforestation in Borneo, Indonesia. Methods: First, we use Markovian land cover change analysis (from 2000 to 2010) to estimate changes in forest cover, project these rates of change into the near future, and estimate changes in carbon stocks due to palm oil conversion. Second, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions from a typical Indonesian palm oil biodiesel plantation using a life cycle assessment approach (LCA). Results: These two approaches show conflicting assessments for the carbon footprint of palm biodiesel: a sustainable endeavor when short-term global warming potential is evaluated yet highly unsustainable when rates of forest loss are measured. Furthermore, accounting for carbon that incorporated prior land cover dramatically altered sustainability assessments. Conclusions: Thus, integration of these two approaches reveals the importance of including both historic and future land cover changes into sustainability assessments. This synthesis demonstrates the importance of using a plurality of approaches from different disciplines when teaching sustainability, and highlights the unique role that landscape ecological approaches can play in sustainability assessments such as LCA. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels can potentially be improved by employing robust microorganisms and enzymes that efficiently deconstruct plant polysaccharides at elevated temperatures. Many of the geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) are surrounded by vegetation providing a source of allochthonic material to support heterotrophic microbial communities adapted to utilize plant biomass as a primary carbon and energy source. In this study, a well-known hot spring environment, Obsidian Pool (OBP), was examined for potential biomass-active microorganisms using cultivation-independent and enrichment techniques. Analysis of 33,684 archaeal and 43,784 bacterial quality-filtered 16S rRNA gene pyrosequences revealed that archaeal diversity in the main pool was higher than bacterial; however, in the vegetated area, overall bacterial diversity was significantly higher. Of notable interest was a flooded depression adjacent to OBP supporting a stand of Juncus tweedyi, a heat-tolerant rush commonly found growing near geothermal features in YNP. The microbial community from heated sediments surrounding the plants was enriched in members of the Firmicutes including potentially (hemi)cellulolytic bacteria from the genera Clostridium, Anaerobacter, Caloramator, Caldicellulosiruptor, and Thermoanaerobacter. Enrichment cultures containing model and real biomass substrates were established at a wide range of temperatures (55–85 °C). Microbial activity was observed up to 80 °C on all substrates including Avicel, xylan, switchgrass, and Populus sp. Independent of substrate, Caloramator was enriched at lower (<65 °C) temperatures while highly active cellulolytic bacteria Caldicellulosiruptor were dominant at high (>65 °C) temperatures. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Purpose: Previous estimates of carbon payback time (CPT) of corn ethanol expansion assumed that marginal yields of newly converted lands are the same as the average corn yield, whereas reported marginal yields are generally lower than the average yield (47–83 % of average yield). Furthermore, these estimates assumed that the productivity of corn ethanol system and climate change impacts per unit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain the same over decades to a century. The objective of this study is to re-examine CPT of corn ethanol expansion considering three aspects: (1) yields of newly converted lands (i.e., marginal yield), (2) technology improvements over time within the corn ethanol system, and (3) temporal sensitivity of climate change impacts.Methods: A new approach to CPT calculation is proposed, where changes in productivity of ethanol conversion process and corn yield are taken into account. The approach also allows the use of dynamic characterization approach to GHGs emitted in different times, as an option. Data are collected to derive historical trends of bioethanol conversion efficiency and corn yield, which inform the development of the scenarios for future biofuel conversion efficiency and corn yield. Corn ethanol’s CPTs are estimated and compared for various marginal-to-average (MtA) yield ratios with and without considering technology improvements and time-dependent climate change impacts.>Results and discussion: The results show that CPT estimates are highly sensitive to both MtA yield ratio and productivity of ethanol system. Without technological advances, our CPT estimates for corn ethanol from newly converted Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land exceed 100 years for all MtA yield ratios tested except for the case where MtA yield ratio is 100 %. When the productivity improvements within corn ethanol systems since previous CPT estimates and their future projections are considered, our CPT estimates fall into the range of 15 years (100 % MtA yield ratio) to 56 years (50 % MtA yield ratio), assuming land conversion takes place in early 2000s. Incorporating diminishing sensitivity of GHG emissions to future emissions year by year, however, increases the CPT estimates by 57 to 13 % (from 17 years for 100 % MtA yield ratio to 88 years for 50 % MtA yield ratio). For 60 MtA yield ratio, CPT is estimated to be 43 years, which is relatively close to previous CPT estimates (i.e., 40 to 48 years) but with very different underlying reasons.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering technological advances in understanding the climate change implications of land conversion for corn ethanol. Without the productivity improvements in corn ethanol system, the prospect of paying off carbon debts from land conversion within 100 years becomes unlikely. Even with the ongoing productivity improvements, the yield of newly converted land can significantly affect the CPT. The results reinforce the importance of considering marginal technologies and technology change in prospective life cycle assessment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: Rising corn prices in the USA due partly to increasing ethanol demands have led to a significant expansion of corn areas displacing natural vegetation and crops including cotton. From 2005 to 2009, cotton area harvested in the USA nearly halved with a reduction of 2.5 million hectares, while that of corn increased by 1.8 million hectares. However, environmental impacts of land shifts from cotton and corn have been largely neglected in literature.Methods: In this study, we evaluate the environmental properties of US corn and cotton production and implications of land cover change from cotton to corn using state-specific data and life cycle impact assessment. Focusing on regional environmental issues, we cover both on-farm direct emissions such as different types of volatile organic compounds and pesticides and indirect emissions embodied in input materials such as fertilizers. TRACI 2.0 is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of these emissions.Results and discussion: The results show that US cotton and corn productions per hectare on average generate roughly similar impacts for most impact categories such as eutrophication and smog formation. For water use and freshwater ecotoxicity, corn shows a smaller impact. When land shifts from cotton to corn in cotton-growing states, however, the process may aggravate most of the regional environmental impacts while relieving freshwater ecotoxicity impact. The differences in the two estimates are due mainly to underlying regional disparities in crop suitability that affects input structure and environmental emissions.Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of potential, unintended environmental impacts that cannot be adequately captured when average data are employed. Understanding the actual mechanisms under which certain policy induces marginal changes at a regional and local level is crucial for evaluating its net impact. Further, our study calls for an attention to biofuel-induced land cover change between crops and associated regional environmental impacts. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), straddling the northeastern parts of India near the foothills of the Himalayas, are one of the most densely populated and polluted regions on the globe, with consequent large anthropogenic emissions. In particular, the use of traditional biofuels in the rural areas along the plains leads to strong emissions of various pollutants. Due to this importance, a comprehensive study on the chemical characteristics of rainwater was carried out during southwest summer monsoon season of 2009 at two different locations over Varanasi, India, located in the middle of IGP region in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh. The rainwater samples were analyzed for major chemical constituents along with pH and its electric conductivity. The pH values ranged from 5.18 to 7.08 with a mean of 5.82 ± 0.45 suggest the alkaline nature of rainwater over Varanasi. During the study period, ~14 % rainwater samples were found to be acidic when the winds blew from south–southeast direction. The weighted mean pH and electric conductivity were found higher (5.92 ± 0.45) and (24.59 µS/cm) at Maldahiya site than Banaras Hindu University (5.89 ± 0.46) and (17.16 µS/cm) due to dominance of soil-derived particles. The equivalent concentration of ionic species is of the order: Ca2+ &gt; SO4 2− &gt; NO3 − &gt; Cl− &gt; Mg2+ &gt; Na+ &gt; HCO3 − &gt; NH4 + &gt; K+ &gt; F− &gt; H+. The weighted mean concentration of dominant ions in rainwater over Varanasi was Ca2+ (67.1 ± 56 µeq/l), SO4 2− (37 ± 23 µeq/l) and NO3 − (27.1 ± 28 µeq/l). Significant correlation (r = 0.81; P &lt; 0.001) between the sum of major cations (NH4 + + Ca2+ + Mg2+) and the sum of acidic species (SO4 2− + NO3 −) corroborates that these alkaline species may act as a neutralizing agent for the acidity of rainwater. The source contribution of SO4 2− in rainwater was estimated and was ~95 % by man-made activities, which is mainly derived from burning of fossil/biofuels over this region. The source of nitrate (11 %) emissions was mainly from automobiles and biomass burning. Statistical analysis such as principle component analysis was performed to find out possible sources of measured ions. First factor accounted for ~54 % variance suggested that most of the ions were from natural sources especially soil dust and sea; however, factor 2 accounted only for ~12 % variance suggests their sources from burning of fossil fuel and biomass. The third factor also indicates the mixed sources into the atmosphere. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) of winery organic waste, with reference to two Italian red and white grapes (i.e. Nero Buono and Greco) by-products was investigated. The study was carried out to verify the possibility to reduce the production impact in a green-waste-management-chain-perspective. The possibility to efficiently utilize wine-related-by-products for energy production at a micro-scale (i.e. small-medium scale winery production plant) was also verified. Results showed as a good correlation can be established between the percentage of COD removal and the biogas production, as the winery can produce, from its waste methanization, about 7800kWhyear-1 electrical and 8900kWhyear-1 thermal. A critical evaluation was performed about the possibility to utilize the proposed approach to realize an optimal biomass waste management and an energetic valorization in a local-energy-production-perspective. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sewage sludge management is a big problem all over the world because of its large quantities and harmful impact on the environment. Energy conversion through fermentation, compost production from treated sludge for agriculture, especially for growing energetic plants, and treated sludge use for soil remediation are widely used alternatives of sewage sludge management. Recently, in many EU countries the popularity of these methods has decreased due to the sewage sludge content (heavy metals, organic pollutions and other hazards materials). This paper presents research results where the possibility of solid recovered fuel (SRF) production from the separate fraction (10-40mm) of pre-composted materials - sewage sludge from municipal waste water treatment plant and biomass residues has been evaluated. The remaining fractions of pre-composted materials can be successfully used for compost or fertiliser production, as the concentration of heavy metals in the analysed composition is reduced in comparison with sewage sludge. During the experiment presented in this paper the volume of analysed biodegradable waste was reduced by 96%: about 20% of input biodegradable waste was recovered to SRF in the form of pellets with 14.25MJkg-1 of the net calorific value, about 23% were composted, the rest - evaporated and discharged in a wastewater. The methods of material-energy balances and comparison analysis of experiment data have been chosen for the environmental impact assessment of this biodegradable waste management alternative. Results of the efficiency of energy recovery from sewage sludge by SRF production and burning, comparison analysis with widely used bio-fuel-sawdust and conclusions made are presented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The literature on the impacts of biofuels on agricultural commodity prices is characterized by contradictory findings. We review studies published between 2007 and 2014 that estimate the effects of U.S. corn ethanol policy on corn prices and find estimates ranging from nil to over 80%. Such divergent results make it difficult to assess the merits of alternative biofuel policies. To bring more clarity to the issue and facilitate comparisons across studies, we assemble a database of over 150 medium-to-long run estimates of the effect of corn ethanol production on corn prices from 29 published studies. We first normalize corn price impacts by the change in corn ethanol volume to control for the large differences in ethanol quantities across scenarios. We then conduct a meta-analysis to identify the factors that drive the remaining variation in corn price impacts across studies. In addition to ethanol volumes, we find that modeling framework, projection year, inclusion of ethanol co-products, and biofuel production from other feedstocks explain much of the differences in price effects. The results indicate that a one billion gallon expansion of the US corn ethanol mandate in the year 2015 would lead to a three to four percent increase in corn prices, with smaller price changes projected in future years. © 2014.

AB  - In Brazil, local agricultural research agendas are increasingly challenged by the search for sustainable biodiesel crop options for family farmers, especially under semi-arid conditions. The aim of this paper is to explore the suitability of different biodiesel crops (i.e. soybean, castor bean and sunflower) through a set of environmental and socioeconomic indicators in a semi-arid (Montes Claros) and a more humid (Chapada Gaúcha) municipality in the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. A technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) was used to assess current (maize, beans, soybean and grass seed) and alternative (castor bean and sunflower) crops grown with current and alternative production techniques. The quantification of the inputs and outputs was based on farm surveys, expert knowledge, literature and field experiments. Although castor bean and sunflower are economically competitive with maize in Montes Claros, feed and labour requirements may hinder farmers' adoption. In Chapada Gaúcha, the double cropping system soybean/sunflower presented small economic gains when compared to soybean; it also increased nitrogen losses and biocide residues. We conclude that the scope for alternative and sustainable biodiesel crops on family farms is limited. Their economic benefits are small or absent, while their introduction can lead to higher environmental impacts and there may be trade-offs with food and feed availability at the farm level. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recently, microalgae was considered as a renewable energy for fuel production because its production is nonseasonal and may take place on nonarable land. Despite all of these advantages, microalgal oil production is significantly affected by environmental factors. Furthermore, the large variability remains an important problem in measurement of algae productivity and compositional analysis, especially, the total lipid content. Thus, there is considerable interest in accurate determination of total lipid content during the biotechnological process. For these reason, various high-throughput technologies were suggested for accurate measurement of total lipids contained in the microorganisms, especially oleaginous microalgae. In addition, more advanced technologies were employed to quantify the total lipids of the microalgae without a pretreatment. However, these methods are difficult to measure total lipid content in wet form microalgae obtained from large-scale production. In present study, the thermal analysis performed with two-step linear temeperature program was applied to measure heat evolved in temperature range from 310 to 351°C of Nostoc sp. KNUA003 obtained from large-scale cultivation. And then, we examined the relationship between the heat evolved in 310-351°C (HE) and total lipid content of the wet Nostoc cell cultivated in raceway. As a result, the linear relationship was determined between HE value and total lipid content of Nostoc sp. KNUA003. Particularly, there was a linear relationship of 98% between the HE value and the total lipid content of the tested microorganism. Based on this relationship, the total lipid content converted from the heat evolved of wet Nostoc sp. KNUA003 could be used for monitoring its lipid induction in large-scale cultivation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Yak dung is widely used for cooking and heating in Tibet. We measured real-time concentrations of black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5μm or less (PM2.5) emitted by yak dung burning in six households with different living conditions and stove types in the Nam Co region, Tibet. We observed a much lower average BC/PM2.5 mass ratio (0.013, range 0.006-0.028) from dung combustion in this area than previously reported estimates, ranging between 0.05 and 0.11. Based on our measurements, estimated fuel use, and published emission factors of BC and PM2.5, about 0.4-1.7Gg/year of BC is emitted by yak dung combustion in Tibet in addition to the previously estimated 0.70Gg/year of BC for Tibetan residential sources. Our survey shows that most residents were aware of adverse health impacts of indoor yak dung combustion and approximately 2/3 of residents had already installed chimney stoves to mitigate indoor air pollution. However, our measurements reveal that, without adequate ventilation, installing a chimney may not ensure good indoor air quality. For instance, the 6-h average BC and PM2.5 concentrations in a stone house using a chimney stove were 24.5 and 873μg/m3, respectively. We also observed a change in the BC/PM2.5 ratios before and after a snow event. The impact of dung moisture content on combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions needs further investigation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Here we assess 20 bioenergy crop accessions across 10 species, and examine the influence of weed management and annual harvest treatments over three growing seasons in Virginia and one season in Kentucky. Species in this study include: Andropogon gerardii, Arundo donax, Miscanthus×giganteus (sterile triploid and seeded tetraploid), Miscanthus sinensis (ornamental and naturalized), Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Panicum virgatum, Phalaris arundinacea, Saccharum sp., Sorghum bicolor and the unconventional choice of Sorghum halepense. There was a large difference in yield between locations at the end of the planting year, with all accessions producing equivalent or greater biomass in Kentucky. Weed management did not impact yield in the establishment year, as biomass was predictably low. After the third growing season, only A. gerardii and two accessions of naturalized M. sinensis had noticeable reductions in yield due to competition from weeds. After three growing seasons, we obtained the highest yields from M.×giganteus (63, 51 and 39Mgha-1 for 'Illinois', 'PowerCane' and 'Nagara' varieties, respectively), naturalized accessions of M. sinensis (54Mgha-1), and A. donax (39Mgha-1), using traditional cropping practices. Few accessions had low establishment rates limiting overall yields (&lt;10Mgha-1); however, when aboveground biomass was calculated on an individual plant basis, yields were comparable to high yielding species, encouraging further examination at higher population densities. Our results indicate that site characteristics such as soil parameters and water availability may be more important for yield than weed competition, especially over time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the storage dry matter (DM) losses for switchgrass bales that were preprocessed using an industrial baler technology prior to storage with three particles sizes of feedstock and two types of bale wraps. Mixed models were used to test difference in DM losses across the particle sizes, wrap materials, and storage days. Response functions were also estimated to determine DM losses for each particle size and wrap material at storage over time. DM losses were found to be different across particle size, wrap material, and storage period. Specifically, the DM losses were lower when the particle size of switchgrass baled decreased from full length to less than two centimeters. The results show switchgrass bales stored at the smallest particle size had lower DM losses than bales stored at the full length of feedstock. Also, applying additional film wrap that completely covers the net wrapped bale reduced DM losses relative to bales wrapped only in net. Furthermore, storage DM losses of preprocessed switchgrass bales increased linearly with days in storage. Our findings suggest that applying both net and film wrap to switchgrass bales composed by a particle size less than two centimeters can reduce DM losses during storage. Economic analysis indicates the price of switchgrass was also important in the choice of storage method for switchgrass. The results provide valuable insight into improving feedstock logistics and the feasibility of the advanced biofuels industry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The cultivation of dedicated bioenergy crops is being stimulated because of their potential to replace fossil fuels and to maintain or to sequester carbon (C) in the soil, and thus help to mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 levels. There are, however, still a lot of inaccuracies with regard to the dynamics of C in the soil, and thus with the potential to sequester soil C in these bioenergy crops. Using experimental data observed at the intensively monitored short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) plantation of the POPFULL project, we demonstrate that frequently neglected C pools and fluxes can be of crucial importance for the soil C balance. We highlight three specific cases. First, C inputs into the soil due to weed roots may equal or exceed those due to poplar fine roots, especially during the establishment phase of the plantation. Secondly, harvesting influences the dynamics of above- and belowground C inputs, as well as the soil environment. Large amounts of C are stored in the belowground woody biomass, which represents a long-term C pool. Thirdly, spatial differences related to the planting design are an important source of error in the upscaling of soil variables. We call upon researchers to consider and measure these neglected C pools and fluxes. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The integrated approach of wastewater treatment and microalgal biodiesel production based on phycoremediation is a promising process. The experiment was set up to study the phycoremediation potential of Chlorella minutissima to remove the pollution load from primary treated IARI's (Indian Agricultural Research Institute) wastewater and tertiary treated CETP (Common Effluent Treatment Plant) wastewater and evaluation of biomass for biodiesel after harvesting. The physical and chemical parameters of wastewater quality such as nitrate, phosphate, potassium, EC, TDS, BOD, COD, etc., were studied. C. minutissima removed about 90-98% TDS, 70-80% N, 60-70% P and 45-50% K from the wastewater within 12 days. The level of BOD and COD were reduced by 60 and 75%, respectively. The algal biomasses were harvested for biodiesel extraction. The highest specific lipid productivity for CETP and IARI wastewater was 0.171 and 0.132g-lipidsg-cell-1day-1, respectively. The oleic acid had increased 59.6% in CETP wastewater in comparison to IARI wastewater. The results of this study concluded that algal strain C. minutissima is not only a means for remediation of pollutant load, but it can also be used as potential driving force for biodiesel production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Decarbonisation of transport has become central to European Union policy. Biofuels are expected to represent a substantial part of the overall strategy towards diversifying Europe's energy supplies and curbing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way. This research deals with the dynamic simulation modeling of a biodiesel market as a part of transportation fuel market and analyses of various policy support instruments on increasing the proportion of biofuel in total transport fuel demand. The study is carried out for Latvia's road transport sector. After it had experienced generous financial support from the government allowing the industry to develop, support was abruptly stopped creating stagnation in both biodiesel supply and demand. This threatened the national transport policy goals. The goal of this research is to find the most effective policy strategies for achieving the national transport policy goals by applying system dynamics modeling to the current market conditions of transport fuels. Specifically, the primary focus of this paper is an attempt to gain insight into the long-term dynamic behavior of the biodiesel market in Latvia. The principal policy tools and mechanisms implemented can be summarized as: i) state subsidies at different levels and stages (i.e. the biodiesel production sector, the agricultural sector, and the end consumer sectors), ii) increasing the excise taxes on fossil fuels, iii) increasing the share of the biodiesel in the transportation fuel blend. The results obtained from model simulations confirm that promoting biofuel acceptance among end-users is the primary key issue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainability guidelines can help to safeguard the sustainable use of biological materials. When these guidelines are legally prescribed, their influence on the economic viability of bioenergy, biofuel and bioliquid projects is increased substantially, through their impact on national subsidy regimes and international trade. One of the key examples is the European directive 2009/28/EC, or the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), and the related COM/2010/11 that integrate guidelines for calculating greenhouse gas impact for various bioenergy pathways. This paper looks further into the sustainability results when influenced by principal decisions that are legally open for debate. Therefore, a concise review is conducted of the legal state-of-the-art on whether a product is waste or not. The review pinpoints uncertainty, leading to four potential legal scenarios. The sustainability of a complex biorefinery is analysed for each scenario. The results show (i) a high sensitivity to the principal decisions on the nature of waste materials in the scenarios, and (ii) to the definition of boundaries between the processes. More detailed rules for the application of the RED guidelines are needed, and should be complemented with methods specifically targeting all relevant sustainability aspects, thereby enhancing the overall understanding of the sustainability of the process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Liquefaction bio-oil (LBO) produced with ethanol (or acetone) as the solvent and pyrolysis bio-oil (PBO) produced at 550. °C (or 850. °C) from sewage sludge (SS) were produced, and were characterized and evaluated in terms of their heavy metal (HM) composition. The total concentration, speciation and leaching characteristic of HMs (Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Ni) in both LBO and PBO were investigated. The total concentration and exchangeable fraction of Zn and Ni in bio-oils were at surprisingly high levels. Quantitative risk assessment of HM in bio-oils was performed by the method of risk assessment code (RAC), potential ecological risk index (PERI) and geo-accumulation index (GAI). Ni in bio-oil produced by pyrolysis at 850. °C (PBO850) and Zn in bio-oil by liquefaction at 360. °C with ethanol as solvent (LBO-360E) were evaluated to possess very high risk to the environment according to RAC. Additionally, Cd in PBO850 and LBO-360E were evaluated by PERI to have very high risk and high risk, respectively, while Cd in all bio-oils was assessed moderately contaminated according to GAI. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marginal and degraded lands are expected to be important resources in the production of biofuel feedstocks in order to avoid real or perceived competition with food, feed and fiber production. Globally, there are millions of hectares of salt-affected land available for lignocellulosic feedstock production. Greenhouse experiments determined the effects of irrigating with water having different levels of salinity and sodicity on seedling emergence, plant growth, and cation balance in plant tissues in several populations of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link). The effect of salt stress on seedling emergence was more pronounced in switchgrass than prairie cordgrass with 31 and 15% reduction, respectively, compared with pure water. In a two-season greenhouse pot experiment, aboveground dry biomass production in control treatments was 8 and 21% higher in prairie cordgrass pc17-102 and pc17-109, respectively, than in EG 1102 switchgrass. Switchgrass EG 1102 produced greater biomass than prairie cordgrass populations when irrigated with moderately saline (5dSm-1) water, although differences were not detected with highly saline water (10dSm-1). Switchgrass EG 2101 emergence, plant growth and cation balance were severely affected by increasing levels of salinity. Overall, several prairie cordgrass populations and lowland switchgrass cultivars were found to have good emergence and high biomass production under moderate to high salt stress and may be good candidates for lignocellulosic feedstocks on salt-affected land. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of oxygenated biofuels reduces the greenhouse gas emissions; however, they also result in increased toxic aldehyde by-products, mainly formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and propionaldehyde. These aldehydes are carcinogenic and/or toxic and therefore it is important to understand their formation and destruction pathways in combustion and atmospheric systems. Accurate information about their infrared cross-sections and integrated strengths are crucially needed for development of quantitative detection schemes and modeling tools. Critical to the development of such diagnostics are accurate characterization of the absorption features of these species. In this study, the gas phase infrared spectra of propionaldehyde (also called propanal, CH3-CH2-CHO), a saturated three carbon aldehyde found in the exhaust emissions of biodiesel or diesel fuels, was studied using high resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy over the wavenumber range of 750-3300cm-1 and at room temperature 295K. The absorption cross sections of propionaldehyde were recorded at resolutions of 0.08 and 0.096cm-1 and at seven different pressures (4-33Torr). The calculated band-strengths were reported and the integrated band intensity results were compared with values taken from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) database (showing less than 2% discrepancy). The peak positions of the 19 different vibrational bands of propionaldehyde were also compared with previous studies taken at a lower resolution of 1cm-1. To the best of our knowledge, the current FTIR measurements provide the first highest resolution infrared cross section data for propionaldehyde. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Removal of crop residues has become common practice in arable systems, however, little is known about how soil arthropod communities change in response to reduced resource availability and habitat complexity associated with residue removal. We added maize residues to wheat and maize fields and investigated soil arthropod diversity and abundance over the period of one year. Residue addition did not affect the diversity and little affected the abundance of soil arthropods in wheat and maize fields with the latter being restricted to few taxonomic groups, suggesting that at least in the short-term soil arthropods benefit little from crop residue-mediated increase in food supply and habitat structure. Contrasting the minor effects of residue addition, densities of soil arthropods were much higher in wheat than in maize fields, presumably due to more dense and more continuous coverage by plants, and higher input of root residues. Furthermore, in wheat fields density of arthropods more strongly varied with season, presumably due to more pronounced pulses of root exudates and root residues entering the soil in wheat as compared to maize fields in summer and winter, respectively. Low density and little variation in densities of soil arthropods in maize fields reflect that environmental conditions and resource supply varied little with crop coverage and season. Overall, the results point to low importance of aboveground crop residues for soil arthropod communities and highlight that belowground plant resources, i.e. root exudates and root residues are the major driver of soil arthropod communities of arable systems. Thus, at least in short term removal of crop residues for e.g., biofuel production is likely to be of minor importance for soil arthropod communities. In contrast, changing crop species from wheat to maize markedly reduces the density of soil animals threatening the ecosystem functions they provide. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To better understand the photochemical production and diurnal distributions of organic and inorganic aerosols in the tropical coastal Indian atmosphere, the aerosol (TSP) samples were collected every 3h during 30-31 January, 14-15 February and 28-29 May 2007 from Chennai and studied for total carbon (TC) and nitrogen (TN) and their stable isotope ratios (δ13CTC and δ15NTN), carbonaceous components, inorganic ions, diacids, ketoacids and α-dicarbonyls. Time-resolved distributions of bulk parameters, inorganic ions, and diacids and related compounds, except for few species, did not show any clear diurnal trend but showed peaks at 6-9h during all the study periods, except for the peak at 15-18h on 28 May. SO42-, C2-C6 diacids, ketoacids and α-dicarbonyls in February and on 29 May showed a diurnal trend. δ13CTC and δ15NTN stayed relatively constant during the study periods but showed 13C depletion (in January) and 15N enrichment when TC and TN peaked. Based on these results together with air mass trajectories, we found that the diurnal distributions of Chennai aerosols are mainly influenced by land/sea breeze and the aged (photochemically processed) air masses, although in situ photochemical production and nighttime chemistry of secondary aerosol species, particularly C2-C4 diacids and SO42-, are significant. The characteristics of seasonal variations of carbonaceous components, and diacids and related compounds and comparisons of δ13CTC and δ15NTN of Chennai aerosols with the isotopic signatures of the point sources inferred that biofuel/biomass burning in South and Southeast Asia are the major sources of aerosols (TSP). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines the sustainability of phytoremediation for soils contaminated with heavy metals, especially the influence of management of the produced metal-enriched biomass on the environmental performance of the complete system. We examine a case study in Asturias (north of Spain), where the land was polluted with Pb by diffuse emissions from an adjacent steelmaking factory. A Phytoremediation scenario based on this case was assessed by performing a comparative life cycle assessment and by applying the multi-impact assessment method ReCiPe. Our Baseline scenario used the produced biomass as feedstock for an anaerobic digester that produces biogas, which is later upgraded cryogenically. The Baseline scenario was compared with two alternative scenarios: one considers depositing the produced biomass into landfill, and the other considers excavating the contaminated soil, disposing it in a landfill, and refilling the site with pristine soil. A sensitivity analysis was performed using different yields of biomass and biogas, and using different distances between site and biomass valorization/disposal center. Our results show that the impacts caused during agricultural activities and biomass valorization were compensated by the production of synthetic natural gas and the avoided impact of natural gas production. In addition, it was found that if the produced biomass was not valorized, the sustainability of phytoremediation is questionable. The distance between the site and the biomass processing center is not a major factor for determining the technology's sustainability, providing distances are less than 200-300. km. However, distance to landfill or to the source of pristine soil is a key factor when deciding to use phytoremediation or other ex-situ conventional remediation techniques. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents an alternative approach to assess the impacts of biofuel production using a method integrating the simulated values of a new semi-empirical model at the crop production stage within a life cycle assessment (LCA). This new approach enabled us to capture some of the effects that climatic conditions and crop management have on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, crop yields and other nitrogen (N) losses. This analysis considered the whole system to produce 1MJ of biofuel (bioethanol from wheat and biodiesel from rapeseed). Non-renewable energy use, global warming potential (GWP), acidification, eutrophication and land competition are considered as potential environmental impacts. Different co-products were handled by system expansion. The aim of this study was (i) to evaluate the variability due to site-specific conditions of climate and fertiliser management of the LCA of two different products: biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from wheat produced in the Basque Country (Northern Spain), and (ii) to improve the estimations of the LCA impacts due to N losses (N2O, NO3, NH3), normally estimated with unspecific emission factors (EFs), that contribute to the impact categories analysed in the LCA of biofuels at local scale. Using biodiesel and bioethanol derived from rapeseed and wheat instead of conventional diesel and gasoline, respectively, would reduce non-renewable energy dependence (-55%) and GWP (-40%), on average, but would increase eutrophication (42 times more potential). An uncertainty analysis for GWP impact showed that the variability associated with the prediction of the major contributor to global warming potential (soil N2O) can significantly affect the results from the LCA. Therefore the use of a model to account for local factors will improve the precision of the assessment and reduce the uncertainty associated with the convenience of the use of biofuels. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As part of an agreement during the COP15, the Brazilian government is fostering several activities intended to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of them is the adoption of anaerobic digester (AD) for treating animal manure. Due to a lack of information, we developed a case study in order to evaluate the effect of such initiative for beef cattle feedlots. We considered the net GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from the manure generated from 140 beef heifers confined for 90days in the scope "housing to field application" by including field measurements, literature values, and the offset generated by the AD system through the replacement of conventional sources of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and electricity, respectively. Results showed that direct GHG emissions accounted for 0.14 ± 0.06 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per kg of animal live weight gain (lwg), with ~80% originating from field application, suggesting that this emission does not differ from the conventional manure management (without AD) typically done in Brazil (0.19 ± 0.07 kg of CO2eq per kglwg-1). However, 2.4MWh and 658.0 kg of N-manure were estimated to be generated as a consequence of the AD utilization, potentially offsetting 0.13 ± 0.01 kg of CO2eqkglwg-1 or 95% (± 45%) of total direct emissions from the manure management. Although, by replacing fossil fuel sources, i.e. diesel oil, this offset could be increased to 169% (± 47%). In summary, the AD has the potential to significantly mitigate GHG emissions from manure management in beef cattle feedlots, but the effect is indirect and highly dependent on the source to be replaced. In spite of the promising results, more and continuous field measurements for decreasing uncertainties and improving assumptions are required. Identifying shortcomings would be useful not only for the effectiveness of the Brazilian government, but also for worldwide plans in mitigating GHG emissions from beef production systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major share of the area of hypoxic growth in the Northern Gulf of Mexico has been attributed to nutrient run-off from agricultural fields, but no estimate is available for the cost of reducing Gulf hypoxic area using agricultural conservation practices. We apply the Soil and Water Assessment Tool using observed daily weather to simulate the reduction in nitrogen loading in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) that would result from enrolling all row crop acreage in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Nitrogen loadings at the outlet of the UMRB are used to predict Gulf hypoxic area, and net cash farm rent is used as the price for participation in the CRP. Over the course of the 42. year simulation, direct CRP costs total more than $388 billion, and the Inter-Governmental Task Force goal of hypoxic area less than 5000 square kilometers is met in only two years. © 2014.

AB  - This work performs a cost evaluation of small-scale produced wood chips from forests in the Euro-Mediterranean region to be used for heating purposes. The study is focused on forests located in the Argençola municipality (Catalonia, northeastern Spain). The use of such easy-to-produce biofuel is appealing since it may be used as a valid substitute of heating oil to produce thermal energy in the same area where it is produced, thus minimizing transportation requirements and reducing dependence on the rising prices of heating oil. Additionally, it allows facing environmental and social concerns related to the current lack of management in the forests under analysis, which has led to an important increase in the biomass stock and wildfires risk. As wildfires in the Euro-Mediterranean region generate important impacts, an average economic cost of wildfires has been evaluated in this paper. The economic assessment of small-scale production and consumption of wood chips as proposed in this study has shown interesting economic benefits when compared with current heating oil prices. Results indicate that it is a realistic option since production costs range from 12.2€/GJ to 18.5€/GJ depending on the applied forestry practices, whereas current cost of heating oil is about 23.9€/GJ. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted to assess the impact of the data with higher uncertainty on the final results. It has been shown that the key factors that determine the viability of the proposed model are heating oil price, biomass stock growth rate, transportation requirements and applied forest management practices. Results presented prove that wood chips cost is quite independent of fossil fuel prices, thus higher fossil fuel prices greatly favors the use of wood chips when produced and consumed in the same area, thus minimizing transportation requirements. In addition, higher biomass growth rates than those considered in this work may reduce the final cost of small-scale produced wood chips. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) stems, being waste residues after harvesting starchy roots, are a potential biofuel resource. However high concentrations of ash and elements Cl, K, etc. in the stems may cause severe deposition, corrosion and particle emissions, in addition to slagging during combustion. This study tests washing by water as a pretreatment to reduce the problems. A 3-level full factorial designed experiment was conducted with washing time (< 1800 s) and temperature (20-40 °C) as factors and fuel characteristics as responses. The effect of milling particle size was also examined in a supplementary experiment. After washing, the net calorific value of the biomass tended to be higher, though not significant. Both washing time and temperature increased C but decreased H, while N and S content decreased with time only. A short washing of 50 s decreased the ash content by approximately 50% and Cl around 75%, followed by K and P that decreased to 50% after 5 min. Smaller milling size resulted in a larger amount of starch washed away, but no significant change in content of total ash and individual elements, except for Cl which was significantly higher in the smaller particles. The effect of washing on the ash composition is visualized in a ternary diagram, showing that the risk for slagging and fine particle emissions is reduced. A reduction in the risk of corrosion is also predicted as indicated by a relatively higher ratio of S/Cl and lower Cl/(K + Na). Thus, in addition to extraction of starch, the washing can also improve fuel quality of the residual biomass. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, online Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to generate the first comprehensive characterization of full-scale carbon contactors for siloxane removal from biogas. Using FTIR, two clear operational regions within the exhaustion cycle were evidenced: an initial period of pseudo-steady state where the outlet siloxane concentration was consistently below the proposed siloxane limits; and a second period characterized by a progressive rise in outlet siloxane concentration during and after breakthrough. Due to the sharp breakthrough front identified, existing detection methods (which comprise field sampling coupled with laboratory-based chromatographic determination) are insufficiently responsive to define breakthrough, thus carbon contactors currently remain in service while providing limited protection to the combined heat and power engine. Integration of the exhaustion cycle to breakthrough identified average specific media capacities of 8.5-21.5 gsiloxane, which are lower than that has been reported for vapour phase granular activated carbon (GAC). Further speciation of the biogas phase identified co-separation of organic compounds (alkanes and aromatics), which will inevitably reduce siloxane capacity. However, comparison of the five full-scale contactors identified that greater media capacity was accessible through operating contactors at velocities sufficient to diminish axial dispersion effects. In addition to enabling significant insight into gas phase GAC contactors, the use of FTIR for online control of GAC for siloxane removal is also presented. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Growing demand for energy has led to a rise in the price of fossil oil and an increased rate of depletion of fossil resources. This situation has generated a strong interest in the use of biofuel, and many studies have been undertaken on the worldwide potential for biofuel. Among all renewable energy sources, biomass could contribute to meeting the EU's renewable energy targets in 2020, especially short rotation coppice (SRC). In order to evaluate the energy and economic sustainability of woodchip production by black locust SRC, an ad hoc study was undertaken and a specific calculation model was developed. Data were collected in a black locust SRC plantation site in North West Italy during the period 2006-2012. This involved an SRC duration of six years and a biomass (10 Mg ha-1 DM per year) harvest at the end of a cycle (six years). The results indicated that black locust plantations are very desirable from an energy point of view since the output/input ratio results are higher than 20. Unfortunately, the results are not so positive from an economic point of view. In fact, in order to obtain economic sustainability for woodchip production, the biomass price should be at least €103 Mg-1 DM. Consequently, woodchip production by black locust SRC is only possible with economic support for production and with optimisation of agricultural labour and biomass production. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The resource efficiency of biofuel production via biomass pyrolysis is evaluated using exergy as an assessment metric. Three feedstocks, important to various sectors of U.S. agriculture, switchgrass, forest residue, and equine waste, are considered for conversion to bio-oil (pyrolysis oil) via fast pyrolysis, a process that has been identified as adaptable to on- or near-farm application. Biomass and biofuel production pathways are defined, material flows are determined, and exergy in- and outflows associated with biomass production and conversion are computed, including the depletion of exergy from its natural state (cumulative exergy demand, CExD). Sources of exergy depletion are quantified and categorized by energy carriers, e.g., electricity and diesel fuel, and materials, e.g., fertilizer, as well as renewable and nonrenewable resources. Yields for biomass to bio-oil conversion by fast pyrolysis are determined experimentally. Breeding factors, a measure of exergy production (the ratio of the chemical exergy of the output product to process exergy inputs), are determined for the production of biomass and bio-oil. The quantification of exergy depletion for process pathways enables the possible identification of more sustainable (resource efficient) pathways for biomass and bio-oil production. It is shown, for example, that feedstocks grown primarily for biomass such as switchgrass may be less sustainable using the exergy measure compared to use of residue (e.g., forest thinnings) or waste biomass (e.g., equine waste). With regard to the pyrolysis process, there is substantial reduction in exergy depletion when the coproducts noncondensable gases and biochar are recycled and utilized as a source of heat. The sustainability of biomass production and conversion, as measured by exergy depletion, is strongly influenced by energy carriers. The study reveals that the method of electricity production, i.e., on-site generation or grid electricity, as well as the choice of grid electricity can have a significant impact on sustainability. The exergy content of the bio-oil produced varies from 24 to 27 MJ/kg bio-oil, which is much lower than traditional fuels. However, the cumulative exergy depletion for the production and conversion to bio-oil varies from approximately 4 to 11 MJ/kg bio-oil, which is also much lower than traditional fuels. Breeding factors for biomass production and conversion to bio-oil based on cumulative exergy depletion vary from approximately 2 to 5, demonstrating the potential exergy benefit of bio-oil production using fast pyrolysis. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Atmospheric phosphorus fertilizes plants and contributes to Earth's biogeochemical phosphorus cycle. However, calculations of the global budget of atmospheric phosphorus have been unbalanced, with global deposition exceeding estimated emissions from dust and sea-salt transport, volcanic eruptions, biogenic sources and combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass, the latter of which thought to contribute about 5% of total emissions. Here we use measurements of the phosphorus content of various fuels and estimates of the partitioning of phosphorus during combustion to calculate phosphorus emissions to the atmosphere from all combustion sources. We estimate combustion-related emissions of 1.8 Tg P yr-1, which represent over 50% of global atmospheric sources of phosphorus. Using these estimates in atmospheric transport model simulations, we find that the total global emissions of atmospheric phosphorus (3.5 Tg P yr-1) translate to a depositional sink of 2.7 Tg P yr-1 over land and 0.8 Tg P yr-1 over the oceans. The modelled spatial patterns of phosphorus deposition agree with observations from globally distributed measurement stations, and indicate a near balance of the phosphorus budget. Our finding suggests that the perturbation of the global phosphorus cycle by anthropogenic emissions is larger thanpreviously thought. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing concern for the increase of the global warming effects due to anthropogenic activities raises the challenge of finding novel technological approaches to stabilize CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and counteract impinging interconnected issues such as desertification and loss of biodiversity. Biological-CO2 mitigation, triggered through biological fixation, is considered a promising and eco-sustainable method, mostly owing to its downstream benefits that can be exploited. Microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, green algae and some autotrophic bacteria could potentially fix CO2 more efficiently than higher plants, due to their faster growth. Some examples of the potential of biological-CO2 mitigation are reported and discussed in this paper.In arid and semiarid environments, soil carbon sequestration (CO2 fixation) by cyanobacteria and biological soil crusts is considered an eco-friendly and natural process to increase soil C content and a viable pathway to soil restoration after one disturbance event. Another way for biological-CO2 mitigation intensively studied in the last few years is related to the possibility to perform carbon dioxide sequestration using microalgae, obtaining at the same time bioproducts of industrial interest. Another possibility under study is the exploitation of specific chemotrophic bacteria, such as Ralstonia eutropha (or picketii) and related organisms, for CO2 fixation coupled with the production chemicals such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).In spite of the potential of these processes, multiple factors still have to be optimized for maximum rate of CO2 fixation by these microorganisms. The optimization of culture conditions, including the optimal concentration of CO2 in the provided gas, the use of metabolic engineering and of dual purpose systems for the treatment of wastewater and production of biofuels and high value products within a biorefinery concept, the design of photobioreactors in the case of phototrophs are some of the issues that, among others, have to be addressed and tested for cost-effective CO2 sequestration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for biofuels has been rising, which has led developing countries to focus on production of feedstocks for biodiesel and bioethanol production. This has caused concerns for the impacts on food security, food prices and environmental sustainability. This paper examines a hypothetical case of cassava-based bioethanol production in southern Mali, assessing its environmental, economic and social sustainability. Results demonstrate that environmental sustainability of cassava-based bioethanol production depends on the ‘baseline’ chosen: Compared to the situation before the decline in cotton production 10 years ago, the carbon stocks will increase. However, if compared to the current situation, where considerable carbon stocks have accumulated in fallow fields, the loss of carbon will be substantial. Increased cassava production will create greater incomes and better temporal distribution of labour input. Analysis of the significance of current cassava production for food security shows that bioethanol production should be based on the attiéké variety of cassava, thereby avoiding interference with the important role of the bonouma in assuring food security in northern Mali. The key factor determining the economic feasibility is whether local farmers will be willing to supply cassava at a realistic price. The results indicate that this is likely to be the case. © 2015 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.

AB  - By 2013, the wheat grain harvested area in Mexico was 683,044.42 ha, which represents 3.06% of the national area for agricultural purposes. At the end of each agricultural cycle, wheat straw is generated as biomass waste. Mexican farmers burn the wheat straw in the same place where it is generated, in order to clean and prepare the land for the next harvest. Hence, the aim of this work was to determine the amount of wheat straw generated at a national level, identify the states with high biomass potential, and estimate the energy potential. It was estimated that 4,612,950.23 t of wheat straw are generated in Mexico. Sonora and Baja California generated 61.69% of the wheat straw. The results highlighted 69.19 PJ per agricultural cycle, equivalent to 18.24% of the biomass energy share reported in Mexico's National Energy Balance, by 2013. The option to use this energy for electricity generation in a biomass power plant was assessed. It could potentially supply a national biopower industry with a total installed capacity of 728.05 MW. The waste biomass has been one of the best options to replace fossil fuel resources and is a sustainable activity that does not deplete future resources. © 2015 WIT Press.

AB  - The story of biofuels has been described as one of ‘riches to rags’ (Sengers et al., 2010). Initially cornucopian views of the potential of biofuels have been challenged under the weight of increasing speculation that their pace of development was racing ahead of understanding of the range of direct and indirect sustainability impacts of this technology. UK and EU targets for renewable fuels in the transport sector have further compounded perceptions of an unfettered dash for biofuels. Media headlines linking the rise of vast biofuel plantations in various parts of the world with rising food prices provoked a rapid shift in thinking about this technology in the second half of the 2000s. No longer is it possible to encounter the term ‘energy crops’ without some awareness of the potential conflict with the use of agricultural land for food encapsulated by the term ‘food vs. fuel’. Other social, environmental, economic and ethical challenges are emerging especially with respect to so-called ‘first generation’ biofuels produced from food crops. © Mohr A and Raman S.

AB  - This work presents the results of the pyrolysis of algal biomass obtained from high-rate algae ponds treating sewage. The two high-rate algae ponds (HRAP) were built and operated at the São João Navegantes Wastewater Treatment Plant. The HRAP A was fed with raw sewage while the HRAP B was fed with effluent from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The HRAP B provided higher productivity, presenting total solids concentration of 487.3 mg/l and chlorophyll a of 7735 mg/l. The algal productivity in the average depth was measured at 41.8 g·m -2 day -1 in pond A and at 47.1 g·m -2 day -1 in pond B. Algae obtained from the HRAP B were separated by the process of coagulation/flocculation and sedimentation. In the presence of alum, a separation efficiency in the range of 97% solid removal was obtained. After centrifugation the biomass was dried and comminuted. The biofuel production experiments were conducted via pyrolysis in a tubular quartz glass reactor which was inserted in a furnace for external heating. The tests were carried out in an inert nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 60 ml/min. The system was operated at 400, 500, and 600°C in order to determine the influence of temperature on the obtained fractional yields. The studies showed that the pyrolysis product yield was influenced by temperature, with a maximum liquid phase (bio-oil and water) production rate of 44% at 500°C, 45% for char and around 11% for gas. © 2015 Vargas e Silva and Monteggia.

AB  - Since 2008, and following dramatic increases in prices, international commodities markets systems have begun changing after decades of relative indifference. The reasons for high, volatile food prices are manifold and widely analyzed by the abundance of literature on the subject, that deals essentially with imbalances in demand and supply. On the global demand for food, a factor with a huge impact is the change in diet, especially in emerging countries where, an increase of per capita income corresponds to an increase in the demand for animal-based foods. As the demand for food increases, demand for land increases and pushes prices up, thus fuelling speculation that mainly affects countries where land prices are lower. The paper aims to highlight the behaviour of China and India –which are among the most important emerging countries in terms of economic growth, concentration of population and surface area – with regard to the large-scaleland investment phenomenon. We have aimed to identify those macroeconomic indicators (such as biofuels production, food price index, GDP per capita, cereals production and crude oil prices, usually referred to in order to explain the trend) which best exemplify how they can affect the two countries analyzed in the rush for land. The paper is divided into sections. Following a brief presentation of adopted methodology, an overall picture is presented of agriculture, renewable energy and land investment in China and India and, by means of a correlation matrix, the impact that some macroeconomic variables have on the phenomenon have been described. © 2015, Transition Academia Press.

AB  - The holistic study of soils requires an interdisciplinary approach involving biologists, chemists, geologists, and physicists, amongst others, something that has been true from the earliest days of the field. In more recent years this list has grown to include anthropologists, economists, engineers, medical professionals, military professionals, sociologists, and even artists. This approach has been strengthened and reinforced as current research continues to use experts trained in both soil science and related fields and by the wide array of issues impacting the world that require an in-depth understanding of soils. Of fundamental importance amongst these issues are biodiversity, biofuels/energy security, climate change, ecosystem services, food security, human health, land degradation, and water security, each representing a critical challenge for research. In order to establish a benchmark for the type of research that we seek to publish in each issue of SOIL, we have outlined the interdisciplinary nature of soil science research we are looking for. This includes a focus on the myriad ways soil science can be used to expand investigation into a more holistic and therefore richer approach to soil research. In addition, a selection of invited review papers are published in this first issue of SOIL that address the study of soils and the ways in which soil investigations are essential to other related fields. We hope that both this editorial and the papers in the first issue will serve as examples of the kinds of topics we would like to see published in SOIL and will stimulate excitement among our readers and authors to participate in this new venture. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Current biofuel prospects face many hurdles to becoming mass produced, such as ethanol which is lower in energy content and incompatible with the petroleum-based fuel infrastructure we live in. Consequently, the search is on for an organism that either produces naturally or can be engineered to produce a fuel source that is both comparable in energy content and compatible to the current petroleum-based infrastructure. The pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has long been a model species for studies of diatom growth, biochemistry, and lipid accumulation (e.g., triglycerides). In this study, we have used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to examine the hydrocarbons produced by P. tricornutum at 20 and 30 °C. P. tricornutum did indeed produce hydrocarbons similar to those found in petroleum-based fuels, namely octane (C8), undecane (C11), nonadecane (C19), and heneicosane (C21) at 20 °C. At 30 °C, however, the alkanes produced were instead heptadecane (C17), octadecane (C18), nonadecane (C19), and eicosane (C20). We also observed three alkenes—heptadecene (C17:1), octadecene (C18:1), and nonadecene (C19:1)—which were not present at the lower temperature. If having organisms such as P. tricornutum or other microalgae produce fuel products is the direct goal, then growth temperature may very well be an important factor to consider. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Purpose: Serpentine soils derived from ultramafic rocks release elevated concentrations of toxic heavy metals into the environment. Hence, crop plants cultivated in or adjacent to serpentine soil may experience reduced growth due to phytotoxicity as well as accumulate toxic heavy metals in edible tissues. We investigated the potential of biochar (BC), a waste byproduct of bioenergy industry in Sri Lanka, as a soil amendment to immobilize Ni, Cr, and Mn in serpentine soil and minimize their phytotoxicity.
Materials and methods: The BC used in this study was a waste byproduct obtained from a Dendro bioenergy industry in Sri Lanka. This BC was produced by pyrolyzing Gliricidia sepium biomass at 900 °C in a closed reactor. A pot experiment was conducted using tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) by adding 1, 2.5, and 5 % (w/w) BC applications to evaluate the bioavailability and uptake of metals in serpentine soil. Sequential extractions were utilized to evaluate the effects of BC on bioavailable concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Mn as well as different metal fractionations in BC-amended and BC-unamended soil. Postharvest soil in each pot was subjected to a microbial analysis to evaluate the total bacterial and fungal count in BC-amended and BC-unamended serpentine soil.
Results and discussion: Tomato plants grown in 5 % BC-amended soil showed approximately 40-fold higher biomass than that of BC-unamended soil, whereas highly favorable microbial growth was observed in the 2.5 % BC-amended soil. Bioaccumulation of Cr, Ni, and Mn decreased by 93–97 % in tomato plants grown in 5 % BC-amended soil compared to the BC-unamended soil. Sequentially extracted metals in the exchangeable fraction revealed that the bioavailabile concentrations of Cr, Ni, and Mn decreased by 99, 61, and 42 %, respectively, in the 5 % BC-amended soil.
Conclusions: Results suggested that the addition of BC to serpentine soil as a soil amendment immobilizes Cr, Ni, and Mn in serpentine soil and reduces metal-induced toxicities in tomato plants. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Over the last decade, emerging economic powers have become increasingly influential actors in the formerly closed circle of donor countries. In the frame of south-south cooperation initiatives, large economies in the global south are working with less advanced developing countries. While a significant literature on China's role regarding mining and oil and gas exploration in Africa has developed, an analysis of the new dynamics of South-South cooperation and its effect on the political economy and sustainability of rural development and energy diversification in African countries is largely absent. As an effort to start filling this gap, we analyze the opportunities and frictions introduced by Brazilian actors in the biofuel sector in a set of sub-Saharan African countries. By assessing the political, technical and economic dimensions present in Brazil's south-south cooperation strategy for this region, we find that the arrival of Brazilian biofuel actors to Africa is leading to deep asymmetries between powerful and less preeminent actors, undermining the overall sustainability of the offered development model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulose waste in nature is increasing due to the increasing activity of agroforestry. Up to 40% of lignocellulose biomass are consisted of xylan. Xylan complete breakdown requires the action of xylanase. Xylanase has been used to breakdown xylan into commercial product such as low calories sugar, prebiotic, and biofuel. Due to its wide application, several variation of xylanase characterization are needed. Our previous studies have collected Paenibacillus sp. XJ18 from TNBD forest, Jambi, Indonesia, to gain a unique enzyme characteristic. In this study the characteristic of crude xylanase from Paenibacillus sp. XJ18 was investigated. The highest activity of xylanase production was at 36 h. The xylanase showed activity in a broad range of pH (4.5-9.0). The highest activity showed at pH 5.0, 90 °C. Crude enzyme extract was unstable and had halftime at its pH and optimum temperature about 67 min. The xylanase activity was increased about 4.59 times after being concentrated by 70% acetone (2.4578 U/mL). Based on TLC result, xylanase from Paenibacillus sp. XJ18 was predicted to produce xylobiose exclusively from extracted corncob xylan. © 2015 Institut Pertanian Bogor

AB  - Chemically synthesized nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) probes derivatized with tetrasaccharides were used to study the reactivity of representative Clostridium thermocellum β-glucosidase, endoglucanases, and cellobiohydrolase. Diagnostic patterns for reactions of these different classes of enzymes were observed. Results show sequential removal of glucose by the β-glucosidase and a progressive increase in specificity of reaction from endoglucanases to cellobiohydrolase. Time-dependent reactions of these polysaccharide-selective enzymes were modeled by numerical integration, which provides a quantitative basis to make functional distinctions among a continuum of naturally evolved catalytic properties. Consequently, our method, which combines automated protein translation with high-sensitivity and time-dependent detection of multiple products, provides a new approach to annotate glycoside hydrolase phylogenetic trees with functional measurements. © 2015 Deng, Takasuka, Bianchetti, Bergeman, Adams, Northen and Fox.

AB  - The carbon (C) footprint of palm oil production is needed to judge emissions from potential biofuel use. Relevance includes wider sustainable palm oil debates. Within life cycle analysis, aboveground C debt is incurred if the vegetation replaced had a higher C stock than oil palm plantations. Our study included 25 plantations across Indonesia, in a stratified study design representing the range of conditions in which oil palm is grown. From allometric equations for palm biomass and observed growth rates, we estimated the time-averaged aboveground C stock for 25-year rotation and 95%-confidence interval to be 42.07 (42.04–42.10) Mg C ha−1 for plantations managed by company on mineral soils, 40.03 (39.75–40.30) Mg C ha−1 for plantations managed by company on peat, and 37.76 (37.42–38.09) Mg C ha−1 for smallholder oil palm on mineral soils. Oil palm can be established C debt-free on mineral soils with aboveground C stocks below these values; neutrality of mineral soil C pools was documented in a parallel study. Acknowledging variation in shoot:root ratios, the types of vegetation that can be converted debt-free to oil palm include grasslands and shrub, but not monocultural rubber plantations, rubber agroforest, and similar secondary or logged-over forests of higher C stock. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Because of the impending energy crisis and the environmental problems caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, biofuels produced from renewable energy biomass have been playing a more significant role in the world. This follows from their obvious environmental and economic advantages. Bioethanol, the most widely used transportation biofuel, is typically derived from plant-based feedstock sources such wheat, sugar beet, corn, straw, and wood. However, the main problem with bioethanol production is that despite the range of feedstock, raw material availability varies considerably from season to season, as there is no systematic framework. By combining technological paradigm theory with literature mining, we found that bioethanol feedstock production development has followed a three-stage trajectory, which is in accordance with the traditional technological paradigm - the S-curve. This new curve can be divided into BFDP (bioethanol feedstock development paradigm) competition, BFDP diffusion, and BFDP shift. Each phase has a different generation of feedstock; first-generation bioethanol in BFDP competition, second-generation bioethanol in BFDP diffusion, and third-generation bioethanol in BFDP shift. Further, based on the technological support, literature mining, and a realistic background, the second-generation bioethanol (mainly lignocellulosic biomass) is expected to continue to be a significant future trend in the world. The new BFDP framework presented in this paper may provide scholars with research ideas for the future.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis is a key step in bioethanol production. Efficient hydrolysis requires a consortium of different enzymes that are able to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. Myceliopthora thermophila is a promising candidate for the production of thermophilic cellulolytic enzymes, the use of which could reduce the cost of ethanol production. The growth conditions of the fungus were optimized in order to achieve increased secretion of extracellular cellulases. Optimal conditions were found to be 7.0% w/v brewer's spent grain as the carbon source and 0.4% w/v ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source. The cellulases obtained were characterized for their optimum activity. The optimum temperature and pH for cellulase activity are 65 °C and pH 5.5, respectively. Studies on thermal inactivation of the crude extract showed that the cellulases of M. thermophila are stable for temperatures up to 60 °C. At this temperature the half-life was found to be as high as 27 h. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose resulted in 31.4% hydrolysis yield at 60 °C after 24 h of incubation. Finally, the recalcitrance constant for cellulose and cellulose pretreated with ionic liquids was calculated to be 5.46 and 2.69, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents the first comprehensive estimates of the impact of U.S. biofuel subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions. Although U.S. support for biofuels is large and growing, the associated impact on greenhouse gas emissions remains unclear. The effect of biofuel subsidies on emissions is determined by the relative magnitudes of countervailing substitution and price effects. Regulators typically ignore the price effect of biofuel policies, and therefore do not fully account for market and climate impacts. We develop an economic simulation model of U.S. energy markets to estimate the impact of biofuel subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 through 2009. The model represents end-use consumption of oil, natural gas, coal and electricity in four sectors. We find that the subsidies for ethanol increased greenhouse gas emissions, while those for biodiesel have an ambiguous effect. Thus, ethanol subsidies create a green paradox. Although ethanol has lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline, the subsidies lower the market price of blended fuel, which increases overall fuel consumption and increase total greenhouse gas emissions. These findings question the suitability of using ethanol subsidies to achieve climate goals and highlight the importance of accounting for the price effect of biofuel policies.

AB  - Background: Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum is a hemicellulose-degrading thermophilic anaerobe that was previously engineered to produce ethanol at high yield. A major project was undertaken to develop this organism into an industrial biocatalyst, but the lack of genome information and resources were recognized early on as a key limitation. Results: Here we present a set of genome-scale resources to enable the systems level investigation and development of this potentially important industrial organism. Resources include a complete genome sequence for strain JW/SL-YS485, a genome-scale reconstruction of metabolism, tiled microarray data showing transcription units, mRNA expression data from 71 different growth conditions or timepoints and GC/MS-based metabolite analysis data from 42 different conditions or timepoints. Growth conditions include hemicellulose hydrolysate, the inhibitors HMF, furfural, diamide, and ethanol, as well as high levels of cellulose, xylose, cellobiose or maltodextrin. The genome consists of a 2.7 Mbp chromosome and a 110 Kbp megaplasmid. An active prophage was also detected, and the expression levels of CRISPR genes were observed to increase in association with those of the phage. Hemicellulose hydrolysate elicited a response of carbohydrate transport and catabolism genes, as well as poorly characterized genes suggesting a redox challenge. In some conditions, a time series of combined transcription and metabolite measurements were made to allow careful study of microbial physiology under process conditions. As a demonstration of the potential utility of the metabolic reconstruction, the OptKnock algorithm was used to predict a set of gene knockouts that maximize growth-coupled ethanol production. The predictions validated intuitive strain designs and matched previous experimental results. Conclusion: These data will be a useful asset for efforts to develop T. saccharolyticum for efficient industrial production of biofuels. The resources presented herein may also be useful on a comparative basis for development of other lignocellulose degrading microbes, such as Clostridium thermocellum. © 2015 Currie et al.

AB  - While biofuel is one of the ways through which dependency on fossil fuels can be reduced, it is controversial, not least because it may entail a conflict between food production and the rights of local communities on the one hand, and subsidised access to renewable, non-fossil fuel on the other. As a means to reduce these tensions, a large number of voluntary sustainability schemes have emerged, particularly after the EU Renewable Energy Directive was adopted in 2009. If biofuel actors in the EU are to have their biofuels counted within the 10 per cent renewable target, to be attractive, these voluntary schemes must comply with the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids and be approved by the EU. When analysing the voluntary sustainability schemes applying to biofuel, the theory of reflexive law is applied. By highlighting the social dimension of sustainability, more specifically the human rights to participation, land and food, it is found that those schemes that have been developed with the participation of non-governmental organisations stand out from the schemes that are merely industry based. The EU requirements are lower than those voluntary schemes that have been developed and monitored by a multi-stakeholder process. Moreover, the indicators adopted by the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) are too general to be applicable on specific projects. © 2015 Norwegian Centre for Human Rights.

AB  - One intrinsic component of public engagement events on scientific issues that has been ignored is the role of media representations as informational inputs. This is despite inferences that media representations may support learning, reflection, misinformation, or polarization during an event. In this article, we examined the role of media references during a public deliberation on advanced biofuels, revealing how participants used them for various purposes, such as supporting their points of view, challenging others, and adding information to the discussion. However, media references steadily decreased over time, and our analysis revealed that they ultimately had a limited influence on deliberations. © 2015 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Background Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is one of the leading candidates to provide lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. Switchgrass is capable of relatively high productivity on marginal land or when intercropped with trees. Production of switchgrass is dependent upon light use efficiency at the canopy level. Thus, maintenance of photosynthesis at light limiting and cool conditions ought to elongate the growing season and increase productivity of switchgrass. Photosynthesis under cool conditions and low light is maintained higher in giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) than switchgrass by retaining relatively high expression of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our main goal was to create lines of switchgrass with upregulated PPDK and to evaluate photosynthetic responses of those lines to growth temperature under low radiation conditions. Our approach was to grow replicate plants of each transgenic event with an untransformed control in low light environments at either warm (28 °C day/24 °C night) or cool (14 °C day/12 °C night) conditions. Photosynthesis parameters of all plants were assessed with fluorescence kinetics, light response curves and carbon dioxide response curves. Results We created several lines of transgenic switchgrass with documented upregulation of cDNA for the PPDK gene (C4ppdk1). Photoinhibition was higher in the transgenic lines, but electron transport rates (ETR) and quantum yield of photosystem II were not inhibited by cool conditions. The higher than expected ETR under cool conditions was associated with increased non-photochemical quenching, which indicated that enzymatic reactions of photosynthesis were inhibited more by cool conditions than photochemical processes. In all except one transgenic line, most metrics of biochemical processes decreased under cool growth conditions, which resulted in significantly lower productivity under cool conditions. Conclusions All transgenic lines were able to balance electron transport and biochemical process at low radiation keeping apparent quantum yield constant and the light saturation point relatively low. Thus, the photosynthetic changes associated with the transgenic events could make the transgenic lines appropriate for use in low light regions such as forest intercropping systems if productivity was increased. Although one transgenic line had weakly improved photosynthesis under cool conditions in this study, improving cold temperature photosynthesis in switchgrass will require more than manipulating the expression of a single gene. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The promotion and adoption of biofuels in Nigeria must be predicated on sufficient capacity for absorbing biofuels produced from the increasing investments in biofuels plantations, plants and processing facilities. This paper assesses the socioeconomic and related premises for biofuels development in Nigeria by conducting an econometric estimation of the petroleum products consumption. The paper first estimates aggregated petroleum product consumption, and then assess the response to specific petroleum products in terms of consumption, market (population), electricity generation, installed electricity generation capacity, and GDP. The result shows that all the petroleum products contribute significantly and about equally to aggregate petroleum consumption. The high proportion of petrol (about 44 percent) as a percentage of the aggregate petroleum product consumption validates the push for implementing the E10 petrol-ethanol blending for Nigeria. The consumption of diesel is also significant. Diesel is another petroleum product for which D20 biofuel blending policy has been proposed. The increase in population and GDP, coupled with the poor electricity situation, will keep driving the consumption of petroleum products. As the population increases, and the country continues to struggle to match electricity generation with population growth, the petrol-ethanol and diesel-biodiesel blending policy must be pursued tenaciously to ensure a reduction in carbon emission in Nigeria. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Classical plant breeding approaches may fall short to breed new plant species of high environmental and ecological interests. Biotechnological and genetic manipulations, on the other hand, may hold more effective capabilities to circumvent the limitations of sexual incompatibility and conventional breeding programs. Given that plant cells encompass multiple copies of organellar genomes (mitochondrial and plastidial genomes), an important question could be raised about whether an artificial attempt to duplicate the nuclear genome might also be conceivable through a binucleation approach (generating plant cells with 2 nuclei from 2 different plant species) for potential production of new polyploidies that would characterize new plant species. Since the complexities of plant genomes are the result of multiple genome duplications, an artificial binucleation approach would thus be of some interest to eventually varying plant genomes and producing new polyploidy from related or distal plant species. Here, I discuss the potentiality of such an approach to engineer binucleated plant cells as a germ of new plant species to fulfill some environmental applications such as increasing the biodiversity and breeding new species adaptable to harsh environmental stresses and increasing green surfaces to reduce atmospheric pollutions in arid lands with poor vegetation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aviation industry has set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions in coming decades. The strategy involves the use of sustainable biofuels, aiming to achieve benefits from environmental, social, and economic perspectives. In this context, Brazilian conditions are favorable, with a mature agroindustry that regularly produces automotive biofuel largely adopted by Brazilian road vehicles, while air transportation has been growing at an accelerating pace and a modern aircraft industry is in place. This paper presents the main conclusions and recommendations from a broad assessment of the technological, economic, and sustainability challenges and opportunities associated with the development of drop-in aviation biofuels in Brazil. It was written by a research team that prepared the initial reports and conducted eight workshops with the active participation of more than 30 stakeholders encompassing the private sector, government institutions, NGOs, and academia. The main outcome was a set of guidelines for establishing a new biofuels industry, including recommendations for (a) filling the identified research and development knowledge gaps in the production of sustainable feedstock; (b) overcoming the barriers in conversion technology, including scaling-up issues; (c) promoting greater involvement and interaction between private and government stakeholders; and (d) creating a national strategy to promote the development of aviation biofuels. © 2015 Luís A.

AB  - Palm oil based biodiesel offers an alternative energy source that can reduce current dependence on conventional fossil fuels and may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions depending on the type of feedstock and processes used. In the Malaysian context, the palm oil industry not only provides high-yield, renewable feedstock to the world, it brings socio-economic development to the Malaysian rural community and contributes to the national income. However, the sustainability of palm oil remains controversial, due to deforestation, pollution and social conflicts associated with its production. Sustainability assessment is vital for the palm oil industry to identify weaknesses, improve its sustainability performance and improve consumer confidence. This paper proposes a holistic sustainability assessment framework for palm oil production with the aim to address the weaknesses of existing palm oil sustainability assessment methods. It identifies environmental, social and economic Headline Performance Indicators, Key Performance Indicators and their Performance Measures in crude palm oil production in a structured framework. Each quantitative/semi-quantitative performance measure is translated into Likert Scale of 1-5, where 3 is the threshold value, 5 is the ideal condition, and 1 is the worst case scenario. Calculation methods were established for the framework to provide quantitative assessment results. The framework was tested using a hypothetical example with data from existing studies. The results suggest that crude palm oil production in Malaysia is below the sustainability threshold. Evaluations of this sustainability assessment framework also demonstrate that it is a comprehensive assessment method for assessing sustainability of feedstock for biofuel production. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Rising energy prices, geopolitics and concerns over the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change are increasing the demand for biofuel production. The contribution of biofuels to energy supply is expected to grow fast with beneficial impacts including reductions in greenhouse gasses, improved energy security and new income sources for farmers. However, biomass production for energy will also compete with food crops for scarce land and water resources, already a major constraint on agricultural production in many parts of the world. This paper explores the land implications of increased biofuel production globally, from a systemic view of the world's energy evolution. It concludes that, although of lesser concern at the global level, local and regional impact could be substantial.

AB  - By having the objective of reducing their global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and their petroleum dependency, many industrialized countries like European Union countries support the sustainable development and will increase, by 2020, the ratio of biofuel (bioethanol or biodiesel) blend with transportation fuel to 10% (v/v). However, this objective could deprive the world of arable lands needed to feed 320 to 460 million people. To replace conventional vegetable oils (for example, canola oil) to produce biodiesel, microalgae could be used as the bulk material, as their total lipid yield can be as high as 75% (w/w). To produce biodiesel, the lipids must previously be extracted from the wet microalgae. This study showed that microalgae could be directly extracted without dewatering process with a yield of 29.0% (w/w) by using boiling pretreatments (water phase). The yield obtained was slightly lower than the traditional extraction methods (33.0% w/w) implying the costly technique of freeze-drying. The results also showed that the chemical physicochemical pretreatment considered had no influence on the composition of the fatty acid methyl esters of the biodiesel produced with methyl palmitoleate as the major component with up to 28.0% (w/w). © 2015 WIT Press.

AB  - Purpose - This paper assesses the projected growth of food supply relative to population growth and estimated food demand growth over the next four decades. Methodology/approach - World population projections are analyzed for the main developed and developing regions. Implied food demand growth is then compared to grain and oilseed supply projections from a few of the most reliable sources. Three of these are 10-year projections and two extend to 2030 and 2050. To the extent possible, comparisons are made among the alternative projections. Conclusions about food availability and prices are finally drawn. Findings - Meeting the growth in demand for food, feed, and biofuels to 2050will not be a steep hill to climb, but there will need to be continued private and public investment in technology to induce increased production growth rates through productivity enhancements and increased purchased inputs. Practical implications - The main food security challenge of the future, as in the present, is not insufficient production but rather increasing access and reducing vulnerability for food insecure households. The dominance of future population growth in the food insecure regions of Africa makes this challenge even more critical between now and 2050 and even more so in the years beyond 2050 when climate change effects on resource constraints will be more severe.

AB  - The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana contains the United States' largest coal reserve. The area produces large amounts of natural gas through extraction from water-saturated coalbeds. Determining the impacts of coalbed natural gas-produced efflux water on crops is important when considering its potential use as supplemental irrigation water. We hypothesized that coalbed natural gas water, because of its high salinity and sodicity, would affect plant secondary metabolism (essential oils) and biomass accumulation. A 2-yr field study was conducted in Wyoming to investigate the effects of produced water on two traditional bioenergy feedstocks-corn (Zea mays L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.)-and four novel biofuel feedstock species-spearmint (Mentha spicata L.), Japanese cornmint (Mentha canadensis L.), lemongrass [Cymbopogon flexuosus (Nees ex Steud.) J.F. Watson]), and common wormwood (Artemisia vulgaris L.). The four nontraditional feedstock species were chosen because they contain high-value plant chemicals that can offset production costs. Essential oil content was significantly affected by coalbed natural gas water in lemongrass and spearmint. Oil content differences between two spearmint harvests in the same year indicated that there were significant changes between the growth stage of the plant and essential oil content; the first harvest averaged 0.42 g of oil per 100 g biomass while the second harvest (harvested before flowering) yielded only 0.19 g oil per 100 g dry biomass. Results indicated that produced water can be used for short-period (2 yr) irrigation of crops. However, prolonged use of untreated produced water for irrigation would likely have deleterious long-term effects on the soil and plants unless the water was treated or diluted (mixed) with good-quality water. © 2015 American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Biodiesel production in Europe and Germany relies heavily on rapeseed oil. Thus, the biodiesel industry has become the most important outlet for rapeseed oil. In light of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) saving requirements at the European level, this situation may change: according to the default values specified in the current legislation, biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil will not meet GHG saving requirements as of 2017. In this article, we assess the market impacts of the withdrawal of rapeseed oil from the biodiesel industry in Germany and Europe. Simulations with the MAGNET and CAPRI modelling systems indicate a decline in producer prices for rapeseed of approximately 17% in the EU. The area dedicated to rapeseed production will decline by 6%. Rapeseed oil is primarily substituted by imported vegetable oils. Simultaneously, imports of biodiesel from North America, Argentina and Asia are projected to increase. We investigate options to improve the GHG balance of rapeseed biodiesel. We conclude that only a combination of climate-friendly produced fertiliser and efficient conversion processes can provide the necessary GHG emission-savings to meet the EU's sustainability goals after 2017.

AB  - Following the European Commission's concept of a "Knowledge-based Bioeconomy" (KBBE), great significance in the process of political decision-making shall be attached to scientific expertise. In contrast, the conducted print media analysis on the German biofuel discourse for the period from 1995 to 2012 only found a marginal role of scientific actors in the debate. Even though support for biofuels has been largely rejected as inefficient by several scientific brain trusts for many years, the German government, as well as the EU adhere to this policy. This raises the question of the underlying interests that drive the persistent support for biofuels. In this context, the paper investigates the standing and positioning of different actors in the public media and thereby it contributes to a better understanding of why the political support for biofuels is continued, despite the doubts of scientists. One of the core findings of the study states, that one reason for this political support can be seen in the dominance of a coalition of biofuel advocates, mainly formed by political and economic actors, in the public discourse.

AB  - Connectedness through cooperation with other sectors regarding feedstock, energy, products and by-products is important for environmental performance of industrial production. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of the level of connectedness in the Swedish biofuels for transport industry, involving producers of ethanol, biogas and biodiesel. In interviews, the CEOs of four important companies provided information about current strategies, historic and planned development. The production systems are dynamic and have changed significantly over time, including material and energy exchanges between traditionally separate industries. Interesting development was noted where revised business strategies have led to changed cooperation structures and thus altered material and energy flows. Fuel and raw material prices are very influential and all of the respondents said that political decisions to a large extent affect their competitiveness and emphasised the importance of clear long-term institutional conditions, ironically very much in contrast to the current situation within EU and Sweden.

AB  - A plant species growing in sea or coastal saltmarsh is greatly tolerant to high concentrations of salts, and a plant species growing in desert or dry regions is highly tolerant to drought. Breeding a new plant hybrid species from both species by means of cellular grafting, genome fusion or nuclear transfer would generate, at least in theory, a hybrid plant species that should be strongly tolerant to harsh aridity and salinity and would be potentially irrigable with seawater. Such prospective species can be used for example as a fodder, biofuel crop or stabilizer species to protect soil from wind erosion and sandy storms in dry regions. Breeding such species would change the surface of the world and help to solve major challenges of starvation, malnutrition and poverty. Here, I propose potential approaches that would be worthy of investigation toward this purpose. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has come under criticism for its potential climate change impacts, creating a scientific controversy with major economic implications, as the outcome will shape trade policy regulating ethanol exports. The Brazilian scientists involved in this political struggle are often seen as motivated by predetermined economic and national interests due to their collaboration with sugarcane industry representatives in influencing international biofuel policy. I argue that their alignment is rather an emergent phenomenon that is shaped by their engagement with a policy process they see as being dominated by American and European concerns and practices of evidence-making. Understanding international policy networks in this way, as institutional environments that actively shape and constrain the interests of actors as they coalesce, provides a more useful analysis of how "Brazilian interests" around issues such as energy production and climate change come into being, and are translated into policy. © 2015 American Anthropological Association.

AB  - The crisis of energy producing molecules (fuels) is expected to increase in future, which is currently produced from crude mineral oil. Biodiesel is most reliable, non-toxic, biocompatible liquid fuel that can replace the existing unsustainable sources of energy. Among all the known sources, microalgae display high potential for the production of biodiesel owing to their numerous benefits like higher biomass productivities than plants, no agricultural land requirement, cultivation in waste water and accumulation of 20-50% triacylglycerols. Microalgae biomass and lipid content plays an important role in commercial production of biodiesel. The present work was carried out to develop an axenic culture of a potential microalga Chlorella sp. for high biomass and enhanced lipid accumulation. The important growth parameters like pH, light colour, light intensity and photoperiod were studied for better production of Chlorella biomass. The effect of salinity on cell growth was also studied and compared with normal Fogg’s medium grown cells. The main biomolecules like carbohydrate, protein, lipid and chlorophyll content were also estimated with the help of standard biochemical methods in salt supplemented and without salt Fogg’s medium. The cellular lipid content was increased by growing the cells under different salt concentrations. The micro algal strain showed highest growth of 0.822 g L−1 and 1.021g L−1 in Fogg’s medium and under 0.2 M NaCl supplemented medium respectively. However, the maximum lipid production of 0.1842 g L−1 was estimated by growing the cells in Fogg’s medium including 0.5 M NaCl with slight compromise in cell growth (0.858 g L−1). The lipid content of Chlorella sp. was found to be 26.84% as compared to 14% obtained under normal culture condition. Thus, growing Chlorella sp. under salt supplemented medium and optimizing light requirement will produce high biomass and oil for biodiesel production. © 2015 Monika Prakash Rai, Trishnamoni Gautom and Nikunj Sharma.

AB  - This study seeks to identify the key trends and important knowledge towards biomass and biofuels sustainability using a global assessment. The biomass is considered as the fourth largest energy source in the world after coal, oil and natural gas. It is very important to select the most promising option for using biomass under environmental, economic and resource perspective. While the electricity and heat can be provided by variety of renewable resources such as wind, sun, water, biomass, etc., the biomass showed to be the only alternative for production of transportation fuels. But biomass potential for energy production is promising nowadays. It became the most important renewable energy resource with about 10% of the annual global primary energy demand. The biomass energy has potential to be 'modernised' worldwide due to the easiest way of conversion into the most convenient forms such as gases, liquids, or electricity. This paper reviews the latest literature on biomass resources and biofuel production potential with a spatial focus on global sustainability challenge. A number of scenarios world-wide, estimating the current and future development of biomass and biofuel sustainability challenge including the case of Croatia and Kosova are given. Great amount of research is focused on the challenges of growing and harvesting the biomass use for the energy and biofuel production, sustainability of production operations and various trade possibilities. The overview shows that biomass and biofuel sustainability is influenced by several factors that affect the food security as well as socio-economic impacts. The harmonisation of well working sustainability framework and strong policy measures are essential with consideration on the impact assessment that examines the economic and environmental effects of biomass and biofuel use.

AB  - Paper sludge is a solid residue in paper making process that is currently disposed in land fields or burned. That consequently pollutes the environment and on the other hand this waste could be potentially valuable bioenergy convertible resource. Paper sludge, which contains cellulosic and lignocellulosic residues, is believed to be one of the most promising feedstock for the production of bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol is the most employed liquid biofuel either as a fuel or as a gasoline enhancer. Production of ethanol for fuel is increasing because of the demand to reduce oil consumption and improving air quality, which is related to reduced emission of CO and aromatic compounds. The main processing challenge in the ethanol production is the pretreatment of lignocellusosic biomass. During the pretreatment the degree of crystallinity of cellulose must be reduced to increase the fraction of amorphous cellulose, which is amenable to enzymatic hydrolysis. For the pretreatment one can employ physical, chemical and biological methods. The pretreatment method should improve following formation of glucose and avoid the formation of inhibitors for subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation processes. In this study paper sludge from paper making company was firstly pretreated by milling or using phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and then enzymatically treated with enzyme cellulase. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose using cellulase converted it to glucose. Hydrolyses were conducted at temperature, ? = 45 °C, stirrer speed, fm = 200 min-1, different range of pH = (4-6) and amount of enzyme V = (100, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000) μL. We achieved the conversion of more than 83 % after 48 h hydrolysis at pH = 5 and amount of enzyme V = 3,000 μL. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - We propose a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the optimal investment of biorefinery facilities considering non-cooperative farmers and biofuel consumers. Interactions among the supply chain players are captured through a single-leader-multiple-follower Stackelberg game under the generalized Nash equilibrium assumption. Given a three-echelon superstructure, the lead biofuel company in the middle echelon first optimizes its design and operational decisions, including facility location, sizing, and technology selection, material input/output and price setting. The following farmers and biofuel consumers in the upstream and downstream then optimize their transactions with the biofuel company to maximize their individual profits. Novel solution strategies are also proposed to solve the proposed bilevel MINLP efficiently. A county-level case study is presented to demonstrate the application of our model, as well as the performance of the proposed solution strategy. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A range of energy crops can be grown on marginal land (i.e. land that is not suitable for food crop production or contaminated site) to provide feedstocks for bioenergy, non-food products and biofuels. The food versus fuel debate had a significant negative impact in Europe on first generation biofuels production from food crops (i.e. wheat, rapeseed, etc). A new approach involving the use of marginal land for the production of lignocellulosic species for the production of bioethanol is now pursued in Italy and in many other countries, where the demand for high quality water resources, arable land, food and fossil fuels is rapidly growing. With an emerging "feed versus fuel debate" there is a pressing need to find options for the use of marginal lands and wastewaters or saline ground waters to produce second generation biofuel or bio paper crops. Arundo donax was selected as a potential crop for use in these areas, since it produces more cellulosic biomass and sequesters more contaminants, using less land and pesticides than any other alternative crops reported in the literature. The objective of this paper is to evaluate economically a simplified process for the production of second generation bioethanol from A. donax.

AB  - Biofuel production in China suffers from many uncertainties due to concerns about the government's support policy and supply of biofuel raw material. Predicting biofuel production is critical to the development of this energy industry. Depending on the biofuel's characteristics, we improve the prediction precision of the conventional prediction method by creating a dynamic fuzzy grey-Markov prediction model. Our model divides random time series decomposition into a change trend sequence and a fluctuation sequence. It comprises two improvements. We overcome the problem of considering the status of future time from a static angle in the traditional grey model by using the grey equal dimension new information and equal dimension increasing models to create a dynamic grey prediction model. To resolve the influence of random fluctuation data and weak anti-interference ability in the Markov chain model, we improve the traditional grey-Markov model with classification of states using the fuzzy set theory. Finally, we use real data to test the dynamic fuzzy prediction model. The results prove that the model can effectively improve the accuracy of forecast data and can be applied to predict biofuel production. However, there are still some defects in our model. The modeling approach used here predicts biofuel production levels based upon past production levels dictated by economics, governmental policies, and technological developments but none of which can be forecast accurately based upon past events. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Greater investment in agriculture is essential for enhancing food security and nutrition, particularly in a global environment faced with dwindling natural resources, increasing populations, and the effects of global climate change. In order for food systems to meet present and future challenges, increased investment in agriculture is required. The CFS (Committee on World Food Security) principles provide a framework to help ensure that investment in agriculture is transparent, responsible, environmentally sustainable, and contributes to inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Concomitant to this trend is observed worldwide the recent phenomenon called land grabbing, that is spreading around the world due to the tendency of foreign investment in land for food and biofuels. This paper analyzes from the perspective of the CSF principles, if the investment in foreign lands is characterized as an economic and socio-environmental threat or can be considered a necessary investment to world security.

The expansion and the development of biofuel production in small or large scale, creates a new territorial and economic dynamics, which is required to be controlled and regulated from the State and there must be joint actions by the other stakeholders to avoid setbacks or disputes over territories. In this context, this paper analyzes the systematic production of biofuels tangentially to their economic, political and socio-environmental aspects and focusing on the territorial conflicts generated by a corporate-capitalist perspective, which develops this industry.

AB  - The rapid expansion of production of Biodiesel in Brazil raised the world concern related to socio-amebiental sustainability. Mechanisms such as the Social Seal in Brazil, through the National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel, are created in order to make rules to protect those involved and boost social inclusion. However, controversial aspects in order to make a real social inclusion are not provided, such as the protection of the phenomenon called land grabbing, known in Brazil as grilagem. Approaches a debate to regulate land grabbing by supporting private governance instruments such as the case of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB). Some instruments intended to promote and introduce sustainability meta-standards in the decision making and risk management process of the signatory companies, financial institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with regard to land use and access. We conclude that in the framework of the Social Seal protection and regulatory definitions are unsatisfactory and inaccurate given the intense commercial pressure on land.

AB  - Experts emphasize on the need to develop and deploy renewable energy systems, as fossil energy resources decline. An attractive alternative is to convert lignocellulosic biomass into transportation fuels. It is necessary to develop and deploy renewable energy systems at the multi-terawatt scale, to ensure sustainable prosperity. Sasol converts coal into liquid hydrocarbons in South Africa to extract biofuels. Another alternative is to convert natural gas into liquid hydrocarbons, and both Sasol and Shell operate such plants in Qatar.

AB  - Cover crops (CCs) can provide multiple soil, agricultural production, and environmental benefits. However, a better understanding of such potential ecosystem services is needed. We summarized the current state of knowledge of CC effects on soil C stocks, soil erosion, physical properties, soil water, nutrients, microbial properties, weed control, crop yields, expanded uses, and economics and highlighted research needs. Our review indicates that CCs are multifunctional. Cover crops increase soil organic C stocks (0.1-1. Mg ha-1 yr-1) with the magnitude depending on biomass amount, years in CCs, and initial soil C level. Runoff loss can decrease by up to 80% and sediment loss from 40 to 96% with CCs. Wind erosion potential also decreases with CCs, but studies are few. Cover crops alleviate soil compaction, improve soil structural and hydraulic properties, moderate soil temperature, improve microbial properties, recycle nutrients, and suppress weeds. Cover crops increase or have no effect on crop yields but reduce yields in water-limited regions by reducing available water for the subsequent crops. The few available studies indicate that grazing and haying of CCs do not adversely affect soil and crop production, which suggests that CC biomass removal for livestock or biofuel production can be another benefit from CCs. Overall, CCs provide numerous ecosystem services (i.e., soil, crop-livestock systems, and environment), although the magnitude of benefits is highly site specific. More research data are needed on the (i) multi-functionality of CCs for different climates and management scenarios and (ii) short-and long-term economic return from CCs. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.

AB  - We present global direct radiative effect (DRE) calculations of carbonaceous aerosols emitted from biomass/biofuel burning addressing the interplay between two poorly constrained contributions to DRE: mixing state of black carbon (lensing) and light absorption by organic aerosol (OA) due to the presence of brown carbon (BrC). We use the parameterization of Saleh et al. (2014) which captures the variability in biomass/biofuel OA absorption. The global mean effect of OA absorption is +0.22 W/m2 and +0.12 W/m2 for externally and internally mixed cases, while the effect of lensing is +0.39 W/m2 and +0.29 W/m2 for nonabsorbing and absorbing OA cases, signifying the nonlinear interplay between OA absorption and lensing. These two effects can be overestimated if not treated simultaneously in radiative transfer calculations. The combined effect of OA absorption and lensing increases the global mean DRE of biomass/biofuel aerosols from 0.46 W/m2 to +0.05 W/m2 and appears to reduce the gap between existing model-based and observationally constrained DRE estimates. We observed a strong sensitivity to these parameters in key regions, where DRE shifts from strongly negative (&lt; 1W/m2) to strongly positive (&gt; +1 W/m2) when accounting for lensing and OA absorption. © 2015.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L., a toxic species that does not interfere with the food chain, produces biodiesel of better environmental quality than mineral oils. However, in order to cultivate it sustainably, it is necessary to optimize the limited resources used, mainly water and soil. Therefore, in arid areas, it is necessary to cultivate under intensive conditions, irrigate with reclaimed water and cut production costs. To optimize water consumption, partial root-zone drying (PRD), which keeps a part of the root system dry, was used. This water management strategy, employed successfully in other oil crops, yielded less fruit per bunch, but more fruit bunches per plant. This fact will probably allow to establish higher planting density and, consequently, higher productivity per surface unit. This is one of the few available options for improving profitability as production per tree is stable (1.25 kg seed plant-1 year-1 for the most productive trees, with excellent climate and soil, and no limitations water use). A high percentage of fruit lying on the ground (24%) and non-uniform timing in fruit production (except some specimens) greatly hinder its mechanization. Although this crop's environmental and socio-economic benefits are not taken into account, it is very difficult, with only the calculated water consumption (15.5 m3 water per L of oil or 5.6 m3 water per L of oil according to our best estimations), to consider it a profitable option. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Trade in agricultural goods and raw materials provides an important challenge for rule-making at the national, regional and international level. Many of the activities undertaken in the name of efficient agriculture are unsustainable, but unsustainable agriculture does not depend just from the exports level, because it can be found everywhere: in fact, trade in agricultural and food products can both threaten and promote sustainability. At that point the question arises as to what multilateral (or regional) rules are needed specifically to tackle the issue of sustainability and trade? With regards to this question, there are several issues such as property rights to indigenous resources, trade rules governing biofuels, investment in and ownership of land and mineral rights in resource-rich countries. This short paper looks at some specific areas where the issue of global governance, through trade institutions, impinges on farming and fishing practices and related types of raw material trade, by presenting a taxonomy that shows the intersection between government trade activities, trade agreements and sustainability. Particularly, it may consider two categories of government activity in agricultural and raw material trade: taxes or other restrictions and subsidies or other forms of encouragement; these actions can be divided in the direction of sustainability and those that are inimical to that objective. Therefore, the paper will illustrate the interface between trade rules and sustainability objectives, by discussing some examples reflecting these actions/sustainability combinations, such as: the removal of tariffs on environmental goods; restrictions on imports of products produced in an unsustainable way; restrictions on exports of raw materials in the context of scarcity; subsidies to encourage environmental farming practices; subsidies for the production and use of biofuels; and subsidies for fossil fuel usage. The last section links these topics to the issue of gaps in global governance: this item has been recognized in WTO discourse for some time, especially in the Ministerial Declaration on the contribution of the WTO to achieving greater coherence in global economic policymaking. But the search for a cohesive system of governance remains in the hands of the major countries of the world that have to led the way towards the synergy between trade rules and sustainability goals.

AB  - Phytoextraction could be an efficient technique to remediate heavy metals from contaminated soils. Identifying bioenergy crops that can be produced successfully on marginal lands, such as those polluted by heavy metals, also reduces the pressure to produce energy crops on land that would otherwise be used to produce food crops. The objective of this study was to determine the phytoremediation capability of two warm season perennials, prairie cordgrass (Spartinapectinata Link, 'Savoy') and switchgrass (Panicumvirgatum L., 'Cave-In-Rock' (CIR)) through their growth response to cadmium (Cd). Growth rate, Cd tolerance, accumulation and translocation were measured at concentrations of 0 (control), 5, 10, 30, and 50 mg L-1 of Cd mixed with Hoagland's solution in an aerated hydroponic system. Although a reduction of plant growth was observed when the Cd concentration was higher than 10 mg L-1 for both species, there were significant differences in Cd tolerance, translocation and accumulation between species. The tolerance index (Ti) was between 72.5 and 107.1 in Savoy and 48.7 and 75.7 in CIR under Cd concentrations of 50 mg L-1 and 5 mg L-1, respectively. The translocation factor (Tf) for both species was increased with increasing Cd concentration in solution, but the Tf of Savoy was higher than CIR. The highest bio-concentration factor (BCF) of the roots reached 325.7 for Savoy and 144.5 for CIR when the Cd concentration was 5 mg L-1 and the BCF of the shoots in both species was consistently low (13.7 to 16.8 and 4.1 to 6.0 for Savoy and CIR, respectively) indicating higher Cd retention in the roots than shoots. It was concluded that both species could be utilized in phytoremediation when the Cd concentration is less than 10 mg L-1, however Savoy has the higher tolerance, translocation and accumulation capabilities which makes it a better candidate for phytoremediation and biomass production on Cd polluted soils. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a widely used reference organism in studies of photosynthesis, cilia, and biofuels. Most research in this field uses a few dozen standard laboratory strains that are reported to share a common ancestry, but exhibit substantial phenotypic differences. In order to facilitate ongoing Chlamydomonas research and explain the phenotypic variation, we mapped the genetic diversity within these strains using whole-genome resequencing. We identified 524,640 single nucleotide variants and 4812 structural variants among 39 commonly used laboratory strains. Nearly all (98.2%) of the total observed genetic diversity was attributable to the presence of two, previously unrecognized, alternate haplotypes that are distributed in a mosaic pattern among the extant laboratory strains. We propose that these two haplotypes are the remnants of an ancestral cross between two strains with;2% relative divergence. These haplotype patterns create a fingerprint for each strain that facilitates the positive identification of that strain and reveals its relatedness to other strains. The presence of these alternate haplotype regions affects phenotype scoring and gene expression measurements. Here, we present a rich set of genetic differences as a community resource to allow researchers to more accurately conduct and interpret their experiments with Chlamydomonas. © 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Biofuel products from halophytic plants are valuable due to their high oil content and growth on non-productive, salt-affected lands. The northern part of Golestan Province has high potential for bio-fuel production from salt-tolerant plants such as Salicornia bigelovii (oilseed halophyte) due to its water and soil properties. In this research, the suitable locations for growingSalicornia plant in Golestan Province were defined based on suitability analysis. By this analysis, the suitable area for cultivation and total amount of producible biodiesel were evaluated. In this regard, the principal parameters were defined and the suitable areas were specified by spatial superposition of these layers, using Geographical Information System (GIS). The Index Overlay model was applied for data combination in suitability analysis. The results showed that the most suitable lands for growing Salicornia, are located in the North-West part of Golestan Province with an area of 2365km2, corresponding to about 12% of the total study area. The total amount of producible biodiesel of this area is estimated to be 201.143 million liters per year.

AB  - Caldicellulosiruptor bescii grows optimally at 78°C and is able to decompose high concentrations of lignocellulosic plant biomass without the need for thermochemical pretreatment. C. bescii ferments both C5 and C6 sugars primarily to hydrogen gas, lactate, acetate, and CO2 and is of particular interest for metabolic engineering applications given the recent availability of a genetic system. Developing optimal strains for technological use requires a detailed understanding of primary metabolism, particularly when the goal is to divert all available reductant (electrons) toward highly reduced products such as biofuels. During an analysis of the C. bescii genome sequence for oxidoreductase-type enzymes, evidence was uncovered to suggest that the primary redox metabolism of C. bescii has a completely uncharacterized aspect involving tungsten, a rarely used element in biology. An active tungsten utilization pathway in C. bescii was demonstrated by the heterologous production of a tungsten-requiring, aldehyde- oxidizing enzyme (AOR) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. Furthermore, C. bescii also contains a tungsten-based AOR-type enzyme, here termed XOR, which is phylogenetically unique, representing a completely new member of the AOR tungstoenzyme family. Moreover, in C. bescii, XOR represents ca. 2% of the cytoplasmic protein. XOR is proposed to play a key, but as yet undetermined, role in the primary redox metabolism of this cellulolytic microorganism. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current condition of palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment and utilization and to propose alternative scenarios to improve the sustainability of palm oil industries. The research was conducted through field survey at some palm oil mills in Indonesia, in which different waste management systems were used. Laboratory experiment was also carried out using a 5 m3 pilot-scale wet anaerobic digester. Currently, POME is treated through anaerobic digestion without or with methane capture followed by utilization of treated POME as liquid fertilizer or further treatment (aerobic process) to fulfill the wastewater quality standard. A methane capturing system was estimated to successfully produce renewable energy of about 25.4-40.7 kWh/ton of fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 109.41- 175.35 kgCO2e/tonFFB (CO2e: carbon dioxide equivalent). Utilization of treated POME as liquid fertilizer increased FFB production by about 13%. A palm oil mill with 45 ton FFB/hour capacity has potential to generate about 0.95-1.52 MW of electricity. Coupling the POME-based biogas digester and anaerobic co-composting of empty fruit bunches (EFBs) is capable of adding another 0.93 MW. The utilization of POME and EFB not only increases the added value of POME and EFB by producing renewable energy, compost, and liquid fertilizer, but also lowers environmental burden. © 2015 IWA Publishing.

AB  - Biomass size reduction is the first step for biofuel production from cellulosic biomass through biochemical pathway, and it is usually performed on a mill with screen installed to control the size of the produced particles. The absence of in-depth knowledge about the effects of screen size throughout the biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass makes it difficult to choose the screen size to conduct biomass size reduction to minimize the energy consumption on mills, maximize the cellulose recovery rate after pretreatment, and maximize the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency. The objective of this work is to address this issue by generating new knowledge on the effects of screen size in these three processes: size reduction, pretreatment, and enzymatic hydrolysis in conversion of big bluestem biomass for biofuel production. Four screen sizes used in this study were 1, 2, 4, and 8 mm. It was found that using a larger screen size saved energy in biomass size reduction on a knife mill. Moreover, particles produced with larger screen sizes achieved higher cellulose recovery rate after pretreatment, higher enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency, and higher total sugar yield. © 2015 Xiaoxu Song et al.

AB  - In this paper, I analyze the constraints that limit biomass from becoming an alternative, sustainable and efficient energy source, at least in relation to the current metabolism of developed countries. In order to be termed sustainable, the use of an energy source should be technically feasible, economically affordable and environmentally and socially viable, considering society as a whole. Above all, it should meet society's "metabolic needs," a fundamental issue that is overlooked in the mainstream biofuels narrative. The EROI (Energy Return on Investment) of biofuels reaches a few units, while the EROI of fossil fuels is 20-30 or higher and has a power density (W/m2) thousands of times higher than the best biofuels, such as sugarcane in Brazil. When metabolic approaches are used it becomes clear that biomass cannot represent an energy carrier able to meet the metabolism of industrialized societies. For our industrial society to rely on "sustainable biofuels" for an important fraction of its energy, most of the agricultural and non-agricultural land would need to be used for crops, and at the same time a radical cut to our pattern of energy consumption would need to be implemented, whilst also achieving a significant population reduction. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - A challenging, and largely uncharted, area of research in the field of anaerobic digestion science and technology is in understanding the roles of trace metals in enabling biogas production. This is a major knowledge gap and a multifaceted problem involving metal chemistry; physical interactions of metal and solids; microbiology; and technology optimization.

AB  - Many biotechnological processes such as biogas production or defined biotransformations are carried out by microorganisms or tightly cooperating microbial communities. Process breakdown is the maximum credible accident for the operator. Any time savings that can be provided by suitable early-warning systems and allow for specific countermeasures are of great value. Process disturbance, frequently due to nutritional shortcomings, malfunction or operational deficits, is evidenced conventionally by process chemistry parameters. However, knowledge on systems microbiology and its function has essentially increased in the last two decades, and molecular biology tools, most of which are directed against nucleic acids, have been developed to analyze and diagnose the process. Some of these systems have been shown to indicate changes of the process status considerably earlier than the conventionally applied process chemistry parameters. This is reasonable because the triggering catalyst is determined, activity changes of the microbes that perform the reaction. These molecular biology tools have thus the potential to add to and improve the established process diagnosis system. This chapter is dealing with the actual state of the art of biogas process analysis in practice, and introduces molecular biology tools that have been shown to be of particular value in complementing the current systems of process monitoring and diagnosis, with emphasis on nucleic acid targeted molecular biology systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Forest products, wood and non-wood, remain vital among smallholder households in Zambia with charcoal being the most sought after product. This has led to increased exploitation of forest trees to meet the needs for fuel wood, among others. However, Jatropha curcas plant has been identified as a potential fuel source. In the early 2000s, profit-making organizations encouraged smallholder households to grow Jatropha for use as an alternative fuel source. This paper reports on a study conducted in Solwezi between 2011 and 2014 to evaluate the impact of Jatropha cultivation for biofuel production. A sample of 100 small-scale farmers involved in Jatropha cultivation and key informants were interviewed to evaluate the impact of growing Jatropha at the small-scale level. Results show that farmers lost out on time; income from sale of edible non-wood forest products; and experienced reduction in maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production, worsening household economic conditions. Farmers attributed this loss to unclear policy alignment on biofuel production by government. We therefore recommend that project implementation should involve interactions of all legislative bodies and any other concerned stakeholders. There is also a need to promote the value chain, from production to marketing, which focuses on minimizing detrimental effects on the livelihood of small-scale farmers. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Impact of climate change on the water resources of the United States exposes the vulnerability of feedstock-specific mandated fuel targets to extreme weather conditions that could become more frequent and intensify in the future. Consequently, a sustainable biofuel policy should consider: (a) how climate change would alter both water supply and demand; and (b) in turn, how related changes in water availability will impact the production of biofuel crops; and (c) the environmental implications of large scale biofuel productions. Understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is the key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels. Therefore, the focus of this study is to model the rarely explored interactions between land use, climate change, water resources and the environment in future biofuel production systems. Results from this study will help explore the impacts of the US biofuel policy and climate change on water and agricultural resources. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyze the water quantity and quality consequences of land use and land management related changes in cropping conditions (e.g., more use of marginal lands, greater residue harvest, increased yields), plus management practices due to biofuel crops to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard target on water quality and quantity. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Bioethanol fermentations expose yeasts to a new, complex and challenging fermentation medium with specific inhibitors and sugar mixtures depending on the type of carbon source. It is, therefore, suggested that the natural diversity of yeasts should be further exploited in order to find yeasts with good ethanol yield in stressed fermentation media. In this study, we screened more than 50 yeast isolates of which we selected five isolates with promising features. The species Candida bombi, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Torulaspora delbrueckii showed better osmo- and hydroxymethylfurfural tolerance than Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, S. cerevisiae isolates had the highest ethanol yield in fermentation experiments mimicking high gravity fermentations (25 % glucose) and artificial lignocellulose hydrolysates (with a myriad of inhibitors). Interestingly, among two tested S. cerevisiae strains, a wild strain isolated from an oak tree performed better than Ethanol Red, a S. cerevisiae strain which is currently commonly used in industrial bioethanol fermentations. Additionally, a W. anomalus strain isolated from sugar beet thick juice was found to have a comparable ethanol yield, but needed longer fermentation time. Other non-Saccharomyces yeasts yielded lower ethanol amounts. © 2014, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - EU forest biomass demand is increasing rapidly under policy stimuli, as biofuels are important for EU utilities to reach EU 2020 renewables goal. The import of large amounts will be required, but stakeholders have sustainability concerns. Utilities are adopting self-regulatory certification schemes to reduce stakeholder pressures but the interplay between these efforts, stakeholder and policy dynamics, and business risks is not well understood. This study uses literature, interviews, and a survey of 120 stakeholders to delineate influential actors in the discourse, principal concerns, and ways to ameliorate opposition and risk. The work finds many actors opposed to forest energy systems, and shows how critique is directed toward a nexus of industry and policymakers. It also indicates that critics have an ascendant status and can catalyze changes in policy and business practice in response to their concerns. Key concerns involve carbon, biodiversity, and deforestation; however, it is found that self-governance systems do not yet incorporate metrics to meet emerging expectations. The study concludes that efforts must deliver robust track records of strong ecological, climate, and social performance for forest energy supply chains to allay concerns - as distinct from just 'sustainability certification'. Work must include increased efforts to source woody biomass from the EU-27+ to engender trust in forest energy actors, and scientific studies to delineate 'strong' versus 'weak' 'carbon and temporal carbon' performance for forest energy systems. This also suggests a need to delineate silvicultural regimes that facilitate the management of forest energy supply chains for improved carbon performance. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The impacts of climate and land use changes on streamflow and sediment export were evaluated for a humid (São Lourenço) and a dry (Guadalupe) Mediterranean catchment, using the SWAT model. SWAT was able to produce viable streamflow and sediment export simulations for both catchments, which provided a baseline for investigating climate and land use changes under the A1B and B1 emission scenarios for 2071-2100. Compared to the baseline scenario (1971-2000), climate change scenarios showed a decrease in annual rainfall for both catchments (humid: - 12%; dry: - 8%), together with strong increases in rainfall during winter. Land use changes were derived from a socio-economic storyline in which traditional agriculture is replaced by more profitable land uses (i.e. corn and commercial forestry at the humid site; sunflower at the dry site). Climate change projections showed a decrease in streamflow for both catchments, whereas sediment export decreased only for the São Lourenço catchment. Land use changes resulted in an increase in streamflow, but the erosive response differed between catchments. The combination of climate and land use change scenarios led to a reduction in streamflow for both catchments, suggesting a domain of the climatic response. As for sediments, contrasting results were observed for the humid (A1B: - 29%; B1: - 22%) and dry catchment (A1B: + 222%; B1: + 5%), which is mainly due to differences in the present-day and forecasted vegetation types. The results highlight the importance of climate-induced land-use change impacts, which could be similar to or more severe than the direct impacts of climate change alone. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are important alternatives for meeting our future energy needs. Successful bioenergy crop production requires maintaining environmental sustainability and minimum impacts on current net annual food, feed, and fiber production. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine under-productive areas within an agricultural field in a watershed using a single date; high resolution remote sensing and (2) examine impacts of growing bioenergy crops in the under-productive areas using hydrologic modeling in order to facilitate sustainable landscape design. Normalized difference indices (NDIs) were computed based on the ratio of all possible two-band combinations using the RapidEye and the National Agricultural Imagery Program images collected in summer 2011. A multiple regression analysis was performed using 10 NDIs and five RapidEye spectral bands. The regression analysis suggested that the red and near infrared bands and NDI using red-edge and near infrared that is known as the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI) had the highest correlation (R2 = 0.524) with the reference yield. Although predictive yield map showed striking similarity to the reference yield map, the model had modest correlation; thus, further research is needed to improve predictive capability for absolute yields. Forecasted impact using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model of growing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) on under-productive areas based on corn yield thresholds of 3.1, 4.7, and 6.3 Mg·ha-1 showed reduction of tile NO3-N and sediment exports by 15.9%-25.9% and 25%-39%, respectively. Corresponding reductions in water yields ranged from 0.9% to 2.5%. While further research is warranted, the study demonstrated the integration of remote sensing and hydrologic modeling to quantify the multifunctional value of projected future landscape patterns in a context of sustainable bioenergy crop production. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A study was initiated to investigate the sustainability effects of intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation. This forest-based biofuel system could possibly provide biomass from the perennial energy grass while maintaining the economics and environmental benefits of a forest managed for sawtimber. Operations necessary for successful switchgrass establishment and growth, such as site preparation, planting, fertilizing, mowing and baling, may affect hydrology and nutrient runoff. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the temporal effects of management on nutrient concentrations and loadings and (ii) to use pretreatment data to predict those treatment effects. The study watersheds (~25 ha each) in the North Carolina Atlantic Coastal Plain were a pine/ switchgrass intercropped site (D1), a midrotation thinned pine site with natural understory (D2), and a switchgrass-only site (D3). Rainfall, drainage, water table elevation, nitrogen (total Kjedahl N, NH4-N, and NO3-N), and phosphate were monitored for the 2007-2008 pretreatment and the 2009-2012 treatment periods. From 2010 to 2011 in site D1, the average NO3-N concentration effects decreased from 0.18 to -0.09 mg L-1, and loads effects decreased from 0.86 to 0.49 kg ha-1. During the same period in site D3, the average NO3-N concentration effects increased from 0.03 to 0.09 mg L-1, and loads effects increased from -0.26 to 1.24 kg ha-1. This study shows the importance of considering water quality effects associated with intensive management operations required for switchgrass establishment or other novel forest-based biofuel systems. © 2015 American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - We make the case that phosphorus (P) is inextricably linked to an increasingly fragile, interconnected, and interdependent nexus of water, energy, and food security and should be managed accordingly. Although there are many other drivers that influence water, energy, and food security, P plays a unique and underrecognized role within the nexus. The P paradox derives from fundamental challenges in meeting water, energy, and food security for a growing global population. We face simultaneous dilemmas of overcoming scarcity of P to sustain terrestrial food and biofuel production and addressing overabundance of P entering aquatic systems, which impairs water quality and aquatic ecosystems and threatens water security. Historical success in redistributing rock phosphate as fertilizer to enable modern feed and food production systems is a grand societal achievement in overcoming inequality. However, using the United States as the main example, we demonstrate how successes in redistribution of P and reorganization of farming systems have broken local P cycles and have inadvertently created instability that threatens resilience within the nexus. Furthermore, recent expansion of the biofuels sector is placing further pressure on P distribution and availability. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist to intensify and expand food and biofuel production through recycling and better management of land and water resources. Ultimately, a strategic approach to sustainable P management can help address the P paradox, minimize tradeoffs, and catalyze synergies to improve resilience among components of the water, energy, and food security nexus. © 2015 American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - An outstanding challenge toward efficient production of biofuels and value-added chemicals from plant biomass is the impact that lignocellulose-derived inhibitors have on microbial fermentations. Elucidating the mechanisms that underlie their toxicity is critical for developing strategies to overcome them. Here, using Escherichia coli as a model system, we investigated the metabolic effects and toxicity mechanisms of feruloyl amide and coumaroyl amide, the predominant phenolic compounds in ammonia-pretreated biomass hydrolysates. Using metabolomics, isotope tracers, and biochemical assays, we showed that these two phenolic amides act as potent and fast-acting inhibitors of purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways. Feruloyl or coumaroyl amide exposure leads to (i) a rapid buildup of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), a key precursor in nucleotide biosynthesis, (ii) a rapid decrease in the levels of pyrimidine biosynthetic intermediates, and (iii) a long-term generalized decrease in nucleotide and deoxynucleotide levels. Tracer experiments using 13C-labeled sugars and [15N]ammonia demonstrated that carbon and nitrogen fluxes into nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are inhibited by these phenolic amides. We found that these effects are mediated via direct inhibition of glutamine amidotransferases that participate in nucleotide biosynthetic pathways. In particular, feruloyl amide is a competitive inhibitor of glutamine PRPP amidotransferase (PurF), which catalyzes the first committed step in de novo purine biosynthesis. Finally, external nucleoside supplementation prevents phenolic amide-mediated growth inhibition by allowing nucleotide biosynthesis via salvage pathways. The results presented here will help in the development of strategies to overcome toxicity of phenolic compounds and facilitate engineering of more efficient microbial producers of biofuels and chemicals. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Bioenergy is widely seen as being in competition with food for land resources. This note examines the potential of plants that use the mode of photosynthesis known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) to generate globally significant quantities of renewable electricity without displacing productive agriculture and perhaps even increasing food supply. CAM plants require of the order of 10-fold less water per unit of dry biomass produced than do common C3 and C4 crops, and because of their succulence are endowed with substantial water-storage capacities that helps to buffer intermittent water availability. This allows them to thrive in areas where traditional agriculture struggles, either because of low rainfall, or because the seasonality or unpredictability of rainfall is too great to allow profitable arable farming. Although as a group these plants are understudied, sufficient data are available to support estimates of the contribution they might make to global electricity supply if used as feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Two CAM species are examined here as potential bioenergy crops: Opuntia ficus-indica and Euphorbia tirucalli. Both show the high degree of drought tolerance typical of CAM plants and produce promising yields with low rainfall. Even CAM plants in semi-arid areas may have opportunity costs in terms of lost agricultural potential, but an alternative approach to bioenergy may allow the food value of land to be increased whilst using the land for energy. Global power generation from gas is around 5 PW h per year. The data suggests that 5 PW h of electricity per year could be generated from CAM plants cultivated on between 100 and 380 million hectares of semi-arid land, equivalent to between 4% and 15% of the potential resource. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - Novel processing strategies for hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass in a single reactor offer large potential cost savings for production of biocommodities and biofuels. One critical challenge is retaining high enzyme production in the presence of elevated product titers. Toward this goal, the cellulolytic, ethanol-producing bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans was adapted to increased ethanol concentrations. The resulting ethanol-tolerant (ET) strain has nearly doubled ethanol tolerance relative to the wild-type level but also reduced ethanol yield and growth at low ethanol concentrations. The genome of the ET strain has coding changes in proteins involved in membrane biosynthesis, the Rnf complex, cation homeostasis, gene regulation, and ethanol production. In particular, purification of the mutant bifunctional acetaldehyde coenzyme A (CoA)/alcohol dehydrogenase showed that a G609D variant abolished its activities, including ethanol formation. Heterologous expression of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in the ET strain increased cellulose consumption and restored ethanol production, demonstrating how metabolic engineering can be used to overcome disadvantageous mutations incurred during adaptation to ethanol. We discuss how genetic changes in the ET strain reveal novel potential strategies for improving microbial solvent tolerance. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Biochar (carbonized biomass for agricultural use) has been used worldwide as soil amendment and is a technology of particular interest for Brazil, since its “inspiration” is from the historical Terra Preta de Índios (Amazon Dark Earth), and also because Brazil is the world’s largest charcoal producer, generating enormous residue quantities in form of fine charcoal and due to the availability of different residual biomasses, mainly from agroindustry (e.g., sugar-cane bagasse; wood and paper-mill wastes; residues from biofuel industries; sewage sludge etc), that can be used for biochar production, making Brazil a key actor in the international scenario in terms of biochar research and utilization). In the last decade, numerous studies on biochar have been carried out and now a vast literature, and excellent reviews, are available. The objective of this paper is therefore to deliver a critical review with some highlights on biochar research, rather than an exhaustive bibliographic review. To this end, some key points considered critical and relevant were selected and the pertinent literature “condensed”, with a view to guide future research, rather than analyze trends of the past. © 2015, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - We develop an analytical and numerical multi-market model that integrates land, fuel, and food markets, and link it with an emissions model to quantify the importance of carbon leakage relative to the intended emissions savings resulting from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for conventional biofuels. The expansion of biofuels mandated by the RFS can increase or decrease GHG emissions depending on the policy regime being evaluated. For example, replacing the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) with the RFS, as occurred at the end of 2011 when the VEETC was allowed to expire, would reduce emissions by 2.0 tgCO2e in 2015 for an expansion of ethanol of 11.4 billion liters. A policy regime consisting of the RFS alone would increase emissions by at least 4.5 tgCO2e for the same expansion of ethanol. Our findings highlight an important tension between land and fuel market leakage. Policy regimes that result in less land market leakage tend to lead to more domestic fuel market leakage per liter of ethanol added. Copyright © 2015 by the IAEE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO) is one of the most sustainable solutions to replace conventional fossil fuels in the transport sector. It can achieve greenhouse gas savings up to 88% and at the same time reducing the disposal of a polluting waste. In addition, it does not provoke potential negative impacts that conventional biofuels may eventually cause linked to the use of arable land. For this reason, most policy frameworks favor its consumption. This is the case of the EU policy that double-counters the use of residue and waste use to achieve the renewable energy target in the transport sector. According to different sources, biodiesel produced from UCO could replace around 1.5%-1.8% of the EU-27 diesel consumption. This paper presents an in-depth thermoeconomic analysis of the UCO biodiesel life cycle to understand its cost formation process. It calculates the ExROI value (exergy return on investment) and renewability factor, and it demonstrates that thermoeconomics is a useful tool to assess life cycles of renewable energy systems. It also shows that UCO life cycle biodiesel production is more sustainable than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Little information regarding the global water footprint of biofuels consumed in Europe is available. Therefore, the ultimate origin of feedstock underlying European biodiesel and bioethanol consumption was investigated and combined with the irrigation requirements of different crops in different countries. A (blue) water consumption of 1.9 m3 in 12 countries per GJ of European biodiesel and 3.3 m3 in 23 countries per GJ of bioethanol was determined. Even though this represents an increase by a factor of 60 and 40 compared to fossil diesel and gasoline, these figures are low compared to global average data. The assessment of local consequences has shown that the irrigation of sunflower seed in Spain causes 50% of the impacts resulting from biodiesel-even though it constitutes only 0.9% of the feedstock. In case of bioethanol production, the irrigation of sugar cane in Egypt, which constitutes only 0.7% of the underlying feedstock, causes 20% of the impacts. In a case study on passenger cars, it was shown that biofuels can reduce the global warming potential by circa 50% along the product life cycle. However, the price of this improvement is an approximate 19 times increased water consumption, and resulting local impacts are even more severe. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biogas is rich in methane and can be further purified through biogas upgrading technologies, presenting a viable alternative to natural gas. Landfills and anaerobic digestors treating municipal solid waste are a large source of such biogas. They therefore offer an attractive opportunity to tap into this potential source of natural gas while at the same time minimizing the global warming impact resulting from methane emissions in waste management schemes (WMS) and fossil fuel consumption reduction. This study looks at the current municipal solid waste flows of Spain, Italy, and Austria over one year (2009), in order to determine how much biogas is generated. Then it examines how much natural gas could be substituted by using four different biogas upgrading technologies. Based on current waste generation rates, exploratory but realistic WMS were created for each country in order to maximize biogas production and potential for natural gas substitution. It was found that the potential substitution of natural gas by biogas resulting from the current WMS seems rather insignificant: 0.2% for Austria, 0.6% for Italy and 0.3% for Spain. However, if the WMS is redesigned to maximize biogas production, these figures can increase to 0.7% for Austria, 1% for Italy and 2% for Spain. Furthermore, the potential CO2 reduction as a consequence of capturing the biogas and replacing fossil fuel can result in up to a 93% reduction of the annual national waste greenhouse gas emissions of Spain and Italy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a worldwide trend towards stricter control of diesel exhaust emissions, however presently, there are technical impediments to the use of FAME (fatty acid methyl esters)-type biodiesel fuel (BDF). Although hydrogenated biodiesel (HBD) is anticipated as a new diesel fuel, the environmental performance of HBD and its utilization system have not been adequately clarified. Especially when waste cooking oil is used as feedstock, not only biofuel production but also the treatment of waste cooking oil is an important function for society. A life cycle assessment (LCA), including uncertainty analysis, was conducted to determine the environmental benefits (global warming, fossil fuel consumption, urban air pollution, and acidification) of HBD produced from waste cooking oil via catalytic cracking and hydrogenation, compared with fossil-derived diesel fuel or FAME-type BDF. Combined functional unit including "treatment of waste cooking oil" and "running diesel vehicle for household waste collection" was established in the context of Kyoto city, Japan. The calculation utilized characterization, damage, and integration factors identified by LIME2, which was based on an endpoint modeling method. The results show that if diesel vehicles that comply with the new Japanese long-term emissions gas standard are commonly used in the future, the benefit of FAME-type BDF will be relatively limited. Furthermore, the scenario that introduced HBD was most effective in reducing total environmental impact, meaning that a shift from FAME-type BDF to HBD would be more beneficial. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different initial pH (6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0) and uncontrolled initial pH (CK) on the lab-scale anaerobic co-digestion of kitchen waste (KW) with cow manure (CM). The variations of pH, alkalinity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and total ammonia nitrogen (NH4 +-N) were analyzed. The modified Gompertz equation was used for selecting the optimal initial pH through comprehensive evaluation of methane production potential, degradation of volatile solids (VS), and lag-phase time. The results showed that CK and the fermentation with initial pH of 6.0 failed. The pH values of the rest treatments reached 7.7-7.9 with significantly increased methane production. The predicted lag-phase times of treatments with initial pH of 6.5 and 7.5 were 21 and 22days, which were 10days shorter than the treatments with initial pH of 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. The maximum methane production potential (8579mL) and VS degradation rate (179.8mL/g VS) were obtained when the initial pH was 7.5, which is recommended for co-digestion of KW and CM. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The conversion efficiency (εc) of absorbed radiation into biomass (MJ of dry matter per MJ of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) is a component of yield potential that has been estimated at less than half the theoretical maximum. Various strategies have been proposed to improve εc, but a statistical analysis to establish baseline εc levels across different crop functional types is lacking. Data from 164 published εc studies conducted in relatively unstressed growth conditions were used to determine the means, greatest contributors to variation, and genetic trends in εc across important food and biofuel crop species. εc was greatest in biofuel crops (0.049–0.066), followed by C4 food crops (0.046–0.049), C3 nonlegumes (0.036–0.041), and finally C3 legumes (0.028–0.035). Despite confining our analysis to relatively unstressed growth conditions, total incident solar radiation and average growing season temperature most often accounted for the largest portion of εc variability. Genetic improvements in εc, when present, were less than 0.7% per year, revealing the unrealized potential of improving εc as a promising contributing strategy to meet projected future agricultural demand. © 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - The current energy model based on fossil fuels is coming to an end due to the increase in global energy demand. Biofuels such as ethanol and butanol can be produced through the syngas fermentation by acetogenic bacteria. The present work hypothesizes that formate addition would positively impact kinetic parameters for growth and alcohol production in Clostridium ljungdahlii PETC and Clostridium carboxidivorans P7 by diminishing the need for reducing equivalents. Fermentation experiments were conducted using completely anaerobic batch cultures at different pH values and formate concentrations. PETC cultures were more tolerant to formate concentrations than P7, specially at pH 5.0 and 6.0. Complete growth inhibition of PETC occurred at sodium formate concentrations of 30.0 mM; however, no differences in growth rates were observed at pH 7.0 for the two strains. Incubation at formate concentrations lower than 2.0 mM resulted in increased growth rates for both strains. The most recognizable effects of formate addition on the fermentation products were the increase in the total carbon fixed into acids and alcohols at pH 5.0 and pH 6.0, as well as, a higher ethanol to total products ratio at pH 7.0. Taken all together, these results show the ability of acetogens to use formate diminishing the energy demand for growth, and enhancing strain productivity. © 2015 Sociedad Espanola de Microbiologia.

AB  - Phragmites karka (Retz.) Trin. ex Steud. is a halophytic grass found in inland saline marshes potentially useful for biofuel industry. Growth, polyphenol content and antioxidant activity in different plant parts were investigated after 45 days NaCl (0,100, 200 and 400 mM) treatments. An increased in polyphenolic content (5.06 to 12.81 mg GAE g-1 DW) and antioxidant activity (0.64-3.21 IC50 mg ml -1 for DPPH and 9.09-17.91 mM Fe +2 g -1 DW for FRAP) was observed with the increasing salt concentrations among different plant parts. Increase in plant biomass, phenolic content and antioxidant activity with lower MDA at 100 mM NaCl indicates a strong protection against oxidative damage. Leaves exhibited highest polyphenol and antioxidant activity, followed by stem and root. Coefficient of regression shows the high predictability of antioxidant activity (0.705) and phenolic contents (0.763) with an increase in salinity. Our data indicates a link between production of polyphenolic antioxidants and salt stress in P. karka which indicates salinity as an effective tool to produce antioxidant rich biomass for industrial purposes. © 2015, Pakistan Botanical Society.

AB  - China is the largest energy consumer in the world, but has limited energy resources. Energy security is thus a primary concern for China. Over reliance on the consumption of fossil energy has resulted in severe environmental pollution, which puts pressure on the government to adjust its energy mix. To strengthen its energy supply and prevent further environmental degradation, China has been committed to developing renewable energies, such as biofuels. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the development of biofuels, rural household biogas, and bioethanol, in particular. It also examines related government policies and the future prospects of the biofuel sector. The analysis shows that remarkable achievements have been made in the development of biogas in rural areas and in bioethanol at the industrial level. This progress is largely credited to government's strong support for the biofuel sectors. Nonetheless, although ongoing energy insecurity and environmental pollution continues to motivate the central government to support the development of biofuels, widening domestic food supply and demand gap, changes in rural life and agricultural industrialization constrain the further expansion of rural household biogas and cereal-based bioethanol. This article suggests that while China urgently needs to find alternative feedstock for the existing rural household biogas digesters and bioethanol plants, centralized biogas and non-cereal-based bioethanol projects should be prioritized for future development.

AB  - The study was aimed to evaluate the potential of existing genotypes of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) as biomass feedstock for ethanol production. We investigated the biomass productivity and chemical composition of twenty-six Jerusalem artichoke clones grown in a semi-arid region of China. Jerusalem artichoke was demonstrated to be a sustainable feedstock for bioethanol production. All structural and non-structural carbohydrates in whole plant of Jerusalem artichoke could be 5000 L/ha. The above-ground biomass of Jerusalem artichoke could be a promising feedstock for cellulosic ethanol. The ethanol potential yield from cellulose and hemicellulose in above-ground biomass were 1821 to 5930 L/ha, contributing 29.8-66.4% of the total ethanol yield, which could be as high as that from switchgrass and sweet sorghum stem. Large variation among the investigated genotypes for carbohydrates makes it possible to select suitable clones to be used in bioethanol production in semiarid regions. Clones HB-3, HEN-3, IM-1, SC-1, SHX-3, SX-2 and ZJ-2 yielded tuber total soluble sugar higher than 4.0 t/ha. Clones BJ-4, HUB-2, HUN-2, QH-1, SD-2 and SHH-1 produced more than 5.0 t/ha cellulose and hemicellulose in above-ground biomass. Clones BJ-4 and HUB-2 have the highest ethanol potential based on structural carbohydrates. These clones were promising material if used as biofuel feedstock in this growth condition. © Z.X.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass-based ethanol is categorized as 2nd generation bioethanol in the advanced biofuel portfolio. To make sound incentive policy proposals for the Chinese government and to develop guidance for research and development and industrialization of the technology, the paper reports careful techno-economic and sensitivity analyses performed to estimate the current competitiveness of the bioethanol and identify key components which have the greatest impact on its plant-gate price (PGP). Two models were developed for the research, including the Bioethanol PGP Assessment Model (BPAM) and the Feedstock Cost Estimation Model (FCEM). Results show that the PGP of the bioethanol ranges $4.68-$6.05/gal (9,550-12,356 yuan/t). The key components that contribute most to bioethanol PGP include the conversion rate of cellulose to glucose, the ratio of five-carbon sugars converted to ethanol, feedstock cost, and enzyme loading, etc. Lignocellulosic ethanol is currently unable to compete with fossil gasoline, therefore incentive policies are necessary to promote its development. It is suggested that the consumption tax be exempted, the value added tax (VAT) be refunded upon collection, and feed-in tariff for excess electricity (byproduct) be implemented to facilitate the industrialization of the technology. A minimum direct subsidy of $1.20/gal EtOH (2,500 yuan/t EtOH) is also proposed for consideration. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Ethanol production in Brazil has grown by 219% between 2001 and 2012, increasing the use of land and water resources. In the semi-arid north-eastern Brazil, irrigation is the main way for improving sugarcane production. This study aimed at quantifying water consumed in ethanol production from sugarcane in this region using the water footprint (WF) indicator and complementing it with an evaluation of the water apparent productivity (WAP). This way we were able to provide a measure of the crop´s physical and economic water productivity using, respectively, the WF and WAP concepts. We studied sugarcane cultivation under nine different water regimes, including rainfed and full irrigation. Data from a mill of the state of Alagoas for three production seasons were used. Irrigation influenced sugarcane yield increasing total profit per hectare and economic water productivity. Full irrigation showed the lowest WF, 1229 litres of water per litre of ethanol (L/L), whereas rainfed production showed the highest WF, 1646 L/L. However, the lower WF in full irrigation as compared to the rest of the water regimes implied the use of higher volumes of blue water per cultivated hectare. Lower water regimes yielded the lowest economic productivity, 0.72 US$/m3 for rainfed production as compared to 1.11 US$/m3 for full irrigation. Since economic revenues are increased with higher water regimes, there are incentives for the development of these higher water regimes. This will lead to higher general crop water and economic productivity at field level, as green water is replaced by blue water consumption. © 2015 INIA.

AB  - Monoterpenes are liquid hydrocarbons with applications ranging from flavor and fragrance to replacement jet fuel. Their toxicity, however, presents a major challenge for microbial synthesis. Here we evolved limonene-tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and sequenced six strains across the 200-generation evolutionary time course. Mutations were found in the tricalbin proteins Tcb2p and Tcb3p. Genomic reconstruction in the parent strain showed that truncation of a single protein (tTcb3p1-989), but not its complete deletion, was sufficient to recover the evolved phenotype improving limonene fitness 9-fold. tTcb3p1-989 increased tolerance toward two other monoterpenes (β-pinene and myrcene) 11- and 8-fold, respectively, and tolerance toward the biojet fuel blend AMJ-700t (10% cymene, 50% limonene, 40% farnesene) 4-fold. tTcb3p1-989 is the first example of successful engineering of phase tolerance and creates opportunities for production of the highly toxic C10 alkenes in yeast. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - We measured stable isotopic and chemical characteristics of bulk aerosols collected at a coastal station in western India (Goa) between December 2009 and January 2011, to characterize lower tropospheric atmospheric conditions and their influence on particle chemistry during winter and summer seasons. Marked differences were observed in terms of sources and chemical compositions of bulk aerosols. The δ15NTN values of winter aerosols (10.8 ± 2.2‰, n = 10) indicate biomass burning contributions in the carbonaceous fraction, while significantly depleted δ15NTN values of summer aerosols (6.2 ± 2.3‰, n = 12) hints incorporation of marine N species. The δ34STS showed depleted values during winter (5.0 ± 1.0‰, n = 10), which closely matched with those of typical urban polluted environments, while summer aerosols showed a systematic enrichment of δ34STS (up to ~14‰ with average value 9.0 ± 2.8‰, n = 13); possibly due to incorporation of volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) emitted from the adjacent Arabian Sea. Likewise, δ13CTOC values showed ~2‰ enrichment in winter aerosols (–24.8 ± 0.4‰, n = 10) with respect to those of summer values, indicating presence of bio-fuel and coal burning contributions in carbonaceous fraction of winter aerosols. We also measured major ions (Na+, K+, Mg++, Ca++, NH4+, Cl–, Br–, NO3–, SO4–2) in water soluble fraction of aerosols to understand winter/summer changes in the atmospheric chemistry over this coastal area. This is the first ever dataset on triple isotopic characteristics of bulk aerosols at a coastal location of India showing signatures of continental bio-mass/biofuel burning influences during winter, whereas marine inventories (e.g., sea salt, DMS and mineral dust) appear to dominate chemical composition of summer aerosols. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used to analyze various pathways of biofuel preparation from "cradle to grave." Effects of nitrogen supply for algae cultivation and technology of algal oil extraction on life cycle fossil energy ratio of biodiesel are assessed in this study. Life cycle fossil energy ratio of Chlorella vulgaris based biodiesel is improved by growing algae under nitrogen-limited conditions, while the life cycle fossil energy ratio of biodiesel production from Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown with nitrogen deprivation decreases. Compared to extraction of oil from dried algae, extraction of lipid from wet algae with subcritical cosolvents achieves a 43.83% improvement in fossil energy ratio of algal biodiesel when oilcake drying is not considered. The outcome for sensitivity analysis indicates that the algal oil conversion rate and energy content of algae are found to have the greatest efects on the LCA results of algal biodiesel production, followed by utilization ratio of algal residue, energy demand for algae drying, capacity of water mixing, and productivity of algae.

AB  - Biomass supply chain optimization aims to facilitate large-scale production of biofuels by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of biomass feedstock provision. Most existing models are not web based, limited by the accessibility for real-world applications. A CyberGIS-enabled biomass supply chain decision support platform was developed to improve model accessibility and computational performance. The platform includes four major components: BioScope optimization model, GISolve middleware, high-performance cyberinfrastructure, and an interactive web interface. The workflow and functions of each component are provided to illustrate the development and usage of the platform. Case studies and associated system performance have been evaluated to demonstrate the utility of the CyberGIS-enabled decision support platform. Through leveraging cyberinfrastructure resources and interactive web-based interface, the platform enables solving complex biomass supply chain optimization problems. The improved computational performance could provide responsive decision support for group-based applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Camelina sativa could be a potential feedstock to help meet the U.S. biodiesel production goal of 36 billion gallons by 2022, as set forth by Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This research is focused on assessing the energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of camelina biodiesel production in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the U.S. Field data were collected from a camelina farm in the region, and crushing and transesterification data were measured using facilities at the University of Idaho. It was estimated that use of camelina biodiesel reduces GHG emissions by 69% compared to 2005 baseline diesel. However, camelina biodiesel does not meet the ASTM D6751 specification for oxidative stability without an additive. Camelina has a smaller seed size compared to canola and required 23% more energy for crushing. The net energy ratio for camelina biodiesel was found to be 3.6, and the fossil energy ratio was found to be 4.2. From an agronomic standpoint, camelina can be incorporated into low rainfall areas of the PNW as a rotational crop. Wheat areas of the PNW with annual rainfall of 19 to 38 cm that currently incorporate fallow into their rotations were considered as potential areas for camelina production. There were 846,500 ha (2.1 million acres) of land meeting the criteria in the region that could potentially produce 443.0 million L of biodiesel (117.1 million gal) and 1.2 billion kg of meal per year. This is 12.1% of the approved amount of camelina meal that could be used in livestock feed within the PNW. It was concluded that camelina biodiesel qualifies as an advanced biofuel, and camelina meal has potential to be consumed locally as a feed mix for livestock. © 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in corn (Zea mays L.) is critical for optimizing yield and reducing environmental impact. Stover removal in continuous corn (CC) for biofuel production, coupled with reduced-tillage systems, could alter NUE and residual soil nitrate-N. Experiments were conducted in Minnesota over 3 yr to determine how N uptake, NUE, and residual soil nitrate-N are a ected by stover (remove and retain), tillage (chisel- [CT], strip- [ST], and no-till [NT]), and fertilizer N (0, 45, 89, 134, 179, and 224 kg N ha–1) management. ­There was a linear response of grain and total aboveground N uptake to fertilizer N across stover management and tillage treatments. Stover removal increased recovery efficiency for ST and NT at fertilizer N rates £134 kg N ha–1, but did not enhance N recovery in plots fertilized at rates >134 kg N ha–1. Internal efficiency was 5% greater with stover removal with no fertilizer N, but did not change with fertilizer N application. Stover removal did not affect agronomic efficiency in CT but did enhance it in ST and NT at fertilizer N rates £ 134 kg N ha–1. Residual soil nitrate-N to a depth of 1.2 m was 10 to 16 kg NO3–N ha–1 greater with stover removal at fertilizer N rates of 134 to 224 kg N ha–1. Greater residual soil nitrate-N with stover removal indicates a need for judicious management of N when stover is removed in intensively-managed Upper Midwestern CC systems. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Removal of crop residues for bioenergy, feedstock, or other purposes should be done with caution to avoid excessive soil erosion or loss of soil organic matter (SOM). This study examined average annual changes in soil erosion from rainfall and wind forces and trends in soil organic matter as a function of commodity and/or bioenergy-based crop rotations, yield variations, and different field management practices, including residue removal across all land capability class (LCC) I to VIII soils in selected areas of the U.S. Central Great Plains (CGP). Specifically, comparisons were made between various rotations including corn, winter wheat, sorghum, cotton, fallow, and canola, subject to reduced tillage and no-till management practices. The purpose was to assess cropping options, field management, and soil sustainability to provide a geospatial assessment for use in soil conservation planning and possible bioenergy resource assessments in the CGP. Soil erosion and SOM (proxied by a soil conditioning index, SCI) were analyzed on individual soil map unit components using the RUSLE2 and WEPS models. Results were grouped by LCC and organized with respect to three different spatial resolutions: field scale (individual soil type), field scale aggregated to county level, and field scale aggregated to regional level. Analyses indicate variation in soil erosion and SCI trends as a function of crop type, rotation, and field management practices across different soil types within a single county and at the regional level. Considerable variation in removable residue amounts also occurred across different rotations, especially with respect to crop type, rotation, soil type, and tillage. Results obtained in this study should help advance the overall knowledge base of both public and private-focused commodity and bioenergy crop production agriculture and soil sustainability by providing small informational resolution (i.e., soil type) data on soil erosion and health trends that could have a pronounced effect on producer economics and long-term land sustainability. © 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - This paper deals with the comparative analysis of environmental impacts of bio-diesel produced from Jatrophacurcas, rapeseed, canola, soybean and palm oil, by applying the life cycle analysis (LCA). The environmental impact categories considered are global warming potential (GWP, carbon dioxide equivalents) and acidification potential (AP, sulphur dioxide equivalent). The results indicate advantages regarding energy resources and greenhouse gases (GHG), while the disadvantages related to acidification, eutrophication and nitrous oxide in case of Jatropha. Data collection was based on both primary survey as well as secondary review from a sample of 75 respondents. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the significant difference between the populations means, based on data collected from sample means of the respective population.

AB  - A sustainable transition is premised upon moving from a carbon energy regime to a renewable energy regime; a highly contested political-economic transformation, to say the least. In places like the United States and European Union the main form of renewable energy is bioenergy, especially biofuels. Recent policy and industry efforts are focusing on the development and implementation of what are known as 'drop-in' biofuels, so named because they can be incorporated into existing distribution infrastructure (e.g. pipelines) and conversion devices with relatively few, if any, technical modifications. As with carbon energy, bioenergy has particular materialities that are implicated in the political-economic possibilities and constraints facing societies around the world. These political materialities of bioenergy shape and are shaped by new energy regimes and therefore problematize the notion of a drop-in biofuel. Thus further examination of the political materialities of bioenergy, and of renewable energy more generally, is of critical importance for successful sustainable transitions.

AB  - Mustard seed meals of indian mustard [InM (Brassica juncea)] and yellow mustard [YeM (Sinapis alba)], alone and combined, were tested for effects on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants and for suppression of southern root-knot nematode [RKN (Meloidogyne incognita)] and weed populations. In the greenhouse, with all seed meal treatments applied at 0.25% total w/w soil, low tomato plant stands (up to 60% dying/dead) resulted from amendment with 3 YeM:1 InM, 1 YeM:1 InM, and YeM, applied right before transplant. Compared with untreated controls, low numbers of RKN eggs per gram root were consistently recorded from amendment with 3 YeM:1 InM. In a 2012 field study, incorporation of 1 YeM:1 InM (1700 lb/acre) resulted in lower tomato root biomass than fertilizer application (504 lb/acre), YeM or InM (each 1700 lb/acre). All treatments were applied with added fertilizer to achieve 100–102 lb/acre nitrogen, 7.4 lb/acre phosphorus, 74.7 lb/acre potassium, 6.0 lb/acre sulfur, and 1.0 lb/acre boron. The lowest numbers of RKN eggs per gram root (harvest 2012) were collected from plots amended with InM (1700 lb/acre), YeM (850 lb/acre), and 3 YeM:1 InM (1700 lb/acre), but the numbers were not significantly different from fertilizer only (504 lb/acre) controls. Highest and lowest tomato yields (numbers of fruit) in 2012 were recorded from YeM (850 lb/acre) and 3 YeM:1 InM (1700 lb/acre) amendments, respectively. In 2013, there were no significant differences among treatments in eggs per gram root or in tomato yields. No mustard seed meal treatment affected weed populations. At the tested rates, YeM seed meal showed potential for use in tomato beds but results were inconsistent between years. © 2015 American Society for Horticultural Science. All rights received.

AB  - One method to inform decisions with respect to sustainable, efficient and equitable water allocation and use is water footprint assessment (WFA). This paper presents a preliminary WFA of South Africa (SA) based on data for the period 1996–2005 Crop production was found to contribute about 75% of the total water footprint of national production. The total water footprint of crop production is mainly composed of five crops: maize, fodder crops, sugarcane, wheat and sunflower seed, which account for 83% of the crop water footprint. The average water footprint of a South African consumer is 1 255 m3/yr, below the world average of 1 385 m3/yr, and is dominated by the consumption of meat (32%) and cereals (29%). About one fifth of this water footprint of consumption is external to SA. While SA is a net virtual water importer, the virtual water trade analysis revealed that a large share of blue water consumption is related to export. Sustainability concerns are that the major river basins face severe blue-water scarcity for extended periods of the year, and that water pollution levels related to nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be unsustainable in all river basins in SA. Efficient allocation and use of water is investigated by means of comparing the consumptive water footprint to global benchmark values, as well as the economic green- and blue-water productivity and the economic land productivity of the crops cultivated in SA. Furthermore, crops with specific potential for biofuel production are assessed. Lastly, recommendations to address the identified issues are given. © 2015, South African Water Research Commission.

AB  - Ex-post evaluations of energy policies in Malaysia between 1970 and 2010 were conducted. The developments of energy policies in Malaysia were traced from the early 1970s with the introduction of the country's first energy-related policy all the way to 2010 with the country's first endeavour towards a biobased energy system. Analyses revealed that many of the policies were either: (1) directly responding to changes in global/domestic socioeconomic and political events, or (2) provided visions to guide developments of the energy sector in alignment with the country's growth agenda. Critical examinations of the country's actual energy consumptions during these 40 years were also conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these energy-related policies. Three noteworthy successes in Malaysia's energy landscape are: (1) the formation of PETRONAS as the national oil and gas company; (2) reduction of country's over-reliance on oil as a single source of energy by significantly growing the production and use of natural gas in a short span of time; and (3) creation of a thriving oil and gas value chain and ecosystem in the country. However, the country is still critically dependent on scarce petroleum resources, despite having an abundance of renewable reserves. Progress towards renewable energy has been too little and too slow. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The two major pathways for energy utilization from biomass are conversion to a liquid fuel (i.e., biofuels) or conversion to electricity (i.e., biopower). In the United States (US), biomass policy has focused on biofuels. However, this paper will investigate three options for biopower: low co-firing (co-firing scenarios refer to combusting a given percentage of biomass with coal) (5%-10% biomass), medium co-firing (15%-20% biomass), and dedicated biomass firing (100% biomass). We analyze the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact of each of these options, with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Our analysis shows that in the absence of land use change emissions, all biomass co-combustion scenarios result in a decrease in GHG emissions over coal generation alone. The two biggest barriers to biopower are concerns about carbon neutrality of biomass fuels and the high cost compared to today's electricity prices. This paper recommends two policy actions. First, the need to define sustainability criteria and initiate a certification process so that biomass providers have a fixed set of guidelines to determine whether their feedstocks qualify as renewable energy sources. Second, the need for a consistent, predictable policy that provides the economic incentives to make biopower economically attractive. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The exponential growth of energy demand worldwide, the depletion of oil reserves and the severe pollutants problems caused by industry that favors greenhouse effect, evidence the need to increase the supply of oils for biodiesel production. This sets a new overview for studying non-edible oilseeds species. An alternative is barbados nut or piñon (Jatropha curcas) crop, perennial bush that is native from Mexico and Central America, grows in most of tropical countries, and it is considered like one of the non-conventional oilseed crops with great expectations for obtaining biodiesel. The barbados nut (Jatropha curcas) seeds have an outstanding characteristic: their high oil content allows converting it to liquid biofuel, and also the shell can be transformed into biogas and biofertilizers. Jatropha curcas is a green option to reforest degraded soils and to control erosion, as well as an option to diversify agricultural systems (crop rotation). On the other hand, in several scientific studies it is reported a wide variation in yields, due lack of study of plant's genetics, the agronomic handling, as well to the misunderstanding that exists in some countries in the field of zones with best agroecological ability to set the crop. The agroecological zoning (ZAE) refers to a division of land surface and weather into smaller units, that have similar characteristics related to its ability, potential yield and environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to define the zones with different agroecological abilities to set the Jatropha curcas crop, in the state of Tabasco. In order to accomplish this, four types of abilities were defined: optimal, proper, marginal by thermal or water deficit, and marginal by thermal or water excess. The agroecological zoning (ZAE) proposed in this paper defines zones based on combinations of soil, physiography, weather characteristics of temperature, rainfall and growth rate. An agroclimatic zoning is a zone with characteristics related to weather and crop systems, for our study the database of ERIC III (Extractor Rápido de Información Climatológica) was used, reporting for Tabasco a total of 93 meteorological stations. Nevertheless, only 35 stations were selected, since the other had inconsistencies in their information. From those 35 stations, a weather database was created, considering the information of historical series in a daily basis, like minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall and evaporation (1950-2003 period). The edaphoclimatic zoning consisted in assessing the soil resource based in the units and subdivisions of soil from FAO/UNESCO system. In order to fulfill the zoning, cartographic data of soils subunits was consolidated, including texture, slope, soil depth, and its fertility, whose edaphological properties were compared to FAO's Jatropha curcas crop requirements and optimal level was assigned. The tool used for cartography elaboration was ArcMap GIS Software, which consists of computer mapping system that relates locations with agroclimatic information equal to Jatropha curcas crop requirements, which were defined like areas with ability, and according to this maps were prepared at a scale of 1:250 000 of every climatic element. The interpolation for the calculation of isolines was made by Kriging method, embedded within ArcMap software, which ease the handling and superposition of theme information layers of weather and soil. The yearly average analysis of temperature corroborated that whole Tabasco state has optimal ability and the rainfall analysis showed a surface of 2 229 631 ha with optimal ability. About soil resource there were detected 37 subunits of soil with optimal ability, adding a surface of 945 462 ha. After analyzing the maps between optimal characteristic abilities (temperature, rainfall and growth rate) and edaphological, there were detected 833 181 ha with optmial agroecological ability, therefore in the state of Tabasco is feasible the crop of this oilseed to produce biofuels.

AB  - In this study, we report an extensive set of analytical results on the quality of the biogas produced by a landfill of automotive shredder residues. In particular, the investigation was directed towards the identification of a spectrum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16 compounds) and a wide range of volatile organic compounds (35 compounds). This article highlights the most important indications of toxicological concern for the detected compounds. Among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chrysene shows the highest concentration, followed by pyrene and benzo(b)fluoranthene. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene, the most carcinogenic of the tested compounds, displayed results below the limit of analytical detectability. Benzo(a)pyrene, another typical carcinogenic compound, was detected at low concentrations. With regard to volatile organic compounds, the survey revealed a relevant concentration of toluene (found in fuels and paint thinner) significantly higher than the other compounds. Noticeable amounts of hexane, trichloromethane, and acetone were also found. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - The impact of co-digestion as opposed to separate digestion, on biogas and methane yield (apparent synergetic effects) was investigated for three biomass materials (pig manure, cow manure and food waste) under mesophilic conditions over a 36 day period. In addition to the three biomass materials (digested separately), 13 biomass mixtures (co-digested) were used. Two approaches for modelling biogas and methane yield during co-digestion, based on volatile solids concentration and ultimate gas and methane potentials, wereevaluated. The dependency of apparent synergetic effects on digestion time and biomass mixture composition was further assessed using measured cumulative biogas and methane yields and specific biogas and methane generation rates. Results indicated that it is possible, based on known volatile solids concentration and ultimate biogas or methane yields for a set of biomass materials digested separately, to accurately estimate gas yields for biomass mixtures made from these materials using calibrated models. For the biomass materials considered here, modelling indicated that the addition of pig manure is the main cause of synergetic effects. Co-digestion generally resulted in improved ultimate biogas and methane yields compared to separate digestion. Biogas and methane production was furthermore significantly higher early (0-7 days) and to some degree also late (above 20 days) in the digestion process during co-digestion. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Eremurus spectabilis samples were liquefied in organic solvents (methanol, ethanol and acetone) with (sodium hydroxide and ferric chloride) and without catalyst in a cylindrical reactor at temperatures of 270, 290 and 310°C under supercritical conditions. The effects of liquefaction parameters such as temperature, catalyst and solvent on product yields were investigated. The liquid products were extracted with diethyl ether and benzene using an extraction procedure. The product yields in supercritical methanol, ethanol and acetone were found to as 41.6%, 53.8% and 64.3% in the non-catalytic runs at 310°C, respectively. The highest conversion was obtained in supercritical acetone in the presence of ferric chloride (10%) at same temperature in the catalytic runs. The produced liquids in acetone were analyzed and characterized by elemental, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The liquid products (bio-oils) obtained with acetone contained various types of components including aromatics, nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds. As the bio-oils obtained exhibit high heat values, E. spectabilis is presented as a potential feedstock candidate for production of bio-fuels or valuable chemicals. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Background: Marine microalgae are among the most promising lipid sources for biodiesel production because they can be grown on nonarable land without the use of potable water. Marine microalgae also harvest solar energy efficiently with a high growth rate, converting CO2 into lipids stored in the cells. Both light intensity and nitrogen availability strongly affect the growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid composition of oleaginous microalgae. However, very few studies have systematically examined how to optimize lipid productivity by adjusting irradiance intensity, and the metabolic dynamics that may lead to improved lipid accumulation in microalgae have not been elucidated. Little is known about the mechanism of lipid synthesis regulation in microalgae. Moreover, few studies have assessed the potential of using marine microalgae as oil producers. Results: In this work, a newly isolated marine microalga, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4, was selected as a potential lipid producer, and the effect of photobioreactor operations on cell growth and lipid production was investigated. The combined effects of light intensity and nitrogen depletion stresses on growth and lipid accumulation were further explored in an effort to markedly improve lipid production and quality. The optimal lipid productivity and content attained were 312 mg L-1 d-1 and 43.1% per unit dry cell weight, respectively. This lipid productivity is the highest ever reported for marine microalgae. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to observe transient changes during lipid accumulation triggered by combined stresses. Finally, metabolite turnover was also assessed using an in vivo 13C-labeling technique to directly measure the flow of carbon during lipid biosynthesis under stress associated with light intensity and nitrogen deficiency. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the synergistic integration of cultivation and dynamic metabolic profiling technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for enhancing oil production in a marine microalga. The knowledge obtained from this study could be useful in assessing the feasibility of marine microalgae biodiesel production and for understanding the links between dynamic metabolic profiles and lipid biosynthesis during the course of microalgal cultivation. © 2015 Ho et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - As the use of second-generation biofuel crops increases, so do questions about sustainability, particularly their potential to affect fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This study used a life-cycle approach to compare environmental impacts associated with three switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production scenarios: i) regional production from a pool of Tennessee farmers based on in-field inputs and biomass yield; ii) varying nitrogen (N)-input levels from a replicated field study for 8-yrs i.e., a 100% and 9% decrease, and an 81% and 172% increase from 'baseline levels' of N inputs used under objective i; and, iii) a legume-intercrop system compared to baseline levels in order to determine effects of displacing synthetic-N with legumes. When compared across all agricultural inputs, nitrogen fertilizer production and breakdown resulted in the greatest environmental impacts. Although fertilization increased lignocellulosic yields, a 100% reduction in N-inputs from baseline levels reduced the formation of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxides per unit of production, (or dry tonne of biomass over 10-yrs) compared to a 172% increase. Switchgrass yield response indicated a 'less is more' scenario, as inputs beyond the current recommended input level (67 kg N ha-1) are not environmentally remunerating. During switchgrass biomass production, inputs with lesser impacts included phosphorus, herbicides, pesticides, and diesel fuel. Legume-intercropping reduced greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater acidification (5% and 27% reduction in global warming potential and formation of acidifying species, respectively) compared with the 67 kg N ha-1 rate. Although N-fertilizers impact environmental sustainability of regional switchgrass feedstock production, environmental consequences can be reduced under proper N-management i.e., ≤67 kg N ha-1 or legume intercropping. However, given that the aim of second-generation feedstocks is to reduce the current reliance on fossil fuels, their production still requires fossil energy-based inputs. Consequently, greenhouse gas reductions and the extent of cleaner feedstock production during the agricultural biofuel supply chain is contingent upon input management and optimizing synthetic fertilizer usage. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - In order to relieve the pressure of energy supply and environment contamination that humans are facing, there are now intensive worldwide efforts to explore natural bioresources for production of energy storage compounds, such as lipids, alcohols, hydrocarbons, and polysaccharides. Around the world, many plants have been evaluated and developed as feedstock for bioenergy production, among which several crops have successfully achieved industrialization. Microalgae are another group of photosynthetic autotroph of interest due to their superior growth rates, relatively high photosynthetic conversion efficiencies, and vast metabolic capabilities. Heterotrophic microorganisms, such as yeast and bacteria, can utilize carbohydrates from lignocellulosic biomass directly or after pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce liquid biofuels such as ethanol and butanol. Although finding a suitable organism for biofuel production is not easy, many naturally occurring organisms with good traits have recently been obtained. This review mainly focuses on the new organism resources discovered in the last 5 years for production of transport fuels (biodiesel, gasoline, jet fuel, and alkanes) and hydrogen, and available methods to improve natural organisms as platforms for the production of biofuels. ©Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013

AB  - The narrow scope of the U.S. renewable fuel standard (RFS2) is a missed opportunity to spur a wider range of biomass use. This is especially relevant as RFS2 targets are being missed due to demand-side limitations for ethanol consumption. This paper examines the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of a more flexible policy based on RFS2, which includes credits for chemical use of bioethanol (to produce bioethylene). A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the life-cycle GHG emissions of conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE), made from natural gas derived ethane (mean: 1.8 kg CO2e/kg LDPE). The life-cycle GHG emissions from bioethanol and bio-LDPE are examined for three biomass feedstocks: U.S. corn (mean: 97g CO2e/MJ and 2.6 kg CO2e/kg LDPE), U.S. switchgrass (mean: -18g CO2e/MJ and -2.9 kg CO2e/kg LDPE), and Brazilian sugar cane (mean: 33g CO2e/MJ and -1.3 kg CO2e/kg LDPE); bioproduct and fossil-product emissions are compared. Results suggest that neither corn product (bioethanol or bio-LDPE) can meet regulatory GHG targets, while switchgrass and sugar cane ethanol and bio-LDPE likely do. For U.S. production, bioethanol achieves slightly greater GHG reductions than bio-LDPE. For imported Brazilian products, bio-LDPE achieves greater GHG reductions than bioethanol. An expanded policy that includes bio-LDPE provides added flexibility without compromising GHG targets. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: In the sugarcane industry, large amounts of lignocellulosic residues are generated, which includes bagasse, straw, and tops. The use of the whole sugarcane lignocellulosic biomass for the production of second-generation (2G) ethanol can be a potential alternative to contribute to the economic viability of this process. Here, we conducted a systematic comparative study of the use of the lignocellulosic residues from the whole sugarcane lignocellulosic biomass (bagasse, straw, and tops) from commercial sugarcane varieties for the production of 2G ethanol. In addition, the feasibility of using a mixture of these residues from a selected variety was also investigated. Results: The materials were pretreated with dilute acid and hydrolyzed with a commercial enzymatic preparation, after which the hydrolysates were fermented using an industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The susceptibility to enzymatic saccharification was higher for the tops, followed by straw and bagasse. Interestingly, the fermentability of the hydrolysates showed a different profile, with straw achieving the highest ethanol yields, followed by tops and bagasse. Using a mixture of the different sugarcane parts (bagasse-straw-tops, 1:1:1, in a dry-weight basis), it was possible to achieve a 55% higher enzymatic conversion and a 25% higher ethanol yield, compared to use of the bagasse alone. For the four commercial sugarcane varieties evaluated using the same experimental set of conditions, it was found that the variety of sugarcane was not a significant factor in the 2G ethanol production process. Conclusions: Assessment of use of the whole lignocellulosic sugarcane biomass clearly showed that 2G ethanol production could be significantly improved by the combined use of bagasse, straw, and tops, when compared to the use of bagasse alone. The lower susceptibility to saccharification of sugarcane bagasse, as well as the lower fermentability of its hydrolysates, can be compensated by using it in combination with straw and tops (sugarcane trash). Furthermore, given that the variety was not a significant factor for the 2G ethanol production process within the four commercial sugarcane varieties evaluated here, agronomic features such as higher productivity and tolerance of soil and climate variations can be used as the criteria for variety selection. © 2015 Pereira et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum are anaerobic thermophilic bacteria being investigated for their ability to produce biofuels from plant biomass. The bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, adhE, is present in these bacteria and has been known to be important for ethanol formation in other anaerobic alcohol producers. This study explores the inactivation of the adhE gene in C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum. Deletion of adhE reduced ethanol production by >95% in both T. saccharolyticum and C. thermocellum, confirming that adhE is necessary for ethanol formation in both organisms. In both adhE deletion strains, fermentation products shifted from ethanol to lactate production and resulted in lower cell density and longer time to reach maximal cell density. In T. saccharolyticum, the adhE deletion strain lost >85% of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity did not appear to be affected, although ALDH activity was low in cell extracts. Adding ubiquinone-0 to the ALDH assay increased activity in the T. saccharolyticum parent strain but did not increase activity in the adhE deletion strain, suggesting that ALDH activity was inhibited. In C. thermocellum, the adhE deletion strain lost >90% of ALDH and ADH activity in cell extracts. The C. thermocellum adhE deletion strain contained a point mutation in the lactate dehydrogenase gene, which appears to deregulate its activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, leading to constitutive activation of lactate dehydrogenase. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in plastids, and thus, export for subsequent acyl editing and lipid assembly in the cytosol and endoplasmatic reticulum is required. Yet, the transport mechanism for plastid fatty acids still remains enigmatic. We isolated FAX1 (fatty acid export 1), a novel protein, which inserts into the chloroplast inner envelope by α-helical membrane-spanning domains. Detailed phenotypic and ultrastructural analyses of FAX1 mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility and synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds such as lipids, ketone waxes, or pollen cell wall material. Determination of lipid, fatty acid, and wax contents by mass spectrometry revealed that endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, but levels of several plastid-produced species increased. FAX1 over-expressing lines showed the opposite behavior, including a pronounced increase of triacyglycerol oils in flowers and leaves. Furthermore, the cuticular layer of stems from fax1 knockout lines was specifically reduced in C29 ketone wax compounds. Differential gene expression in FAX1 mutants as determined by DNA microarray analysis confirmed phenotypes and metabolic imbalances. Since in yeast FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport, we concluded that FAX1 mediates fatty acid export from plastids. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related, mitochondrial membrane proteins of so-far unknown function. Therefore, this protein family might represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid/biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems involved in vertebrate fatty acid and lipid metabolism. © 2015 Li et al.

AB  - The first generation biofuels primarily produced from crops compete with other food crops for arable land and are recently susceptible as safe and reliable renewable energy resources. The second generation biofuels produced from non-food feedstocks, mainly being microalgae, have been paid increasing attention to. Compared to the first generation biofuels, there are some advantages for microalgae such as high productivity, less land use, low requirement of water quality, environmental use (for wastewater treatment and carbon dioxide (CO2) biomitigation), etc. This paper reviews the current status of the use of microalgae for sustainable production of biofuels and specifically addresses issues to do with culturing systems, processes, economics, and modelling. Open ponds and a variation of closed photobioreactor culturing systems were described in detail. The culture processes are introduced briefly. Techno-economic analyses and analyses of environmental effect mainly due to CO2 biomitigation are performed. Life cycle assessments and the model studies of microalgae production are also reviewed comprehensively in addition. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - We studied temporal dynamics of above- and belowground growth and N use in three production systems: maize (C4 annual), reconstructed prairie (a mixture of perennial C3 and C4 species) and fertilized reconstructed prairie. Our objectives were to fill knowledge gaps about temporal patterns of growth (especially for roots), inform further experimental research, and provide quantitative datasets for modeling. A 2-yr field study was conducted near Boone, IA, in which above- and belowground plant tissues were sampled repeatedly during each growing season (n = 15 aboveground, n = 4 belowground). Dry weight and tissue N concentration were measured, and growth rates and N productivity were estimated. We found that maize produced more aboveground biomass (18.4 Mg/ha) with higher growth rates that peaked later in the season compared with the two prairie treatments (9.4–14.9 Mg/ha/year). Maize allocated a smaller proportion of its biomass belowground (10%) than both prairie treatments did (20–40%). Overall the N productivity ranged from 11 to 135 kg biomass kg–1 thermal unit–1 for maize and 34 to 344 kg biomass kg–1 thermal unit–1 for both prairie treatments. Our findings provide new, quantitative data that will be useful for predicting system-level processes of annual and perennial crops evaluated for food and biofuel production. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Sugar cane cultivation has long characterized the economies of many Latin American and Caribbean states. Labor has shifted from the enslavement that accompanied sugar production under colonial powers to wage labor, yet in many ways the working conditions have remained similar. Working conditions on Brazilian sugar cane plantations vary widely, but there is ample evidence to conclude that the exploitation of workers is common in this industry. Brazil’s northeast has historically been the primary area of sugar cane production. However, centuries of poor agricultural practices have resulted in diminished soil fertility in this region. This environmental degradation is compounded by the Northeast’s historical dependence on agricultural production, contributing to high rates of unemployment, and the vast income discrepancy between the northeast and the south. Labor migration from the northeast to the more affluent south is a consequence of these circumstances. This paper considers the working conditions of the seasonal migrant labor force that bears most of the responsibility for sugar cane harvesting in the center-south region of Brazil, and questions the sustainability of ethanol under the current mode of production, given the human and social challenges. © 2015, Common Ground, Terry-Ann Jones, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Interest in the promotion of biofuel investments to mediate the energy crisis and assist rural development is growing across sub-Saharan Africa. However, empirical evidence on how policy can effectively promote sustainable biofuels is largely lacking. This paper presents new, multi-level assessments of the implications of the Malian Strategy for Biofuels Development for the promotion of the oil-bearing, non-edible tree Jatropha curcas (Jatropha) as a sustainable development tool in Mali: a sub-Saharan African country that has led Jatropha-derived biofuel policy initiatives. In doing so, the paper addresses knowledge gaps on the role of national policy instruments in the uptake of biofuel activities. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with government departments, international organizations, private sector representatives, non-governmental organizations and farming communities. Data show that mainstreaming internationally agreed principles into national policies is key to attract monetary, institutional and technical support from international organizations and donors. However, there are gaps between policy targets, actual yields and land cover. Jatropha oil supplies remain insufficient for improving access to fuel and substituting national consumption. Ambitious land cover targets set within national policies could risk land use shifts away from food towards biofuel production. Improved cooperation and coordination among state departments, enhanced monitoring of programmes and projects, as well as the establishment of adequate regulatory and fiscal frameworks governing private biofuel investments are needed to achieve sustainable outcomes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - With a primary goal of reducing the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels, as equally creating a new source of revenue for the rural population, Mozambique began the cultivation of raw materials for the production of biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel). However, biodiesel production in the country is still on a Inceptive phase, showing evidence that needs to be stimulated. This paper aims to characterize the biodiesel sector in order to assess their contributions to attend the Mozambique energy needs. The biodiesel sector is characterized by the insignificant biodiesel production due to absence of social inclusion policies and diversification of raw material. The residual cooking oil is an alternative fuel with low costing and high energy potential, and it does not compete with food security parameters. Therefore, it is able to minimize weaknesses and strengthen the sector against the threats identified by the SWOT analysis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess crop residue biomass potential for second generation biofuel production in the Lawra-Nandom district of Ghana. The methods used in this study included interviews, survey, field and laboratory experiments. The findings show that total annual crop residues production in the Lawra-Nandom district amounts to about 272,000 t. Among the major crops grown in the district, sorghum crop generates the largest quantity of residues, contributing 59% by weight of the total residues. Ethanol production potential could reach 40 million litres if 40% of the average residue generated between 2003 and 2012 were used for energy purposes. The net energy balance of the biofuel production process was 1718.7 MJ with a ratio of energy output to input being 1.31. Second generations biofuels are expensive compared to first generation and research efforts aimed at technology improvement and cost reduction must intensify in order to make the technology attractive to developing countries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study was to investigate whether a pyrolysis plant using municipal solid waste (MSW) in North Carolina would be environmentally friendly. Based on the analysis of primary landfills and wasteflow across North Carolina, five pyrolysis plants were assumed to be built to utilize MSW. Life cycle assessment results indicate that global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), human toxicity potential (HTP) and photochem ozone creation potential (POCP) are mainly from bio-oil production, which accounts for 32.8%, 59.4%, 98.2% and 99.8% of the total potentials generated by the whole process, respectively. Besides, the main source of ozone depletion potential (ODP) and terrestric ecotoxicity potential (TETP) is electricity for bio-oil production. Eutrophication potential (EP) emission is mainly from the exhaust of diesel vehicle operation. Hydrogen and char are produced in production and upgrading of bio-oil as co-products, which generate 5.5 MJ and 2.7 MJ energy credits per kg MSW, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the yield of bio-oil is the most sensitive parameter in determining GWP and the electricity consumption also plays a significant role on GWP. The impact potentials of MSW pyrolysis were compared with those of other three alternatives of anaerobic digestion, incineration and landfill for treating MSW. Results show fast pyrolysis for bio-oil causes the least impact, while the disposal of the MSW in landfills causes the worst impact on the environment. Based on above results, pyrolysis of MSW for transportation fuels is an environment-friendly way to utilize the MSW. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the use of second-generation biofuel crops increases, so do questions about sustainability, particularly their potential to affect fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This study used a lifecycle approach to compare environmental impacts associated with three switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production scenarios: i) regional production from a pool of Tennessee farmers based on in-field inputs and biomass yield; ii) varying nitrogen (N)-input levels from a replicated field study for 8-yrs i.e., a 100% and 9% decrease, and an 81% and 172% increase from 'baseline levels' of N inputs used under objective i; and, iii) a legume-intercrop system compared to baseline levels in order to determine effects of displacing synthetic-N with legumes. When compared across all agricultural inputs, nitrogen fertilizer production and breakdown resulted in the greatest environmental impacts. Although fertilization increased lignocellulosic yields, a 100% reduction in N-inputs from baseline levels reduced the formation of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxides per unit of production, (or dry tonne of biomass over 10-yrs) compared to a 172% increase. Switchgrass yield response indicated a 'less is more' scenario, as inputs beyond the current recommended input level (67 kg N ha-1) are not environmentally remunerating. During switchgrass biomass production, inputs with lesser impacts included phosphorus, herbicides, pesticides, and diesel fuel. Legume-intercropping reduced greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater acidification (5% and 27% reduction in global warming potential and formation of acidifying species, respectively) compared with the 67 kg N ha-1rate. Although N-fertilizers impact environmental sustainability of regional switchgrass feedstock production, environmental consequences can be reduced under proper N-management i.e., ≥67 kg N ha-1 or legume intercropping. However, given that the aim of second-generation feedstocks is to reduce the current reliance on fossil fuels, their production still requires fossil energy-based inputs. Consequently, greenhouse gas reductions and the extent of cleaner feedstock production during the agricultural biofuel supply chain is contingent upon input management and optimizing synthetic fertilizer usage. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The growing demand for green world serves as one of the most significant challenges of modernization. Requirements like largest usage of energy for modern society as well as demand for friendly milieu create a deep concern in field of research. Biofuels are placed at the peak of the research arena for their underlying benefits as mentioned by multiple researches. Out of a number of vegetable oils, only a few are used commercially for biodiesel production. Due to various limitations of edible oil, non-edible oils are becoming a profitable choice. Till today, very little percentage of biodiesel is used successfully in engine. The research is still continuing for improving the biodiesel usage level. Recently, it is found that the blended biodiesel from more than one feedstock provides better performance in engine. This paper reviews the physicochemical properties of different biodiesel blends obtained from various feedstocks with a view to properly understand the fuel quality. Moreover, a short description of each feedstock is given along with graphical presentation of important properties for various blend percentages from B0 to B100. Finally, mathematical model is formed for predicting various properties of biodiesel blend with the help of different research data by using polynomial curve fitting method. The results obtained from a number of literature based on this work shows that the heating value of biodiesel is about 11% lower than diesel except coconut (14.5% lower) whereas kinematic viscosity is in the range of 4-5.4 mm2/s. Flash point of all biodiesels are more than 150 °C, except neem and coconut. Cold flow properties of calophyllum, palm, jatropha, moringa are inferior to others. This would help to determine important properties of biodiesel blend for any percentage of biodiesel and to select the proper feedstock for better performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the increasing demand for alternative energy carriers, biomass is in the focus of research and industry as raw material for fuels and base chemicals. This has led to an increased use of feedstock for biofuel production and to conflict between using this feedstock for either food or for fuel generation. To avoid this problem, lignocellulose is seen as a promising raw material, as it is not used for food or feed production and harbors high amounts of sugars in form of cellulose and hemicellulose. Currently, the enzymes used for cellulose degradation are mainly produced directly in their natural hosts (e.g. Trichoderma reesei) or in genetically altered microorganisms. The high costs for the production of these enzymes make them a major obstacle for the economically feasible use of lignocellulose as a renewable raw material. As an alternative production platform, plants could be used to express these enzymes cheaply and directly in the raw material to be used for conversion. To alleviate the skepticism towards genetically altered plants, especially prevalent in Germany and Europe, chloroplast transformation offers the opportunity to combine efficient production of a set of cellulases within a single plant, while reducing the risk of releasing altered genetic information into the environment. This approach is used in this project to express seven cellulolytic enzymes, derived from the bacterium Thermobifida fusca, in the chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum and to analyze their activity on cellulosic substrates as well as their influence on plant growth. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

AB  - The perennial miscanthus crop is a promising feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production due to its high yield, low input and low environmental impacts. To be suitable for cellulosic ethanol production, cultivated Miscanthus clones need to present not only high aboveground biomass production, but also high cellulose and hemicellulose contents and low lignin, soluble, and ash contents. By testing M.×. giganteus, M. sacchariflorus, and M. sinensis clones, we investigated the relationships between biomass production and biomass composition traits at two harvest dates over 3 years. High aboveground biomass production was associated with high canopy height, high stem diameter, late flowering, and high cellulose and lignin contents but low hemicellulose, soluble, and ash contents. The aboveground biomass production was positively correlated with the potential yields of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignins. These relationships were consistent throughout the years and the harvest dates. The most productive Miscanthus clones displayed high cellulose contents and low soluble and ash contents; however, they displayed low hemicellulose contents and high lignin contents. The total aboveground biomass composition was closer to the stem composition than to the leaf composition. Nevertheless, the leaves were interesting because of their high hemicellulose and low lignin contents. Lastly, all of the studied factors were significant, but the biomass production traits were mainly affected by the year of cultivation or clone, while the biomass composition traits were mainly affected by the harvest date. All of the traits showed low interaction effects. These results will guide the breeding of Miscanthus clones that are tailored for biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is a matter of time before biofuels become essential for powering the planet. As the population grows and the fossil fuel supply continues to dwindle, we will need sustainable, bio-based fuels to take the lead in the energy market. But, biofuels, most notably ethanol, have received criticism because they often compete with food for land space, putting food stocks at risk.

AB  - Xylans, including methylglucuronoxylans (MeGXn) and methylglucuronoarabinoxylans (MeGAXn), are the predominant polysaccharides in hemicellulose fractions of dicots and monocots available for conversion to biofuels and chemicals. Paenibacillus sp. strain JDR-2 (Pjdr2) efficiently depolymerizes MeGXn and MeGAXn and assimilates the generated oligosaccharides, resulting in efficient saccharification and subsequent metabolism of these polysaccharides. A xylan utilization regulon encoding a cellassociated GH10 (glycoside hydrolase family 10) endoxylanase, transcriptional regulators, ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters, an intracellular GH67 α-glucuronidase, and other glycoside hydrolases contributes to complete metabolism. This GH10/GH67 system has been proposed to account for preferential utilization of xylans compared to free oligo-and monosaccharides. To identify additional genes contributing to MeGXn and MeGAXn utilization, the transcriptome of Pjdr2 has been sequenced following growth on each of these substrates as well as xylose and arabinose. Increased expression of genes with different substrates identified pathways common or unique to the utilization of MeGXn or MeGAXn. Coordinate upregulation of genes comprising the GH10/GH67 xylan utilization regulon is accompanied with upregulation of genes encoding a GH11 endoxylanase and a GH115 α-glucuronidase, providing evidence for a novel complementary pathway for processing xylans. Elevated expression of genes encoding a GH43 arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase and an arabinose ABC transporter on MeGAXn but not on MeGXn supports a process in which arabinose may be removed extracellularly followed by its rapid assimilation. Further development of Pjdr2 for direct conversion of xylans to targeted products or introduction of these systems into fermentative strains of related bacteria may lead to biocatalysts for consolidated bioprocessing of hemicelluloses released from lignocellulose. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Biofuels will help meet rising demands for energy and, ideally, limit climate change associated with carbon losses from the biosphere to atmosphere. Biofuel management must therefore maximize energy production and maintain ecosystem carbon stocks. Increasingly, there is interest in intercropping biofuels with other crops, partly because biofuel production on arable land might reduce availability and increase the price of food. One intercropping approach involves growing biofuel grasses in forest plantations. Grasses differ from trees in both their organic inputs to soils and microbial associations. These differences are associated with losses of soil carbon when grasses become abundant in forests. We investigated how intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a major candidate for cellulosic biomass production, in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations affects soil carbon, nitrogen, and microbial dynamics. Our design involved four treatments: two pine management regimes where harvest residues (i.e., biomass) were left in place or removed, and two switchgrass regimes where the grass was grown with pine under the same two biomass scenarios (left or removed). Soil variables were measured in four 1-ha replicate plots in the first and second year following switchgrass planting. Under switchgrass intercropping, pools of mineralizable and particulate organicmatter carbon were 42% and 33% lower, respectively. These declines translated into a 21% decrease in total soil carbon in the upper 15 cm of the soil profile, during early stand development. The switchgrass effect, however, was isolated to the interbed region where switchgrass is planted. In these regions, switchgrass-induced reductions in soil carbon pools with 29%, 43%, and 24% declines in mineralizable, particulate, and total soil carbon, respectively. Our results support the idea that grass inputs to forests can prime the activity of soil organic carbon degrading microbes, leading to net reductions in stocks of soil carbon. Active microbial biomass, however, is higher under switchgrass, and thismicrobial biomass is a dominant precursor of soil carbon formation. Future studies need to investigate soil carbon dynamics throughout the lifetime of intercropping rotations to evaluate whether increases in microbial biomass can offset initial declines in soil carbon, and hence, maintain ecosystem carbon stocks. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Controlling soil nutrient leaching in farmland ecosystems has been a hotspot in the research field of agricultural environment. Biochar has its unique physical and chemical properties, playing a significant role in enhancing soil carbon storage, improving soil quality and increasing crop yield. As a kind of new exogenous material, biochar has the potential in impacting soil nutrient cycling directly or indirectly, and has profound influences on soil nutrient leaching. This paper analyzed the intrinsic factors affecting how biochar affects soil nutrient leaching, such as the physical and chemical properties of biochar, and the interaction between biochar and soil organisms. Then the latest literatures regarding the external factors, including biochar application rates, soil types, depth of soil layer, fertilization conditions and temporal dynamics, through which biochar influences soil nutrient (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) leaching were reviewed. On that basis, four related action mechanisms were clarified, including direct adsorption of nutrients by biochar due to its micropore structure or surface charge, influencing nutrient leaching through increasing soil water-holding capacity, influencing nutrient cycling through the interaction with soil microbes, and preferential transport of absorbed nutrients by fine biochar particles. At last future research directions forbetter understanding the interactions between biochar and nutrient leaching in the soil were proposed. ©, 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology.

AB  - The sustainability of biofuels has been the subject of heated debates in Europe. The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED) introduced criteria meant to define whether biofuels are sustainable. These criteria, relating to the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the types of land used to produce biofuels, are expected to be implemented through certification schemes associating private companies and public bodies (whether national or European). Using recent works in the sociology of markets, I consider these sustainability schemes as agencements, a lens for the study of the construction of a market in sustainable biofuels and for the analysis of European integration. I focus on the mass balance system, which, meant to track the circulation of biofuels qualified as sustainable, is a compromise, implemented at the price of pervasive uncertainties and difficulties. The European political and economic organisation is at stake in discussions related to the extent of the control exercised through the sustainability schemes by virtue of the mass balance system, and a politics of subsidiarity and a politics of harmonisation are at the heart of the making of a European market for sustainable biofuels. The description of the agencements organising European markets in sustainable biofuels points to the importance of coexistence as an economic and political operation. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We examine the transnational governance of biofuel sustainability and its coexistence with the WTO trade regime. The way in which the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is shaping transnational biofuel governance shows deep and mutual dependence between public and private. The EU relies on a private system of compliance and verification, but private certification schemes are dependent on the incentives provided by RED to expand commercially. A second layer of hybridity in this governance system is that it is emerging in the shadow of the WTO. EU policymakers refrained from introducing binding requirements for social sustainability criteria in RED, and left private certifiers to fill this gap. Our discussion also serves to introduce the symposium on the ‘Transnational Hybrid Governance’ (THG) of biofuels. The three contributions to the symposium analyse the complex making and mutual shaping of biofuel sustainability and discuss the institutional features, processes, networks, and sociotechnical devices by which markets are organised, and economic and political orders take shape. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - With air quality, liability, and safety concerns, prescribed burning and managed wildfire are often considered impractical treatments for extensive fuels reduction in western US forests. For California’s Sierra Nevada forests, we evaluated the alternative and analyzed the amount and distribution of constraints on mechanical fuels treatments on USDA Forest Service land. With the use of current standards and guides, feedback from practicing silviculturists, and GIS databases, we developed a hierarchy of biological (i.e., nonproductive forest), legal (i.e., wilderness), operational (i.e., equipment access), and administrative (i.e., sensitive species and riparian areas) constraints. Of the Sierra Nevada Bioregion’s 10.7 million acres in USDA Forest Service ownership, 58% contains productive forest and 25% is available to mechanical treatment. National forests in the southern Sierra Nevada have higher levels of constraint due to more wilderness and steeper, more remote terrain. We evaluated different levels of operational constraints and found that increasing road building and operating on steeper slopes had less effect on increasing mechanical access than removing economic considerations (i.e., accessing sites regardless of timber volume). Constraints due to sensitive species habitat and riparian areas only reduced productive forest access by 8%. We divided the Sierra Nevada Bioregion into 710 subwatersheds (mean size of 22,800 acres) with >25% Forest Service ownership as an approximation of a relevant management planning unit for fire or “fireshed.” Only 20% of these subwatersheds had enough unconstrained acreage to effectively contain or suppress wildfire with mechanical treatment alone. Analysis suggests mechanical treatment in most subwatersheds could be more effective if it established a fuel-reduced “anchor” from which prescribed and managed fire could be strategically expanded. With potential future increases in wildfire size and severity, fire policy and forest restoration might benefit if mechanical thinning is more widely used to leverage and complement managed fire. © 2015 Society of American Foresters.

AB  - Two processing tomato hybrids and five N fertilization rates were evaluated regarding their biomass, fruit yield, and saccharification potential. Although no difference was detected between the hybrids, both for fruit and residual biomass yield, 106kgha-1N fertilization rate showed the highest fruit mass and 186kgha-1 resulted in the highest residual biomass production.The biomass in the hybrid Kero had higher content of total and crystalline cellulose compared to Defender. N fertilization significantly changed biomass composition. Eighty kg ha-1 N led to the highest lignin, hemicellulose and pectin content, whereas the 159kgha-1 applications caused the highest percentage of total and crystalline cellulose. Xylose was the most abundant monosaccharide in hemicelluloses, whereas fucose was the lest abundant. The hybrid Kero gave higher ethanol potential production than Defender and both hybrids reached the highest values under 159kgha-1 of N. Alkali pre-treatment caused the highest values of saccharification and hot water the lowest. The hybrid Kero showed higher saccharification potential than Defender and 159kgha-1N fertilization rate led to the best results. We show that tomato residual biomass is an interesting lignocellulosic feedstock for ethanol production and both hybrid and nitrogen fertilization rate significantly affects the biomass chemical composition and saccharification potential of the residual biomass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between different biofuel production systems, the context in which they operate, and the extent to which various types of frameworks and schemes are able to monitor and promote their sustainability. The paper refers to the European Union Renewable Energy Directive and two international certification schemes (Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels and NTA 8080/81) that can provide a 'licence to sell' biofuels on the EU market, and to the Mozambican policy framework for sustainable biofuels that provides a 'licence to produce' biomass for biofuels in Mozambique. Food security is used as a case study, and the food security impacts of two agro-industrial and two smallholder biofuel projects in Mozambique are described and analysed. The sustainability frameworks and schemes used in this study are able to address some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between and within different biofuel production systems. The emphasis is on monitoring agro-industrial projects while smallholder projects tend to slip through the net even when their negative impacts are evident. We conclude that globally applicable sustainability principles are useful, however, they should be operationalised at local or production system levels. This approach will support balancing between global frameworks and local heterogeneity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is growing interest in biofuel production, and energycane (Saccharum spp. × S. spontaneum L.) has been proposed as an important biofuel and biomass crop. However, little is known about the growth and ecology of this new crop, especially in the tropics. The present study evaluated the performance of 14 energycane clones, elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.), and two sugarcane (S. officinarum L.) varieties in the humid tropics of Costa Rica, and eight energycane clones in the subtropics of Florida. In the tropics, energycane’s growth and biomass production were highly variable when comparing clones. However, the best performing clones US85-1006, US88-1006, and US78-1014 produced almost twice the dry biomass (&gt;64 Mg ha-1) compared with sugarcane varieties Pindar and Q-132 (21-39 Mg ha-1). In the subtropics, energycane fresh (52-79 Mg ha-1) and dry (20-30 Mg ha-1) weights were less than half of those in the tropics. Energycane clones flowered in both environments, but pollen viability was three to four times higher (&gt;40%) in the tropics than in the subtropics, although viable seeds were found only in the tropics. Weed risk assessment (WRA) scores were higher in the tropics than in the subtropics and varied among clones. The results confirmed that energycane is a promising feedstock for biomass production and could play an important role as a bioenergy crop when grown in the tropics and subtropics, but due to genotype × environment interactions, the tradeoff between biomass production and weedy and invasive risk must be assessed for each individual clone and environment. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Managing the soil profile NO3-N through crop selection and irrigation is an important consideration for the sustainable production of cellulosic biofuel feedstock crops. Data from two seasons were collected and analyzed from a 4-yr study conducted in Prosser, WA, to assess the e ect of biofuel feedstock grasses and irrigation levels on soil profile NO3-N. e experimental design was a split plot with three replications. e main plots had three irrigation levels (60, 80, and 100% evapotranspiration, ET), and the subplots contained three cultivars of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) cultivars. Soil and root samples were collected in fall 2011 (Season1) and winter of 2012 (Season2). Soil profile NO3-N concentrations were highest at the lowest irrigation levels. In Season1, the soil profile NO3-N concentration averaged over depths was 1.7 mg kg-1 for the switchgrass cultivars and 5.6 mg kg-1 for gamagrass. In Season2, the concentrations were 1.4 and 2.2 mg kg-1 for the switchgrass cultivars and gamagrass, respectively. We found a signi cant correlation between switchgrass root mass and soil profile NO3-N; r = 0.63-Kanlow; r = 0.58- Blackwell; and r = 0.46- Shawnee. Our results suggest that soil profile NO3-N was lower under the switchgrass cultivars than gamagrass. More root mass and NO3-N were accumulated at lower irrigation levels. e results reported here can help in developing practical decision tools for managing fertilizer N in biomass biofuel crops. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Algal biomass is currently being pursued as a source for conversion to jet fuel because of its renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic fuel properties. To reduce fresh water consumption used in the production of biomass, research has shifted to growing algae on wastewater. Algal biomass grown on wastewater is noncompetitive to feed sources. In this research, the lipid extracted algal biomass of Chlorella sorokiniana is repurposed as a biosorbent to remove copper(II) from wastewater. A comparative recovery study of Cu(II) is presented with whole algal biomass and lipid extracted algae (LEA). The Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate the binding types of ion exchange electrostatic interaction with various surface sites of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and metal groups. The Cu capture maximum for the whole biomass and LEA is capable of removing similar quantities of Cu(II) with a sorption-desorption life of six cycles. Hence, the LEA is a viable substitute for whole algae as a means to remove Cu from wastewater while preserving the lipid for conversion into biodiesel, jet fuel, or the like. Extrapolation of these results could provide justification for using LEA as a pretreatment for heavy metal removal from wastewater, whether generated from industrial or municipal processes. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - This study discusses about the environmental performance of Miscanthus conversion to district heat. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is used as a tool to assess the environmental impacts related to the biomass conversion to heat. Energy conversion of Miscanthus is compared in two combustion scenarios: (i) in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant and (ii) in a Boiler (producing heat only). Biomass conversion to heat is also compared with the conversion of natural gas (NG). The environmental impact categories considered for the assessment are: Global Warming Potential (GWP), Non-Renewable Energy (NRE) use and Land use (LU). The current study revealed that for 1MJ of heat production, Miscanthus fired in the CHP plant would lead to a GWP at -0.071kg CO2-eq, an NRE use -0.767-MJ primary, and LU 0.09m2-a (square metre-annual). For the same heat output, Miscanthus fired in the boiler would lead to a GWP of 0.005kg CO2-eq, NRE use 0.172MJ-primary and land use 0.063m2-a. Miscanthus fired in the CHP plant is better than in the boiler from the stand point of lowering the GWP and increasing the savings in fossil fuel, but with slightly higher LU. A comparison between Miscanthus and NG has showed that despite the biomass possessed advantage in reducing GWP and NRE use, additional land required for Miscanthus could be seen as a disadvantage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio fuels production was carried out in an electrically heated fixed bed tubular reactor. During the experimental work, all kinds of factor were investigated. It was found that reaction temperature played key role and the rate between nickel and cobalt is an important role in decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction. Technological conditions are optimized at reaction temperature, the oil flow rate, the gas flow rate and the rate between nickel and cobalt, 450°C, 0.1 mL/min, 12 mL/min and 3:1, respectively. The alkanes content and alkenes content of liquid products is 44.86 and 49.08 %, respectively under the optimized condition. The product is mostly under C18 hydrocarbon compounds. The results of GC online and trace water determination show that the oxygen in the oils are mainly removed through decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction. The oxygen in the oils are tiny removed through the dehydration of alcohol. Characterization of technologies including TG, XRD, BET, FT-IR, GC-MS and temperature programmed reduction were performed to demonstrate more details. The catalyst deactivation was due to coke deposition, relatively to sintering. © 2015, Chemical Publishing Co. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work was carried out in search of a suitable fuel alternative to fast-depleting fossil fuel and oil reserves and in serious consideration of the environmental problems associated with the major use of fuels based on petrochemicals; research work is in progress worldwide. Researchers have been re-directing their interests to biomass-dependent fuels, which currently seem to be the only logical substitute for green development in the context of economical and environmental aspects. Renewable bioresources are available worldwide in the form of residual agricultural biomass and wastes, which can be converted into liquid biofuels. However, the process of converting, or chemical conversions, can be very expensive and not worthwhile to use for an economical large-scale commercial supply of biofuels. Hence, there is still need for souch research to be done on an effective, economical, and efficient conversion process. The objective of this review is to provide a deep overview of liquid biofuels and the present knowledge produced by scientists throughout the world. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Transition of the current gasoline-based transportation system into a renewable fuel-based clean vehicle system has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve national energy security. However, the realized net environmental benefit or energy security improvement is tightly linked to the electricity fuel mix (for electric cars and plug-in hybrids) and fueling strategy (for cars using alternative liquid fuels). In addition, different types of transportation fuels have significantly different demands on land resources, both on land type and quantity. For example, biofuel production requires large quantities of agricultural land, while wind farms require land with sufficient wind density. Furthermore, there is substantial regional variation in the quality of necessary resources. Regions with higher wind speeds require less land to produce the same amount of electricity than those with lower wind speed, assuming the same turbine design. Similarly, regions with optimal soil conditions and climate for crop cultivation require less land to produce the same amount of biofuel. To enable comparison of land demand among different fuel choices for clean vehicles, this research provides a county-scale assessment of land demand based on a "per-vehicle-mile-traveled" basis. Potential clean vehicle fuels assessed in this study include ethanol produced from different feedstocks (corn and switchgrass), biodiesel from algae cultivated in open ponds and closed systems, and electricity produced from renewable sources (wind and solar). Our results show that, in general, engineered systems (wind electricity, solar electricity, and biodiesel from closed-system algae) are more land efficient than natural systems (corn ethanol from corn starch and stover, switchgrass ethanol, and biodiesel from open-pond algae). Solar electricity is the dominant regional optimal fuel choice from the land-use perspective for engineered systems while lowland switchgrass ethanol and biodiesel from open-pond algae are the major optimal choices for the natural systems. These results shed light on developing both federal and state level policies to minimize land-use impact for the development of a clean vehicle system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pretreatment as a crucial step in the process of ethanol production has significant influences on the process efficiency and on the environmental performance of the bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. In present life cycle analysis (LCA) study, two cases for pretreatment of woodchips were considered as the focal point of the ethanol plant. One was assumed as base scenario whereas the second is the proposed alternative by implementation of modifications on the base design. In the first stage, LCA results of pretreatment unit showed lower environmental impacts in respiratory inorganics and land use than in new scenario, while the base scenario revealed better performance in fossil fuels. The results of the second stage of LCA study demonstrated improvement in proposed design in most categories of environmental impacts such as 18.5 % in land use as well as 17 % improvement in ecosystem quality. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This paper analyzes costs of several biofuel production pathways in Australia from crop residues (stubble), a lignocellulosic feedstock. As well as land (and sea) transport suitable biofuels, we also consider electricity, and aviation biofuels. Some biofuel cost calculations assume a minimum processing plant scale, often based on contemporary fossil fuels production scales. The more theoretical approach here minimizes production cost by trading off processing and transport costs. Optimal scales and process component costs depend on feedstock spatial concentration; however total costs are less strongly dependent. Lower concentrations correspond to smaller processing plant and greater collection areas and costs. Processing costs are added to feedstock production and transport costs to derive biofuel supply cost ranges as a function of feedstock concentration in an Australian context. Sensitivity analysis then identifies significant parameters and confidence interval estimates. A companion paper generates Australian nationally aggregated supply cost curves. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L) stover removal for biofuel or forage has implications on soil organic C (SOC). The objective of this study was to evaluate short-term (3-yr) stover management (retained or removed [79% removed, across treatments and years]), tillage system (chisel tillage, strip-tillage, and no-till [CT, ST, and NT, respectively]), and fertilizer N (0 and 224 kg N ha-1) effects on particulate and total soil C and N in continuous corn (CC) cropping systems on fine-textured soils in the Upper Midwest. Soil samples were collected at study initiation in 2008 and at its conclusion in 2011. Stover removal decreased SOC in the surface depth (D1) by 15% compared to when it was retained and 11 % when compared with the baseline level. In the same depth, SOC with CT was 10 and 9% less than with ST and NT, respectively, and 10% less than the baseline. Particulate organic matter C (POM-C) decreased in D1 between sampling times with stover removal in all tillage systems. When stover was retained, POM-C in D1 increased 36 and 40% over the baseline with ST and NT, respectively, but decreased 18% with CT. Chisel tillage decreased POM-C in the sampled soil profile by 13 and 17% compared with ST and NT, respectively, and by 21 % when compared with the baseline. These results demonstrate that annually harvesting the maximum quantities of stover in CC allowable by field-scale machinery can reduce near-surface particulate and total soil organic matter in the Upper Midwest after 3 yr, but losses can be reduced by tillage systems that reduce soil disturbance. © Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison WI 53711 USA.

AB  - A biophysically constrained economic analysis of several alternative biofuel production pathways develops upper and lower bounds on national supply cost curves, taking into account implicit spatial dependencies and trade-offs. As well as land (and sea) transport suitable biofuels, we also consider electricity and aviation biofuels. One feedstock (crop residues from grains) and five bioenergy pathways illustrate this approach for Australia. The methods are, however, applicable to any feedstock, bioenergy technology, region, or scale. Biofuel production costs, dependent on the spatial concentration of available feedstock, are derived in a companion paper by selecting a cost minimizing production scale. Lower concentrations imply smaller processing plants and greater collection areas and costs. Any candidate production plant location can have a collection area that approximates the least cost for its average spatial concentration, because feedstock concentration varies only modestly within cost minimizing area scales. A set of plant locations, scales, and near to least-cost collection areas, is found that collectively service all the available residue feedstock using Australian data. This generates upper and lower bounds on nationally aggregated supply cost curves. The sizing of biofuel facilities will be also affected by investment scale commercial considerations, including the reliability of feedstock and investor appetite for risk: these are discussed qualitatively. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels have great potential as low-carbon transportation fuel alternatives and can be essentially drop-in fuels for existing fossil-fuel-based transportation infrastructures. Thus, the incentives for biofuel development are large but there are a number of issues: competition with food, land use, fresh water use, economics in comparison to fossil fuels, and achievable reduction in carbon footprint in comparison to other transportation fuel options. This paper focuses on utilization of anthropogenic CO2 from power plants in advanced biofuel production systems and the integration of those systems with various power plant designs. In doing so, the boundary of the life cycle analysis is expanded to include the power plant CO2 source, considering specifically natural gas, pulverized coal, supercritical coal, and IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) options. The carbon footprints for the integrated systems are compared to CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) as well as the current status quo of CO2 release to the atmosphere. The integrated biorefinery-power plant options considered here are shown to be greatly advantaged compared to the status quo (no CO2 capture) carbon footprint, and also advantaged with respect to CCS as long as the biorefinery alone operates with a carbon footprint that is 75% or more lower than that of gasoline. In addition, the projected carbon footprint values, and estimated production costs, for algal-based ethanol are favorable compared to other transportation fuel options including corn-based ethanol and electricity. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability certification schemes and standards are meant to prevent a range of unacceptable socioeconomic and environmental consequences, such as threats to biodiversity. While there is wide support for conserving biodiversity, operationalizing this support in the form of guiding principles, criteria/indicators, and legislation is complicated. This study investigates how and to what extent 26 sustainability standards (eleven for forest management, nine for agriculture and six biofuel-related) consider biodiversity, by assessing how they seek to prevent actions that can threaten biodiversity as well as how they support actions aimed at biodiversity conservation. For this purpose, a benchmark standard was developed, meant to represent a case with very high ambitions concerning biodiversity conservation. Of the assessed standards, the biofuel-related standards demonstrated the highest level of compliance with the benchmark. On average, they complied with 72% of the benchmark's component criteria, compared to 61% for the agricultural standards and 60% for the forestry standards. Fairtrade, Sustainable Agriculture Network/Rainforest Alliance (SAN/RA), Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) were particularly stringent, while Green Gold Label S5 (GGLS5), PEOLG, Global Partnership for Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBALGAP), European Union Organic (EU Organic), National Organic Program (NOP), Green Gold Label S2 (GGLS2), and International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) were particularly unstringent. All eleven forestry standards, six of the nine agricultural standards, and all six biofuel-related standards addressed ecosystem conversion, ranging from requiring that high conservation value areas be identified and preserved to requiring full protection. Finally, key barriers to, and challenges for, certification schemes are discussed and recommendations are made for further development of sustainability standards. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Carbon-based liquid fuels are highly valued for transportation; they are the world's largest form of commercial energy and second largest source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Strategies to address their CO2 emissions have been shaped by fuel cycle analysis (FCA), a version of lifecycle assessment that examines fuel products and their supply chains. FCA studies have diverse findings and large uncertainties. Disagreements are particularly sharp for biofuels, which are seen as key replacements for petroleum fuels. A critical reading of the evolving literature reveals problems of model structure, including system boundary misspecification, flawed carbon cycle representation, and use of a static framework to analyze dynamic systems. New analytic paradigms are needed for liquid fuels, given their tradability, the realities of the carbon cycle, and the implausibility of capturing carbon from mobile sources. Logical decomposition of options shows that, beyond measures to limit fuel demand, CO2 emissions from liquid fuels must be balanced by increasing the rate of net carbon fixation. Further analysis and discussion are needed of carbon accounting methods, energy research priorities, ways to link CO2 removal options to fuel-related mitigation efforts, and the transportation elements of climate policy. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Seaweeds are a valuable feedstock in the production of biofuels such as biogas. In order to achieve higher conversion rates, the biomass requires a pretreatment step. However, the use of harsh conditions is detrimental to the environment and negatively affects the biochemical composition of the seaweed, lowering the yields of the products. In this study, Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima were pretreated with organic acids and enzymes. The extent of hydrolysis was evaluated by the concentration of reducing sugars (RS) released from the seaweed. Thereafter, the effect of pretreatments on biogas production from L. digitata was investigated in 120 ml batch reactors incubated at 35°C. Oxalic acid and the enzymatic preparation Cellulase (Sigma C9748) improved the recovery of RS. Pretreatments inhibited the anaerobic digestion process and only a 6% increase in biogas production was obtained when the biomass was subjected to a combination of 2.5% citric acid and Cellulase. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - There is significant interest in farming algae for the direct production of biofuels and valuable lipids. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the leading model system for studying lipid metabolism in green algae, but current methods for isolating mutants of this organism with a perturbed lipid content are slow and tedious. Here, we present the Chlamydomonas high-lipid sorting (CHiLiS) strategy, which enables enrichment of high-lipid mutants by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of pooled mutants stained with the lipid-sensitive dye Nile Red. This method only takes 5 weeks from mutagenesis to mutant isolation. We developed a staining protocol that allows quantification of lipid content while preserving cell viability. We improved separation of high-lipid mutants from the wild type by using each cell's chlorophyll fluorescence as an internal control. We initially demonstrated 20-fold enrichment of the known high-lipid mutant sta1 from a mixture of sta1 and wild-type cells. We then applied CHiLiS to sort thousands of high-lipid cells from a pool of about 60 000 mutants. Flow cytometry analysis of 24 individual mutants isolated by this approach revealed that about 50% showed a reproducible high-lipid phenotype. We further characterized nine of the mutants with the highest lipid content by flame ionization detection and mass spectrometry lipidomics. All mutants analyzed had a higher triacylglycerol content and perturbed whole-cell fatty acid composition. One arbitrarily chosen mutant was evaluated by microscopy, revealing larger lipid droplets than the wild type. The unprecedented throughput of CHiLiS opens the door to a systems-level understanding of green algal lipid biology by enabling genome-saturating isolation of mutants in key genes. © 2014 The Authors The Plant Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A promising way to increase the energy efficiency and reduce costs of biofuel production is to integrate it with heat and power production in polygeneration plants. This study treats the retrofitting of a Danish combined heat and power plant by integrating lignocellulosic ethanol production based on wheat straw with the aim of minimizing specific ethanol production cost. Previously developed and validated models of the facilities are applied in the attempt to solve the design optimization problem. Straw processing capacities in the range of 5-12 kg/s are considered, while plant operation is optimized over the year with respect to maximal income and with the limitations that the reference hourly district heating production has to be met while reference hourly power export cannot be exceeded. The results suggest that the specific ethanol production cost increased continuously from 0.958 Euro/L at a straw processing capacity of 5 kg/s to 1.113 Euro/L at a capacity of 12 kg/s, indicating that diseconomies-of-scale applies for the suggested ethanol production scheme. A thermodynamic evaluation further discloses that the average yearly exergy efficiency decreases continuously with increasing ethanol production capacity, ranging from 0.746 for 5 kg/s to 0.696 for 12 kg/s. This trend results from operating constraints that induce expensive operation patterns in periods of high district heating loads or shut-down periods for the combined heat and power plant. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the found optimum is indifferent to major variations in fossil fuel prices. The results question the efficiency of the suggested retrofitting scheme in the present energy system, and they further point toward the importance of taking operating conditions into consideration when developing flexible polygeneration plant concepts as differences between design-point operation and actual operation may have a significant impact on overall plant performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd .

AB  - In the United States, renewable energy mandates calling for increased production of cellulosic biofuels will require a diversity of bioenergy feedstocks to meet growing demands. Within the suite of potential energy crops, plants within the genus Agave promise to be a productive feedstock in hot and arid regions. The potential distributions of Agave tequilana and Agave deserti in the United States were evaluated based on plant growth parameters identified in an extensive literature review. A geospatial suitability model rooted in fuzzy logic was developed that utilized a suite of biophysical criteria to optimize ideal geographic locations for this new crop, and several suitability scenarios were tested for each species. The results of this spatially explicit suitability model suggest that there is potential for Agave to be grown as an energy feedstock in the southwestern region of the United States - particularly in Arizona, California, and Texas - and a significant portion of these areas are proximate to existing transportation infrastructure. Both Agave species showed the highest state-level renewable energy benefit in Arizona, where agave plants have the potential to contribute 4.8-9.6% of the states' ethanol consumption, and 2.5-4.9% of its electricity consumption, for A. deserti and A. tequilana, respectively. This analysis supports the feasibility of Agave as a complementary bioenergy feedstock that can be grown in areas too harsh for conventional energy feedstocks. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Given the growing global population, mankind must find new ways to lower competition for land between food and fuel production. Our findings for cassava suggest that this important crop can substantially increase the combined production of both food and fuel. Cassava stems have previously been overlooked in starch and energy production. These food-crop residues contain about 30% starch (dry mass) mostly in the xylem rather than phloem tissue. Up to 15% starch of the stem dry mass can be extracted using simple water-based techniques, potentially leading to an 87% increase in global cassava starch production. The integration of biofuel production, using residues and wastewater from starch extraction, may bring added value. The cassava roots on which biofuels and other products are based can be replaced by cassava stems without land use expansion, making root starch available as food for additional 30 million people today. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study estimated the potential emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from bioenergy ecosystems with a biogeochemical model AgTEM, assuming maize (Zea mays L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) will be grown on the current maize-producing areas in the conterminous United States. We found that the maize ecosystem acts as a mild net carbon source while cellulosic ecosystems (i.e., switchgrass and Miscanthus) act as mild sinks. Nitrogen fertilizer use is an important factor affecting biomass production and N2O emissions, especially in the maize ecosystem. To maintain high biomass productivity, the maize ecosystem emits much more GHG, including CO2 and N2O, than switchgrass and Miscanthus ecosystems, when high-rate nitrogen fertilizers are applied. For maize, the global warming potential (GWP) amounts to 1-2 Mg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1, with a dominant contribution of over 90% from N2O emissions. Cellulosic crops contribute to the GWP of less than 0.3 Mg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. Among all three bioenergy crops, Miscanthus is the most biofuel productive and the least GHG intensive at a given cropland. Regional model simulations suggested that substituting Miscanthus for maize to produce biofuel could potentially save land and reduce GHG emissions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - A field trial was carried out on a 15 year old Miscanthus stand, subject to nitrogen fertilizer treatments of 0, 63 and 125 kg-N ha-1, measuring N2O emissions, as well as annual crop yield over a full year. N2O emission intensity (N2O emissions calculated as a function of above-ground biomass) was significantly affected by fertilizer application, with values of 52.2 and 59.4 g N2O-N t-1 observed at 63 and 125 kg-N ha-1, respectively, compared to 31.3 g N2O-N t-1 in the zero fertilizer control. A life cycle analyses approach was applied to calculate the increase in yield required to offset N2O emissions from Miscanthus through fossil fuel substitution in the fuel chain. For the conditions observed during the field trial yield increases of 0.33 and 0.39 t ha-1 were found to be required to offset N2O emissions from the 63 kg-N ha-1 treatment, when replacing peat and coal, respectively, while increases of 0.71 and 0.83 t ha-1 were required for the 125 kg-N ha-1 treatment, for each fuel. These values are considerably less than the mean above-ground biomass yield increases observed here of 1.57 and 2.79 t ha-1 at fertilization rates 63 and 125 kg-N ha-1 respectively. Extending this analysis to include a range of fertilizer application rates and N2O emission factors found increases in yield necessary to offset soil N2O emissions ranging from 0.26 to 2.54 t ha-1. These relatively low yield increase requirements indicate that where nitrogen fertilizer application improves yield, the benefits of such a response will not be offset by soil N2O emissions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Cellulosic bioenergy production provides opportunities to utilize a range of cropping systems that can enhance the multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. In a 9-ha field experiment located on fertile land in Boone County, IA, USA, we directly compared a corn-soybean rotation harvested for grain, continuous corn harvested for grain and stover, continuous corn harvested for grain and stover with a rye cover crop, newly reconstructed prairie harvested for biomass and fertilized with nitrogen, and unfertilized newly reconstructed prairie harvested for biomass. Comparisons were made using four performance indicators: harvestable yield, net energy balance (NEB), root production, and nutrient balances. We found trade-offs among systems in terms of the measured performance indicators. Continuous corn systems were the highest yielding, averaging 13 Mg ha-1 of harvested biomass (grain plus stover), whereas fertilized and unfertilized prairies produced the least harvested biomass at 8.8 and 6.5 Mg ha-1, respectively. Mean NEBs were highest in continuous corn systems at 45.1 GJ ha-1, intermediate in the corn-soybean rotation at 28.6 GJ ha-1, and lowest in fertilized and unfertilized prairies at 11.4 and 10.5 GJ ha-1, respectively. Concomitant with the high yields of the continuous corn systems were the large nutrient requirements of these systems compared to the prairie systems. Continuous corn with rye required three times more nitrogen inputs than fertilized prairie. Root production, on the other hand, was on average seven times greater in the prairie systems than the annual crop systems. On highly fertile soils, corn-based cropping systems are likely to play an important role in maintaining the high productivity of agricultural landscapes, but alternative cropping systems, such as prairies used for bioenergy production, can produce substantial yield, require minimal externally derived inputs, and can be incorporated into the landscape at strategic locations to maximize the production of other ecosystem services. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable development of a bioenergy industry will require low-cost, high-yielding biomass feedstock of desirable quality. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is one of the primary feedstock candidates in North America, but the potential to grow this biomass crop using fertility from biosolids has not been fully explored. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of harvest frequency and biosolids application on switchgrass in Virginia, USA. 'Cave-in-Rock' switchgrass from well-established plots was cut once (November) or twice (July and November) per year between 2010 and 2012. Class A biosolids were applied once at rates of 0, 153, 306, and 459 kg N ha-1 in May 2010. Biomass yield, neutral and acid detergent fiber, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash were determined. Theoretical ethanol potential (TEP, l ethanol Mg-1 biomass) and yield (TEY, l ethanol ha-1) were calculated based on cellulose and hemicellulose concentrations. Cutting twice per season produced greater biomass yields than one cutting (11.7 vs. 9.8 Mg ha-1) in 2011, but no differences were observed in other years. Cutting once produced feedstock with greater TEP (478 vs. 438 l Mg-1), but no differences in TEY between cutting frequencies. Biosolids applied at 153, 306, and 459 kg N ha-1 increased biomass yields by 25%, 37%, and 46%, and TEY by 25%, 34%, and 42%, respectively. Biosolids had inconsistent effects on feedstock quality and TEP. A single, end-of-season harvest likely will be preferred based on apparent advantages in feedstock quality. Biosolids can serve as an effective alternative to N fertilizer in switchgrass-to-energy systems. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sweet corn is a widely distributed crop that generates agricultural waste without significant commercial value. In this study, we show that sweet corn varieties produce large amounts of residual biomass (10 t ha-1) with high content of soluble sugars (25% of dry matter) in a short growing season (3 months). The potential ethanol production from structural and soluble sugars extracted from sweet corn stover reached up to 4400 l ha-1 in the most productive hybrids, 33% of which (1500 l ha-1) were obtained by direct fermentation of free sugars. We found wide genetic variation for biomass yield and soluble sugars content suggesting that those traits can be included as complementary traits in sweet corn breeding programs. Dual-purpose sweet corn hybrids can have an added value for the farmers contributing to energy generation without affecting food supply or the environment. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The main goal of phytoremediation is to improve ecosystem functioning. Soil biochemical properties are considered as effective indicators of soil quality and are sensitive to various environmental stresses, including heavy metal contamination. The biochemical response in a soil contaminated with cadmium was tested after several treatments aimed to reduce heavy metal availability including liming, biochar addition and phytoextraction using Amaranthus tricolor L. Two biochars were added to the soil: eucalyptus pyrolysed at 600. °C (EB) and poultry litter at 400. °C (PLB). Two liming treatments were chosen with the aim of bringing soil pH to the same values as in the treatments EB and PLB. The properties studied included soil microbial biomass C, soil respiration and the activities of invertase, β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, urease and phosphomonoesterase. Both phytoremediation and biochar addition improved soil biochemical properties, although results were enzyme specific. For biochar addition these changes were partly, but not exclusively, mediated by alterations in soil pH. A careful choice of biochar must be undertaken to optimize the remediation process from the point of view of metal phytoextraction and soil biological activity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crop residue resources may affect soil quality, global carbon balance, and stability of crop production, but also contribute to future energy security. This study was performed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation in residue quantities of field crops in five provinces of North China (NC) and three provinces of Northeast China (NEC). The availability of biomass resources was derived from statistical data on crop yields for all crops on the provincial and even county level. We found that cereals - wheat, maize, and rice - were the biggest resource of crop residue feedstock. The ranking of these crops as a source of biomass for bioenergy is determined by the acreage in each region and the crop-specific yield. Annually, the average amount of total residue of 83.0 Mt (Mt = Mega tonnes) in NC (16.9 Million ha) comprised 76.6 Mt field residues and 6.4 Mt process residues on an air-dried basis. The average amount of total biomass residue of 105.7 Mt in NEC (19.8 Million ha) comprised 92.8 Mt field residues and 12.9 Mt process residues. Averaged for 2008, 2009, and 2010, the total standard coal equivalent (SCE) in NC amounted to 46.4 Mt, which comprised 42.4 Mt field residues and of 3.9 Mt process residues. In NEC, the SCE value of 57.0 Mt comprised 49.7 Mt field residues and 7.4 Mt process residues. The temporal availability of field residues was mainly concentrated in the period between July and September, followed by the period between October and December. In the period between July and September, the amount of field residue available amounted to 40.9 and 53.1 Mt in NC and NEC, respectively. An accurate assessment of field residues may guide policy makers and industry to optimize the utilization of the crop residue resource. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion can be employed to produce methane biogas from residual microalgae biomass derived from either a lipid based biofuel process or wastewater treatment. There is interest in using halophytic microalgae for biofuel production due to their potential robustness in large-scale open pond production. The anaerobic digestion of halophytic microalgae biomass would however be challenging due to the high salinities not typically experienced in anaerobic digestion scenarios. Halophytic microalgae biomass as a potential substrate feedstock for anaerobic digestion would have salinities in excess of 3.5%, which is typically found in marine environments. To investigate the anaerobic digestion of halophytic microalgae issue the first stage of the reported study focuses on the changes undertaken in the bacterial community associated with the anaerobic digestion of piggery effluent under increasing saline conditions, with the aim of establishing a saline tolerant anaerobic digestion inoculum capable of digesting feedstocks under high salinity conditions. Favourable results from this inoculum development study allowed the investigation of anaerobic digestion of halophytic microalgae. The reported results demonstrate that a saline tolerant inoculum was maintained. Subsequent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of the resulting halophytic bacterial community showed several halophytic methanogens. The inoculum was used to digest the halophytic microalgae. The resulting gas data showed that biogas production of 358. ±. 53. mL/g of volatile solids (VS) with a methane content of 54. ±. 4.3% methane was achieved at 7% salinity. The volume of biogas produced on a wet weight microalgae biomass basis was 122. ±. 26 and 175. ±. 25. mL/g of halophytic microalgae biomass respectively (74. ±. 2.8. wt.% moisture content). The conversion of carbon in the feedstock to methane achieved an efficiency of 26.4% and 46.6% at 3.4% and 7% salinity respectively. A halo-tolerant anaerobic digestion microbial community could be further optimized to complete the loop with nutrient recycle required with the production of halophytic microalgae based biofuels and potentially, hypersaline wastewater treatment applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of biofuels is strongly supported all over the world as a renewable energy source for reducing dependence on the unstable oil market. Bioethanol, the main biofuel produced in the world, is widely used to power vehicles in both the USA and Brazil, but concerns exist in both places regarding its sustainability. In Brazil, it is produced from a by-product of the sugar cane industry, while in the USA it is manufactured from food crops. The production of biogas and biodiesel is growing rapidly, but neither has outpaced the production of bioethanol. The European Union (EU) is greatly interested in this issue, and in 2011 adopted an extensive strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions related to transport by 60% by the year 2050. In order to achieve this result, the current European transportation system must be transformed. This ambitious goal will require the implementation of complex measures including the reduction of fossil fuels in favor of renewable fuels. This program has various options regarding the development of biofuels (e. g., biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel) and their related technologies, which are still on trial (mainly regarding the bioethanol production), and must also analyze their sustainability from a social and economic standpoint. The paper discusses the use of biofuels for transport in the European setting, and shows that their sustainability may result in relevant negative social effects due mainly to the use of land for energy crops (e.g., change of food price and world food shortage). © 2015, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

AB  - Nizimuddinia zanardini macroalgae, harvested from Persian Gulf, was chemically characterized and employed for the production of ethanol, seaweed extract, alginic acid, and biogas. In order to improve the products yields, the biomass was pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid and hot water. The pretreated and untreated biomasses were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by cellulase (15FPU/g) and β-glucosidase (30IU/g). Hydrolysis yield of glucan was 29.8, 82.5, and 72.7g/kg for the untreated, hot-water pretreated, and acid pretreated biomass, respectively. Anaerobic fermentation of hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the maximum ethanol yield of 34.6g/kg of the dried biomass. A seaweed extract containing mannitol and a solid residue containing alginic acid were recovered as the main byproducts of the ethanol production. On the other hand, the biogas yield from the biomass was increased from 170 to 200m3 per ton of dried algae biomass by hot water pretreatment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the last years the worldwide legal framework has stimulated the biofuel development, causing their production and use to be exhaustively studied. Biodiesel has been mostly produced in European countries, but the agronomic potential of the Latin-American countries has led the effort toward the biodiesel production, via regulations. This is the case of Colombia, where the oil palm has been exploited as the major biodiesel feedstock. The acts, laws and regulations indicate the mandatory expansion of biodiesel usage. Nonetheless, the laws do not explain the way in that those expansion targets will be done. In this work, the optimal conditions of the supply chain biodiesel were studied via the techno-economic and environmental analysis. Using logistic restrictions, environmental assessment and cost minimization (all of them were estimated in this work), the optimal expansion conditions were decided, taking into account the minimal emissions and the effect of the Land Use Change (LUC) for the oil palm crop expansion. The results showed that the Middle Region is the most promising zone for biodiesel expansion, as well as the Eastern Region is the most adequate zone for expansion crops since the LUC impact is lowest. Finally, the results indicated that the biodiesel based industry must be addressed toward other feedstocks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, a novel concurrent process of pretreatment and wet storage was developed and investigated by applying calcium peroxide for preservation and conversion of fresh water hyacinth biomass to fermentable sugars. The effects of CaO2 loading concentration and moisture content on the lignin reduction, carbohydrate preservation and enzymatic saccharification of water hyacinth biomass were evaluated by experimental design using a response surface methodology. The data showed that the concurrent process could conserve 70% carbohydrates and remove 40% lignin from biomass of water hyacinth at the best condition in this study. The enzymatic digestibility and reducing sugar yield from the best condition of concurrent process were around 93% and 325mg/g (dry weight) of fresh biomass, respectively. The result suggested that the concurrent process developed in this work could be a potential alternative to consolidate the pretreatment and storage of aquatic plant biomass for fermentable sugar production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A future hydrogen economy requires the sustainable production of renewable hydrogen. One method to produce hydrogen from stored renewable energy could be through reformation of bioethanol. However, chemically catalyzed reformation processes, although well studied, still present a number of significant technical challenges. Here, bioreformation of ethanol to hydrogen by photofermentation with the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris is described. Cultures were shown to tolerate up to 2% ethanol. An RSM (response surface methodology) was carried out in which three key factors, light intensity, and ethanol and glutamate concentrations were varied. The results showed that nearly 2mol of H2 could be obtained from one mole of ethanol, 33% of that theoretically possible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion process is often inhibited by alteration of substrates and/or organic overload. This study aimed to elucidate changes of microbial ecology in biogas reactors upon radical changes of substrates and to determine their importance to process imbalance. For this reason, continuously fed reactors were disturbed with pulses of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates and the microbial ecology of the reactors were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing before and after the imposed changes. The microbial composition of the three reactors, initially similar, diverged greatly after substrate change. The greatest increase in diversity was observed in the reactor supplemented with carbohydrates and the microbial community became dominated by lactobacilli, while the lowest corresponded to the reactor overfed with proteins, where only Desulfotomaculum showed significant increase. The overall results suggest that feed composition has a decisive impact on the microbial composition of the reactors, and thereby on their performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Denitrifying MFC was successfully coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation process in this study. With the help of cathode electrons, the stoichiometry relationship δ-NH3-N:δ-NO2--N:δ+NO3--N was approximate 1:1.37:0.03 during the stable operation, which demonstrated its further nitrite and nitrate reduction. According to microbial community analysis, Candidatus Brocadia sinica was the main anammox community, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris with electrochemical driven denitrifying ability, especially enriched in biofilm. Higher abundance of nirK genes in biofilm (compare to the control) and invariable amx genes in suspended sludge were responsible for its better nitrogen removal. The sludge and biofilm performed their own duties on anammox and denitrification, respectively, according to genes quantification. Under the totally autotrophic system, electron donors were "concentrated supplied" and easy to control, which avoided the suppression of anammox growth, making this autotrophic coupling process appears to be more promising. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Napier grass is potentially a viable feedstock for biofuel production. The present study investigated biological pretreatment of Napier grass by three microbial consortia followed by saccharification and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment efficiencies of three microbial consortia were compared in terms of degradation ability, saccharide and biogas yield. The lignocellulose loss rates of Napier grass varied largely. The biomass pretreated by the consortium WSD-5 gave 43.4% and 66.2% total sugar yield under low and moderate loadings of commercial enzyme mixtures, while the highest yield was 83.2% pretreated by the consortium MC1 under a high enzyme loading. The maximum methane yield of pretreated samples by the consortia MC1, WSD-5 and XDC-2 were 259, 279, 247. ml/g VS, respectively, which were 1.39, 1.49 and 1.32. times greater than the values of the untreated controls. This study showed that pretreatments by MC1, WSD-5 and XDC-2 were capable of significantly enhancing both the saccharide and methane yields from Napier grass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A design of experiments was adopted to assess the optimal conditions for methane production from the macroalgae Sargassum sp. co-digested with glycerol (Gly) and waste frying oil (WFO). Three variables were tested: % total solids of algae (%TSSargassum sp.), co-substrate concentration (gGly/WFOL-1), and co-substrate type (Gly or WFO). The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of Sargassum sp. was 181±1L CH4kg-1 COD. The co-digestion with Gly and WFO increased the BMP by 56% and 46%, respectively. The methane production rate (k), showed similar behaviour as the BMP, increasing 38% and 19% with Gly and WFO, respectively. The higher BMP (283±18L CH4kg-1 COD) and k (65.9±2.1L CH4kg-1 CODd-1) was obtained in the assay with 0.5% TS and 3.0gGlyL-1. Co-digestion with glycerol or WFO is a promising process to enhance the BMP from the macroalgae Sargassum sp. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Performances of mechanical and low-temperature (<100. °C) thermal pre-treatments were investigated to improve the present efficiency of anaerobic digestion (AD) carried out on waste activated sludge (WAS) in the largest Italian wastewater treatment plant (2,300,000. p.e.). Thermal pre-treatments returned disintegration rates of one order of magnitude higher than mechanical ones (about 25% vs. 1.5%). The methane specific production increased by 21% and 31%, with respect to untreated samples, for treatment conditions of respectively 70 and 90. °C, 3. h. Thermal pre-treatments also decreased WAS viscosity. Preliminary energy and economic assessments demonstrated that a WAS final total solid content of 5% was enough to avoid the employment of auxiliary methane for the pre-treatment at 90. °C and the subsequent AD process, provided that all the heat generated was transferred to WAS through heat exchangers. Moreover, the total revenues from sale of the electricity produced from biogas increased by 10% with respect to the present scenario. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an environmentally friendly and economically feasible remediation technology for mitigating soil contamination in agricultural lands. However, phytoremediation can be a slow process, and for highly contaminated soils this approach would require hundreds to thousands of years to meet soil environmental quality standards. Such a long period of phytoremediation is relatively unfeasible without economic revenue from crop production. This study involves growth of corn in plots of lead-contaminated agricultural land with Pb concentrations of about 6000. mg/kg. Our results showed that Bright Jean No. 7 corn was highly tolerant to lead, as evidenced by minimal effects on its growth and biomass production. Annually, each hectare of corn could produce up to 93.4 tons of dry matter and removed up to 7.2. kg of lead. The corn biomass grown on such contaminated fields could be used as a bioenergy fuel, and each hectare of corn biomass could produce 1545. GJ of thermal energy every year, which is equivalent to the heat from combustion of 57 tons of hard coal. The lead content in the corn kernel was less than the EU standard limit for animal consumption. Each hectare could produce approximately 25 tons of corn grains for animal feed per year, and the remaining parts of the plant could be used as the bioenergy fuel to generate heat energy equivalent to 40 tons of hard coal. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of barley straw with K2CO3 at different temperatures (280-400°C) was conducted and compared to optimize its process conditions; the aqueous phase as a co-product from this process was recycled to explore the feasibility of implementing wastewater reuse for bio-crude oil production. Results showed that low temperature favored the formation of bio-crude oil, with a maximum yield of 34.9wt% at 300°C. Contrarily, at high temperature, the bio-crude oil had better qualities in terms of less oxygen content and higher heating values (HHVs). The compounds identified in bio-crude oil were mainly phenolics, carboxylic acids, aldehydes and alcohols, among which the relative contents of phenolics and carboxylic acids decreased with increasing temperature. In the recirculation studies, bio-crude yield was enhanced gradually with aqueous phase addition at 300°C, and reached 38.4wt% after three cycles. The HHVs of bio-crude oil from HTL with aqueous phase were 28.4-29.4MJ/kg, slightly higher than those from HTL with fresh water. While no obvious differences in elemental distribution can be found after aqueous phase recirculation. In conclusion, this study gives a detailed insight into the HTL behavior of barley straw, and offers potential opportunities and benefits for bio-crude oil production through the reuse of aqueous phase. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study we show that a chemical ferricyanide cathode can be replaced by a biological oxygen reducing cathode in a plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) with a new record power output. A biocathode was successfully integrated in a PMFC and operated for 151days. Plants growth continued and the power density increased reaching a maximum power output of 679mW/m2 plant growth area (PGA) in a 10min polarization. The two week record average power densities was 240mW/m2 PGA. The new records were reached due to the high redox potential of oxygen reduction which was effectively catalyzed by microorganisms in the cathode. This resulted in a 127mV higher cathode potential of the PMFC with a biocathode than a PMFC with a ferricyanide cathode. We also found that substrate availability in the anode likely limits the current generation. This work is crucial for PMFC application as it shows that PMFC can be a completely sustainable biotechnology with an improved power output. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current global wave of land acquisition - variously debated as land grabbing or investment in land - is promoted by the World Bank and the FAO as creating win-win-situations for local populations and investors alike. Common policy recommendations suggest expanding the production of export crops, by making use of marginal or unused land. Considerable potentials for such an expansion are assumed. Taking Tanzania as a case study, the evidence for such types of land is assessed by using a broad range of statistics. We will argue firstly, that the terms marginal and unused land serve as a manipulative terminology for the benefit of attempts to commercially valorize and commodify African landscapes, from biofuel to large-scale food production and tourism. However, they relate to different rationalities of domination. Unused land refers to a state-bureaucratic narrative, which excludes user groups deemed irrelevant for national development, while marginal land refers to a capitalist-economic narrative that excludes what is not profitable. Secondly, the terms are analyzed as categories central for state simplification of social relations attached to land. Modelling of these land use categories based on remote sensing is an attempt to compensate weak state capacities to enhance the legibility of the landscape by constructing it as a landscape of commercial value. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol equivalent (EE) is defined as the mass of ethanol needed to deliver the equivalent amount ofenergy from a given feedstock using energy equivalency or produce the equivalent amount of mass of acarbon-based chemical using molar equivalency. The production of ethanol from biomass requires energy,which in a sustainable world could be produced from biomass. Therefore, we also define a real ethanolequivalent (EEx) indicating that the ethanol equivalent also includes the use of 1 unit of bioethanol toproduce x units of bioethanol. Thus, the abbreviation EE2.3used in this paper shows a 2.3 output/inputbioethanol ratio or efficiency. Calculations of the corresponding mass of corn and size of landwere basedon the first generation corn-based bioethanol technology as commercially practiced in the US in 2008.Since the total energy and essential materials requirements of a given process can be calculated, theEE2.3of a production process or even a total technology can be estimated. We show that the EE2.3couldbe used as a translational tool between fossil- and biomass-based feedstocks, products, processes, andtechnologies. Since the EE2.3can be readily determined for any given biomass-based technology, therequired mass of biomass feedstock, the size of land, and even the volume of water can be calculated.Scenario analyses based on EE2.3could better visualize the demands of competing technologies on theenvironment both for the experts and to the general public. While differentiating between 1, 1000, and100,000 BTUs for different options is rather difficult for most people, comparing the amount of the landneeded to produce the same amount of energy or mass via different technologies is more straightforward. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Switchgrass is being evaluated as a potential feedstock source for cellulosic biofuels and is being cultivated in several regions of the United States. The recent availability of switchgrass land cover maps derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service cropland data layer for the conterminous United States provides an opportunity to assess the environmental conditions of switchgrass over large areas and across different geographic locations. The main goal of this study is to develop a data-driven multiple regression switchgrass productivity model and identify the optimal climate and environment conditions for the highly productive switchgrass in the Great Plains (GP). Environmental and climate variables used in the study include elevation, soil organic carbon, available water capacity, climate, and seasonal weather. Satellite-derived growing season averaged Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) was used as a proxy for switchgrass productivity. Multiple regression analyses indicate that there are strong correlations between site environmental variables and switchgrass productivity (r = 0.95). Sufficient precipitation and suitable temperature during the growing season (i.e., not too hot or too cold) are favorable for switchgrass growth. Elevation and soil characteristics (e.g., soil available water capacity) are also an important factor impacting switchgrass productivity. An anticipated switchgrass biomass productivity map for the entire GP based on site environmental and climate conditions and switchgrass productivity model was generated. Highly productive switchgrass areas are mainly located in the eastern part of the GP. Results from this study can help land managers and biofuel plant investors better understand the general environmental and climate conditions influencing switchgrass growth and make optimal land use decisions regarding switchgrass development in the GP. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A biofuel process chain based on fast pyrolysis of hybrid poplar and subsequent hydroupgrading of the obtained bio-oil is simulated using Aspen Plus®. The simulation includes the pyrolysis plant and the biorefinery with its hydrotreating, hydrocracking, distillation and steam reforming sections. All parts of the process are modeled with a high level of detail, using 83 model compounds and a kinetic reaction model for the pyrolysis plant. A cross-check with published experimental data is included in order to validate the model. Based on the simulation results, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is conducted for the biofuel products, identifying the processes with the highest contribution to the environmental impacts. The obtained synthetic biofuels are compared with their fossil fuel equivalents in order to quantify their potential environmental benefits. LCA results show greenhouse gas (GHG) savings of 54.5% for the produced fuel mix compared to conventional gasoline and diesel. Electricity consumption is one of the keys for reducing the overall environmental impact, while GHG savings could be enhanced by improving the thermal efficiency of the combustion processes in the plants. The biofuel pathway assessed is found to be an interesting option to produce second-generation biofuels with optimization potential in all phases of the system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rapeseed is widely used to produce biodiesel, especially in Europe. In several studies, it has been shown that there is a good potential for growing this crop across the continent. However there is still little awareness that the energy efficiency of biofuel production from rapeseed is very low. Energy efficiency can be expressed in terms of Energy Return for Energy Invested (EROEI). We mapped EROEI values for all EU countries plus Switzerland based on expected yields derived from rapeseed suitability maps. We find that EU countries produce rapeseed biofuel with EROEI values of 2.2 and lower. We suggest that plans for biofuel cropping have to be supplemented by maps of EROEI. It is not only relevant to show where rapeseed can be grown, but we should also look at where its use for bioenergy can be efficient. In the area theoretically suitable for growing rainfed rapeseed (excluding unsuitable areas and water), 37.6% of the area can produce rape methyl ester (RME) biofuel only with an energy loss. We conclude that the energy efficiency of rapeseed biodiesel is low and spatially heterogeneous, and unless there are major technological improvements in the production process, replacing fossil fuels by biofuels from rapeseed is hardly a feasible option. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carbohydrate feedstocks are at the root of bioindustrial production and are needed in greater quantities than ever due to increased prioritization of renewable fuels with reduced carbon footprints. Cyanobacteria possess a number of features that make them well suited as an alternative feedstock crop in comparison to traditional terrestrial plant species. Recent advances in genetic engineering, as well as promising preliminary investigations of cyanobacteria in a number of distinct production regimes have illustrated the potential of these aquatic phototrophs as biosynthetic chassis. Further improvements in strain productivities and design, along with enhanced understanding of photosynthetic metabolism in cyanobacteria may pave the way to translate cyanobacterial theoretical potential into realized application. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - To better address the dynamic interactions between human and hydrologic systems, we develop an integrated modeling framework that employs a System of Systems optimization model to emulate human development decisions which are then incorporated into a watershed model to estimate the resulting hydrologic impacts. The two models are run interactively to simulate the coevolution of coupled human-nature systems, such that reciprocal feedbacks between hydrologic processes and human decisions (i.e.; human impacts on critical low flows and hydrologic impacts on human decisions on land and water use) can be assessed. The framework is applied to a Midwestern U.S. agricultural watershed, in the context of proposed biofuels development. This operation is illustrated by projecting three possible future coevolution trajectories, two of which use dedicated biofuel crops to reduce annual watershed nitrate export while meeting ethanol production targets. Imposition of a primary external driver (biofuel mandate) combined with different secondary drivers (water quality targets) results in highly nonlinear and multiscale responses of both the human and hydrologic systems, including multiple tradeoffs, impacting the future coevolution of the system in complex, heterogeneous ways. The strength of the hydrologic response is sensitive to the magnitude of the secondary driver; 45% nitrate reduction target leads to noticeable impacts at the outlet, while a 30% reduction leads to noticeable impacts that are mainly local. The local responses are conditioned by previous human-hydrologic modifications and their spatial relationship to the new biofuel development, highlighting the importance of past coevolutionary history in predicting future trajectories of change. © 2014.

AB  - Rapid growth of biofuel production in the United States and Brazil over the past decade has increased interest in replicating this success in other nations of the Pan American region. However, the continued use of food-based feedstock such as maize is widely seen as unsustainable and is in some cases linked to deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising further doubts about long-term sustainability. As a result, many nations are exploring the production and use of cellulosic feedstock, though progress has been extremely slow. In this paper, we will review the North–South axis of biofuel production in the Pan American region and its linkage with the agricultural sectors in five countries. Focus will be given to biofuel policy goals, their results to date, and consideration of sustainability criteria and certification of producers. Policy goals, results, and sustainability will be highlighted for the main biofuel policies that have been enacted at the national level. Geographic focus will be given to the two largest producers—the United States and Brazil; two smaller emerging producers—Argentina and Canada; and one stalled program—Mexico. However, several additional countries in the region are either producing or planning to produce biofuels. We will also review alternative international governance schemes for biofuel sustainability that have been recently developed, and whether the biofuel programs are being managed to achieve improved environmental quality and sustainable development. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A dominant discourse in contemporary rural debate relates to food. Deliberated in multiple and complex ways, the conversation vacillates between issues of food sustainability, security, type and provenance, to those of food scarcity, access and safety. Further compounding this complexity, food is equally central to discourses of energy, climate change, biofuels, production patterns, land use and a ‘21st-century land rush’. The use and management of rural resources consequently finds itself near the top of current political, social, economic and environmental agendas. However, while there have been limited contributions by rural geographers on food-related issues, there is no doubting that the oft-declared challenge of providing safe and secure food supplies, and feeding a growing world population, has witnessed increased vigour of engagement. This report explores this engagement, deliberating on the promotion of a ‘new productivism’, the endorsement of the role of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) in securing food supplies, the escalation of global land grabs, and the subsequent impacts on sustainable rural futures. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Aims: Diverse perennial grasslands represent an attractive goal for biofuel production, but are difficult to establish on formerly cultivated land. Nurse species have been used to aid in establishment, but the mechanisms by which facilitation occurs remain poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that nurse plants accumulate beneficial, pathogen-suppressive bacterial communities.
Methods: Fourteen native, invasive, and crop plant treatments were planted in a field previously in a corn-soybean (Zea mays – Glycine max) rotation. Soil microbial community characteristics were measured, specifically the density of Streptomyces soil bacteria, and the density and proportion of pathogen-inhibitory Streptomyces isolates, due to the demonstrated role of this bacterial genus in soil-borne disease suppression.
Results: After one growing season, no significant differences were observed among plant treatments in Streptomyces density, the density or proportion of inhibitory isolates, or the intensity of inhibition observed against two common soil-borne pathogens. Streptomyces density and soil organic matter were significantly correlated among plots, though in differing directions in legumes and forbs.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that one growing season is insufficient for perennial plants to condition soil for increased pathogen-suppression in a nutrient-rich agricultural soil. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Discovery of microorganisms producing enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze cellulosic biomass is of great importance for biofuel production. To date, however, only a miniscule fraction of natural biodiversity has been tested because of the relatively low throughput of screening systems and their limitation to screening only culturable microorganisms. Here, we describe an ultra-high-throughput droplet-based microfluidic system that allowed the screening of over 100,000 cells in less than 20 min. Uncultured bacteria from a wheat stubble field were screened directly by compartmentalization of single bacteria in 20 pl droplets containing a fluorogenic cellobiohydrolase substrate. Sorting of droplets based on cellobiohydrolase activity resulted in a bacterial population with 17- and 7-fold higher cellobiohydrolase and endogluconase activity, respectively, and very different taxonomic diversity than when selected for growth on medium containing starch and carboxymethylcellulose as carbon source. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy crises and environmental pollution have caused considerable concerns; duckweed is considered to be a promising new energy plant that may relieve such problems. Lemna aequinoctialis strain 6000, which has a fast growth rate and the ability to accumulate high levels of starch was grown in both Schenk &amp; Hildebrandt medium (SH) and in sewage water (SW). The maximum growth rates reached 10.0 g DW m-2 day-1 and 4.3 g DW m-2 day-1, respectively, for the SH and SW cultures, while the starch content reached 39% (w/w) and 34% (w/w). The nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate reached 80% (SH) and 90% (SW) during cultivation, and heavy metal ions assimilation was observed. About 95% (w/w) of glucose was released from duckweed biomass hydrolysates, and then fermented by Angel yeast with ethanol yield of 0.19 g g-1 (SH) and 0.17 g g-1 (SW). The amylose/ amylopectin ratios of the cultures changed as starch content increased, from 0.252 to 0.155 (SH) and from 0.252 to 0.174 (SW). Lemna aequinoctialis strain 6000 could be considered as valuable feedstock for bioethanol production and water resources purification. © 2014 Yu et al.

AB  - Lignin is an abundant and essential polymer in land plants. It is a prime factor in the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass to agricultural and industrial end-uses such as forage, pulp and papermaking, and biofuels. To better understand lignifi cation at the molecular level, we are developing a lignin spectroscopic and imaging toolbox on one "negligible" auxiliary. Toward that end, we describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of a new designer monolignol, 3-O-propargylcaffeyl alcohol, which contains a bioorthogonal alkynyl functional group at the 3-O-position. Importantly, our data indicate that this monolignol does not alter the fidelity of lignification. We demonstrate that the designer monolignol provides a platform for multiple spectroscopic and imaging approaches to reveal temporal and spatial details of lignification, the knowledge of which is critical to reap the potential of energyrich renewable plant biomass for sustainable liquid fuels and other diverse economic applications.

AB  - The objective of this research is to develop an economic analysis of different crop mix biofuels programs for meeting ethanol and sustainability demands. Primary data are from South Dakota State University field experiments on farms located in east-central South Dakota. The data include 4 years of field data, three crop systems (mixed grass, switchgrass and corn), two residue treatments (no removal, removal of biomass), and three landscape positions (back slope, crest and foot slope). A representative farm model and five scenarios are developed to conduct a full budget analysis over a 12-year period. Public benefits are evaluated, using the benefit transfer method to value ecosystem services, by allocating a dollar value to three environmental variables; carbon sequestration, reduction of sedimentation and pheasant production. Stochastic simulation results are compared for each of the five scenarios, one with only annualized net private returns, and one including the value of environmental benefits. Results indicate that: (1) the conventional continuous corn scenario has the highest net returns over the 12-year budget, (2) carbon sequestration represents 80% of the environmental benefits, and (3) the added economic value of ecosystem services does not provide enough incentives for farmers to convert from corn production to grass production.

AB  - This study evaluated the life cycle GHG emissions of a renewable jet fuel produced from sugar cane in Brazil under a consequential approach. The analysis included the direct and indirect emissions associated with sugar cane production and fuel processing, distribution, and use for a projected 2020 scenario. The CA-GREET model was used as the basic analytical tool, while Land Use Change (LUC) emissions were estimated employing the GTAP-BIO-ADV and AEZ-EF models. Feedstock production and LUC impacts were evaluated as the main sources of emissions, respectively estimated as 14.6 and 12 g CO2eq/MJ of biofuel in the base case. However, the renewable jet fuel would strongly benefit from bagasse and trash-based cogeneration, which would enable a net life cycle emission of 8.5 g CO2eq/MJ of biofuel in the base case, whereas Monte Carlo results indicate 21 ± 11 g CO2eq/MJ. Besides the major influence of the electricity surplus, the sensitivity analysis showed that the cropland-pasture yield elasticity and the choice of the land use factor employed to sugar cane are relevant parameters for the biofuel life cycle performance. Uncertainties about these estimations exist, especially because the study relies on projected performances, and further studies about LUC are also needed to improve the knowledge about their contribution to the renewable jet fuel life cycle. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuels are proposed to play an important role in several mitigation strategies to meet future CO2 emission targets for the transport sector but remain controversial due to significant uncertainties in net impacts on environment, society, and climate. A switch to biofuels can also affect short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), which provide significant contributions to the net climate impact of transportation. We quantify the radiative forcing (RF) and global-mean temperature response over time to EU on-road fossil diesel SLCFs and the impact of 20% (B20) and 100% (B100) replacement of fossil diesel by biodiesel. SLCFs are compared to impacts of on-road CO2 using different approaches from existing literature to account for biodiesel CO2. Given the best estimates for changes in emissions when replacing fossil diesel with biodiesel, the net positive RF from EU on-road fossil diesel SLCFs of 3.4 mW/m2 is reduced by 15% and 80% in B20 and B100, respectively. Over time the warming of SLCFs is likely small compared to biodiesel CO2 impacts. However, SLCFs may be relatively more important for the total warming than in the fossil fuel case if biodiesel from feedstock with very short rotation periods and low land-use-change impacts replaces a high fraction of fossil diesel. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The extensive use of fossil fuels is increasingly recognized as unsustainable as a consequence of depletion of supplies and the contribution of these fuels to climate change by GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions into the atmosphere. Microalgae indicate alternative renewable sustainable energy sources as they have a high potential for producing large amounts of biomass which in turn can be used for production of different third-generation biofuels at large scale. Microalgae transform the solar energy into the carbon storage products, leads to lipid accumulation, including TAG (triacylglycerols), which then can be transformed into biodiesel, bioethanol and biomethanol. This paper reviews the selection, production and accumulation of target bioenergy carrier's strains and their advantages as well as the technological development for oil, biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, biogas production and GHG mitigation. The feedstock of promising algal strain exhibits the suitable biofuel production. The current progress of hybrid-technologies (biomass production, wastewater treatment, GHG mitigation) for production of prime-products as biofuels offer atmospheric pollution control such as the reduction of GHG (CO2 fixation) coupling wastewater treatment with microalgae growth. The selection of efficient strain, microbial metabolism, cultivation systems, biomass production are key parameters of viable technology for microalgae-based biodiesel-production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Large private sector investments in low- and middle-income countries are often critically evaluated with regards to their environmental, social, human rights, and health impacts. A health impact assessment, including a baseline health survey, was commissioned by the Addax Bioenergy Sierra Leone project in 2010. As part of the monitoring, a follow-up survey was conducted three years later. A set of health indicators was assessed at six impacted and two control sites. Most of these indices improved, particularly at the impacted sites. The prevalences of stunting, wasting, and Plasmodium falciparum in children under five years of age decreased significantly at impacted sites (all p < 0.05) and non-significantly at control sites. Anemia in children and in women of reproductive age (15–49 years) decreased significantly at impacted and control sites (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). Health facility-based deliveries increased significantly at the impacted sites (p < 0.05). The prevalences of helminth infections in children aged 10–15 years remained approximately at the same levels, although focal increases at the impacted sites were noted. Access to improved sanitation decreased significantly (p < 0.05) at control and non-significantly at impacted sites. Water quality remained poor without significant changes. The epidemiologic monitoring of a bioenergy project provides a useful contribution for evidence-based decision-making. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME), a pollutant produced by the palm oil industry, was treated by the Vetiver system technology (VST). This technology was applied for the first time to treat POME in order to decrease biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). In this study, two different concentrations of POME (low and high) were treated with Vetiver plants for 2 weeks. The results showed that Vetiver was able to reduce the BOD up to 90% in low concentration POME and 60% in high concentration POME, while control sets (without plant) only was able to reduce 15% of BOD. The COD reduction was 94% in low concentration POME and 39% in high concentration POME, while control just shows reduction of 12%. Morphologically, maximum root and shoot lengths were 70 cm, the number of tillers and leaves was 344 and 86, and biomass production was 4.1 kg m-2. These results showed that VST was effective in reducing BOD and COD in POME. The treatment in low concentration was superior to the high concentration. Furthermore, biomass of plant can be considered as a promising raw material for biofuel production while high amount of biomass was generated in low concentration of POME. © 2014 Negisa Darajeh et al.

AB  - 'Giant' tridacnid clams have evolved a three-dimensional, spatially efficient, photodamage-preventing system for photosymbiosis. We discovered that the mantle tissue of giant clams, which harbours symbiotic nutrition-providing microalgae, contains a layer of iridescent cells called iridocytes that serve to distribute photosynthetically productive wavelengths by lateral and forward-scattering of light into the tissue while back-reflecting non-productive wavelengths with a Bragg mirror. The wavelength- and angle-dependent scattering from the iridocytes is geometrically coupled to the vertically pillared microalgae, resulting in an even re-distribution of the incoming light along the sides of the pillars, thus enabling photosynthesis deep in the tissue. There is a physical analogy between the evolved function of the clam system and an electric transformer, which changes energy flux per area in a system while conserving total energy. At incident light levels found on shallow coral reefs, this arrangement may allow algae within the clam system to both efficiently use all incident solar energy and avoid the photodamage and efficiency losses due to non-photochemical quenching that occur in the reef-building coral photosymbiosis. Both intra-tissue radiometry andmultiscale optical modelling support our interpretation of the system's photophysics. This highly evolved 'three-dimensional' biophotonic system suggests a strategy for more efficient, damage-resistant photovoltaic materials and more spatially efficient solar production of algal biofuels, foods and chemicals. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - In the early 2000s high expectations existed regarding the potential contribution of biofuels to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and substitution of fossil fuels in transport. In recent years sobering judgments prevailed. The major barriers for a further expansion of biofuels are their high costs (compared to fossil fuels), moderate ecological performances, limited feedstocks for biofuel production and their competition with food production.The objective of this paper is to investigate the market prospects of biofuels up to the year 2030. It focuses on the three currently most important regions for biofuels production and use: the US, EU and Brazil which in 2010 accounted together for almost three-quarters of global biofuel supply.Our method of approach is based on a dynamic economic framework considering the major cost components of biofuels and corresponding technological learning with respect to capital costs. Moreover, for the analysis of the competitiveness of biofuels with fossil fuels also taxes are considered.The most important result is that under existing tax policies biofuels are cost-effective today and also for the next decades in the regions investigated. However, their potentials are restricted especially due to limited crops areas, and their environmental performance is currently rather modest.The major final conclusions are: (i) To reveal the real future market value of biofuels, a CO2 based tax system should be implemented for all types of fuels providing a neutral environmental incentive for competition between all types of fossil and renewable fuels; (ii) Moreover, the research and development for all types of biofuels, but especially for second generation biofuels, has to be intensified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Net Present Value (NPV) and total production cost calculations are made for first and second generation biofuels in 74 settings, covering 5 fuel output types, 8 feedstock types, 12 countries and 8 combinations of agricultural management systems between 2010 and 2030. Yields are assumed to increase due to better crop management and improved varieties. High NPVs (meaning profitable production) are calculated for cassava (up to 16,000. $/ha) and palm production (up to almost 7000. $/ha). But cassava can also have a negative NPV which indicates that the project investment is not without risk. The calculated NPVs for jatropha range from -900 to 2000. $/ha, while for sugarcane and soy the NPV is always positive, (2500-5000. $/ha and 200-3000. $/ha respectively) and therefore profitable. Total production costs in 2010 are estimated to vary from 5 to 45. $/GJ for 1st generation feedstocks in 2010, and from around 10-35. $/GJ in 2020, compared to 20-30. $/GJ for fossil fuels. Argentina and Malaysia are the regions with the lowest production costs for biofuel (soy and palm biodiesel for 11-15. $/GJ and 8-23. $/GJ respectively), although potential for cost reduction exists in other regions. Production costs of 2nd generation biofuels are estimated to be 17-26. $/GJ in 2020 and 14-23. $/GJ in 2030. Poplar based synfuel production in Ukraine has the lowest costs (14-17. $/GJ) and rice straw based bioethanol the highest (23-26. $/GJ) - for both the short and long term. The time between investment and benefits, as well as the size of investment and the alternative commodity markets, varies with the type of feedstock. The choice of feedstock therefore depends on the local agricultural system, and the preferences and means of the local farmers. Key to the competitive production of 2nd generation fuels is the optimisation of the conversion process, which dominates overall production costs (with 35-65% of total costs). Also important is the efficient organisation of supply chain logistics, especially for the low energy density feedstocks such as wheat straw - requires densification early in the chain. Key factors in the economic analysis are: labour costs and requirements, agricultural efficiency, conversion cost and biomass yields. Acquiring accurate location specific data is essential for detailed analyses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pressure on land resources is expected to increase as global population continues to climb and the world becomes more affluent, swelling the demand for food. Changing climate may exert additional pressures on natural lands as present-day productive regions may shift, or soil quality may degrade, and the recent rise in demand for biofuels increases competition with edible crops for arable land. Given these projected trends there is a need to understand the global climate impacts of land use and land cover change (LULCC). Here we quantify the climate impacts of global LULCC in terms of modifications to the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere (radiative forcing, RF) that are caused by changes in long-lived and short-lived greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol effects, and land surface albedo. We attribute historical changes in terrestrial carbon storage, global fire emissions, secondary organic aerosol emissions, and surface albedo to LULCC using simulations with the Community Land Model version 3.5. These LULCC emissions are combined with estimates of agricultural emissions of important trace gases and mineral dust in two sets of Community Atmosphere Model simulations to calculate the RF of changes in atmospheric chemistry and aerosol concentrations attributed to LULCC. With all forcing agents considered together, we show that 40% (16 %) of the present-day anthropogenic RF can be attributed to LULCC. Changes in the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and aerosols from LULCC enhance the total LULCC RF by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to the LULCC RF from CO2 alone. This enhancement factor also applies to projected LULCC RF, which we compute for four future scenarios associated with the Representative Concentration Pathways. We attribute total RFs between 0.9 and 1.9Wm-2 to LULCC for the year 2100 (relative to a preindustrial state). To place an upper bound on the potential of LULCC to alter the global radiation budget, we include a fifth scenario in which all arable land is cultivated by 2100. This theoretical extreme case leads to a LULCC RF of 3.9Wm-2 (0.9Wm-2), suggesting that not only energy policy but also land policy is necessary to minimize future increases in RF and associated climate changes.

AB  - The plantations of oil-bearing trees and conversion of their vegetable oils to biodiesel have positive impacts on the agricultural, rural and national economies as well as being a partial solution to the energy scarcity. In India, many oil-bearing tree plantations including jatropha, karanja, palm and polong have already been established, mostly at a small farm’ levels with direct and indirect assistance from the private and government sectors. In this study, the private financial sustainability of karanja, palm and soapnut plantations has been studied through private discounted cash flow analysis and an attempt has been made to evaluate the production cost of these pure plant oils (PPOs) and biodiesels from an Indian prospective. The net present value from karanja, palm and soapnut plantations is estimated at INR 226000/ha, INR 261000/ha and INR 173000/ha respectively, for a plantation project life of 15 years under average yield conditions. The estimated payback period on the investment is 6 years for karanja plantation and 7 years for palm and soapnut plantations. The production costs of PPO and biodiesels for karanja, palm and soapnut are estimated to be INR 47.33/kg and INR 51.44/kg, INR 42.80/kg and INR 46.67/kg, and INR 45.66/kg and INR 49.68/kg, respectively. The estimated production costs of these PPO crops indicate that they can compete financially with petrodiesel to meet the mandatory blending requirement in transportation sector of India. © 2014, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - Background: Novozym 435, a commercial lipase from Candida antarctica, recombinant, expressed in Aspergillus niger, immobilized on macroporous acrylic resin, has been already described in the obtention of biodiesel. It is here evaluated in the production of a new biofuel that integrates the glycerol as monoglyceride (MG) together with two fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) molecules by the application of 1,3-selective lipases in the ethanolysis reaction of sunflower oil. Results: Response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to estimate the effects of main reaction. Optimum conditions for the viscosity, selectivity, and conversion were determined using a multifactorial design of experiments with three factors run by the software Stat Graphics version XV.I. The selected experimental parameters were reaction temperature, oil/ethanol ratio and alkaline environment. On the basis of RSM analysis, the optimum conditions for synthesis were 1/6 oil/EtOH molar ratio, 30°C, and 12.5 μl of NaOH 10 N aqueous solutions, higher stirring than 300 rpm, for 2 h and 0.5 g of biocatalyst. Conclusions: These obtained results have proven a very good efficiency of the biocatalyst in the studied selective process. Furthermore, it was allowed sixteen times the successive reuse of the biocatalyst with good performance. © 2014 Luna et al.

AB  - To fulfill the national bioenergy goals of the United States, conversion of marginal lands to intensive biomass crop production and/or application of greater amounts of nutrients to existing cropland could be expected. Such change in agricultural practices could produce unintended environmental consequences such as water quality degradation. Select Best Management Practices (BMPs) are evaluated for water quality mitigation effectiveness as well as for their relative cost-effectiveness, issues that are often ignored in evaluation of biofuels as a sustainable solution for energy demand. The water quality impacts of converting pastureland to intensive biomass production for biofuel, evaluated using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), indicate significant increases in erosion and nutrient loadings to water bodies. Hydrologic and economic evaluation of the BMPs indicate their implementation produced effective water pollution mitigation but at substantial costs, accentuating the sustainability issue related to the economics of renewable fuels. U.S. national energy policy designed around achieving energy independence should also consider environmental and economic trade-offs for biofuels to be an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase (LPAT) is one of the major triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes, controlling the metabolic flow of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. Experimental studies in Arabidopsis have shown that LPAT activity is exhibited primarily by three distinct isoforms, namely the plastid-located LPAT1, the endoplasmic reticulum-located LPAT2, and the soluble isoform of LPAT (solLPAT). In this study, 24 putative genes representing all LPAT isoforms were identified from the analysis of 11 complete genomes including green algae, red algae, diatoms and higher plants. We observed LPAT1 and solLPAT genes to be ubiquitously present in nearly all genomes examined, whereas LPAT2 genes to have evolved more recently in the plant lineage. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that LPAT1, LPAT2 and solLPAT have convergently evolved through separate evolutionary paths and belong to three different gene families, which was further evidenced by their wide divergence at gene structure and sequence level. The genome distribution supports the hypothesis that each gene encoding a LPAT is not duplicated. Mapping of exon–intron structure of LPAT genes to the domain structure of proteins across different algal and plant species indicates that exon shuffling plays no role in the evolution of LPAT genes. Besides the previously defined motifs, several conserved consensus sequences were discovered which could be useful to distinguish different LPAT isoforms. Taken together, this study will enable the generation of experimental approximations to better understand the functional role of algal LPAT in lipid accumulation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - To improve ethanol production directly from CO2 in photosynthetic cyanobacterial systems, one key issue that needs to be addressed is the low ethanol tolerance of cyanobacterial cells. Our previous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses found that several regulatory proteins were up-regulated by exogenous ethanol in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In this study, through tolerance analysis of the gene disruption mutants of the up-regulated regulatory genes, we uncovered that one transcriptional regulator, Sll0794, was related directly to ethanol tolerance in Synechocystis . Using a quantitative iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomics approach coupled with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RTqPCR), we further determined the possible regulatory network of Sll0794. The proteomic analysis showed that in the Δsll0794 mutant grown under ethanol stress a total of 54 and 87 unique proteins were down- and upregulated, respectively. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the Sll0794 transcriptional regulator was able to bind directly to the upstream regions of sll1514, slr1512, and slr1838, which encode a 16.6 kDa small heat shock protein, a putative sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporter and a carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism protein CcmK, respectively. The study provided a proteomic description of the putative ethanol-tolerance network regulated by the sll0794 gene, and revealed new insights on the ethanol-tolerance regulatory mechanism in Synechocystis. As the first regulatory protein discovered related to ethanol tolerance, the gene may serve as a valuable target for transcription machinery engineering to further improve ethanol tolerance in Synechocystis.

AB  - Geographic research on the Corn Belt and other regional landscapes of the central U.S. has not to date identified quantitatively the climatic, edaphic, topographic, and economic characteristics that determine rural land cover, and that therefore govern land cover change. Using the USDA/NASS Cropland Data Layer, this study identifies these characteristics by employing Multivariable Fractional Polynomials within a logistic regression framework. It maps the suitability distribution for corn, soybeans, spring and winter wheat, cotton, grassland, and forest, which collectively dominate the central U.S., at a 56m resolution across 16 central U.S. states. The non-linear logistic regression models are successful in identifying determinants of land cover with relative operating characteristic (ROC) scores that range from 0.769 for soybeans to 0.888 for forest, with a combined corn/soybean model achieving an ROC of 0.871. For corn and soybean models, when prior land cover of a pixel is added, predictability and ROC scores increase substantially (0.07-0.10), indicating a strong temporal dependency in land cover dynamics due to crop rotation. This process also aids in the delineation of fields from pixels. When neighboring land covers are added to the models, ROC scores improve only slightly (0.014-0.019), however, indicating a weak spatial dependency or contagious diffusion mechanism. By including annual crop prices within the logit models, economically marginal cropland that comes into crop production only when prices are high is identified in a spatially-explicit manner. This capacity informs analyses of policies that affect crop prices (e.g., subsidies for crops or biofuels, changes in global supply and demand), by identifying the consequent changes in land use patterns - changes that modify the economic and environmental performance of the landscape. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work-in view of still decreasing crude oil resources and increasing fuel prices-are presented issues concerning research on development of other, alternative fuel sources including those used in water, land and air transport means. One of them is hydrogen which, while burning, does not produce noxious carbon dioxide but only side effects such as heat and clean water. It is almost true that along with sudden drop of availability and rising price of crude oil many countries face economical paralysis. Any of alternative sources is not capable of supplying even only a basic amount of such energy, not mentioning the whole amount of energy demanded by our civilization. Hydrogen as an independent fuel for internal combustion engines has yet to go a long way to commercialization. to be Co-burning systems (combustion of mixtures)of today used hydrocarbon fuels combined with hydrogen seem closer to this aim. As proved in many investigations the substitution of a part of hydrocarbon fuel by hydrogen enables to make use of beneficial features of both the fuels. One of possible solutions of the problem may be application of an innovative hydrogenic fuel electrolyzer which is presented and evaluated in this paper. © 2015 Bogdan Żółtowski and Mariusz Żółtowski.

AB  - Because plants convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in organisms, biomass production as an energy source can help to reduce the world’s reliance on fossil energy and mitigate global warming. Biofuel production is a fast-growing industry that represents a new type of large-scale human disturbance on ecosystems. Thus, the benefits of biofuel production bring environmental risks that include its potential impact on biodiversity, which is still an open question. In this review, we start first with a brief overview of the evolution of biofuel concept; second, we review the state of biofuel production across the continents, with a major emphasis on the main species used and their major feedstock. For which, we found significant differences for land use and environmental cultural management of biofuel plantation between tropical and temperate regions. Third, we summarize the impacts of biofuel plantation on biodiversity at multiple scales, based on the case studied with respect to the corresponding issues. At the genetic level, introgression and contamination by aggressive genotypes are a primary risk. At the species level, habitat pollution, degradation, and disturbance caused by intensive management of biofuel plantation significantly raise the risk of habitat fragmentation, native extinction, and bio-invasion. At the ecosystem level, the large-scale homogeneous landscape of biofuel plantation results in simplified community and food web that severely damage ecosystem services, including ecosystem diversity. Finally, we compare the current and potential benefits and risks of biofuel plantations for the practical application of a biofuel industry of China. We emphasize the land use constraint from food security and biodiversity conservation, and the need for scientific research and systematic monitoring as a critical support for the sustainable development of biofuel production in China. © 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Community views toward the risks and benefits of emerging renewable energy technologies are important factors in facility siting decisions and their eventual success. While the actual socioeconomic and biophysical impacts of proposed industrial developments are fraught with uncertainty, understanding public perceptions is critical in managing costs and benefits to local citizens. Here, we explore the social acceptability of forest-based biorefineries in Maine using random utility modeling to identify how project attributes and citizen characteristics interact to affect level of support. Using a statewide sample (Statewide) and a subsample of mill towns (Mill Towns), we found that: (1) in both samples, individual characteristics had similar coefficients and significance levels except for pro-environment attitudes; (2) the coefficients related to the industry's negative attributes were notably different between the two samples, while positive attributes were not; (3) in both samples, positive industry attributes such as "producing products from a sustainable resource" and "increased economic development" were the most influential variables in determining the level of support for a new biorefinery in an individual's community; and (4) in general, Mill Town respondents were more accepting of potential negative attributes such as increased levels of truck traffic, odor, noise, and air and water pollution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comprehensive review of the U.S. federal biofuel-related policies, from 1955 to 2012, was conducted to examine the progression of life cycle thinking within the policies. Over 1300 past and present federal and state biofuel laws and incentives were analyzed to identify the establishment of Life-cycle thinking (LCT) in the biofuel policies. The policies were searched for search terms representing the three themes: life cycle assessment, environmental impact and sustainability. LCT in policies was first seen in the Renewable Fuel Standard under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, where life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of biofuels was required. Existing U.S. biofuel policies were also characterized to define types of policy as tax incentive, grants, mandate, etc. The results suggested that climate change or energy incentives, air quality or emissions, etc. should be more emphasized in fuel legislation for a continuous improvement of biofuels industry. Only 13% of both the federal and state policies reviewed in this study employed some aspect of LCT. Policies that incorporate LCT often only focused on greenhouse gas emissions; policies should include other environmental impacts to avoid any environmental tradeoffs and unintended consequences from biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reviews the situation of biofuels production with regard to climate change and sustainability. The biomass energy or biofuels combustion is carbon neutral or even carbon negative as the carbon, which is stored during its growth, is released and does not add new carbon to the active carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas remove carbon from geologic storage and contribute to climate change by emission of GHGs. Biofuel also controls the carbon emissions from biomass facilities which would have been released back into the atmosphere through natural decay or disposal through open-burning. Inspite of these GHG benefits, the progress in biofuels expansion is at crossroads as it is influenced by various factors like land use changes and food security related issues. However biofuels from degraded land and from non-food crops are promising and will help in climate change mitigation. Proper planning in land use and identifying most appropriate policies for promoting this will help in tackling the global issue and in achieving the goal. The technology utilizing carbon sequestered in various sources, for ethanol, biodiesel and other biofuels production is a sustainable solution to climate change rather than biofuels from food crops.

AB  - To provide the renewable energy industry in New Jersey with current and comprehensive information on biomass feedstocks, conversion technology yields and efficiencies, and bioenergy generation estimates, the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University performed an assessment of biomass energy potential for the state in 2007. In 2014, an update and expansion of the 2007 Assessment of Bioenergy Potential in New Jersey was conducted. The study includes a detailed database of New Jersey's sustainable biomass and energy potential, containing data on more than 40 feedstocks and 7 bioenergy generation technologies. It also includes a unique bioenergy calculator for estimating potential biopower or biofuel yields by technology, feedstock, and county; a comprehensive evaluation of the bioenergy potential in the state; and greenhouse gas reduction scenarios. The research indicates that New Jersey produces approximately 7.4 million dry tons (MDT) of biomass annually, of which an estimated 4.32 MDT (∼58%) are practically recoverable and could ultimately be available to produce energy in the form of power or transportation fuels. This biomass could deliver up to 5.2 million megawatt hours of power (∼7% of NJ's annual electricity consumption) or 250 million gallons of gasoline equivalent (∼4.4% of NJ's annual transportation fuel consumption) if the appropriate technologies and infrastructure were in place. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

AB  - This study contributes to global debates on biofuels and rural development, providing insights into the role of Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) in addressing global poverty and promoting sustainable energy. Jatropha energy crop investments have proliferated as a means to substitute imported oil, foster rural development and reduce poverty. This paper presents new mixed-method assessments of the potential for, and initial impacts of, Jatropha projects that aim to improve livelihoods and energy security in rural Mali, a leading proponent of Jatropha cultivation. Factors affecting the socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers are assessed and capital assets available for different livelihood strategies are identified and evaluated. Comparative analysis of information gathered through participatory methods allows evaluation of the role played by Jatropha cultivation in the determination of different livelihood outcomes. Data show that households involved with NGO or private sector activities linked to Jatropha can gain financial capital from the sale of Jatropha seeds and soap. Findings also show that small-scale cultivation does not threaten food security. When grown on a small scale as a living fence, Jatropha demarcates property, and reduces land tenure conflicts and soil erosion. Projects focusing on Jatropha use for rural electrification offer potential to improve energy access. However, current supplies of Jatropha oil remain insufficient for these benefits to materialise. On-the-ground challenges were identified, along with opportunities to better link policies to local-level practices. © 2013 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).

AB  - This paper compares supply and demand constraints on the ramp-up of biofuels in the United States. Three recent supply-side developments are assessed: (1) build-out of commercial-scale cellulosic biorefineries, (2) incremental improvements to existing ethanol and biodiesel biorefineries, and (3) use of waste oils for renewable diesel and biodiesel. From a technical perspective, we estimate these developments could increase domestic biofuels production by up to 4.3, 2.3, and 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline equivalent (BGGE) by 2030, respectively. This corresponds to 3.7% of final energy in the U.S. transportation sector in 2013. On the demand side, the main technical constraints to biofuel growth involve the blend rate of ethanol with gasoline. Rapid removal of E85 and E15 vehicle and infrastructure barriers could generate room for an additional 13.0BGGE of ethanol and 2.7BGGE of biodiesel consumption by 2030. There is no demand constraint on drop-in biofuels. Both supply and demand constraints limit the expansion of biofuels, but demand constraints can likely be relaxed at a faster pace than supply constraints. Whether the further expansion of biofuels is socially, economically, or environmentally justifiable is not a research question examined here. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) has a good potential as a raw material for ethanol production. However, continual supply of feed stock to the distillery is a major constraint in sweet sorghum based ethanol production. The main goals of this research were to determine genotype by sowing date interactions for sugar yield components and to identify high yielding and stable or specifically adapted genotypes for cultivation across the year via ANOVA (analysis of variance) and GGE (genotype + genotype by environment) biplot analysis. Given that sugar yield and quality varies with different sowing dates, 3 hybrids and 2 varieties of sorghum were planted at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) research farm, India on first of every month from January to December in a split plot design considering sowing date as main plot and genotypes as sub plot. The experiment was repeated for 3 consecutive years between 2007 and 2010 and observations were recorded for sugar yield and contributing traits. Date of sowing was the most important source of variation, accounting for 58 to 94% of the G+S+GS for sugar yield and related traits. Of the 12 monthly sowings, May, June and July sowings recorded highest sugar, cane and juice yields and the yields decreased with delay in sowing there on. The genotypes SPV 422 and ICSSH 30 recorded high sugar yield while ICSSH 24 was stable performer with comparative sugar yield. ‘Which- won-where’ analysis has demarcated the sowing dates into 2 groups and based on mean performance for sugar yield and GGE biplot analysis, the genotype SPV 422 was suitable for sowing from September to March and the genotype ICSSH 30 was suitable for sowing from April to August. However, brix was more of a genetic trait less influenced by the date of sowing. © Society for the Advancement of Breeding Research in Asia and Oceania (SABRAO) 2014.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the production of biofuels from algae cultivated in municipal wastewater in Gothenburg, Sweden. A possible biorefinery concept is studied based on two cases; Case A) combined biodiesel and biogas production, and Case B) only biogas production. The cases are compared in terms of product outputs and impact on global CO2 emissions mitigation. The area efficiency of the algae-based biofuels is also compared with other biofuel production routes. The study investigates the collaboration between an algae cultivation, biofuel production processes, a wastewater treatment plant and an industrial cluster for the purpose of utilizing material flows and industrial excess heat between the actors. This collaboration provides the opportunity to reduce the CO2 emissions from the process compared to a stand-alone operation. The results show that Case A is advantageous to Case B with respect to all studied factors. It is found that the algae-based biofuel production routes investigated in this study has higher area efficiency than other biofuel production routes. The amount of algae-based biofuel possible to produce corresponds to 31 MWfuel for Case A and 26 MWfuel in Case B. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

AB  - Paper mill sludge (PMS) is a residual biomass that is generated at paper mills in large quantities. Currently, PMS is commonly disposed in landfills, which causes environmental issues through chemical leaching and greenhouse gas production. In this research, we are exploring the potential of fast pyrolysis process for converting PMS into useful bio-oil and biochar products. We demonstrate that by subjecting PMS to a combination of acid hydrolysis and torrefaction pre-treatment processes it is possible to alter the physicochemical properties and composition of the feedstock material. Fast pyrolysis of pretreated PMS produced bio-oil with significantly higher selectivity to levoglucosenone and significantly reduced the amount of ketone, aldehyde, and organic acid components. Pretreatment of PMS with combined 4% mass fraction phosphoric acid hydrolysis and 220°C torrefaction processed prior to fast pyrolysis resulted in a 17 times increase of relative selectivity towards levoglucosenone in bio-oil product along with a reduction of acids, ketones, and aldehydes combined from 21 % to 11 %. Biochar, produced in higher yield, has characteristics that potentially make the solid byproduct ideal for soil amendment agent or sorbent material. This work reveals a promising process system to convert PMS waste into useful bio-based products. More in-depth research is required to gather more data information for assessing the economic and sustainability aspects of the process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sugarcane ethanol is considered to be one of the most efficient first-generation biofuels in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The carbon footprint (CF), however, increases significantly when taking into account emissions induced by indirect land-use changes (ILUC). This case study investigates sugarcane ethanol production in the Republic of Malawi, in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA); the research objectives were to identify and quantify direct and indirect emissions and to identify measures to optimize the CF. The CF has been calculated with a life cycle approach and with data obtained from the involved companies; our estimations with regard to ILUC take into account further expansion plans for sugarcane crop production. Under existing production conditions ethanol produced in Malawi leads to GHG emissions expressed as CO2eq of 116gMJ-1 of ethanol. However, high optimization potentials exist when the vinasse is used as an input for biogas production and the harvesting switches from pre-harvest burning to green harvesting. ILUC induced by prospective sugarcane expansions in the Southern Region will, according to current planning, probably not occur since these expansions are linked to the implementation of a large-scale irrigation project. However if ILUC takes place, high levels of additional CO2 emissions of about 77gMJ-1 of ethanol are to be expected. Although the case study results are only valid for a specific region, some of the findings, such as the high compensation potential regarding ILUC through investments in irrigation systems, may be transferable to other regions in SSA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has used partial equilibrium models to estimate the overall indirect land use change (iLUC) associated with the biofuel scenario mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). For regulatory purposes, the U.S. EPA "shocks" (changes) the amount of each biofuel in the economic models one at a time to estimate the threshold values for specific biofuels (single-shock analysis). The primary assumption in the single-shock analysis is that iLUC is a linear process with respect to biofuels, i.e., that interactions between different biofuels are trivially small. However, the assumption of linearity in the single-shock analysis is not appropriate for estimating the threshold values for specific biofuels when the interactions between different biofuels are not small.Numerical results from the RFS2 program show that the effects of interactions between different biofuels are too large to be ignored. Thus, the threshold values for specific biofuels determined by the U.S. EPA are scenario-dependent and value choice-driven. They do not reflect real impacts of specific biofuels. Using scenario-dependent values for regulation is arbitrary and inappropriate. Failure to deal appropriately with interactions between different biofuels when assigning iLUC values to specific biofuels is a mathematical and systematic flaw; it is not an "uncertainty" issue. The U.S. EPA should find better ways to differentiate the contribution of one biofuel versus another when assigning iLUC values or find better means of regulating the land use change impact of biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil water availability, nutrient supply and climatic conditions are key factors for plant production. For a sustainable integration of bioenergy plants into agricultural systems, detailed studies on their water uses and growth performances are needed. The new bioenergy plant Igniscum Candy is a cultivar of the Sakhalin Knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis), which is characterized by a high annual biomass production. For the determination of transpiration-yield relations at the whole plant level we used wicked lysimeters at multiple irrigation levels associated with the soil water availability (25, 35, 70, 100%) and nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha-1). Leaf transpiration and net photosynthesis were determined with a portable minicuvette system. The maximum mean transpiration rate was 10.6 mmol m-2 s-1 for well-watered plants, while the mean net photosynthesis was 9.1 μmol m-2 s-1. The cumulative transpiration of the plants during the growing seasons varied between 49 l (drought stressed) and 141 l (well-watered) per plant. The calculated transpiration coefficient for Fallopia over all of the treatments applied was 485.6 l kg-1. The transpiration-yield relation of Igniscum is comparable to rye and barley. Its growth performance making Fallopia a potentially good second generation bioenergy crop. .

AB  - Urban storm water runoff can carry a wide range of contaminants, many of which exceed federal maximum contaminant levels, into surface water resources (e.g., rivers and lakes). The use of filtration systems has received greater attention for its potential to remove particulate matter and other contaminants. Biochar is expected to have excellent potential as an adsorbent or filter given its large surface area and microporous structure. This study evaluated the potential use of biochar as a filter media through a series of column experiments. A column with an inner diameter of 7 cm (2.75 in.) and a length of 61 cm (24 in.) using biochar as filter media was constructed to examine its effectiveness for the removal of mixed contaminants [total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and E. coli] from synthetic storm water. The results demonstrated that this filter reduced the TSS in the storm water effluent by an average of 86% and the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate by 86 and 47%, respectively. After filtration, the concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn (heavy metals) decreased by 18, 19, 65, 75, 17, and 24%, respectively. The variation can be explained in terms of the chemical behavior of the different heavy metals as well as the properties of the biochar. Among the three PAHs tested, biochar successfully removed phenanthrene (almost 100% removal efficiency) and achieved 76% removal efficiency for naphthalene but resulted in no removal of benzo(a)pyrene; the average removal for the three PAHs was 68%. Biochar was not efficient in removing E. coli from storm water, and the concentration of almost 7,400∈∈MPN/100∈∈mL in the inflow was reduced to approximately 5,000∈∈MPN/100∈∈mL in the outflow, representing a mean removal efficiency of 27%. Overall, the biochar used in this study showed promise to be an effective filter media for the removal of selected contaminants from urban storm water runoff. However, additional research should be conducted using different types of biochars, produced from different feedstock and production conditions, to determine the most effective biochar that can simultaneously remove multiple contaminants from urban storm water. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

An optimization-based supply chain model is used to obtain long-run planning outcomes, based on which we develop market models considering both perfect and imperfect competitions. The equilibrium among stakeholders in the multi-echelon supply chain can be obtained by solving a collection of first-order conditions associated with their profit-maximization problems. For the imperfect competition, the model, additionally, allows firms with significant market share at different segment of the supply chain to exercise market power. We apply the models to an illustrative case study of California. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Through a comparative energy flow analysis, this paper examines the energy security impacts of growing biofuels on wastelands in South India. India's National Policy on Biofuels claims that wastelands are well suited for biofuel production because they are empty and unused. However, in rural Tamil Nadu, a Prosopis juliflora fuelwood energy economy already exists on these lands and services a mix of rural and urban consumers at household and industrial levels. This Prosopis economy currently provides 2.5-10.3 times more useful energy than would the government's proposed Jatropha curcas biodiesel economy, depending on Jatropha by-product usage. Contrary to the government's claims, growing biofuels on wastelands can weaken, rather than improve, the country's energy security. Further, replacing Prosopis with Jatropha could engender changes in economic and property relations that could further weaken energy security. These findings are not specific to rural Tamil Nadu as Prosopis is widely used as a fuelwood throughout Asia and Africa. Calls to 'develop' degraded lands through biofuel promotion similarly exist in these regions. This study underscores the importance of analyzing wasteland-centered biofuel policies at local levels in order to better understand the changes in human-environment relationships resulting from this policy push. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compared advanced anaerobic digestion combining two-phased anaerobic digestion (2PAD) with high pressure homogenization (HPH) pretreatment to conventional anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge at laboratory scale. The study began with examination of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) solubilization due to HPH pretreatment at different pressure (0-12,000psi) and chemical dose (0.009-0.036g NaOH/g total solids). Homogenizing pressure was found as the most significant factor (p-value&lt;0.05) for increasing solubilization of particulate chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biopolymers in TWAS. Based on the preliminary results, a pretreatment with chemical dose of 0.009g NaOH/g total solids and pressure of 12,000psi was selected for digester studies. Upon acclimation of anaerobic inocula to pretreatments, a total number of twelve lab-scale digesters were operated under scenarios including single-stage (control), 2PAD, and HPH coupled with 2PAD (HPH+2PAD) at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 14 and 7 days. Between mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, mesophilic digestion was found to benefit more from pretreatments. Relative (to control) improvements in methane yield and volatile solids (VS) removals increased noticeably as SRT was shortened from 20 to 14 and 7 days. HPH+2PAD system was found to achieve the maximum methane production (0.61-1.32L CH4/Ldigester-d) and VS removals (43-64%). Thermophilic control, 2PAD and HPH+2PAD systems resulted in significant pathogen removals meeting Class A biosolids requirements according to Organic Matter Recycling Regulations (OMRR) of British Columbia (BC) at 20d SRT. Energy analysis indicated that all the digestion scenarios attained positive energy balance with 2PAD system operated at 20d SRT producing the maximum net energy of 4.76GJ/tonne CODadded. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Differences and similarities in aerosol characteristics, for the first time, over two environmentally distinct locations in Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) - Kanpur (KPR) (urban location) and Gandhi College (GC) (rural site) are examined. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) exhibit pronounced seasonal variability with higher values during winter and premonsoon. Aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF) and A˚ngstro¨m exponent (α) are higher over GC than KPR indicating relatively higher fine mode aerosol concentration over GC. Higher FMF over GC is attributed to local biomass burning activities. Analysis of AOD spectra revealed that aerosol size distribution is dominated by wide range of fine mode fractions or mixture of modes during winter and postmonsoon, while during premonsoon and monsoon coarse mode aerosols are more abundant. Single scattering albedo (SSA) is lower over GC than KPR. SSA spectra reveals the abundance of fine mode (coarse mode) absorbing (scattering) aerosols during winter and postmonsoon (premonsoon and monsoon). Spectral SSA features reveal that OC contribution to enhanced absorption is negligible. Analysis shows that absorbing aerosols can be classified as Mostly Black Carbon (BC), and Mixed BC and Dust over IGP. Mixed BC and dust is always higher over KPR, while Mostly BC is higher over GC throughout the year. The amount of long range transported dust exhibits a gradient between KPR (higher) and GC (lower). Results on seasonally varying aerosol types, and absorbing aerosol types and their gradients over an aerosol hotspot are important to tune models and to reduce the uncertainty in radiative and climate impact of aerosols. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marginal, often contaminated, sites exist in large areas across the world as a result of historic activities such as industry, transportation and mineral extraction. Remediation, or other improvements, of these sites is typically only considered for sites with high exploitation pressure and those posing the highest risks to human health or the environment. At the same time there is increasing competition for land resources for different needs such as biofuel production. Potentially some of this land requirement could be met by production of biomass on brownfield or other marginal land, thereby improving the land while applying the crop cultivation as part of an integrated management strategy. The design and decision making for such a strategy will be site specific. A decision support framework, the Rejuvenate DST (decision support tool) has been developed with the aim of supporting such site specific decision making. This tool is presented here, and has been tested by applying it to a number of case study sites. The consequent SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis is discussed and evaluated. The DST was found to be systematic, transparent, and applicable for diverse sites in France, Romania and Sweden, in addition to the sites to which it was applied through its development. The DST is regarded as especially useful if applied as a checklist in an iterative way throughout the decision process, from identifying potential crops to identifying knowledge gaps, working/non-working management strategies and potential risks. The DST also provides a structure promoting effective stakeholder engagement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Efficient production of algal biofuels could reduce dependence on foreign oil by providing a domestic renewable energy source. Moreover, algae-based biofuels are attractive for their large oil yield potential despite decreased land use and natural resource (e.g., water and nutrients) requirements compared to terrestrial energy crops. Important factors controlling algal lipid productivity include temperature, nutrient availability, salinity, pH, and the light-to-biomass conversion rate. Computational approaches allow for inexpensive predictions of algae growth kinetics for various bioreactor sizes and geometries without the need for multiple, expensive measurement systems. Parametric studies of algal species include serial experiments that use off-line monitoring of growth and lipid levels. Such approaches are time consuming and usually incomplete, and studies on the effect of the interaction between various parameters on algal growth are currently lacking. However, these are the necessary precursors for computational models, which currently lack the data necessary to accurately simulate and predict algae growth. In this work, we conduct a lab-scale parametric study of the marine alga Nannochloropsis salina and apply the findings to our physics-based computational algae growth model. We then compare results from the model with experiments conducted in a greenhouse tank and an outdoor, open-channel raceway pond. Results show that the computational model effectively predicts algae growth in systems across varying scale and identifies the causes for reductions in algal productivities. Applying the model facilitates optimization of pond designs and improvements in strain selection. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper provides analysis of the availability of grain straw resources for centralised industrial usages and suitable areas in China at the prefectural level. China has abundant straw resources for both decentralised and centralised usages. Decentralised usages are inefficient and cannot absorb enough straw. However, centralised usages have technological and economic problems, such as product cost and resource supply, and therefore, a system analysis of the economic available resources and suitable areas are needed. Three main grain crops - rice, wheat, and corn - and three typical centralised usages - paper making, direct combustion power generation, and bioethanol - are investigated in this study. An optimal model is established on the basis of straw resource characteristics and techno-economic characteristics of the usages and used to calculate the distribution of suitable prefectures and the largest supply of resources for each usage. The study focuses on prefectures in 13 provinces with relatively abundant grain straw resources. The suitable areas for paper making are in North China, for direct combustion power generation are in North and Northeast China, for bioethanol are in Northeast China. The largest economic available resources for paper making, direct combustion power generation, and bioethanol are 47.5, 221.4, and 164.4 million tons, respectively. The operation cost and the ratio of straw actually collected from production are selected for conducting a sensitivity analysis. The impacts of other factors, including the geographical environment, local product demand, existing industry, change in total straw production, technical progress and straw from other crops, are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and other plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been used to increase growth and yield of corn and sugarcane, two graminaceous crops utilized as bioenergy feedstocks. Switchgrass (SG, Panicum virgatum L.), a native perennial grass of North America, is also a desirable bioenergy crop because it can be grown on marginal lands and thus does not necessarily displace food production. Yet no investigations have been conducted on the use of NFB and/or PGPR as inoculants to increase SG growth and productivity. Studies reporting high biomass yields from SG with minimal to no fertilizer nitrogen (N) input prompted us to hypothesize that SG is obtaining part of its N from an alternative source, perhaps through biological nitrogen fixation from root/rhizome associated PGPR. We isolated bacteria from SG rhizomes that had not received fertilizer N input for over ten years and which increased plant growth in the absence of the fertilizer N under growth chamber conditions. The bacteria were identified as a strain of Paenibacillus polymyxa, a N2-fixing bacterium, and several other PGPR capable of solubilizing phosphate and/or producing auxins. Our objective was to test this PGPR inoculum under field conditions with low-N inputs. Here, we present the findings regarding SG productivity in the establishment year. Switchgrass seeds inoculated with the PGPR culture had greater tiller density, and taller tillers resulting in 40% higher yield than uninoculated plants. PGPR have the potential to be effectively utilized as inoculants to enhance SG yields in a low-N input production system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass recalcitrance is a major bottleneck in the development of an economically viable process to convert woody biomass into fuels and other valuable chemicals. Selective breeding of trees with low recalcitrance toward biofuel conversion could help significantly reduce the cost of biofuel production, but such efforts would require a greater understanding of the nature of variations in the biomass recalcitrance of softwood species. The complexity of biomass recalcitrance, however, hinders research into determining the viability of breeding programs aimed to improve the recalcitrance of softwoods. In this study, a method was developed to determine biomass recalcitrance at three levels: chemical composition, pretreatment yield, and sugar release from the enzymatic hydrolysis. This method is designed to investigate the biomass recalcitrance variations among different families of Douglas-fir, which is the most abundant and promising softwood species for biofuel production in the Pacific Northwest region. Wood samples from 150 plantation-grown trees were collected and analyzed to test the method and the applicability of the parameters screened. The relationships between these levels are discussed to determine the best method for screening large D. fir populations. A parameter, a biomass recalcitrance factor, was introduced to quantify the level of biomass recalcitrance toward sugar production from different D. fir trees. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bioenergy sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L). Moench.] is a potential dedicated energy crop that can help fulfill requirements for advancing ligno-cellulosic biofuel technology, but information balancing profitability and soil resource effects of growing this crop is limited. Using field plot data, this study objective is to quantify effects of different bioenergy sorghum management practices on soil characteristics that influence yield and ultimately the producer’s net return. Field studies were conducted at the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research Farm near College Station, TX from 2008 through 2011. A stochastic economic simulation model was developed using yields and associated soil characteristics data. Results suggested growing bioenergy sorghum may be profitable and can achieve a maximum annual net return to capital, land, and management of $1,600 ha−1 by applying 300 kg ha−1 of nitrogen and returning no biomass. This net return, however, is achieved at the cost of soil carbon and nitrogen depletion. The soil nutrient pool was maintained when biomass return rates were approximately 20 % of yield. This management practice, however, requires a compromise of $330 to $422 ha−1 in net returns compared to a 0 % biomass return. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has been recognized as a potential biofuel crop, because it is adapted to a wide range of environmental and climatic conditions. Zones of adaptation for many switchgrass cultivars are well documented and attributed to local adaptation to the temperature and photoperiod at the location of origin. The objective of this study is to develop cultivar-specific growth parameters for the Agricultural Land Management and Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model based on location of origin and use these parameters to predict the biomass production of two lowland cultivars (Alamo and Kanlow) and two upland cultivars (Blackwell and Cave-in-Rock) in the central and southern Great Plains (TX, AR, LA, OK, KS, and MO). The plant parameters adjusted for each cultivar’s origin include average growing season temperature (22–27 °C), photoperiod at growth onset (11.46–13.12 h), maximum number of heat units (1,500–2,300), maximum leaf area index (6–12), and light extinction coefficient (0.33–0.50). The absolute difference between the average simulated and measured yields across all seven field locations for each cultivar is less than 0.5 Mg ha−1. Performance of the cultivar-specific parameters varies by location, but the parameters do a reasonable job of estimating the average yield (less than 15 % difference) of each cultivar for a majority of field locations. In addition, regional simulations of the four cultivars each show realistic spatial variation in yield across the central and southern Great Plains. The parameters derived in this project for the ALMANAC model provide a tool for optimizing choice of switchgrass cultivar on different soils, in different climates, and with different management across large geographic regions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - The Clostridium genus of bacteria contains the most widely studied biofuel-producing organisms such as Clostridium thermocellum and also some human pathogens, plus a few less characterized strains. Here, we present a comparative genomic analysis of 40 fully sequenced clostridial genomes, paying a particular attention to the biomass degradation ones. Our analysis indicates that some of the Clostridium botulinum strains may have been incorrectly classified in the current taxonomy and hence should be renamed according to the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) phylogeny. A core-genome analysis suggests that only 169 orthologous gene groups are shared by all the strains, and the strain-specific gene pool consists of 22,668 genes, which is consistent with the fact that these bacteria live in very diverse environments and have evolved a very large number of strain-specific genes to adapt to different environments. Across the 40 genomes, 1.4–5.8 % of genes fall into the carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) families, and 20 out of the 40 genomes may encode cellulosomes with each genome having 1 to 76 genes bearing the cellulosome-related modules such as dockerins and cohesins. A phylogenetic footprinting analysis identified cis-regulatory motifs that are enriched in the promoters of the CAZyme genes, giving rise to 32 statistically significant motif candidates. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a warm-season C4 grass that is a target lignocellulosic biofuel species. Salt stress is one of the major limiting factors for switchgrass growth in many regions. The objective of this study was to examine relative salt tolerance and genetic diversity among 33 switchgrass populations. Seeds of each population were planted in cone-tainers and grown in a greenhouse. Two months after establishment, the switchgrass were grown in half strength Hoagland’s nutrient solution with either 0 mM NaCl (control) or half strength Hoagland’s nutrient solution with 250 mM NaCl (salt stress treatment) for 24 days. Salt stress tolerance was determined based on a variety of parameters including leaf electrolyte leakage (EL), chlorophyll content (Chl content), leaf photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration rate (Tr). Significant differences in salt stress tolerance were found among the 33 populations. Based on the Pn and salt tolerance trait index (STTI), lowland populations AM-314/MS-155, Kanlow, TEM-LoDorm, Alamo, and BN-13645-64, as well as upland populations T-2086, T-2101, BN-11357-63, and BN-12323-69 were classified as salt tolerant. In contrast, upland populations BN-18757-67, 70SG0021, Summer, 70SG0016, T16971, Dacotah, Turkey, 70SG003, and Pathfinder were classified as salt sensitive populations. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) marker analysis was employed to determine the genetic diversity among the 33 switchgrass populations. UPGMA cluster analysis showed that salt tolerant switchgrass populations TEM-LoDorm, Alamo, Kanlow, BN-12323-69, AM-314/MS-155, T2101, BN-11357-63, T-2086, and BN-13645-64 clustered into one group, indicating that these salt tolerant populations may have a similar genetic background. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in 2010, which mandates that a minimum of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel be produced by 2022. Woody plants growing on native rangelands in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the USA, such as honey mesquite and juniper species, may have potential as bioenergy feedstock, but there are concerns regarding variability in biomass density distribution and high harvest and transport costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) performances of honey mesquite relative to irrigated and dryland sweet sorghum and dryland switchgrass bioenergy feedstock as delivered to the farm gate. Four efficiency criteria such as biomass production cost, energy cost, GHG offset, and GHG use were calculated. Our results suggest that mesquite lagged slightly behind switchgrass when biomass and energy efficiency are considered. However, mesquite appears superior to the other feedstocks in two categories—GHG offset efficiency and GHG use efficiency once land use change (LUC) effects are accounted for. Mesquite as a bioenergy feedstock in the SGP has greater potential if additional benefits such as increased grass production for livestock production and reduction in herbicide costs for mesquite control—both of which would occur as a result of mesquite harvesting—are considered. Mesquite production values on a per-land area basis are lower than the other feedstocks observed in this comparison and therefore could not supplant those feedstocks entirely, but mesquite appears to be suitable as a complementary feedstock to contribute to total biomass feedstock demand. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Biofuel crops have relatively low economic value, and potential to grow them with low-cost inputs is essential for economic viability. Use of biosolids as a fertility source has not been explored at the field scale for switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a potential bioenergy crop. This study tested harvest management and biosolids rate effects on switchgrass production, quality, and theoretical ethanol yield in Virginia, USA. Switchgrass (cv. “Cave-in-Rock”) was annually cut once (winter) or twice (summer and winter) for 2 years. Biosolids were applied once at 0, 77, and 154 kg N ha−1 in May 2011; urea was applied once at 146 kg N ha−1 for comparison. Feedstock yield and quality parameters (neutral and acid detergent fibers, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash) were measured and used to compute theoretical ethanol potential (TEP) and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY). Cutting twice per season produced greater biomass yields than cutting once (6.6 vs 5.4 Mg ha−1) in 2011 but not in 2012. Cutting once per season produced feedstock with greater TEP (513 vs 433 L Mg−1) and TEY (2,980 vs 2,680 L ha−1) in both years. Biosolids and urea increased biomass yields by 11 % (0.6 Mg ha−1) and TEY by 13 % (352 L Mg−1), but both decreased TEP by 1 % (7.1 L Mg−1 biomass). Cutting once per season is advantageous in producing more TEY given comparable biomass yield and superior feedstock quality. Biosolids were a suitable alternate N source and could boost biomass and biofuel production while reducing input costs in switchgrass-based bioenergy systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - There is a growing concern that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during agricultural energy crop production might negate GHG emission savings which was not intended when promoting the use of renewable energy. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major GHG, and in addition, it is the most powerful ozone-depleting compound that is emitted by human activity. The use of N fertilizers and animal manures is the main anthropogenic source of N2O emissions. In spite of their high relevance, we still have limited understanding of the complex underlying microbial processes that consume or produce N2O and their interactions with soil types, fertilizers (rate and types), plants, and other environmental variables. In a 2-year field experiment, we compared two important biogas crops in two different agro-ecological regions of northern Germany for their productivity and GHG emissions, using the closed-chamber technique and high time-resolution sampling. Silage maize, which is currently the most widespread crop grown for biogas fermentation purposes in Germany, was compared with an alternative bioenergy crop at each site. The three forms of nitrogen fertilizers/manures were given: calcium ammonium nitrate, cattle/pig slurry, and biogas residue. The greatest N2O flux activity occurred in the period of May–July in all crops and at both sites. Flux patterns indicated pronounced effects of soil moisture-soil mineral-N interactions which were also seen as causation of the higher N2O fluxes in the bioenergy crop maize compared to the other tested energy crops. However, the N2O emission per unit methane production (specific N2O emission) was clearly lower in soils planted with maize due to significantly higher methane hectare yield of maize. Our data suggest a linear relationship between increasing N input and increases in N2O emission in both years at site with sandy loam texture where highest N2O fluxes were measured. At sandy loam site, the percentage of applied N being emitted as N2O was 1.9 and 1.1 % in soils cropped with maize and 0.9 and 0.8 % in soils cropped with wheat during the investigation period 2007–2008 and 2008–2009, respectively. In contrast, at site with sandy soil texture, the percentage of applied N emitted as N2O was only 0.6 and 0.7 % in maize soils and 0.4 and 0.3 % in grassland during 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 period, respectively. Higher daily and annual N2O emissions at the sandy loam site were attributed to the finer soil texture and higher denitrification activity. The present study provides a very good basis for the assessment of direct emissions of greenhouse gases from relevant biogas crops in North-West Europe. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The Saccharum L. genus includes important crops that are utilized for sugar and fuel production. The World Collection of Sugarcane and Related Grasses (World Collection) in Miami, FL contains diverse and potentially useful germplasm for this and related genera; however, this collection has been underutilized because little is known about the traits of its accessions. Our objectives were to phenotypically characterize the World Collection and select a representative core collection that could then be studied intensively. In total, eight morphological traits of the World Collection were evaluated three times in 1 year. A core of 300 accessions that included each species in the World Collection was selected by using the Maximization Strategy in MStrat software. The core had a higher diversity rating than random selections of 300 accessions. The Shannon–Weaver Diversity Index scores of the core and whole collection were similar indicating that the majority of the diversity was captured by the core collection. The ranges and medians between the core and World Collection were similar; only two of the trait medians were not significant at P = 0.05 using the non-parametric Wilcoxon method and the coincidence rate (CR % = 96.2) was high (>80) indicating that extreme values were retained. Thus, the phenotypic diversity of these traits in the World Collection was well represented by the core collection. Agronomic studies on the core should be useful for characterizing the World Collection and genes for useful traits should be available in the core collection. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

AB  - A surplus of distillers’ grain resulting from rapid expansion in biofuel production has led to interest in finding alternative uses for this co-product, apart from its traditional use as an animal feed. Land application to agricultural soil in order to recycle the nutrients is one potential use. In this study we evaluated the effect of a single application of wet wheat distillers’ grain (WDG) on crop yield and nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in a 3-yr canola-wheat-canola rotation in southern Saskatchewan. The experimental treatments included a single application of WDG at a rate of 100 kg N ha-1 in comparison to urea applied at the same rate of N along with an unfertilized control. In the first year, WDG produced a canola yield of 1266 kg ha-1, which was significantly greater than the urea treatment. The WDG treatment resulted in increased plant N uptake that was 59% greater than the control, but was 20% less than that observed in the urea treatment, indicating that only a portion of the applied N in the WDG was available for recovery. Greater yield of WDG may be due to factors other than N. Both WDG and urea treatments had a significant effect on plant P uptake in the first year. The residual effect of WDG addition on crop parameters in the second and third years was mainly limited to enhancement of plant P uptake in second year. Overall, the WDG applied at the same rate of N was at least as effective as urea for increasing crop yield. © 2014, Agricultural Institute of Canada. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research aimed to determine the optimum nitrogen fertilization rate on three soils for producing biomass sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cultivar M81E) and corn (Zea mays cultivar P33N58) grain yield and to compare their responses. The research was conducted in Missouri in rotations with soybean, cotton, and corn. Seven rates of nitrogen (N) were applied. Sweet sorghum dry biomass varied between 11 and 27.5 Mg ha−1) depending on year, soil type, and N rate. Nitrogen fertilization on the silt and sandy loam soils had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on sweet sorghum yield grown after cotton and soybean. However, yield increased in the clay soil. Corn grain yielded from 1.3 to 12.9 Mg ha−1, and 179 to 224 kg N ha−1 was required for maximum yield. Increasing biomass yield required N application on clay but not on silt loam and sandy loam in rotations with soybean or cotton. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background and aims: Biochar has demonstrably improved crop yields in weathered and acidic soils, but studies in calcareous soils are particularly lacking, so biochar effects on plant growth was investigated under these conditions.
Methods: Six biochars were obtained from different feedstocks and production technologies. Chemical characterization of fresh biochars included total and extractable nutrients, labile carbon, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Extractable nutrients were also evaluated in biochar-soil mixtures with a basic (pH >8.2) test soil. Bioassays with lettuce and ryegrass were carried out to relate biochar chemical properties to effects on plant biomass.
Results: A sewage sludge slow pyrolysis char was stimulatory to plant growth, as was a slow pyrolysis pine wood char at an intermediate concentration, while gasification and fast-pyrolysis pine and poplar wood chars were strongly inhibitory, with reductions in biomass at realistic application rates of 5–19 t ha−1.
Conclusions: Statistical comparison of plant responses with biochar composition led to the assessment that plant responses were most correlated with volatile matter content and total P content, whose availability was likely regulated by pH and Ca content. Potential effects of phytotoxins were considered, but these were seen to be much less probable than effects due to nutrient availability. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Epidemiologic and health impact studies are inhibited by the paucity of global, long-term measurements of the chemical composition of fine particulate matter. We inferred PM2.5 chemical composition at 0.1 × 0.1 spatial resolution for 2004-2008 by combining aerosol optical depth retrieved from the MODIS and MISR satellite instruments, with coincident profile and composition information from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Evaluation of the satellite-model PM2.5 composition data set with North American in situ measurements indicated significant spatial agreement for secondary inorganic aerosol, particulate organic mass, black carbon, mineral dust, and sea salt. We found that global population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations were dominated by particulate organic mass (11.9 ± 7.3 μg/m3), secondary inorganic aerosol (11.1 ± 5.0 μg/m3), and mineral dust (11.1 ± 7.9 μg/m3). Secondary inorganic PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 30 μg/m3 over East China. Sensitivity simulations suggested that population-weighted ambient PM2.5 from biofuel burning (11 μg/m3) could be almost as large as from fossil fuel combustion sources (17 μg/m3). These estimates offer information about global population exposure to the chemical components and sources of PM2.5. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel has increasingly become important for the aviation sector to address energy security and climate change mitigation. Rapeseed (Brassica Napus) is a favored candidate feedstock for HRJ because of its high quality oil content and agroeconomic benefit to replace the fallow period in wheat/fallow rotations. We conducted research to evaluate regional differences in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions for rapeseed cultivation in several counties in 10 states in the United States (U.S.). The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) methodology was applied, and results were compared to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. In this study, yield, nitrogen fertilizer rate, and types were held constant for all locations in order to understand the similarities and differences in the RSB and IPCC methods for estimating N2O emissions. From the results, the RSB-calculated N2O emissions varied for different U.S. states, though regional differences were very small, 0.72-0.73 kg N2O Mg-1seed, while N2O emissions from IPCC method were the same for all sites, 0.87 kg N2O Mg-1seed. The difference between the RSB and IPCC methods is caused by the indirect N2O emissions from ammonia emissions and nitrate leaching. However, the influence of indirect effect is relatively small compared to overall N2O emissions. The utilization of the RSB method may not be justified for estimating regional variations in N2O emissions. As a consequence, the preliminary greenhouse gas (GHG) of rapeseed HRJ fuel using the RSB method in several locations had small differences in result, 42.7-43.0 g CO2 eq/MJ compared to 45.9 g CO2 eq/MJ using the IPCC method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper is the first part in a series of two articles and presents a data-driven wildfire simulator for forecasting wildfire spread scenarios, at a reduced computational cost that is consistent with operational systems. The prototype simulator features the following components: an Eulerian front propagation solver FIREFLY that adopts a regionalscale modeling viewpoint, treats wildfires as surface propagating fronts, and uses a description of the local rate of fire spread (ROS) as a function of environmental conditions based on Rothermel's model; a series of airborne-like observations of the fire front positions; and a data assimilation (DA) algorithm based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for parameter estimation. This stochastic algorithm partly accounts for the nonlinearities between the input parameters of the semi-empirical ROS model and the fire front position, and is sequentially applied to provide a spatially uniform correction to wind and biomass fuel parameters as observations become available. A wildfire spread simulator combined with an ensemble-based DA algorithm is therefore a promising approach to reduce uncertainties in the forecast position of the fire front and to introduce a paradigm-shift in the wildfire emergency response. In order to reduce the computational cost of the EnKF algorithm, a surrogate model based on a polynomial chaos (PC) expansion is used in place of the forward model FIREFLY in the resulting hybrid PCEnKF algorithm. The performance of EnKF and PC-EnKF is assessed on synthetically generated simple configurations of fire spread to provide valuable information and insight on the benefits of the PC-EnKF approach, as well as on a controlled grassland fire experiment. The results indicate that the proposed PC-EnKF algorithm features similar performance to the standard EnKF algorithm, but at a much reduced computational cost. In particular, the re-analysis and forecast skills of DA strongly relate to the spatial and temporal variability of the errors in the ROS model parameters. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Electroporation is a method of treatment of plant tissue that due to its nonthermal nature enables preservation of the natural quality, colour and vitamin composition of food products. The range of processes where electroporation was shown to preserve quality, increase extract yield or optimize energy input into the process is overwhelming, though not exhausted; e.g. extraction of valuable compounds and juices, dehydration, cryopreservation, etc. Electroporation is—due to its antimicrobial action—a subject of research as one stage of the pasteurization or sterilization process, as well as a method of plant metabolism stimulation. This paper provides an overview of electroporation as applied to plant materials and electroporation applications in food processing, a quick summary of the basic technical aspects on the topic, and a brief discussion on perspectives for future research and development in the field. The paper is a review in the very broadest sense of the word, written with the purpose of orienting the interested newcomer to the field of electroporation applications in food technology towards the pertinent, highly relevant and more in-depth literature from the respective subdomains of electroporation research. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Global demands on agricultural land are increasing due to population growth, dietary changes and the use of biofuels. Their effect on food security is to reduce humans’ ability to cope with the uncertainties of global climate change. In light of the 2008 food crisis, to secure reliable future access to sufficient agricultural land, many nations and corporations have begun purchasing large tracts of land in the global South, a phenomenon deemed “land grabbing” by popular media. Because land investors frequently export crops without providing adequate employment, this represents an effective income loss for local communities. We study 28 countries targeted by large-scale land acquisitions [comprising 87 % of reported cases and 27 million hectares (ha)] and estimate the effects of such investments on local communities’ incomes. We find that this phenomenon can potentially affect the incomes of ~12 million people globally with implications for food security, poverty levels and urbanization. While it is important to note that our study incorporates a number of assumptions and limitations, it provides a much needed initial quantification of the economic impacts of large-scale land acquisitions on rural livelihoods. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, a high lipid-accumulating mutant strain of the microalgae Scenedesmus dimorphus was developed via radiation breeding. To induce mutant strain, S. dimorphus was gamma-irradiated at doses from 100 to 800 Gy, and then a mutant (Sd-Pm210) with 25 % increased lipid content was selected using Nile red staining methodology. Sd-Pm210 showed morphological changes and had higher growth rate compared to the wild type. From random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, partial genetic modifications were also observed in Sd-Pm210. In comparisons of lipid content between wild type and Sd-Pm210 using thin-layer chromatography, the content of triacylglycerol was markedly higher in the Sd-Pm210 strain. The total peak area of fatty acid methyl ester was shown to have about 1.4-fold increase in Sd-Pm210, and major fatty acids were identified as palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. To define the metabolic changes in the mutant strain, 2-dimensional electrophoresis was conducted. Several proteins related to lipid synthesis and energy metabolisms were overexpressed in the mutant strain. These results showed that radiation breeding can be utilized for the development of efficient microalgae strains for biofuel production. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Planting non-food bioenergy crops on marginal lands is an alternative bioenergy development solution in China. Native non-food bioenergy plants are also considered to be a wise choice to reduce the threat of invasive plants. In this study, the impacts of climate change (a consensus of IPCC scenarios A2a for 2080) on the potential distribution of nine non-food bioenergy plants native to China (viz., Pistacia chinensis, Cornus wilsoniana, Xanthoceras sorbifolia, Vernicia fordii, Sapium sebiferum, Miscanthus sinensis, M. floridulus, M. sacchariflorus and Arundo donax) were analyzed using a MaxEnt species distribution model. The suitable habitats of the nine non-food plants were distributed in the regions east of the Mongolian Plateau and the Tibetan Plateau, where the arable land is primarily used for food production. Thus, the large-scale cultivation of those plants for energy production will have to rely on the marginal lands. The variables of "precipitation of the warmest quarter" and "annual mean temperature" were the most important bioclimatic variables for most of the nine plants according to the MaxEnt modeling results. Global warming in coming decades may result in a decrease in the extent of suitable habitat in the tropics but will have little effect on the total distribution area of each plant. The results indicated that it will be possible to grow these plants on marginal lands within these areas in the future. This work should be beneficial for the domestication and cultivation of those bioenergy plants and should facilitate land-use planning for bioenergy crops in China. Copyright: © 2014 Wang et al.

AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels contributes to climate change by introducing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and the need for an alternative fuel source is increasingly important. Biomass, either terrestrial or aquatic is considered a potential renewable energy source for biofuel production. Microalgae or seaweed (Macroalgae) are considered superior compared with terrestrial plants - in terms of solar energy storage, nutrient assimilation and potential for biofuel production - due to their higher photosynthetic efficiency, higher biomass yield and rates. The use of algae for biofuel production is expected to play an important role in securing energy supply in the next decades. For example, not only in the processing of those algae directly related to biofuels production but also in the possibility of combining this processing with pollution control, in particular with biological sequestration of CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, or wastewater treatment. Energy from biomass (biological, including biofuels and non-biological processes including gasification, combustion, and so on) is expected to provide more than a half share of the total energy to achieve the desired target. The various aspects associated with the design of algae production units are described in this paper, giving an overview of the current state of development of algae cultivation systems (photo-bioreactors and open ponds). Other potential applications and products from microalgae are also presented in this paper - for example applications in teh biological sequestration of CO2 and in wastewater treatment. In addition, the use of microalgae as food additives and for aquaculture is also discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The US government has mandated production of 79 million liters of biofuel from lignocellulose biomass and advanced fuels by 2022. To meet this requirement, the Department of Energy is encouraging research to develop herbaceous lignocellulose-based bioethanol for use as transport fuel. Miscanthus × giganteus was introduced in the US during 1930s, and is being widely studied for its potential to produce large biomass yield with minimum input in different soils. Miscanthus × giganteus is highly productive, sterile rhizomatous C4 perennial grass adapted to a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. Since the early 1980s, this crop has been studied under various climate and soil conditions in Europe and used to produce heat and electricity by combustion. This paper summarizes its agronomy and the characteristics which make it a potential dedicated bioenergy crop suitable for the reclaimed minesoils of the Appalachian region: Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The area which has been mined in the Appalachian region is estimated at 1.1 million hectares and only about 5% has been fully reclaimed. Using minesoils for miscanthus bioenergy feedstock production minimizes competition for arable land and sequesters soil organic carbon in these degraded lands. Reclaimed minesoils in the Appalachian region has potential to produce 9.22 × 106 Mg yr-1 dry biomass of Miscanthus × giganteus feedstock. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We present yield stress measurements of a concentrated suspension of Miscanthus x giganteus, a biomass substrate for the production of biofuels and chemicals. The particle porosity and the apparent solid packing fraction are quantified, and a simple relationship between volume and mass fractions proposed. The relationship between yield stress and solid concentration was measured with the maximum torque method of Dzuy and Boger (J Rheol 27: 321–349, 1983) for concentrations between 11 and 15 %, just below maximum packing. In the range of concentrations considered, the measured dependence of the yield stress on concentration appears to be significantly stronger than that reported for corn stover, a plant for which reliable data is available: the apparent power law exponent is found to be larger than 10, while the corresponding exponent reported for corn is in the range 4–6. We argue that differences in particle rigidity between corn and Miscanthus may play a role in explaining this result. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Energy efficiency and energy security are emerging concerns in climate change policy. But there is little acknowledgment of energy justice issues. Marginalised and vulnerable communities may be disproportionately exposed to both climate change impacts (e.g. heat, flooding) and costs associated with energy transitions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation (e.g. particulate exposure from biofuel com-bustion). Climate change is producing energy-related impacts such as increased cooling costs. In some cases it threatens energy security. Higher electricity costs associated with 'climate proofing' energy network infrastructure may exacerbate 'fuel poverty'-itself a form of injustice. In this paper we critically review the literature about multiple interrelations between energy policy, justice and climate change. We identify key issues, illuminate knowledge gaps, and synthesise findings to develop a conceptual model. We chart a research agenda and highlight policy implications. © Lucius & Lucius, Stuttgart.

AB  - The native photosynthetic reaction centers photosystemI (PSI) and photosystemII (PSII) act as functional nanostructures for the assembly of photo-biofuel cells. By electrical wiring of PSI and/or PSII with electrodes, the conversion of light energy into electrical power has been demonstrated. Different methodologies to electrically contact the photosystems with the electrodes have been developed, including the reconstitution of the photosystems on relay units, the application of redox-active polymers as charge-transport matrices, and the use of metallic nanoparticles or nanoclusters as electron-transfer relays. Electrical contact of the photosystems with the electrodes facilitates charge separation of the redox intermediates generated upon illumination of the assemblies, thus retarding destructive back electron-transfer reactions and enhancing the conversion of light energy into electrical power. Recent advances to fabricate electrically wired PSI and/or PSII electrodes are surveyed, and different approaches to assemble photo-bioelectrochemical cells are discussed. The limitations and future perspectives of the systems will also be presented. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Minimizing nitrogen (N) fertilization inputs during cultivation is essential for sustainable production of bioenergy and biofuels. The biomass crop willow (Salix spp.) is considered to have low N fertilizer requirements due to efficient recycling of nutrients during the perennial cycle. To investigate how successfully different willow genotypes assimilate and allocate N during growth, and remobilize and consequently recycle N before the onset of winter dormancy, N allocation and N remobilization (to and between different organs) were examined in 14 genotypes of a genetic family using elemental analysis and 15N as a label. Cuttings were established in pots in April and sampled in June, August and at onset of senescence in October. Biomass yield of the trees correlated well with yields recorded in the field. Genotype-specific variation was observed for all traits measured and general trends spanning these sampling points were identified when trees were grouped by biomass yield. Nitrogen reserves in the cutting fuelled the entirety of the canopy establishment, yet earlier cessation of this dependency was linked to higher biomass yields. The stem was found to be the major N reserve by autumn, which constitutes a major source of N loss at harvest, typically every 2-3 years. These data contribute to understanding N remobilization in short rotation coppice willow and to the identification of traits that could potentially be selected for in breeding programmes to further improve the sustainability of biomass production. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Thraustochytrid production of polyunsaturated fatty acids and xanthophylls have been generally sourced from crop-derived substrates, making the exploration of alternative feedstocks attractive since they promise increased sustainability and lower production costs. In this study, a distinct two-stage fermentation system was conceptualized for the first time, using the brown seaweed sugar mannitol as substrate for the intermediary biocatalyst Gluconobacter oxydans, an acetic acid bacterium, along with the marine thraustochytrid Aurantiochytrium sp. to produce the value-added lipids and xanthophylls. Jar fermenter culture resulted in seaweed mannitol conversion to fructose with an efficiency of 83 % by G. oxydans and, after bacteriostasis with sea salts, production of astaxanthin and docosahexaenoic acid by Aurantiochytrium sp. KH105. Astaxanthin productivity was high at 3.60 mg/L/day. This new system, therefore, widens possibilities of obtaining more varieties of industrially valuable products including foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biofuel precursor lipids from seaweed fermentation upon the use of suitable thraustochytrid strains. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper presents a price-endogenous, dynamic, mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to determine the biofuel feedstock supply response in U.S. agriculture and future biorefinery locations that meet the mandated cellulosic biofuel production targets. With a large number of supply units and potential processing locations involved, the problem could not be solved directly using MINLP solvers. We developed a sequential two-stage solution procedure to cope with this computational difficulty. The original MINLP model is decomposed into a price-endogenous agricultural sector model that solves the supply response and equilibrium in agricultural product markets, and a dynamic linear mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that solves the optimum facility location and supply chain network. The two models are solved sequentially with feedback from each other. Because of the large number of binary variables involved, computational difficulty was also encountered when solving the MIP model. We employed a heuristic backward-recursive technique to cope with this difficulty. Using moderately large test problems, we demonstrate that the heuristic solution procedures are computationally convenient and produce near-optimal solutions. We then applied this method to solve the full-scale model where nearly 3,000 U.S. counties were considered both as spatial supply units and potential refinery locations over the 2007-2022 planning horizon. Empirical results show that: (i) the U.S. biofuel mandates would lead to a significant increase in food commodity prices; (ii) regional comparative advantage in producing biofuel feedstocks would be more important than proximity to biofuel demand locations when determining the optimum refinery locations; and (iii) incorporating biofuel refinery locations in land-use decisions makes a considerable difference in the regional biomass production pattern. © 2014 INFORMS.

AB  - Effect of biochar addition on soil CO2 efflux in a typical Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) plantation in Lin'an, Zhejiang Province, China was investigated from July 2012 to July 2013 by the static closed chamber-GC technique. Soil temperature, soil moisture, WSOC and MBC concentrations were determined as well. Results showed that soil CO2 efflux exhibited a strong seasonal pattern. Compared with the control (without biochar application), the biochar treatment increased the soil CO2 efflux only in the first month since application, and then the effect diminished thereafter. There were no significant differences in the annual cumulative value of soil CO2 efflux between the biochar and control treatments. The annual mean value in soil MBC concentration (362 mg·kg-1) in the biochar treatment was higher than that (322 mg·kg-1) in the control. However, no significant difference in the soil WSOC concentration was found between the biochar and control treatments. Strong exponential relationships between soil temperature and soil CO2 efflux were observed regardless of the treatment and soil layer. The apparent temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil CO2 efflux in the biochar treatment was higher than that in the control. Soil CO2 efflux was related to soil WSOC concentration but not with soil MBC or moisture content. To conclude, the application of bamboo leaf biochar did not affect the annual cumulative CO2 emission in the Chinese chestnut plantation but increased the Q10, and the CO2 efflux was predominantly controlled by the soil tem-perature and soil WSOC level. ©, 2014, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology.

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) is a non-edible oil producing plant which is being advocated as an alternative biofuel energy resource. Its ability to grow in diverse soil conditions and minimal requirements of essential agronomical inputs compared with other oilseed crops makes it viable for cost-effective advanced biofuel production. We designed a study to investigate the effects of elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) (550ppm) on the growth, reproductive development, source-sink relationships, fruit and seed yield of J. curcas. We report, for the first time that elevated CO2 significantly influences reproductive characteristics of Jatropha and improve its fruit and seed yields. Net photosynthetic rate of Jatropha was 50% higher in plants grown in elevated CO2 compared with field and ambient CO2-grown plants. The study also revealed that elevated CO2 atmosphere significantly increased female to male flower ratio, above ground biomass and carbon sequestration potential in Jatropha (24kg carbon per tree) after 1year. Our data demonstrate that J. curcas was able to sustain enhanced rate of photosynthesis in elevated CO2 conditions as it had sufficient sink strength to balance the increased biomass yields. Our study also elucidates that the economically important traits including fruit and seed yield in elevated CO2 conditions were significantly high in J. curcas that holds great promise as a potential biofuel tree species for the future high CO2 world. © 2014 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.

AB  - The demand and potential for increasing the use of bioenergy from harvest residues in Sweden are large. However, harvest residue (branches and tops) and stump extraction negatively affect soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. The main objective of this study was to assess the effects of increased harvest residue extraction on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation at national level. Further, the reduction in CO2 by substituting coal with biofuel from harvest residues and stumps was assessed. Several scenarios with increased harvest residue extraction were simulated with the forest management system HUGIN and the SOC decomposition model Q and the effects on SOC accumulation in Swedish coniferous forest soils were assessed. All scenarios resulted in decreased SOC accumulation. The decrease in SOC accumulation was largest for stump extraction, with 0.15 Mg C ha-1y-1 loss on average over a 100-year simulation period. In all scenarios, the short-term effects on SOC accumulation were greater than the long-term effects. The effect of substituting coal with bioenergy was an immediate reduction of net CO2 emissions. An increase in the use of forest residues leads to CO2 mitigation in the atmosphere, even when SOC losses are accounted for. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent decades, environmental and economic issues have pushed the production of biofuels worldwide. In this scenario, ethanol is the most produced biofuel. Starch is a potential substrate for this purpose, but the extra cost needed to hydrolyze it into glucose is still a drawback. As an alternative for the expensive and energy demanding conventional hydrolysis process, the cold hydrolysis is being studied. In this process, granular starch degrading enzymes act directly on raw starch granules; therefore, this hydrolysis is carried out below gelatinization temperature. As a consequence, the energy requirement can be significantly reduced. In this work, the cold hydrolysis and fermentation of fresh sweet potato were experimentally studied. For that, it was employed the sweet potato strain BRS Cuia, whose carbohydrate level reaches 28.7%. It can be translated into a potential to produce 185Lt-1 ethanol, or equivalently 7400Lha-1. The enzymes blend adopted for the hydrolysis stage was Stargen™ 002. The surface response method indicated 200gL-1 of sweet potato and 45GAUg-1 of sweet potato as the best balance between high glucose formation rate and low enzyme consume. The 1h pretreatment that achieved the highest glucose concentration was at 52°C in the presence of the enzymes blend. Finally, the study of the simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation showed that the medium supplementation has no significant effect over the fermentation performance, while the pH control is beneficial, improving the ethanol production in 54%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As the production of first generation biofuels from corn or rape seed is facing severe criticism due to the perceived competition with food production, second generation biofuels made from non-food biomass are being developed to fill the gap. These can be made from lignocellulosic residues instead of agricultural products, which is commonly considered to make competition for soils and land-use change less severe. Economic competitiveness for this kind of biofuels could however not be established so far for various reasons, such as complex and expensive plant technology and the need of biomass transportation to the plant. In contrast to large fossil plants, economies of scale are overcompensated by increasing specific biomass transportation cost for large biorefineries. In order to suitably approximate these effects, a nonlinear optimization model is presented in this paper to simultaneously identify optimal plant setups and capacities. In this model, the co-production of other hydrocarbon products in addition to fuels in biorefineries through different combinations of Fischer-Tropsch product upgrading processes is considered. As the optimal plant capacity also depends on the economic value of the plant's products, several biorefinery process setups and their corresponding process-specific economies of scale are compared with regard to their economic viability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Our objective was to determine if a retention area-based Biomass Harvesting Guideline (BHG) strategy maintained desired volumes of downed woody debris (DWD) following woody biomass harvests. We implemented six randomly-assigned treatments in four clearcuts in loblolly pine plantations in the Coastal Plain physiographic region of North Carolina during 2010-2011: 1) woody biomass harvest with no BHGs (NOBHG); 2) 15% retention with woody biomass dispersed (15DISP); 3) 15% retention with woody debris clustered (15CLUS); 4) 30% retention with woody biomass dispersed (30DISP); 5) 30% retention with woody biomass clustered (30CLUS); and 6) no woody biomass harvest (i.e., clearcut only; NOBIOHARV). Prior to harvesting, we flagged 15% or 30% of the treatment area to serve as woody biomass retention sources for the four BHG treatments, and all woody biomass from the flagged area were retained and distributed across that entire treatment area. We examined effects of treatments on: 1) fraction estimated volume of pre-harvest standing volume (total and woody biomass) retained as residual DWD; and 2) fraction retained DWD in treatments 2-5 relative to retained DWD in the NOBHGS and NOBIOHARV treatments. Adding a woody biomass harvest reduced volume of residual DWD by 81% in NOBHG compared to NOBIOHARV. Estimates based on the second metric were most similar to target retentions with retention percentages at 18.8% in 15CLUS, 14.1% in 15DISP, 39.0% in 30CLUS, and 38.0% in 30DISP. Treatments resulted in retention of DWD fractions approximate to those prescribed, suggesting BHGs can be implemented successfully in an operational setting. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wheat straw has a vast potential as feedstock for biofuel production in China. However, little information is available regarding variation in cell wall composition and enzymatic digestibility of wheat straw. This study investigated cell wall compositions and biomass digestibility of the straw of 115 wheat accessions from central China using a 1% NaOH pretreatment and mixed enzymatic hydrolysis. Significant variation in cell wall composition and sugar release was observed, with a coefficient variation (CV) ranging from 4.7% to 21.2%. Cellulose, hemicelluloses, alkali detergent hemicelluloses (ADH), and acid insoluble lignin (AIL) positively correlated with each other, and they all negatively correlated with acid soluble lignin (ASL). Hexose yields had a negative correlation with ADH and AIL, and positive correlation with ASL. No apparent undesirable correlation was found between sugar release and grain yield, thus yield and biomass convertibility can be potentially improved simultaneously. Furthermore, the features of the cell wall constitutions were compared with other plants and their implication in determining the best possible conversion strategy was discussed. This initial study is essential to understand the cell wall composition of wheat straw and to explore the potential of wheat straw as feedstock for biofuel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper provides a critical review of the palm biodiesel landscape in Malaysia. The palm industry is a key source of revenue for the country, where in 2009 the industry was responsible for generating 8% of the gross national income per capita. The interest in palm-based biodiesel can be traced back to the early 1980s however it was only in 2006 that Malaysia officially formulated its first National Biofuel Policy as a strategic government intervention to drive development and implementation of palm biodiesel as substitute to regular fossil-based diesel. As at January 2013, the implementation of the biodiesel mandate (at 5% concentration) has been limited to the Klang Valley central region only. But there are plans for a much wider roll-out and at higher concentration blends in 2014. The policy in its current form assumes that all biofuels are sustainable and therefore fails to provide assurances that the fossil diesel will be replaced by a more sustainable energy source. Here it has been argued that a market-based policy approach would be better than a technology-forcing mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hybrid pennisetum (Pennisetum americanum × P. purpureum) is a popular energy grass with great potential for biofuel production. The objective of this research was to understand the effects of various cultivation strategies on the yield of hybrid pennisetum when growing in saline soil. The effects of plastic mulching, planting density, organic amendment, and additional fertilizer application on the yield and other characteristics of hybrid pennisetum were investigated in a 2-yr field study conducted on the saline land of the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that mulching markedly increased the growth by reducing soil salinity and increasing soil moisture and soil temperature. Yield increased with plant density, and the highest yield (151.4 tons ha−1) was obtained with 27,778 plants ha−1. Plant growth also increased as organic amendment level increased from 0 to 1500 kg ha−1 and with addition of urea (applied when plant height was 80 cm and 150 cm). The abundance of culturable soil microorganisms was increased by the above cultivation measures. It can be concluded that suitable cultivation measures such as mulching, plant density, and application of organic and inorganic fertilizers, which were examined independently, greatly increased the biomass of hybrid pennisetum growing in a saline soil on the Yellow River Delta. The highest yield of hybrid pennisetum obtained was 175.3 tons ha−1. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Although biofuels have the potential for mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security, controversy regarding their overall environmental sustainability is considered a significant bottleneck in their development at both global and EU levels. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to model the current and prospective environmental profiles for poplar-derived bioethanol across various potential EU supply chains (different poplar plantation management, different pretreatment technologies for bioethanol production, five EU locations). LCA modelling indicated that E100 (100% bioethanol) and E85 (85% bioethanol, 15% petrol) fuels derived from Poplar from various locations in the EU had environmental impact scores some 10% to 90% lower than petrol in global warming potential, abiotic depletion potential, ozone depletion potential and photochemical oxidation potential depending upon the exact poplar supply chain and conversion technology modelled. Hybrid poplar clones with higher biomass yields, modified composition and improved cell wall accessibility had a clear potential to deliver a more environmentally sustainable lignocellulosic biorefining industry with environmental scores some 50% lower than with conventional poplar feedstocks. A particular aspect of the present study that warrants further research is the contribution that soil carbon accumulation can make to achieving low-GHG fuels in the future. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

AB  - Biofuel made from conventional (e.g., maize (Zea mays L.)) and cellulosic crops (e.g., switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus)) provides alternative energy to fossil fuels and has been considered to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. To estimate the large-scale carbon and nitrogen dynamics of these biofuel ecosystems, process-based models are needed. Here, we developed an agroecosystem model (AgTEM) based on the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model for these ecosystems. The model was incorporated with biogeochemical and ecophysiological processes including crop phenology, biomass allocation, nitrification, and denitrification, as well as agronomic management of irrigation and fertilization. It was used to estimate crop yield, biomass, net carbon exchange, and nitrous oxide emissions at an ecosystem level. The model was first parameterized for maize, switchgrass, and Miscanthus ecosystems and then validated with field observation data. We found that AgTEM well reproduces the annual net primary production and nitrous oxide fluxes of most sites, with over 85% of total variation explained by the model. Local sensitivity analysis indicated that the model sensitivity varies among different ecosystems. Net primary production of maize is sensitive to temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, fertilizer, and irrigation and less sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In contrast, the net primary production of switchgrass and Miscanthus is most sensitive to temperature among all factors. Nitrous oxide fluxes are sensitive to management in maize ecosystems, and sensitive to climate factors in cellulosic ecosystems. The developed model should help advance our understanding of carbon and nitrogen dynamics of these biofuel ecosystems at both site and regional levels. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Information on genome size, ploidy level, and genomic polymorphisms among accessions of the genus Miscanthus can assist in taxonomic studies, help understand the evolution of the genus, and provide valuable information to biomass crop improvement programs. Taxonomic investigation combining variation in plant morphology, genome size, chromosome numbers, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker polymorphisms were applied to characterize 101 Miscanthus accessions. A total of 258 amplicons generated from 17 informative SSR primer pairs was subjected to cluster and principal coordinate analysis and used to characterize genetic variation and relationships among 31 Miscanthus accessions, including four interspecific Miscanthus hybrids created from controlled pollinations, and four Saccharum, six Erianthus, and one Sorghum bicolor accessions. Miscanthus accessions were distinct from accessions in the genera Erianthus and Saccharum. Miscanthus accessions fell into five taxonomic groups, including the existing taxonomic section Miscanthus, diploid and tetraploid Miscanthus sacchariflorus, and a fourth (M. × giganteus) and fifth group (Miscanthus 'purpurascens'); the last two being intermediate forms. In contrast to previous work, our findings suggest diploid and tetraploid M. sacchariflorus are taxonomically different, the latter more closely related to M. sacchariflorus var lutarioriparius. We also suggest that Miscanthus 'purpurascens' accessions are interspecific hybrids between Miscanthus sinensis and diploid M. sacchariflorus based on DNA content and SSR polymorphisms. The evolution of Miscanthus and related genera is discussed based on combined analysis and geographical origin. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article assesses the potential of California agriculture to supply biofuel feedstock in the form of switchgrass. We construct a fully calibrated, multiregion, multi-input and multioutput model of agricultural supply for California's Central Valley based on the principles of positive mathematical programming. We exploit agronomic information obtained from a biophysical model to estimate regional production functions for switchgrass. The model predicts the extent and location of potential feedstock production in the Central Valley. Our results suggest that switchgrass adoption rates differ widely among agricultural regions, and that switchgrass is not likely to displace specialty crops by much statewide. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The Nobel environmental productivity index (EPI) was used as a framework for the development of a predictive geospatial model to estimate the bioethanol yield potential of four crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) candidates in Australia (Agave fourcroydes, Agave salmiana, Agave tequilana, and Opuntia ficus-indica). GIS software was used to integrate climate datasets with titratable acidity responses to changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, and water availability. Additional refinements to Nobel's approach were made to accommodate spatial and temporal fluctuations in soil water potential (ψs) as a function of soil particle size distribution and precipitation, and CO2 uptake response to a range of day and night temperatures. A scalar factor for CO2 persistence during periods of drought was also introduced to model the capacity of succulent species of Agave to buffer against fluctuations in ψs. Macro-scale criteria were applied to estimate environmentally responsible (ER) bioethanol yield potential on lands that are not suitable for food production. Consideration was given to indigenous vascular plant species richness and endemism scores at ER sites of interest. The highest mean ER bioethanol yield was achieved by A. fourcroydes (μ: 3.89, max. 7.17 kL ha-1 yr-1) while the highest maximum yield was achieved by A. tequilana (μ: 3.78, max. 7.63 kL ha-1 yr-1). This research indicated the CAM pathway may produce significant yields (≥≥ 5 kL ha-1 yr-1) at ER sites totalling 57,700 km2 (0.7% land area of Australia). © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Palm pressed fiber (PPF) and cattle manure (CM) are the waste which can be managed properly by anaerobic co-digestion. The biogas production in co-digested PPF and CM at three volatile solids (VS) ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 was investigated in a series of batch experiments at an organic loading rate of 30.0g VS/L under mesophilic (37±1°C) conditions. The highest daily biogas yield of PPF and CM only, was 90.0mL/g VSadded at day 12 and 23.4mL/g VSadded at day 7. For co-digestion of PPF/CM at mixing ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, there were 93.6mL/g VSadded at day 11, 86.8 and 26.4mL/g VSadded at day 8. VS removal rate for PPF, CM, and co-digestion at mixing ratio of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 were 91.1%, 86.0% and 71.0%, respectively. The anaerobic digestion of PPF and CM and their co-digestion systems were stable in operation with low range of volatile fatty acids (VFA)/TIC (total inorganic carbon) of (0.035-0.091). The main volatile fatty acids were propionic, and iso-butyric acids for PPF, iso-butyric and n-butyric acids for CM. The VFAs and ammonium inhibition were not occurred. The modified Gompertz model can be used to perform a better prediction with a lower difference between the measured and predicted biogas yields. A VS ratio of 3:1 is recommended for practice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gaseous emissions are an important problem in municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants. The sources points of emissions considered in the present work are: fresh compost, mature compost, landfill leaks and leachate ponds. Hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analysed in the emissions from these sources. Hydrogen sulphide and ammonia were important contributors to the total emission volume. Landfill leaks are significant source points of emissions of H2S; the average concentration of H2S in biogas from the landfill leaks is around 1700ppmv. The fresh composting site was also an important contributor of H2S to the total emission volume; its concentration varied between 3.2 and 1.7ppmv and a decrease with time was observed. The mature composting site showed a reduction of H2S concentration (&lt;0.1ppmv). Leachate pond showed a low concentration of H2S (in order of ppbv). Regarding NH3, composting sites and landfill leaks are notable source points of emissions (composting sites varied around 30-600ppmv; biogas from landfill leaks varied from 160 to 640ppmv).Regarding VOCs, the main compounds were: limonene, p-cymene, pinene, cyclohexane, reaching concentrations around 0.2-4.3. ppmv.H2S/NH3, limonene/p-cymene, limonene/cyclohexane ratios can be useful for analysing and identifying the emission sources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biogas production from animal slurry can provide substantial contributions to reach renewable energy targets, yet due to the low methane potential of slurry, biogas plants depend on the addition of co-substrates to make operations profitable. The environmental performance of three underexploited co-substrates, straw, organic household waste and the solid fraction of separated slurry, were assessed against slurry management without biogas production, using LCA methodology. The analysis showed straw, which would have been left on arable fields, to be an environmentally superior co-substrate. Due to its low nutrient content and high methane potential, straw yields the lowest impacts for eutrophication and the highest climate change and fossil depletion savings. Co-substrates diverted from incineration to biogas production had fewer environmental benefits, due to the loss of energy production, which is then produced from conventional fossil fuels. The scenarios can often provide benefits for one impact category while causing impacts in another. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integrated ecological and economic solutions are increasingly sought after by communities to provide basic energy needs such as home heating, transport, and electricity, while reducing drivers of and vulnerability to climate change. Small rural communities may require a coordinated approach to overcome the limitations of economies of scale. Low-carbon development strategies present potential for large payoffs at a household and community scale. Southeast Alaskan forests previously harvested for timber are currently re-growing and require thinning to maintain ecosystem service benefits such as wildlife habitat and hunting. Thinned material presents a potential biofuel source. However, without verification among decision alternatives, communities may not have the momentum, vision, or conviction to stimulate a shift to a new energy source. We present a network approach to evaluating multiple energy delivery pathways, and a calculation of carbon, energy, and dollar savings presented by each pathway. We quantify chain of production impacts; from the point of energy extraction and transport (upstream), through consumption and emission accounting (downstream). Our findings suggest substantial greenhouse gas emission savings of over 70% as well as heating cost savings for all bioenergy scenarios compared to fossil fuel scenarios. Outputs can facilitate dialog between land managers, planners, community members and decision-makers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper critically examines the sociotechnical imaginaries of second-generation bioenergy technology in the global debate, exemplified by the deliberations of international organizations specializing in food and agriculture, energy security, and climate change. The analysis is guided by two objectives: first, to identify and illuminate visions of future advanced biofuels by implementing the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries; second, to scrutinize these imaginaries using a critical and diagnostic utopian method to determine whether the projected visions entail the promise of radical change and hope for socioeconomic transition to a "green" future, or instead manifest an ideological stranglehold striving to perpetuate the status quo. The article demonstrates that sociotechnical imaginaries of advanced biofuel technology superficially project the illusion of utopian potential. On closer examination, however, visions of future second-generation biofuels are limited by the necessity of cost-effectiveness that underpins market competitiveness. They manifest utopian impotence to imagine the future beyond the ideological closure of the currently dominant socioeconomic system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare the types and levels of volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) present in biogas generated in the anaerobic digesters and landfills, evaluate the energetics of siloxane transformations under anaerobic conditions, compare the conditions in anaerobic digesters and municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills which result in differences in siloxane compositions. Biogas samples were collected at the South District Wastewater Treatment Plant and South Dade Landfill in Miami, Florida. In the digester gas, D4 and D5 comprised the bulk of total siloxanes (62% and 27%, respectively) whereas in the landfill gas, the bulk of siloxanes were trimethylsilanol (TMSOH) (58%) followed by D4 (17%). Presence of high levels of TMSOH in the landfill gas indicates that methane utilization may be a possible reaction mechanism for TMSOH formation. The free energy change for transformation of D5 and D4 to TMSOH either by hydrogen or methane utilization are thermodynamically favorable. Either hydrogen or methane should be present at relatively high concentrations for TMSOH formation which explains the high levels present in the landfill gas. The high bond energy and bond distance of the Si-O bond, in view of the atomic sizes of Si and O atoms, indicate that Si atoms can provide a barrier, making it difficult to break the Si-O bonds especially for molecules with specific geometric configurations such as D4 and D5 where oxygen atoms are positioned inside the frame formed by the large Si atoms which are surrounded by the methyl groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil Government is promoting palm plantations to use degraded land for biofuels. Palm production is expected to increase 35 per cent in future and there would be profuse biomass available that needs to be handled efficiently. Therefore, in this study the potential of EFB from Brazil as raw material for biorefinery was explored by compositional analysis and pretreatment conditions optimization to produce ethanol and co-products. EFB from Brazil contains significant cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and low ash content. The optimized dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment conditions for efficient cellulose and hemicellulose separation were 160. °C temperature, 1.025% v/v acid concentration, 10.5. min and 20% solid loading. Under optimum pretreatment process conditions, low enzyme loading (10. FPU, 20. IU cellulase and glucosidase enzyme/g glucan) and 15% solid loading, 51.1. g ethanol, 344.1. g solid residue (65% lignin and 24.87. MJ/kg LHV) and 3.7. l xylose rich liquid could be produced per kg dry EFB. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intensively managed forests in the southeastern United States are a potential source of cellulosic bioenergy and, as conversion technologies improve and demand increases, a greater land area may be required to produce biofuel feedstocks. However, responses of wildlife to forest-based biofuel production are largely unknown. We examined the 4-year response of rodent populations and assemblages to a range of biofuel production regimes, including harvesting residual woody debris and intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in an intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest in eastern North Carolina, USA. We investigated abundance, demography, and community response of rodents in a randomized and replicated field experiment using mark-recapture techniques during 2009-2012. Whereas removal of downed woody biomass did not affect abundance, diversity, or demography of rodents, we detected species-specific effects of incorporating switchgrass. After switchgrass was well established, invasive house mice (Mus musculus) were most abundant in plots with switchgrass. In contrast, white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were commonly captured in plots without switchgrass and other rodents were not affected by biofuel treatments. Across the study, natural succession exerted greater effects on rodent species and the rodent community than biofuel production regimes. As remaining logs and stumps decay and become limiting, downed wood may become more important to rodents. Our results indicate that intercropping switchgrass and harvesting residual woody material had limited effects on rodents in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA within 4 years of stand establishment. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.

AB  - This study develops a model of crop residue (i.e. stover) supply and derived demand for irrigation water accounting for non-linear effects of soil organic matter on soil's water holding capacity. The model is calibrated for typical conditions in central Nebraska, United States, and identifies potential interactions between water and biofuel policies. The price offered for feedstock by a cost-minimizing plant facing that stover supply response is calculated. Results indicate that as biofuel production volumes increase, soil carbon depletion per unit of biofuel produced decreases. Consumption of groundwater per unit of biofuel produced first decreases and then increases (after a threshold of 363dam3 of biofuels per year) due to plants' increased reliance on the extensive margin for additional biomass. The analysis reveals a tension between biofuel and water policies. As biofuel production raises the economic benefits of relaxing water conservation policies (measured by the "shadow price" of water) increase. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wood pellet production has increased hugely in recent years from 7 to 19 million tons in the period 2006-2012, mainly due to the demand created by policies and bioenergy use targets in Europe. Italy is one of the most important importers for domestic heating application and the Italian market can be considered a good subject to estimate the efficacy of quality standards and certification application. The assessment of the quality of wood pellet sold in the market and how the information reported on bag reflect the quality of the product has been carried out during a three-year period. Characterisation analyses and collection of data regarding information reported on bags such as characterisation results, ash class, wood species, certifications, and standard references have been carried out. Results have been statistically evaluated. More than half of samples fulfill the requirements of the A1 class of EN 14961-2 standard, related to the higher quality pellets. Certification, like ENplus and DINplus, appears to be appropriated to guarantee for a high quality of pellet sold in the market. Ash content alone could be a good representative parameter for a first, rapid quality assessment. Ash content results significantly lower in coniferous pellet than in broadleaf one. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase family 11 (GH11) xylanases and xylanases have been identified from Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans. In contrast, little is known about the diversity and distribution of the GH10 xylanase in strains of P. xylanivorans. Xylanase and associated activities of P. xylanivorans have been characterized in detail in the type strain, Mz5. The aim of the present study was to identify GH10 xylanase genes in strains 2 and Mz5 of P. xylanivorans. In addition, we evaluated degradation and utilization of xylan by P. xylanivorans 2 isolated from rumen of Creole goats. After a 12-h culture, P. xylanivorans 2 was able to utilize up to 53 % of the total pentose content present in birchwood xylan (BWX) and to utilize up to 62 % of a ethanol-acetic acid-soluble fraction prepared from BWX. This is the first report describing the presence of GH10 xylanase-encoding genes in P. xylanivorans. Strain 2 and Mz5 contained xylanases which were related to GH10 xylanase of Butyrivibrio sp. Identifying xylanase-encoding genes and activity of these enzymes are a step toward understanding possible functional role of P. xylanivorans in the rumen ecosystem and contribute to providing an improved choice of enzymes for improving fiber digestion in ruminant animals, agricultural biomass utilization for biofuel production, and other industries. © 2014, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

AB  - Reed canary grass (RCG) is a perennial grass traditionally cultivated for forage. It is also used as fuel to produce energy in Finland and Sweden, and other countries have expressed interest in the cultivation of RCG. In China, arable land is limited. Salinity is considered to be a major factor limiting plant crop development and productivity. To boost biofuel production of RCG and extend its range in saline soil, we seek to improve its salt tolerance. Proline acts as an osmolyte that accumulates when plants are subjected to abiotic stress. P5CS plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis. We isolated a P5CS gene from RCG, designated B231P5CS (GenBank accession No. JQ622685). B231P5CS is a fragment (971 bp) that encodes a 323-amino acid polypeptide. We also cloned an actin gene fragment from RCG as a reference gene in expression analysis of B231P5CS gene. Expression analysis revealed that B231P5CS transcripts were upregulated in leaves after treatment with salt (200 mM NaCl) and that transcript levels of B231P5CS reached a maximum 12 h after exposure, which was 14.69 times the level in control plants. The trends of expression were exactly opposite in roots; transcripts were downregulated after salt treatment. Proline concentration increased in leaves after stress. In contrast, proline content of roots decreased up to 3.6-fold relative to controls. Changes in proline concentration after stress were correlated with B231P5CS expression. Our results suggest that B231P5CS is a stress-inducible gene and plays a non-redundant role in plant development. This gene may be used to improve stress tolerance of RGC and other bioenergy feedstock. © FUNPEC-RP.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L.) is a potential dedicated biomass crop for use in biocatalytic conversion systems to biofuels. Nearly 30% of switchgrass cell wall material is xylan. The complete depolymerization of xylan is desirable both as an additional carbon source for microbial fermentation and to reduce inhibitory effects xylooligomers may have on cellulolytic glycoside hydrolase enzymes. To identify structural features of switchgrass xylan that are not distinguishable by mass spectrometry alone, a α-arabinofuranosidase enzyme was used to remove the arabinose side chains from alkali-extracted switchgrass xylan from three cultivars with simultaneous hydrolysis by β-endo-xylanase to enrich for oligosaccharide products with extended branching. The two most abundant enzymatic digestion products were separated and characterized by LC-MSn, linkage analysis, and NMR. These two oligosaccharides were present in all three switchgrass cultivars and found to contain (1→2)-β-xylose-(1→3)-α-arabinose side chains, a linkage not previously reported in switchgrass. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Paper sludge is an attractive biomass source for the conversion to ethanol due to its low cost and the lack of severe pretreatment required. Four sludges from pulp and paper operations including both virgin kraft (VK) and recycled and deinking (RD) paper mills were analyzed. A fractionation process using a laboratory screen was utilized to produce a fiber-rich stream for enzymatic hydrolysis. This process removed 82–98 % of the ash with fiber yields from 39 to 69 %. Even though sludges in both non-fractionated and fractionated scenarios were pH-adjusted, total sugar conversion was still improved by 12–27 % by fractionation with 4.5 times less acid required for pH adjustment. Fermentation of the fractionated sludges showed very high ethanol yields. Acid insoluble clay adsorbs 3–5 mg enzyme per gram of clay depending on enzyme dosage. Acid soluble CaCO3 adsorbs about half of the enzyme compared to clay. Fractionation efficiency was also evaluated by testing different size mesh screen openings (100 to 500 mesh). The 400-mesh screen presented the best fiber yield, ash removal and ash fractionation ratio for both VK and RD sludges. The ash-rich streams have a lower C/N ratio than the original sludge which improves its suitability as soil amendment. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Because of increasing demands for bioenergy, a considerable amount of land in the midwestern United States could be devoted to the cultivation of second-generation bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass and miscanthus. The foliar carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) in these bioenergy crops at harvest is significantly higher than the ratios in replaced crops, such as corn or soybean. We show that there is a critical soil organic matter C/N ratio, where microbial biomass can be impaired as microorganisms become dependent upon net immobilization. The simulation results show that there is a threshold effect in the amount of aboveground litter input in the soil after harvest that will reach a critical organic matter C/N ratio in the soil, triggering a reduction of the soil microbial population, with significant consequences in other microbe-related processes, such as decomposition and mineralization. These thresholds are approximately 25 and 15% of aboveground biomass for switchgrass and miscanthus, respectively. These results suggest that values above these thresholds could result in a significant reduction of decomposition and mineralization, which, in turn, would enhance the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the topsoil and reduce inorganic nitrogen losses when compared to a corn-corn-soybean rotation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work assessed the environmental impacts of the production and use of 1 MJ of hydrous ethanol (E100) in Brazil in prospective scenarios (2020-2030), considering the deployment of technologies currently under development and better agricultural practices. The life cycle assessment technique was employed using the CML method for the life cycle impact assessment and the Monte Carlo method for the uncertainty analysis. Abiotic depletion, global warming, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication were the environmental impacts categories analyzed. Results indicate that the proposed improvements (especially no-til farming-scenarios s2 and s4) would lead to environmental benefits in prospective scenarios compared to the current ethanol production (scenario s0). Combined first and second generation ethanol production (scenarios s3 and s4) would require less agricultural land but would not perform better than the projected first generation ethanol, although the uncertainties are relatively high. The best use of 1 ha of sugar cane was also assessed, considering the displacement of the conventional products by ethanol and electricity. No-til practices combined with the production of first generation ethanol and electricity (scenario s2) would lead to the largest mitigation effects for global warming and abiotic depletion. For the remaining categories, emissions would not be mitigated with the utilization of the sugar cane products. However, this conclusion is sensitive to the displaced electricity sources. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Policies addressing climate change are driving major transformations in access to global land, forests and water as they create new ‘green’ markets that reinforce, and attracts the financial grid and its speculators. This leads us to examine the rise of state violence and subsequent environmental policies in forests, transferring into both ‘fortress’ and ‘participatory’ conservation, enhancing this relationship with new environmental commodity markets. We go on to document how the new and intensifying commodification of the environment associated with climate change is manifest in conflicts linked to the UN-REDD+ programme, industrial tree plantations (ITPs), and land-use practices associated with conservation and biofuels. We trace conflicts to business practices associated with land acquisitions and mining practices which claim to address climate change and mitigate ecological crises. This paper thus grapples with systemic issues of the modern industrial economy and the mechanisms legitimising and advancing the militarisation and marketisation of nature. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article describes the development of a geographic information systems (GIS) based biomass transport analysis tool BIT-UU used in combination with the European renewable energy model Green-X. BIT-UU calculates cost and GHG emissions from lowest cost routes, using intermodal transport (by road, rail, inland waterways and sea) between origins of supply and demand destinations. With the developed biomass trade module in Green-X, the role of bioenergy can be evaluated in the larger context of renewable energy deployment. The modeling framework takes into account the current and future energy policies at EU and country levels, competition with alternative sources of renewable energy (e.g. photovoltaic, wind) and sectors (electricity, heat, transport fuels) as well as competition between EU member states for the same biomass resources. Scenario projections to 2020 are used to demonstrate the developed modeling framework. According to these scenarios, biomass from domestic supply remains the most important source of bioenergy (91-93% in 2020). However, the role of traded solid biomass will become increasingly important. With a business as usual scenario, assuming continuation of current renewable energy policies to 2020, the binding renewable energy targets will not be achieved, but trade of solid biomass will still increase up to 451. PJ in 2020. In the scenario that meets the conditions to achieve the 20% renewable energy target in 2020, traded solid biomass is projected to increase to 440. PJ if sustainability criteria are applied (minimum GHG saving) and 506. PJ without these sustainability regulations. Because imports of solid biomass from outside the EU are projected to become larger than intra-EU trade in the scenarios, the scenarios show the importance of improving the representation of extra-EU biomass sources and trade in the modeling framework. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Because the potential impacts of emissions and extractions can be sensitive to timing, the temporal aggregation of life cycle inventory (LCI) data has often been cited as a limitation in life cycle assessment (LCA). Until now, examples of temporal emission and extraction distributions were restricted to the foreground processes of product systems. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of considering the temporal distribution of the background system inventory.
Methods: The paper focuses on the global warming impact category for which so-called dynamic characterization factors (CFs) were developed and uses the ecoinvent v2.2 database as both an example database to which temporal information can be added and a source of product systems to test the relevance of adding temporal information to the background system. Temporal information was added to the elementary and intermediate exchanges of 22 % of the unit processes in the database. Using the enhanced structure path analysis (ESPA) method to generate temporally differentiated LCIs in conjunction with time-dependent global warming characterization factors, potential impacts were calculated for all 4,034 product systems in the ecoinvent database.
Results and discussion: Each time, the results were calculated for (1) systems in which temporal information was only added to the first two tiers, representing studies in which only the foreground system is temporally differentiated, and (2) systems in which temporal information was also added to the background system. For 8.6 % of the database product systems, adding temporal differentiation to background unit processes affected the global warming impact scores by more than 10 %. For most of the affected product systems, considering temporal information in the background unit processes decreased the global warming impact scores. The sectors that show most sensitivity to the temporal differentiation of background unit processes are associated with wood and biofuel sectors.
Conclusions: Even though the addition of temporal information to unit processes in LCI databases would not benefit every LCA study, the enhancement can be relevant. It allows for a more accurate global warming impact assessment, especially for LCAs in which products of biomass are present in substantial amounts. Relevance for other impact categories could be discussed in further work. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of possibilities for electrical energy production by using municipal solid waste disposed in the biggest Brazilian cities. Currently, the municipal solid waste in Brazil is collected and disposed of at landfills, but there are also other technologies, which in addition to dealing with the garbage can also provide benefits in terms of energy provision. The following scenarios were studied in this work: electricity production from landfill gas (reference scenario); incineration of all municipal solid waste; anaerobic digestion of organic waste and incineration of refuse-derived fuel fractions after being separated in separation plants. According to this study, the biggest cities in Brazil generate about 18.9 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per year (2011), of which 51.5% is biogenic matter. The overall domestic consumption of electricity is 480,120 GWhy-1 in Brazil and the municipal solid waste incineration in the 16 largest cities in the country could replace 1.8% of it using incinerators. The city of São Paulo could produce 637 GWhy-1 with landfill gas, 2368 GWhy-1 with incineration of municipal solid waste and 1177 GWhy-1 with incineration of refuse-derived fuel. The latter two scenarios could replace 27% and 13.5% of the residential electrical energy consumption in the city. This shows that thermal treatment might be a viable option of waste-to-energy in Brazil. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - As jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is a recent crop in Brazil, the studies for defining its suitability for different regions are not yet available, even considering the promises about this plant as of high potential for marginal zones where poor soils and dry climate occur. Based on that, the present study had as objective to characterize the climatic conditions of jatropha’s center of origin in Central America for establishing its climatic requirements and to develop the agro-climatic zoning for this crop for some Brazilian regions where, according to the literature, it would be suitable. For classifying the climatic conditions of the jatropha’s center of origin, climate data from 123 weather stations located in Mexico (93) and in Guatemala (30) were used. These data were input for Thornthwaite and Mather’s climatological water balance for determining the annual water deficiency (WD) and water surplus (WS) of each location, considering a soil water-holding capacity (SWHC) of 100 mm. Mean annual temperature (Tm), WD, and WS data were organized in histograms for defining the limits of suitability for jatropha cultivation. The results showed that the suitable range of Tm for jatropha cultivation is between 23 and 27 °C. Tm between 15 and 22.9 °C and between 27.1 and 28 °C were classified as marginal by thermal deficiency and excess, respectively. Tm below 15 °C and above 28 °C were considered as unsuitable for jatropha cultivation, respectively, by risk of frosts and physiological disturbs. For WD, suitability for rain-fed jatropha cultivation was considered when its value is below 360 mm, while between 361 and 720 mm is considered as marginal and over 720 mm unsuitable. The same order of suitability was also defined for WS, with the following limits: suitable for WS up to 1,200 mm; marginal for WS between 1,201 and 2,400 mm, and unsuitable for WS above 2,400 mm. For the crop zoning, the criteria previously defined were applied to 1,814 climate stations in the following Brazilian regions: Northeast (NE) region and the states of Goiás (GO), Tocantins (TO), and Minas Gerais (MG). The suitability maps were generated by crossing the crop climate requirements with the interpolated climate conditions of the selected regions. The maps showed that only 22.65 % of the areas in the NE region are suitable for jatropha as a rain-fed crop. The other areas of the region are classified as marginal (62.61 %) and unsuitable (14.74 %). In the states of GO and TO, the majority of the areas (47.78 %) is classified as suitable, and in the state of MG, 33.92 % of the territory has suitability for the crop. These results prove that jatropha cannot be cultivated everywhere and will require, as any other crop, minimum climatic conditions to have sustainable performance and high yields. © 2014, ISB.

AB  - Pyranose 2-oxidase (POx), a member of the GMC family of flavoproteins, catalyzes the regioselective oxidation of aldopyranoses at position C2 to the corresponding 2-ketoaldoses. During the first half-reaction, FAD is reduced to FADH2 and reoxidized in the second half-reaction by reducing molecular oxygen to H2O2. Alternative electron acceptors including quinones, radicals or chelated metal ions show significant and in some cases even higher activity. While oxygen as cheap and abundantly available electron acceptor is favored for many processes, reduced oxygen reactivity is desirable for some applications such as in biosensors/biofuel cells because of reduced oxidative damages to the biocatalyst from concomitant H2O2 production as well as reduced electron "leakage" to oxygen. The reactivity of flavoproteins with oxygen is of considerable scientific interest, and the determinants of oxygen activation and reactivity are the subject of numerous studies. We applied site-saturation mutagenesis on a set of eleven amino acids around the active site based on the crystal structure of the enzyme. Using microtiter plate screening assays with peroxidase/2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, variants of POx with decreased oxidase activity and maintained dehydrogenase activity were identified. Variants T166R, Q448H, L545C, L547R and N593C were characterized with respect to their apparent steady-state constants with oxygen and the alternative electron acceptors DCPIP, 1,4-benzoquinone and ferricenium ion, and the effect of the mutations was rationalized based on structural properties. © 2014 Brugger et al.

AB  - The inclusion of ecotoxicity impacts of pesticides in environmental assessments of biobased products has long been hampered by methodological challenges. We expanded the pesticide database and the regional coverage of the pesticide emission model PestLCI v.2.0, combined it with the impact assessment model USEtox, and assessed potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts (PFEIs) of pesticide use in selected biofuel feedstock production cases, namely: maize (Iowa, US, two cases), rapeseed (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany), Salix (South Central Sweden), soybean (Mato Grosso, Brazil, two cases), sugar cane (São Paulo, Brazil), and wheat (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany). We found that PFEIs caused by pesticide use in feedstock production varied greatly, up to 3 orders of magnitude. Salix has the lowest PFEI per unit of energy output and per unit of cultivated area. Impacts per biofuel unit were 30, 750, and 1000 times greater, respectively, for the sugar cane, wheat and rapeseed cases than for Salix. For maize genetically engineered (GE) to resist glyphosate herbicides and to produce its own insecticidal toxin, maize GE to resist glyphosate, soybeans GE to resist glyphosate and conventional soybeans, the impacts were 110, 270, 305, and 310 times greater than for Salix, respectively. The significance of field and site-specific conditions are discussed, as well as options for reducing negative impacts in biofuel feedstock production. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Likely changes in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) resulting from policy-driven expansion of bioenergy crops in the United States are shown to create significant changes in streamflow volumes and increase water stress in the High Plains. Regional climate simulations for current and biofuel cropping system scenarios are evaluated using the same atmospheric forcing data over the period 1979-2004 using the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model coupled to the NOAH land surface model. PET is projected to increase under the biofuel crop production scenario. The magnitude of the mean annual increase in PET is larger than the inter-annual variability of change in PET, indicating that PET increase is a forced response to the biofuel cropping system land use. Across the conterminous U.S., the change in mean streamflow volume under the biofuel scenario is estimated to range from negative 56% to positive 20% relative to a business-as-usual baseline scenario. In Kansas and Oklahoma, annual streamflow volume is reduced by an average of 20%, and this reduction in streamflow volume is due primarily to increased PET. Predicted increase in mean annual P under the biofuel crop production scenario is lower than its inter-annual variability, indicating that additional simulations would be necessary to determine conclusively whether predicted change in P is a response to biofuel crop production. Although estimated changes in streamflow volume include the influence of P change, sensitivity results show that PET change is the significantly dominant factor causing streamflow change. Higher PET and lower streamflow due to biofuel feedstock production are likely to increase water stress in the High Plains. When pursuing sustainable biofuels policy, decision-makers should consider the impacts of feedstock production on water scarcity. © 2014 Khanal et al.

AB  - Biodiesel is increasingly considered as an alternative for fossil diesel. Biodiesel can be produced from rapeseed, palm, sunflower, soybean and algae. In this study, the consequences of large-scale production of biodiesel from micro-algae for eutrophication in four large European seas are analysed. To this end, scenarios for the year 2050 are analysed, assuming that in the 27 countries of the European Union fossil diesel will be replaced by biodiesel from algae. Estimates are made for the required fertiliser inputs to algae parks, and how this may increase concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in coastal waters, potentially leading to eutrophication. The Global NEWS (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) model has been used to estimate the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus to the European coastal waters. The results indicate that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the coastal waters may increase considerably in the future as a result of large-scale production of algae for the production of biodiesel, even in scenarios assuming effective waste water treatment and recycling of waste water in algae production. To ensure sustainable production of biodiesel from micro-algae, it is important to develop cultivation systems with low nutrient losses to the environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: This paper analyses the relationships between the European Commission's legal and political instruments and the changing spatialities of European Union (EU) biofuel development. This interlinkage of law, policy and space are examined through the conceptual lens of assemblages. Originally, despite the multiple pathways to produce biofuels presented by the Commission, the topology of EU development became regionally clustered around European agricultural actors. Resulting from the fast growth of biofuels consumption in the EU, these localized assemblages later became connected with international networks of trading crop-based ethanol and biodiesel. Vis-a-vis this growth, topologically fluid consequences such as indirect land-use changes have begun to influence the dynamics of EU biofuel development. Concurrently, the Commission's mode of steering has transformed from strategies and incentives into regulation that is increasingly geared towards instruments of carbon calculation. With these instruments, the Commission has begun to reorient the assemblage from its agricultural roots towards alternatives with lower land-use impacts. However, this paper argues that there is a need to strengthen the steering of biofuels with topologically sensitive instruments in order to cope with the complex dynamics of the localized assemblages of biofuels production. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The agricultural landscape of the United States could soon be changed by planting of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars to meet governmentmandated targets for lignocellulosic bioenergy production and consumption. This alteration could affect the genetic structure of wild switchgrass populations, which are native to the eastern half of North America through cultivar introgression. In this study, PCR amplification of microsatellite fragments as well as chloroplast gene-specific markers were utilized to quantify the genetic diversity and structure of five native populations and three agronomic fields (hereafter ‘populations’) planted with switchgrass cultivars. Microsatellite polymorphism across all the switchgrass populations ranged from 91.4 to 100%. Overall, natural switchgrass populations had significantly higher mean genetic diversity than agronomic switchgrass cultivars (0.262 ± 0.102 and 0.201 ± 0.082 respectively, t test p &lt; 0.008). Natural switchgrass populations had significantly higher total genetic diversity within (HS) and among (HT) as compared to agronomic switchgrass cultivars. A clear separation of natural and agronomic switchgrass populations was noted using principal component analysis and STRUCTURE analysis. A grouping pattern similar to that obtained in the microsatellite study was observed when chloroplast nucleotide sequence variation was assessed. In the realm of bioenergy sustainability, our results highlight the need to consider the genetic structure of cultivars for bioenergy when they are grown in proximity to native switchgrass populations. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - Population growth, dietary changes, and increasing biofuel use are placing unprecedented pressure on the global food system. While this demand likely cannot be met by expanding agricultural lands, much of the world's cropland can attain higher crop yields. Therefore, it is important to examine whether increasing crop productivity to the maximum attainable yield (i.e., yield gap closure) alone can substantially improve food security at global and national scales. Here we show that closing yield gaps through conventional technological development (i.e., fertilizers and irrigation) can potentially meet future global demand if diets are moderated and crop-based biofuel production is limited. In particular, we find that increases in dietary demand will be largely to blame should crop production fall short of demand. In converting projected diets to a globally adequate diet (3000 kcal/cap/d; 20% animal kcal) under current agrofuel use, we find that 1.8-2.6 billion additional people can be fed in 2030 and 2.1-3.1 billion additional people in 2050, depending on the extent to which yields can improve in those periods. Therefore, the simple combination of yield gap closure and moderating diets offers promise for feeding the world's population but only if long-term sustainability is the focus. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The paper clarifies the social and value dimensions for integrated sustainability assessments of lignocellulosic biofuels. We develop a responsible innovation approach, looking at technology impacts and implementation challenges, assumptions and value conflicts influencing how impacts are identified and assessed, and different visions for future development. We identify three distinct value-based visions. From a techno-economic perspective, lignocellulosic biofuels can contribute to energy security with improved GHG implications and fewer sustainability problems than fossil fuels and first-generation biofuels, especially when biomass is domestically sourced. From socio-economic and cultural-economic perspectives, there are concerns about the capacity to support UK-sourced feedstocks in a global agri-economy, difficulties monitoring large-scale supply chains and their potential for distributing impacts unfairly, and tensions between domestic sourcing and established legacies of farming. To respond to these concerns, we identify the potential for moving away from a one-size-fits-all biofuel/biorefinery model to regionally-tailored bioenergy configurations that might lower large-scale uses of land for meat, reduce monocultures and fossil-energy needs of farming and diversify business models. These configurations could explore ways of reconciling some conflicts between food, fuel and feed (by mixing feed crops with lignocellulosic material for fuel, combining livestock grazing with energy crops, or using crops such as miscanthus to manage land that is no longer arable); different bioenergy applications (with on-farm use of feedstocks for heat and power and for commercial biofuel production); and climate change objectives and pressures on farming. Findings are based on stakeholder interviews, literature synthesis and discussions with an expert advisory group. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Brazil is among the world's largest producers of biofuels. This situation stimulates agreements and strategic alliances for cooperation between countries where biofuel feedstocks are scarce and those where they are abundant. Thus, this study aims to analyze the strategic alliances for cooperation between countries for biofuel production. This research study was conducted using information from the website of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and national and international journals, on strategic alliances for cooperation between Brazil and other countries for biofuel production since 2006. It is known that those involved in the strengthening of strategic alliances for cooperation, can work together through the formation of co-marketing alliances, can contribute to the global development of the biofuel industry. They can also extend this development to other agribusiness chains. Finally, co-marketing alliances lead to actions that benefit all countries and participants in the biofuel production chain, as well as society as a whole. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Background and Aims: Due to their high water use efficiency, Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants are of environmental and economic importance in the arid and semiarid regions of the world. Moreover, many CAM plants (e.g., Agave tequilana) have attractive qualities for biofuel production such as a relatively low lignin content and high amount of soluble carbohydrates. However, the current estimates of CAM productivity are based on empirical stress indices that create large uncertainties. As a first step towards a more accurate quantification of CAM productivity, this paper introduces a new model that couples both soil and atmosphere conditions to CAM photosynthesis.
Methods: The new CAM model is based upon well established C3 photosynthesis models coupled to a nonlinear circadian rhythm oscillator for the control of the photosynthesis carbon fluxes. The leaf-level dynamics are coupled to a simple, yet realistic description of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, including a plant water capacitance module.
Results: The resulting model reproduces the four phases of CAM photosynthes is and the evolution of their dynamics during a soil moisture drydown, as a function of soil type, plant features, and climatic conditions.
Conclusion: The results help quantify the impact of soil water availability on CAM carbon assimilation and transpiration flux. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The concept of a biorefinery improves the economic efficiency of a biofuel production process from microalgae by recovering high value added compounds. Lutein is a carotenoid currently extracted from petals of Tagetes erecta with an established market in poultry and in human nutritional supplements. For the very first time, an extended study on the lipid and lutein production over three Chlorella species as well as cell disruption methods was performed. Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella zofingiensis and Chlorella protothecoides were grown in an indoor vertical alveolar panel photobioreactor with continuous illumination, and two cell disruption methods were assessed at a laboratory scale: glass bead vortexing and ball mill grinding. For C. vulgaris, C. zofingiensis and C. protothecoides the intracellular lutein content was measured as: 3.86, 4.38 and 3.59mgg-1 respectively. Lipid contents vary slightly among microalgae with a value close to 9% w/w. Biomass and lutein productivities were found to be higher for C. vulgaris (0.131gL-1d-1, 0.51mgL-1d-1) and for C. zofingiensis (0.122gL-1d-1, 0.53mgL-1d-1) compared to C. protothecoides (0.103gL-1d-1, 0.37mgL-1d-1).C. vulgaris 1803 and C. zofingiensis B 32 were found to be promising organisms for simultaneous production of lutein and lipids. Although all the microalgae under study belong to the same genus, a species-specific response was observed for each of the cell grinding methods tested. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of the U.S. are threatened by continued drainage and conversion to cropland. Commercial incentives may increase wetland restoration in lieu of easements. Therefore, we evaluated two commercially available populations of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) by comparing two planting techniques and identifying zones of maximum plant vigor and biomass production along a wetland-upland environmental gradient of a restored temporary wetland in east-central South Dakota. In the wetland center (maximum water depth: 0.4–0.5 m) plants were effectively established by transplanting, but not by drilling. Both techniques were effective above the wetland center. The zone of maximum vigor varied by year, ranging from the wetland bottom (0.5-m maximum water depth) to 0.25 m above the wetland-upland boundary. Biomass yield did not differ between populations but was affected by elevation. In a second experiment, 2 years after establishing plants by transplanting at 0.9- or 1.5-m spacing, biomass no longer differed between treatments. Our economic analysis indicated establishment costs could be recovered with < 10 years of biomass and seed harvests. Because prairie cordgrass can be established using conventional techniques and provides positive net revenue, it should be considered for incorporation into shallow wetlands in production fields. © 2014, Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion of four organic waste streams; a thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and screen cake (SC) from a fruit-juice/winery wastewater treatment plant along with municipal sludge cake (MC) and landfill leachate (LL) was evaluated. A total of eight semi-continuously-fed single and co-digesters were operated side-by-side at sludge retention times (SRT) of 20 and 10. days. Co-digestion of industrial waste streams (TWAS and SC) with MC and LL resulted in increased operational stability compared to the single digestion of industrial TWAS at the higher organic loading (10 d SRT). Although digester operational temperature had no statistically significant effect on organics removal and biogas production, mesophilic digesters had consistently higher total coliform densities (8838-37,959 most probable number or MPN/g-dry weight) compared to the thermophilic digesters (41-6723. MPN/g-dry weight) at both SRTs. Coliform analysis results also proved that most of the thermophilic digestates could be classified as Class A biosolids according to regulations. Furthermore, addition of industrial TWAS to co-digesters enhanced the dewaterability of the digested streams. A cost-benefit analysis confirmed the benefits and indicated that a full-scale co-digester utilizing all four waste streams can decrease the total capital and operational cost by 22% ($10.52. million). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gasification biochar represents one of the biochar types tested for agricultural needs. The aim of this study was to clarify the physico-chemical and biological changes occurring in a peat-sand substrate amended with hardwood-derived gasification biochar in the rates of 2, 4 and 20 g l-1. The pH(H2O) of the substrate with 4 g l-1 and 20 g l-1 biochar was increased from 5.6 to 6.2 and 6.7, respectively. The testing of the substrate in the respirometry device showed that the increase in the biochar rate led to a decrease in the amount of CO2 evolved at the maximum pressure drop. The continuous decrease in pressure observed in the respirometry bottles filled with pure biochar allows explaining this effect by biochar sorption activity. Addition of 2 and 4 g l-1 biochar to the peat-sand substrate stimulated the growth of cucumbers in an 18-day pot vegetation experiment. An increase in the number of root tips and root volume with a decreasing average root diameter was shown in the presence of biochar. Stimulation of plant growth on the background of low rates of biochar requires a further study with emphasis on the specific combination of biochar, soil type, plant species, and climatic conditions. © by Olga Muter 2014.

AB  - The human influence on the global hydrological cycle is now the dominant force behind changes in water resources across the world and in regulating the resilience of the Earth system. The rise in human pressures on global freshwater resources is in par with other anthropogenic changes in the Earth system (from climate to ecosystem change), which has prompted science to suggest that humanity has entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This paper focuses on the critical role of water for resilience of social-ecological systems across scales, by avoiding major regime shifts away from stable environmental conditions, and in safeguarding life-support systems for human wellbeing. It highlights the dramatic increase of water crowding: near-future challenges for global water security and expansion of food production in competition with carbon sequestration and biofuel production. It addresses the human alterations of rainfall stability, due to both land-use changes and climate change, the ongoing overuse of blue water, reflected in river depletion, expanding river basin closure, groundwater overexploitation and water pollution risks. The rising water turbulence in the Anthropocene changes the water research and policy agenda, from a water-resource efficiency to a water resilience focus. This includes integrated land and water stewardship to sustain wetness-dependent ecological functions at the landscape scale and a stronger emphasis on green water management for ecosystem services. A new paradigm of water governance emerges, encouraging land-use practices that explicitly take account of the multifunctional roles of water, with adequate attention to planetary freshwater boundaries and cross-scale interactions. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Three species of macroalgae were treated with the aim of reducing nitrogen, sulfur and ash within the biomass prior to hydrothermal processing. The treatments were the nutrient starvation of cultures and post-harvest washing of biomass in freshwater. Subsequently, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of macroalgae was carried out in a batch reactor heated for 8. min with a maximum temperature of 345. °C. Nutrient starvation effectively reduced nitrogen and sulfur levels within the biomass, which led to a reduction in nitrogen by 51-59. wt.% and sulfur by 64-88. wt.% within the biocrude. The yield of biocrude was highest for Derbesia at 38.6-41.7. wt.% and Oedogonium at 35.6-38.8. wt.% when not starved, but was reduced by up to 19. wt.% when the biomass was starved. The washing of biomass consistently reduced the ash content for all species by 7-83. wt.%. The removal of ash affected neither the quality nor the quantity of biocrude produced. The two treatments demonstrate that macroalgal biomass can be effectively manipulated in the production process to modify the composition of the feedstock and, consequently, improve the quality of biocrude. Additionally, reducing the ash content of biomass minimizes its potential impact on HTL processing equipment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - First and second generation biofuels are among few low-carbon alternatives for road transport that currently are commercially available or in an early commercialization phase. They are thus potential options for meeting climate targets in the medium term. For the case of Sweden, we investigate cost-efficient use of biofuels in road transport under system-wide CO2 reduction targets to 2050, and the effects of implementation of targets for an almost fossil-free road transport sector to 2030. We apply the bottom-up, optimization MARKAL_Sweden model, which covers the entire Swedish energy system including the transport sector. For CO2 reductions of 80% to 2050 in the Swedish energy system as a whole, the results of the main scenario show an annual growth rate for road transport biofuels of about 6% from 2010 to 2050, with biofuels accounting for 78% of road transport final energy use in 2050. The preferred biofuel choices are methanol and biomethane. When introducing additional fossil fuel phase-out policies in road transport (-80% to 2030), a doubling of the growth rate to 2030 is required and system CO2 abatement costs increases by 6% for the main scenario. Results imply that second generation biofuels, along with energy-efficient vehicle technologies such as plug-in hybrids, can be an important part of optimized system solutions meeting stringent medium-term climate targets. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Woody feedstocks will play an important role in meeting the total demand for biomass to generate electricity and produce ethanol in the United States. We analyzed 186 different scenarios (31 rotation ages (10 to 40 years in annual time steps); two types of forest management (intensive and nonintensive); and three feedstocks (logging residues only, pulpwood only, logging residues and pulpwood combined)) for ascertaining relative savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of two wood-based energy products (electricity and ethanol) on per unit land and per unit energy bases with respect to equivalent fossil fuel based energy products. Relative savings in GHG emissions were higher under intensive forest management compared with nonintensive forest management on a per unit land basis, whereas this situation reverses on a per unit energy basis. Combined use of pulpwood and logging residues saved the highest amount of GHG emissions on a per unit land basis, but on a per unit energy basis, relative GHG savings were similar to when only logging residues were used as a feedstock. Existing policies promoting bioenergy development in the United States only consider GHG savings on a per unit energy basis. A need exists to consider GHG savings on a per unit land basis as well to ensure efficient utilization of existing land resources to mitigate GHG emissions. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

AB  - Forest biofuel is a main provider of energy in Sweden and the market is expected to grow even further in the future. Removal of logging residues via harvest can lead to short-term acidification but the long-term effects are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to 1) model the long-term effect of whole-tree harvest (WTH) on soil and stream water acidity and 2) perform sensitivity analyses by varying the amounts of logging residues, calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in tree biomass and site productivity in nine alternate scenarios. Data from three Swedish forested catchments and the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) were used to simulate changes in forest soil exchangeable Ca2+ pools and stream water acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) at Gammtratten, Kindla and Aneboda. Large depletions in soil Ca2+ supply and a reversal of the positive trend in stream ANC were predicted for all three sites after WTH. However, the magnitude of impact on stream ANC varied depending on site and the concentration of mobile strong acid anions. Contrary to common beliefs, the largest decrease in modelled ANC was observed at the well-buffered site Gammtratten. The effects at Kindla and Aneboda were much more limited and not large enough to offset the general recovery from acidification. Varying the tree biomass Ca2+ concentrations exerted the largest impact on modelled outcome. Site productivity was the second most important variable whereas changing biomass amounts left on site only marginally affected the results. The outcome from the sensitivity analyses pointed in the same direction of change as in the base scenario, except for Kindla where soil Ca2+ pools were predicted to be replenished under a given set of input data. The reliability of modelled outcome would increase by using site-specific Ca2+ concentrations in tree biomass and field determined identification of site productivity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and Aims Species and hybrids of the genus Miscanthus contain attributes that make them front-runners among current selections of dedicated bioenergy crops. A key trait for plant biomass conversion to biofuels and biomaterials is cell-wall quality; however, knowledge of cell-wall composition and biology in Miscanthus species is limited. This study presents data on cell-wall compositional changes as a function of development and tissue type across selected genotypes, and considers implications for the development of miscanthus as a sustainable and renewable bioenergy feedstock. Methods Cell-wall biomass was analysed for 25 genotypes, considering different developmental stages and stem vs. leaf compositional variability, by Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy and lignin determination. In addition, a Clostridium phytofermentans bioassay was used to assess cell-wall digestibility and conversion to ethanol. Key Results Important cell-wall compositional differences between miscanthus stem and leaf samples were found to be predominantly associated with structural carbohydrates. Lignin content increased as plants matured and was higher in stem tissues. Although stem lignin concentration correlated inversely with ethanol production, no such correlation was observed for leaves. Leaf tissue contributed significantly to total above-ground biomass at all stages, although the extent of this contribution was genotype-dependent. Conclusions It is hypothesized that divergent carbohydrate compositions and modifications in stem and leaf tissues are major determinants for observed differences in cell-wall quality. The findings indicate that improvement of lignocellulosic feedstocks should encompass tissue-dependent variation as it affects amenability to biological conversion. For gene-trait associations relating to cell-wall quality, the data support the separate examination of leaf and stem composition, as tissue-specific traits may be masked by considering only total above-ground biomass samples, and sample variability could be mostly due to varying tissue contributions to total biomass. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Waste-to-ethanol conversion is a promising technology to provide renewable transportation fuel while mitigating feedstock risks and land use conflicts. It also has the potential to reduce environmental impacts from waste management such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. This paper analyzes the life cycle GHG emissions associated with a novel process for the conversion of food processing waste into ethanol (EtOH) and the co-products of compost and animal feed. Data are based on a pilot plant co-fermenting retail food waste with a sugary industrial wastewater, using a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process at room temperature with a grinding pretreatment. The process produced 295L EtOH/dry t feedstock. Lifecycle GHG emissions associated with the ethanol production process were 1458gCO2e/L EtOH. When the impact of avoided landfill emissions from diverting food waste to use as feedstock are considered, the process results in net negative GHG emissions and approximately 500% improvement relative to corn ethanol or gasoline production. This finding illustrates how feedstock and alternative waste disposal options have important implications in life cycle GHG results for waste-to-energy pathways. © 2014.

AB  - We present long-term measurements of sub-micron particle number size distributions (PNSDs) conducted at an urban location, Kanpur, in India, from September 2007 to July 2011. The mean Aitken mode (NAIT), accumulation mode (NACCU), the total particle (NTOT), and black carbon (BC) mass concentrations were 12.4×103cm-3, 18.9×103cm-3, 31.9×103cm-3, and 7.96μgm-3, respectively, within the observed range at other urban locations worldwide, but much higher than those reported at urban sites in the developed nations. The total particle volume concentration appears to be dominated mainly by the accumulation mode particles, except during the monsoon months, perhaps due to efficient wet deposition of accumulation mode particles by precipitation. At Kanpur, the diurnal variation of particle number concentrations was very distinct, with highest during morning and late evening hours, and lowest during the afternoon hours. This behavior could be attributed to the large primary emissions of aerosol particles and temporal evolution of the planetary boundary layer. A distinct seasonal variation in the total particle number and BC mass concentrations was observed, with the maximum in winter and minimum during the rainy season, however, the Aitken mode particles did not show a clear seasonal fluctuation. The ratio of Aitken to accumulation mode particles, NAIT/NACCU, was varied from 0.1 to 14.2, with maximum during April to September months, probably suggesting the importance of new particle formation processes and subsequent particle growth. This finding suggests that dedicated long-term measurements of PNSDs (from a few nanometer to one micron) are required to systematically characterize new particle formation over the Indian subcontinent that has been largely unstudied so far. Contrarily, the low NAIT/NACCU during post-monsoon and winter indicated the dominance of biomass/biofuel burning aerosol emissions at this site. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable feedstock for biofuel production. Acetate is one of the major inhibitors liberated from hemicelluloses during hydrolysis. An understanding of the toxic effects of acetate on the fermentation microorganism and the efficient utilization of mixed sugars of glucose and xylose in the presence of hydrolysate inhibitors is crucial for economic biofuel production.
Results: A new microarray was designed including both coding sequences and intergenic regions to investigate the acetate stress responses of Zymomonas mobilis 8b when using single carbon sources of glucose or xylose, or mixed sugars of both glucose and xylose. With the supplementation of exogenous acetate, 8b can utilize all the glucose with a similar ethanol yield, although the growth, final biomass, and ethanol production rate were reduced. However, xylose utilization was inhibited in both media containing xylose or a mixed sugar of glucose and xylose, although the performance of 8b was better in mixed sugar than xylose-only media. The presence of acetate caused genes related to biosynthesis, the flagellar system, and glycolysis to be downregulated, and genes related to stress responses and energy metabolism to be upregulated. Unexpectedly, xylose seems to pose more stress on 8b, recruiting more genes for xylose utilization, than does acetate. Several gene candidates based on transcriptome results were selected for genetic manipulation, and a TonB-dependent receptor knockout mutant was confirmed to have a slight advantage regarding acetate tolerance.
Conclusions: Our results indicate Z. mobilis utilized a different mechanism for xylose utilization, with an even more severe impact on Z. mobilis than that caused by acetate treatment. Our study also suggests redox imbalance caused by stressful conditions may trigger a metabolic reaction leading to the accumulation of toxic intermediates such as xylitol, but Z. mobilis manages its carbon and energy metabolism through the control of individual reactions to mitigate the stressful conditions. We have thus provided extensive transcriptomic datasets and gained insights into the molecular responses of Z. mobilis to the inhibitor acetate when grown in different sugar sources, which will facilitate future metabolic modeling studies and strain improvement efforts for better xylose utilization and acetate tolerance. © 2014 Yang et al.

AB  - Eutrophication is an environmental problem in a majority of shallow water basins all over the world. The undesired macroalgae has been proposed as a biomass resource for bioethanol production and we have analysed the environmental sustainability of two case studies: Orbetello Lagoon (OL), Italy, and Køge Bay (KB), Denmark. Today, macroalgae are collected and stored in landfills to provide a solution for the excess production. An emergy assessment revealed that the main environmental support for macroalgae growth relates to water in both case studies. In OL, rain represents 51% of the emergy use, and in KB runoff from agricultural land constitutes 86%. The environmental support needed for producing one Joule of bioethanol is somewhat more than for a number of other bioethanol feedstocks being 2.12×106 solar equivalent Joules (seJ) for OL and 2.56×106seJ for KB. However, a high percentage of the environmental support comes from local renewable flows being 40% for OL and 88% for KB. The difference between the two case studies is partly due to the contribution of energy from waves, which plays an important role in carrying macroalgae towards the coast in Køge Bay. Energy-wise, one J of fossil energy is required directly or indirectly to produce 0.09J of bioethanol for OL or 0.44J of bioethanol for KB, i.e. the energy return on (energy) invested (EROI) is less than 1. An alternative scenario was developed in order to investigate improvements of system efficiency. This was analysed with the full-requirement approach as well as with a marginal-requirement approach accounting only what the bioethanol production requires of additional processes, i.e. mainly transportation and conversion of the macroalgae in a biorefinery facility which is assumed to be situated close to an existing industry producing waste heat. Both emergy and EROI analyses showed that only a relatively small amount of resources has to be added to the existing system to produce the bioethanol, e.g. the EROI increased to above 1 in both systems. With the marginal approach, macroalgae may be appreciated as a resource for bioethanol production instead of considered as an environmental problem. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioethanol is obtained from various raw biomasses and by means of optimized process technologies. It can be a substitute for gasoline, which implies greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. The type of feedstock determines the classification of bioethanol: first generation (starch-based biomass or simple sugar-based feedstock) and second generation (lignocellulosic material as straw and wood). Second generation bioethanol production requires cellulosic biomass, which overcome the problems of first generation like food competition and low efficacy in GHG emission reduction. Sustainability evaluations of (first and second generation) bioethanol production have been proposed in the past by means of systemic indicators like emergy analysis and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A joint use of emergy and LCA of a possible implementation of a second generation bioethanol production chain is presented in this study. The emergy methodology has been used to test the physical consistency of the investment required to implement the production process, as well as the benefit of the biofuel-gasoline substitution. The effect of this substitution has been also evaluated by including the LCA of this production chain within the GHG balance of the Province of Siena. © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - We propose a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the optimal design and planning of non-cooperative supply chains from the manufacturer's perspective. Interactions among the supply chain participants are captured through a single-leader-multiple-follower Stackelberg game under the generalized Nash equilibrium assumption. Given a three-echelon superstructure, the lead manufacturer in the middle echelon first optimizes its design and operational decisions, including facility location, sizing, and technology selection, material input/output and price setting. The following suppliers and customers in the upstream and downstream then optimize their transactions with the manufacturer to maximize their individual profits. By replacing the lower level linear programs with their KKT conditions, we transform the bilevel MINLP into a single-level nonconvex MINLP, which is further globally optimized using an improved branch-and-refine algorithm. We also present two case studies, including a county-level biofuel supply chain in Illinois, to illustrate the application of the proposed modeling and solution methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest wood biomass can address multiple energy needs in the form of firewood, chips, charcoal, briquettes and pellets, as well as feedstock needs for the biofuels industry in renewable ways. Short rotation coppiced hardwoods mainly of poplars, willows and sycamores have been recognized as the most promising for energy production, but for industrial applications they need to have their productivity rates increased. Transgenic trees improved in terms of growth rates, site adaptability and stress tolerance can be used in this direction to achieve faster results than other available approaches, such as silvicultural methods or traditional breeding techniques. However, transgenic trees need to undergo through a very strict regulatory process, which involves biosafety and risk assessment controls prior to commercialization. The very strict regulatory framework of transgenic plants reflects mainly the public concerns regarding their impacts on public health and the environment. This paper discusses the main market considerations in terms of the regulation processes and public acceptance for woody biomass energy products of transgenic origin. Also, it presents results of a study from Greece, initiated in the frame of the EU COST Action FP0905 with the aim to explore consumers' attitudes towards the woody biomass energy products of transgenic origin. Field interviews based on a structured questionnaire were conducted on a random sample of 418 consumers all over the country. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed then on 220 consumers, the ones who stated that they would buy such woody biomass energy products. Principal Components Analysis indicated that the main factors affecting consumers' purchasing behaviour towards those products were marketing issues, product quality features and health safety issues. Through cluster techniques, three groups of consumers with similar consumption behaviour were identified: (a) opportunists, (b) consumers interested in health protection issues and (c) consumers influenced by marketing issues. Discriminant Analysis was performed to predict cluster membership and a nonparametric test to profile each consumer group according to personal characteristics and attitude towards the establishment of transgenic forest plantations. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Column-type combined reactors were designed to cultivate micro-aerobic pentachlorophenol (PCP) degrading granular sludge under oxygen-limited conditions (0.1-0.2mgL-1) over 39-day experimental period. Micro-aerobic granular had both anaerobic activity (SMA: 2.34mMCH4/hg VSS) and aerobic activity (SOUR: 2.21mMO2/hg VSS). Metabolite analysis results revealed that PCP was sequentially dechlorinated to TCP, DCP, and eventually to MCP. Methanogens were not directly involved in the dechlorination of PCP, but might played a vital role in stabilizing the overall structure of the granule sludge. For Eubacteria, the Shannon Index (2.09 in inoculated granular sludge) increased both in micro-aerobic granular sludge (2.61) and PCP-degradation granular sludge (2.55). However, for Archaea, it decreased from 2.53 to 1.85 and 1.84, respectively. Although the Shannon Index demonstrated slight difference between micro-aerobic granular sludge and PCP-degradation granular sludge, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated obvious variance of the microbial composition, revealing significant effect of micro-aerobic condition and PCP on microbial community. Furthermore, nucleotide sequencing indicated that the main microorganisms for PCP degradation might be related to Actinobacterium and Sphingomonas. These results provided insights into situ bioremediation of environments contaminated by PCP and had practical implications for the strategies of PCP degradation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Parthenium hysterophorus world's seven most devastating and hazardous weeds, and is abundantly available in several parts of the world. This study treats the subject of effective utilization of this waste biomass (which has cellulose content of 45.2±1.81% w/w) for biofuels production. We have presented a comprehensive and comparative assessment of numerous pretreatment strategies for P. hysterophorus, comprising of all major physical, chemical and physicochemical methods. The yardstick of assessment has been amount of fermentable sugars released during the pretreatment and the post-treatment enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass. Carboxymethylcellulase (1.0U/mg, 1.7mg/mL) produced by an isolate Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SS35 and β-glucosidase (Novozyme 188), have been used for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass. Among the different methods employed for pretreatment, the most efficient treatment has been revealed to be autoclaving of biomass at 121°C and 15psi pressure for 30min in acidic (1% v/v, H2SO4) environment. Total reducing sugar (TRS) yield during this pretreatment, mainly due to hydrolysis of hemicellulosic fraction of biomass, has been 285.3mg/g of raw biomass. Further enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in reducing sugar yield of 187.4mg/g of pretreated biomass (9.37g/L). The total fermentable sugar (TFS) yield from the optimized pretreatment was 397.7mg/g raw biomass (39.77g/100g raw biomass). The effects of different pretreatment methods on biomass structure and complexity were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Comparative assessment of the results with pretreatment and hydrolysis of other conventional agro- and forest residues shows that P. hysterophorus has same potential for being the feedstock for biofuels. These results conclusively demonstrate the utility of P. hysterophorus for sustainable biofuels production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The lipid content of microalgae is regarded as an important indicator for biodiesel. Many attempts have been made to increase the lipid content of microalgae through biochemical and genetic engineering. Significant lipid accumulation in microalgae has been achieved using biochemical engineering, such as nitrogen starvation, but the cell growth was severely limited. However, enrichment of lipid content in microalgae by genetic engineering is anticipated. In this study, GmDof4 from soybean (Glycine max), a transcription factor affecting the lipid content in Arabidopsis, was transferred into Chlorella ellipsoidea. We then investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement of the lipid content of transformed C. ellipsoidea.
Results: We constructed a plant expression vector, pGmDof4, and transformed GmDof4 into C. ellipsoidea by electroporation. The resulting expression of GmDof4 significantly enhanced the lipid content by 46.4 to 52.9%, but did not affect the growth rate of the host cells under mixotrophic culture conditions. Transcriptome profiles indicated that 1,076 transcripts were differentially regulated: of these, 754 genes were significantly upregulated and 322 genes were significantly downregulated in the transgenic strains under mixotrophic culture conditions. There are 22 significantly regulated genes (|log2 ratio| &gt;1) involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Quantitative real-time PCR and an enzyme activity assay revealed that GmDof4 significantly up-regulated the gene expression and enzyme activity of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, a key enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, in transgenic C. ellipsoidea cells.
Conclusions: The hetero-expression of a transcription factor GmDof4 gene from soybean can significantly increase the lipid content but not affect the growth rate of C. ellipsoidea under mixotrophic culture conditions. The increase in lipid content could be attributed to the large number of genes with regulated expression. In particular, the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase gene expression and enzyme activity were significantly upregulated in the transgenic cells. Our research provides a new way to increase the lipid content of microalgae by introducing a specific transcription factor to microalgae strains that can be used for the biofuel and food industries. © 2014 Zhang et al.

AB  - Extreme thermophiles are microorganisms that grow optimally at elevated temperatures (≥ 70°C). They could play an important role in the emerging renewable energy landscape by exploiting thermophily to produce liquid transportation fuels. For example, Caldicellulosiruptor species can grow on unpretreated plant biomass near 80°C utilizing novel multi-domain glycoside hydrolases. Through metabolic engineering, advanced biofuels compatible with existing infrastructure liquid biofuels, so-called lignofuels, could be produced to establish consolidated bioprocessing at high temperatures. In another case, a new paradigm, electrofuels, addresses the inefficiency of biofuel production through the direct synthesis of advanced fuels from carbon dioxide using hydrogen gas as the electron carrier. This requires coupling of biological electron utilization to carbon dioxide fixation and ultimately to fuel synthesis. Using a hyperthermophilic host Pyrococcus furiosus and synthetic metabolic pathways comprised of genes from less thermophilic sources, temperature-regulated biosynthesis of industrial organic chemicals and liquid fuel molecules are possible. Herein, we review recent progress towards the synthesis of lignofuels and electrofuels by extremely thermophilic microorganisms. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The ability to attain the feedstock production goal in the USA for biofuel production is limited by available arable land, cool temperatures, and periods of low light intensity. This study investigates the effects of warm and cool temperatures growth conditions in a low light regime on the photosynthesis and growth of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum cv. Alamo) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus). Alamo switchgrass did not acclimate to low light conditions and had a 47% lower growth and significantly lower mean light saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat = 10.3 mol m-2s-1) at 14/12°C day/night, compared with 28/25°C (Asat = 18.8 mol m-2s-1). In contrast, photosynthesis of giant miscanthus acclimated to low light conditions, but there was no significant decrease in quantum requirement or light saturated photosynthetic rates in cool growing conditions (Asat = 8.2 mol m-2s-1 and 7.0 mol m-2s-1 for warm and cool conditions, respectively). In summary, giant miscanthus growth and photosynthesis is relatively more tolerant of cool temperature than switchgrass, but is severely limited by low radiation. In contrast, Alamo switchgrass growth and photosynthesis is very sensitive to cool conditions, but is able to maintain higher growth than miscanthus at low radiation conditions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We analyze the impact of total and partial waivers of the US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) under uncertain changes in climate conditions that affects crop yield distributions. Results show that reducing RFS would make world agricultural consumers better off, and increase the US corn share in the world market while slightly decreasing agricultural commodity prices. However, the higher the RFS reduction the higher the uncertainty on the price changes. On the other hand, price changes would make ethanol and agricultural producers face losses as well as increase gasoline consumption and, therefore, bring larger environmental damages. Overall, RFS reduction generates negative changes in total economic surplus, specifically, small and medium RFS reductions generate changes in the socio-economic variables; however, large reductions do not bring further changes, although uncertainty in welfare results is higher under an increased reduction. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is a leader in global biofuel production, accounting for 27% of supply. This is driven by a proliferation of mandates and targets calling for increased use of biofuels around the world. Unsustainable biofuel production can alter landscapes and stress social-ecological systems. To mitigate impacts, different types of governance mechanisms have been introduced including national regulations, voluntary certification schemes, sustainability standards, meta-standards, and codes of conduct. Voluntary certification has gained prominence in the region, with over 220 producers and processors in 12 LAC countries obtaining certification. However, given the potential social and environmental impacts evident in the region, voluntary certification may be insufficient and stronger sustainability mechanisms may be justified. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In this study, the research showed that the success of a disruptive energy technology like biofuels depended on: (a) the politics and the leadership of the industry related to the disruptive energy technology; (b) minimizing the social and ecological disruption associated with the disruptive energy technology; (c) a decline in the fossil fuel's supply; (d) an increased in the global demand for energy; (e) the sustainability of the disruptive energy source; (f) using the disruptive energy technology to create an assessable opportunity; and (g) investment risk. This paper concludes that sustainable fuel source such as biofuels has increased local employment while increasing sales in the production of related products. The multiple geographies and technologies surrounding the production of a sustainable fuel resource such as biofuels has also increased risk to the investors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Promoting successful biofuel production in developing economies requires an appreciation of local culture. In Tanzania, where soaring economic expectations have accompanied disappointing commercial outcomes, contemporary project managers would do well to adopt inclusive agricultural planning strategies. Overlooked in the past, Tanzania's farmers now demand a place at the project planning table. Meanwhile, the Tanzanian government has called on the Japan International Cooperation Agency to assess local obstacles to economic development. Strongly influenced by Professor Ikujiro Nonaka, the Japan International Cooperation Agency's methodology suggests community participation and local management are central to project success, and both are vital to assessing success and failure in Tanzania's Jatropha biofuel industry. © 2014, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Starting from (but not limited to) their importance in the Italian context, three agricultural substrates, two of fruit origin (grape seeds and plum stones) and one of herbaceous origin (woad), were comparatively tested for both biomethane production and digestate characterization. The anaerobic digestion tests showed that grape seeds had the highest net methane production of 253.0 NmL g volatile solids (VS)-1, followed by plum stones, whose best resulting net methane production was 174.7 NmL gVS-1, and finally by woad with a net methane production of 153.1 NmL gVS-1. Interestingly, the best methane productions of the fruit substrates were obtained with different substrate to inoculum ratios (on a VS basis), 1:1 for grape seeds but 2:1 for plum stones. On the other hand, a three-month ageing of woad caused a limited reduction of methane production. The estimation of obtained degrees of conversion, carried out on a chemical oxygen demand (COD) basis for the specific tests achieving the respective best methane productions, gave values of 48%, 31%, and 33% for grape seeds, plum stones, and woad, respectively. The estimated degrees of conversion were evaluated along with the respective methane productions and substrate COD/VS ratios. The comparison of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and differential thermal analysis (DTA) profiles, carried out for selected digestates in pairs, revealed some distinctive differences in the relative intensities or presence and absence of particular peaks in the FT-IR spectra and in the relative intensities of the exothermic peaks or horizontal curve shifting of the DTA profiles. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Promising energy crops such as Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL), which are planted on marginal lands, or microalgae such as Chlorella, which are cultivated in ponds located on mudflats or deserts, have been regarded with high hopes to solve the shortage of food crops and increase the amount of biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester, FAME) production. However, the annual yields of biomass and transport fuels (t/ha) of both are still unclear and often exaggerated in the literature. Large portions of JCL biomass, including tree trunks and leaves, can also be used to generate electricity along with FAME, which is produced from seed lipids. Meanwhile, lipid extracted algae (LEA) are composed of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids other than glycerides which are unable to be esterified to form FAME and much more abundant in the microalgae than oil cake in the oil crops. Therefore, it has been strongly suggested that not only transesterification or esterification but also Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and bio-electricity generation should be considered as routes to produce biofuels. Otherwise, the yield of biofuel would be extremely low using either JCL or Chlorella as feedstock. The Life-Cycle Inventories (LCI) of the biofuel processes with whole biomass of JCL and Chlorella were compared based on their net energy ratio (NER) and CO2 emission saving (CES). It was shown that the technological improvement of irrigation, cultivation, and processing for either economic-crops or microalgae were all necessary to meet the requirements of commercial biofuel production. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Short rotation woody crops (SRWC), such as hybrid poplar, have the potential to serve as a valuable feedstock for cellulosic biofuels. Spatial estimates of biomass yields under different management regimes are required for assisting stakeholders in making better management decisions and to establish viable woody cropping systems for biofuel production. To support stakeholders in their management decisions, we have developed a GIS-based web interface using a modified 3PG model for spatially predicting poplar biomass yields under different management and climate conditions in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. The application is implemented with standard HTML5 components, allowing its use in a modern browser and dynamically adjusting to the client screen size and device. In addition, cloud storage of the results makes them accessible on any Internet-enabled device. The web interface appears simple, but is powerful in parameter manipulation and in visualizing and sharing the results. Overall, this application comprises dynamic features that enable users to run SRWC crop growth simulations based on GIS information and contributes significantly to choosing appropriate feedstock growing locations, anticipating the desired physiological properties of the feedstock and incorporating the management and policy analysis needed for growing hybrid poplar plantations. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cork samples from Betula pendula, Quercus suber and Quercus cerris were submitted to Py-GC-MS/FID at temperatures between 550 °C and 900 °C and the pyrolysis-derived compounds (py-products) were identified and quantified. Corks were compared with wood samples. Py-products include suberin, lignin and carbohydrates derivatives. Suberin py-products are dominated by unsaturated aliphatics. Corks pyrolysis yield and composition were dramatically influenced by temperature in contrast to wood that showed stable results across temperatures. At 850-900 °C the peaks area of cork pyrograms were approximately two times higher than at 550 °C, for which yield was about half of the woods, and cork py-products were dominated by suberin-derived short chain aliphatics, namely 1-alkenes, while at 550 °C composition was dominated by lignin derivatives. Lignin and carbohydrate derived products decreased dramatically over 750 °C while the opposite was observed for unsaturated aliphatics. Cork materials show a high potential as feedstock for production of aliphatic-rich pyrolytic biofuels or as a source of olefins. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Miscanthus is emerging as a promising feedstock for domestic biofuel production. However, inefficiencies of the machinery that is used for harvesting bioenergy crops such as miscanthus currently prohibit commercial production. The performance of a mower-conditioner used to harvest miscanthus was evaluated, and modifications to the disk head were made to allow the machine to operate more efficiently. It was also hypothesized that the harvest energy requirement of the mower-conditioner in miscanthus could be reduced by increasing the blade oblique angle. Blades with oblique angles of 20° and 30° were manufactured and fitted to the disk mower-conditioner. When combined with data collected from a real-time yield sensing system, the data collected regarding the machine performance resulted in point-specific and overall machine energy consumption information. The 30° oblique angle resulted in a 27% reduction in the energy requirement, with an energy consumption of 13.5 MJ Mg-1 as compared to 18.5 MJ Mg-1 for the conventional straight (0°) blades. Further studies are needed to examine the overall life of the angled blades as well as the feasibility of their application to other crops harvested by disk mower-conditioners, such as hay and forage. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Due to their heterogeneous nature, forest residues may not be used to their full potential as biorefinery feedstocks. This work investigated the effect of mixing biomass species from the hardwood understory on xylose and glucose yields obtained from dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. The mixed biomass samples consisted of: 70% sweetgum wood + 30% sweetgum bark, 70% sweetgum wood + 30% oak bark, and 70% sweetgum wood + 30% oak wood. A feedstock of 100% sweetgum wood was used as the control. Samples were pretreated with 0.98% (v/v) sulfuric acid at 160°C for 20 min, followed by hydrolysis with a cellulase enzyme cocktail. Resulting sugars from hydrolysis of the mixed samples were statistically compared to the sugar yield of the control; experimental and predicted sugar yields for the mixed samples were also compared to each other. Results showed that mixing biomass species did not negatively affect sugar yields. There were positive interactions between sweetgum wood and sweetgum bark during hydrolysis, as indicated by an increase of experimental xylose and glucose yields by 25% and 12%, respectively. However, the mixture with sweet-gum bark increased formic acid concentration by 70% when compared to the control. In conclusion, the heterogeneous nature of forest residues would not prevent their use as a feedstock in biochemical biorefineries, as far as sugar yields are concerned, but inclusion of bark biomass in forest residues could reduce the quality of the sugar stream, which could cause some processing challenges. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Background: As biofuel projects may be associated with positive and negative effects on people's health and wellbeing, a health impact assessment was performed for the Addax Bioenergy Sierra Leone (ABSL) project. We present data from the baseline health survey, which will provide a point of departure for future monitoring and evaluation activities. Methods: In December 2010, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in eight potentially affected communities. A broad set of clinical and parasitological indicators were assessed using standardised, quality-controlled procedures, including anthropometry and prevalence of anaemia, Plasmodium falciparum and helminth infections. Results: Complete datasets were obtained from 1221 individuals of 194 households and eight schools. Of children aged <5 years (n=586), 41.8% were stunted, 23.2% were underweight and 4.8% were wasted. Very high prevalences of anaemia and P. falciparum were found in children aged 6-59 months (n=571; 86.1% and 74.0%, respectively). Overall, 73.7% of women of reproductive age (n=395) were anaemic. In school-aged children (n=240), 27.9% had light- to moderate-intensity hookworm infections, whereas Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and Schistosoma mansoni were rare (<3% each). Conclusions: The detailed description of the baseline health conditions, in combination with future health surveys, will deepen the understanding of how a biofuel project impacts on community health in a rural setting in sub-Saharan Africa. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Understanding soil water dynamics and evapotranspiration (ET) is imperative to predict the interactions between bioenergy cropping systems and water resources; yet measurements of these variables under bioenergy crops in the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) are limited. The objectives of this study were to quantify and compare soil water dynamics and ET under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and mixed perennial grasses managed for biofuel production. Soil water content was measured from 2011 through 2013 at Stillwater, OK, and from 2012 through 2013 at Chickasha, OK, and ET was estimated using the soil water balance approach. For these crops, soil water depletion occurred mainly above the 2.0-m depth, suggesting negligible root water uptake below 2.0 m. Growing season soil water depletion ranged from 4 to 287 mm and was greater (α = 0.10) for sorghum than switchgrass in 2 out of 5 site-yr, while mixed grasses exhibited the greatest soil water depletion in 1 out of 3 yr. Growing season soil water depletion was positively related to initial soil water content. Crop year ET ranged from 493 to 846 mm and was greater for switchgrass than sorghum in 2 out of 3 site-yr. At Stillwater, average crop year ET measured for 2 yr was 676 mm for switchgrass, 630 mm for sorghum, and 717 mm for mixed grasses. In the SGP, rainfed bioenergy production systems based on biomass sorghum may consume less water per unit land area than systems based on perennial grasses. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - In a forested catchment, river discharge in any season can be either decreased or augmented by forest management practices such as appropriate species selection, density management, and length of rotation. The efficacy of any such strategy in either new plantations or existing forests can be maximized by considering the distribution of the key hydrological functions in the catchment. With the growing awareness of climate change and its impacts, the adequacy of our water supply is becoming an issue of increasing societal importance. At the same time there is greater discussion about using our forests for carbon sequestration and biofuels. Policy-makers should be careful when introducing new programs that incentivize widespread reforestation. The implications of such planting programs on annual and seasonal river flows (under both current and future climatic conditions) need to be considered. Informed choices need to be made as to the objectives for which we manage our forests. In turn, this means that there is an urgent need for water managers and forest managers to work more closely together than in the past to optimally plan and develop forest and water management strategies. © 2014 - Canadian Institute of Forestry.

AB  - A reticular set of environmental, agricultural, and energy issues may be alleviated through beneficial use of poultry litter as a nutrient source to poor quality soils for production of sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] as biofuel feedstock. This study assessed the viability of producing a biofuel crop using an organic by-product as an alternative to commercial fertilizer (CF). Sweet sorghum was established annually for 3 yr on a relatively poor drainage, low organic matter, and low pH soil of eastern Oklahoma. Poultry litter was annually applied at four different application rates and CF applied at equivalent N, P, and K. Sorghum biomass yield and changes in soil properties were monitored. Yield and input costs were used to determine economic return and optimum distances for litter transportation. After 3 yr of litter application, several soil quality parameters increased for litter-amended soils compared to CF. Although economic return was greater for litter, yields from litter were not significantly different from CF. Overall biomass yields and economic returns increased with higher nutrient rates and varied each year because of variable weather. As a result of increased economic return from litter compared to CF, litter could be transported to various distances depending on application rate and ethanol price. Use of litter as a nutrient source for growing sweet sorghum as biofuel feedstock can be economically sustainable and potentially improve water quality in environmentally sensitive watersheds, improve soil quality of marginal land, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Sustainably balancing biofuel crop production with food, feed, and fiber on agricultural lands will require developing new cropping strategies. Double- and/or relay-cropping winter camelina (Camelina sativa L.) with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] may be a means to produce an energy and food crop on the same land in a single year. A study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 in west central Minnesota to evaluate yields, seed quality, economics, and within-field energy balance of winter camelina–soybean double- and relay-cropping systems compared with a conventional monocropped full-season soybean. Systems included methods to hasten camelina harvest (e.g., swathing and desiccating) to promote early soybean growth. Camelina seed yields were unaffected by cropping system and ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 Mg ha–1. Relay-cropped soybean yields were greater than double-cropped soybean and were 58 to 83% of that for the monocropped control. Seed oil and protein content of double- and relay-cropped soybean were comparable to their monocropped counterpart and combined seed oil yield for the dual crop systems was as much as 50% greater. Net economic returns for the relay-crop treatments were competitive with that of the full-season soybean. Moreover, net energy of the relay-crop treatments was generally as high as the sole soybean crop, but energy efficiency (outputs/inputs) was less due to greater inputs. Results indicate that dual cropping of winter camelina with soybean is agronomically viable for the upper Midwest and might be an attractive system to growers seeking a “cash” cover crop. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Glycerol has become a cheap and abundant carbon source due to biodiesel production at a large scale, and it is available for several biotechnological applications. We recently established poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HP)] synthesis in a recombinant Shimwellia blattae strain (Heinrich et al. Appl Environ Microbiol 79:3582-3589, 2013). The major drawbacks of the current strains are (i) low poly(3HP) yields, (ii) low plasmid stability and (iii) insufficient conversion rates. In this study, we demonstrated the influence of alterations of the operon structure, consisting of 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (dhaT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldD) of Pseudomonas putida KT2442, propionate:coenzyme A (propionate-CoA) transferase (pct) of Clostridium propionicum X2 and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase (phaC1) of Ralstonia eutropha H16. It was shown that S. blattae ATCC33430/pBBR1MCS-2::dhaT::pct:: aldD::phaC1 synthesized up to 14.5 % (wtPHA/wtCDW) in a 2-L fed-batch fermentation process. Furthermore, we overcame the problem of plasmid losses during the fermentation period by engineering a carbon source-dependent plasmid addiction system in a triose phosphate isomerase knockout mutant. An assumed poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic acid) degrading activity of the lipase/esterase YbfF could not be confirmed. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The accelerated eutrophication of freshwaters and to a lesser extent some coastal waters is primarily driven by phosphorus (P) inputs. While efforts to identify and limit point source inputs of P to surface waters have seen some success, nonpoint sources remain difficult to identify, target, and remediate. As further improvements in wastewater treatment technologies becomes increasingly costly, attention has focused more on nonpoint source reduction, particularly the role of agriculture. This attention was heightened over the last 10 to 20. years by a number of highly visible cases of nutrient-related water quality degradation; including the Lake Taihu, Baltic Sea, Chesapeake Bay, and Gulf of Mexico. Thus, there has been a shift to targeted management of critical sources of P loss. In both the U.S. and China, there has been an intensification of agricultural production systems in certain areas concentrate large amounts of nutrients in excess of local crop and forage needs, which has increased the potential for P loss from these areas. To address this, innovative technologies are emerging that recycle water P back to land as fertilizer. For example, in the watershed of Lake Taihu, China one of the largest surface fresh waters for drinking water supply in China, local governments have encouraged innovation and various technical trials to harvest harmful algal blooms and use them for bio-gas, agricultural fertilizers, and biofuel production. In any country, however, the economics of remediation will remain a key limitation to substantial changes in agricultural production. © 2014.

AB  - In this review, we summarize the potential impacts of climate change on wildfire activity in the mid-Atlantic region, and then consider how the beneficial uses of prescribed fire could conflict with mitigation needs for climate change, focusing on patters of carbon (C) sequestration by forests in the region. We use a synthesis of field studies, eddy flux tower measurements, and simulation studies to evaluate how the use of prescribed fire affects short- and long-term forest C dynamics. Climate change may create weather conditions more conducive to wildfire activity, but successional changes in forest composition, altered gap dynamics, reduced understory and forest floor fuels, and fire suppression will likely continue to limit wildfire occurrence and severity throughout the region. Prescribed burning is the only major viable option that land managers have for reducing hazardous fuels in a cost-effective manner, or ensuring the regeneration and maintenance of fire-dependent species. Field measurements and model simulations indicate that consumption of fine fuels on the forest floor and understory vegetation during most prescribed burns is equivalent to 1-3. years of sequestered C, and depends on pre-burn fuel loading and burn intensity. Overstory tree mortality is typically low, and stands have somewhat reduced daytime C uptake during the next growing season following burns, but may also have reduced rates of ecosystem respiration. On an annual basis, net ecosystem productivity is negative the first year when consumption losses are included, but then positive in following years, and stands can reach C neutrality within 2-3. years. Field data and model simulations suggest that increases in prescribed burning in fire-prone areas would have little appreciable effect on long-term forest C dynamics in some fire-prone forest types. Large-scale conversion to young pine plantations for fiber and biofuels will potentially increase the risk of wildfires, as had occurred previously in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in the region. © 2013.

AB  - In this study a dynamic simulation modeling approach is used to assess the integration of torrefaction into the wood pellet production and distribution supply chain. The developed model combines discrete event and discrete rate simulation approaches and allows considering uncertainties, interdependencies, and resource constraints along the supply chain which are usually simplified or ignored in static and deterministic models. It includes the whole supply chain from sources of raw materials to the distribution of the final products. The model is applied to an existing wood pellet supply chain, located in British Columbia, Canada, to assess the cost of delivered torrefied pellets to different markets, energy demand, and carbon dioxide emissions along the supply chain and compare them with those of regular pellets. In the presented case study, integration of torrefaction leads to lower delivered cost to existing and potential markets due to increased energy density and reduced distribution costs. In comparison with regular pellets, the delivered cost of torrefied pellets ($/GJ) to Northwest Europe is 9% lower. Also, the energy consumption and the emitted carbon dioxide along the supply chain are decreased due to more efficient transportation of torrefied pellets. Integration of torrefaction into the wood pellet production and distribution supply chain could result in less expensive and cleaner biofuel. The feasibility of such integration depends on the trade-off between the higher capital and operating costs and the reduced transportation costs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The end products (digestate, solid fraction of the digestate, liquid fraction of the digestate) of ten biogas production lines in Finland were analyzed for ten hazardous organic compounds or compound groups: polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB(7)), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH(16)), bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), perfluorinated alkyl compounds (PFCs), linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LASs), nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NP. +. NPEOs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). Biogas plant feedstocks were divided into six groups: municipal sewage sludge, municipal biowaste, fat, food industry by-products, animal manure and others (consisting of milling by-products (husk) and raw former foodstuffs of animal origin from the retail trade). There was no clear connection between the origin of the feedstocks of a plant and the concentrations of hazardous organic compounds in the digestate. For PCDD/Fs and for DEHP, the median soil burden of the compound after a single addition of digestate was similar to the annual atmospheric deposition of the compound or compound group in Finland or other Nordic countries. For PFCs, the median soil burden was somewhat lower than the atmospheric deposition in Finland or Sweden. For NP. +. NPEOs, the soil burden was somewhat higher than the atmospheric deposition in Denmark. The median soil burden of PBDEs was 400 to 1000 times higher than the PBDE air deposition in Finland or in Sweden. With PBDEs, PFCs and HBCD, the impact of the use of end products should be a focus of further research. Highly persistent compounds, such as PBDE- and PFC-compounds may accumulate in agricultural soil after repeated use of organic fertilizers containing these compounds. For other compounds included in this study, agricultural use of biogas plant end products is unlikely to cause risk to food safety in Finland. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study investigated the changes of bacterial community composition including bacterial pathogens along a biogas plant, i.e. from the influent, to the biogas reactor and to the post-digester. The effects of post-digestion temperature and time on the changes of bacterial community composition and bacterial pathogens were also studied. Microbial analysis was made by Ion Torrent sequencing of the PCR amplicons from ethidium monoazide treated samples, and ethidium monoazide was used to cleave DNA from dead cells and exclude it from PCR amplification. Both similarity and taxonomic analysis showed that the bacterial community composition in the influent was changed after anaerobic digestion. Firmicutes were dominant in all the samples, while Proteobacteria decreased in the biogas reactor compared with the influent. Variations of bacterial community composition in the biogas reactor with time were also observed. This could be attributed to varying composition of the influent. Batch experiments showed that the methane recovery from the digested residues (obtained from biogas reactor) was mainly related with post-digestion temperature. However, post-digestion time rather than temperature had a significant effect on the changes of bacterial community composition. The changes of bacterial community composition were also reflected in the changes of relative abundance of bacterial pathogens. The richness and relative abundance of bacterial pathogens were reduced after anaerobic digestion in the biogas reactor. It was found in batch experiments that bacterial pathogens showed the highest relative abundance and richness after 30days' post-digestion. Streptococcus bovis was found in all the samples. Our results showed that special attention should be paid to the post-digestion since the increase in relative abundance of bacterial pathogens after post-digestion might reflect regrowth of bacterial pathogens and limit biosolids disposal vectors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae have been considered as a promising biodiesel feedstock. One of the major factors affecting large-scale algae technology application is poor wintering cultivation performance. In this study, an integrated approach is investigated combining freshwater microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis wintering cultivation in pilot-scale photobioreactors with artificial wastewater treatment. Mixotrophic culture with the addition of acetic acid (pH-regulation group) and autotrophic culture (control group) were designed, and the characteristics of algal growth, lipid and biodiesel production, and nitrogen and phosphate removal were examined. The results showed that, by using acetic acid three times per day to regulate pH at between 6.8 and 7.2, the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphate (TP) removal could be increased from 45.2% to 73.5% and from 92.2% to 100%, respectively. Higher biomass productivity of 66.94mgL-1day-1 with specific growth rate of 0.260day-1 was achieved in the pH-regulation group. The lipid content was much higher when using acetic acid to regulate pH, and the relative lipid productivity reached 37.48mgL-1day-1. The biodiesel yield in the pH-regulated group was 19.44% of dry weight, with 16-18 carbons as the most abundant composition for fatty acid methyl esters. The findings of the study prove that pH adjustment using acetic acid is efficient in cultivating C. zofingiensis in wastewater in winter for biodiesel production and nutrient reduction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Competition for water between key economic sectors and the environment means agreeing allocations is challenging. Managing releases from the three major dams in Kenya's Tana River basin with its 4.4 million inhabitants, 567 MW of installed hydropower capacity, 33 000 ha of irrigation and ecologically important wetlands and forests is a pertinent example. This research seeks firstly to identify and help decision-makers visualise reservoir management strategies which result in the best possible (Pareto-optimal) allocation of benefits between sectors. Secondly, it seeks to show how trade-offs between achievable benefits shift with the implementation of proposed new rice, cotton and biofuel irrigation projects. To approximate the Pareto-optimal trade-offs we link a water resources management simulation model to a multi-criteria search algorithm. The decisions or "levers" of the management problem are volume-dependent release rules for the three major dams and extent of investment in new irrigation schemes. These decisions are optimised for eight objectives covering the provision of water supply and irrigation, energy generation and maintenance of ecosystem services. Trade-off plots allow decision-makers to assess multi-reservoir rule-sets and irrigation investment options by visualising their impacts on different beneficiaries. Results quantify how economic gains from proposed irrigation schemes trade-off against the disturbance of ecosystems and local livelihoods that depend on them. Full implementation of the proposed schemes is shown to come at a high environmental and social cost. The clarity and comprehensiveness of "best-case" trade-off analysis is a useful vantage point from which to tackle the interdependence and complexity of "water-energy-food nexus" resource security issues. © 2014 Author(s).

AB  - Based on an in-depth analysis of results from the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model of climate policies for Brazil and Mexico, we demonstrate that commitments by Mexico and Brazil for 2020—made during the UN climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun—are reachable, but they come at different costs for each country. We find that Brazil's commitments will be met through reduced deforestation, and at no additional cost; however, Mexico's pledges will cost 4 billion US dollars in terms of reduced GDP in 2020. We explore short- and long-term implications of several policy scenarios after 2020, considering current policy debates in both countries. The comparative analysis of these two economies underscores the need for climate policy designed for the specific characteristics of each country, accounting for variables such as natural resources and current economic structure. Our results also suggest that both Brazil and Mexico may face other environmental and economic impacts from stringent global climate policies, affecting variables such as the value of energy resources in international trade. © 2015 The Authors

AB  - Cakile maritima is a member of the Brassicaceae family also known as sea rocket. It is an annual succulent halophyte frequent in coastal dune vegetation in Mediterranean regions and Atlantic coasts from North Africa to the north of Europe. This halophyte presents a complex survival strategy at high salinity and its seeds contain up to 40% of an oil which could be suitable for biofuel production and other industrial applications. However, data concerning the cellular mechanisms allowing this plant to resist salinity are still lacking. Cell suspension cultures offer an in vitro system convenient for cell biology studies and biotechnological methods are still not developed for this putative crop. The present paper reports initiation of C. maritima cell suspension cultures from callus obtained from aerial parts of seedlings. The establishment of a suspension culture which preserves its salt resistance provides an opportunity to gain insights into C. maritima biology. © 2014, University of Florence. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Wheat straw is an attractive substrate for second generation ethanol production because it will complement and augment wheat production rather than competing with food production. However, like other sources of lignocellulosic biomass, even from a single species, it is heterogeneous in nature due to the different tissues and cell types, and this has implications for saccharification efficiency. The aim of this study has been to use Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Partial least squares (PLS) modelling to rapidly screen wheat cultivars for the levels of component tissues, the carbohydrate composition and lignin content, and the levels of simple cross-linking phenolics such as ferulic and diferulic acids.
Results: FTIR spectroscopy and PLS modelling was used to analyze the tissue and chemical composition of wheat straw biomass. Predictive models were developed to evaluate the variability in the concentrations of the cell wall sugars, cell wall phenolics and acid-insoluble lignin. Models for the main sugars, phenolics and lignin were validated and then used to evaluate the variation in total biomass composition across 90 cultivars of wheat grown over two seasons.
Conclusions: Whilst carbohydrate and lignin components varied across the varieties, this mainly reflected differences in the ratios of the component tissues rather than differences in the composition of those tissues. Further analysis indicated that on a mol% basis, relative levels of sugars within the tissues varied to only a small degree. There were no clear associations between simple phenolics and tissues. The results provide a basis for improving biomass quality for biofuels production through selection of cultivars with appropriate tissue ratios. © 2014 Collins et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Color of wood pellets is mainly affected by the feedstock material used for their production and which composition and characteristic affect the final product quality. Pellets made from pure wood are light in color and have low ash content, while pellets made from different mixtures of wood and bark or foliage are generally darker and richer in minerals. This study aims to verify the correlation between color and quality parameters of wood pellets available on the Italian market. All the samples were analyzed following the procedures laid down by the European Norms (EN) on solid biofuels for moisture, ash, calorific value, durability, bulk and solid density. The acquisition of the images was done with two techniques: the CIE Lab color space and RGB-HSV color spaces. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed with CIE-Lab, RGB and HSV separately showing for all the color components good degree of correlation with ash content of pellets. The PCA analysis on two principal components (total explained variance: 64.2%) showed a clear color gradient moving form good to medium or low quality parameters. This pattern is confirmed by the clustering of certified pellets in the region of lightest samples. The calculation of ΔE and ΔRGB showed a good discrimination level between whole pellets samples and their sawdust, and between ones with high and low ash content. The visual predictability of pellets quality on the basis of their color is however not so sharp when considering samples with similar colors. The industrial applicability of such methods for the evaluation of pellets quality is desirable for RGB methodologies that are less expensive and more reliable in working condition, given that specific color calibration is performed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Human population and economic growth are accelerating the demand for plant biomass to provide food, fuel, and fiber. The annual increment of biomass to meet these needs is quantified as net primary production (NPP). Here we show that an underlying assumption in some current models may lead to underestimates of the potential production from managed landscapes, particularly of bioenergy crops that have low nitrogen requirements. Using a simple light-use efficiency model and the theoretical maximum efficiency with which plant canopies convert solar radiation to biomass, we provide an upper-envelope NPP unconstrained by resource limitations. This theoretical maximum NPP approached 200 tC ha -1 yr-1 at point locations, roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than most current managed or natural ecosystems. Recalculating the upper envelope estimate of NPP limited by available water reduced it by half or more in 91% of the land area globally. While the high conversion efficiencies observed in some extant plants indicate great potential to increase crop yields without changes to the basic mechanism of photosynthesis, particularly for crops with low nitrogen requirements, realizing such high yields will require improvements in water use efficiency. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The production of ethanol from pretreated plant biomass during fermentation is a strategy to mitigate climate change by substituting fossil fuels. However, biomass conversion is mainly limited by the recalcitrant nature of the plant cell wall. To overcome recalcitrance, the optimization of the plant cell wall for subsequent processing is a promising approach. Based on their phylogenetic proximity to existing and emerging energy crops, model plants have been proposed to study bioenergy-related cell wall biochemistry. One example is Brachypodium distachyon, which has been considered as a general model plant for cell wall analysis in grasses. To test whether relative phylogenetic proximity would be sufficient to qualify as a model plant not only for cell wall composition but also for the complete process leading to bioethanol production, we compared the processing of leaf and stem biomass from the C3 grasses B. distachyon and Triticum aestivum (wheat) with the C4 grasses Zea mays (maize) and Miscanthus x giganteus, a perennial energy crop. Lambda scanning with a confocal laser-scanning microscope allowed a rapid qualitative analysis of biomass saccharification. A maximum of 108-117 mg ethanol·g-1 dry biomass was yielded from thermo-chemically and enzymatically pretreated stem biomass of the tested plant species. Principal component analysis revealed that a relatively strong correlation between similarities in lignocellulosic ethanol production and phylogenetic relation was only given for stem and leaf biomass of the two tested C4 grasses. Our results suggest that suitability of B. distachyon as a model plant for biomass conversion of energy crops has to be specifically tested based on applied processing parameters and biomass tissue type. © 2014 Meineke et al.

AB  - Mechanical mastication is increasingly used as a fuel management treatment to reduce fire risk at the wildland–urban interface, although ignition and fire behaviour in these novel fuel beds are poorly understood. We investigated the influence of observed fuel moisture content, wind speed, and firebrand size on the probability of sustained flaming of masticated fuel beds under both laboratory and field settings. Logistic regression techniques were applied to assess the probability of sustained flaming in both datasets. Models for the field were also developed using estimated moisture from three sets of weather-based models: (i) the hourly Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) from the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, (ii) the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) moisture estimates for 1 h and 10 h fuels, and (iii) a masticated surface fuel moisture model (MAST). In both laboratory and field testing, the likelihood of a successful ignition increased with decreasing moisture content and increasing wind speed; the effect of firebrand size was only apparent in laboratory testing. The FFMC, NFDRS, and MAST predictions had somewhat reduced discriminative power relative to direct moisture in predicting the probability of sustained flaming based on our field observations. Our results speak to the disparity between the fire behaviour modeling that occurs in the laboratory and the fire behavior modeling that occurs in the field, as the methodology permitted comparison of predictions from sustained flaming models that were developed for one experimental setting and applied to the other. © 2015 National Research Council of Canada.

AB  - The world food supply has become dependent on synthetic fertilizer from ammonia, which comes from the Haber–Bosch process. This process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. The excessive use of synthetic fixed nitrogen fertilizers has led to severe environmental effects, but fixed nitrogen is essential to the sustainability of biofuels. Nitrogen fertilizers are also required for biotic carbon capture schemes like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and soil carbon sequestration. Ammonia has been proposed as a non-carbon emitting alternative fuel that has many advantages over hydrogen. Organic agriculture and nitrogen recovery from waste streams may only partially reduce the demand for synthetic fixed nitrogen. Social solutions like population stabilization may be the best solution for the food supply problem, but ammonia is an enabling technology for alternative fuels and carbon sequestration. Alternative processes for nitrogen fixation are very early in development. This paper offers the viewpoint that alternative means of nitrogen fixation and the wise use of fixed nitrogen need to be developed quickly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB  - A global computable general equilibrium model is used to analyze the economic impacts of rising oil prices with endogenously determined availability of biofuels to mitigate those impacts. The negative effects on the global economy are comparable to those found in other studies, but the impacts are unevenly distributed across countries/regions or sectors. The agricultural sectors of high-income countries, which are relatively energy intensive, would suffer more from a rising oil prices than that in lower-income countries, whereas the reverse is true for the impacts across manufacturing sectors. The impacts are especially strong for oil importers with relatively energy-intensive manufacturing and trade, such as India and China. While the availability of biofuels does mitigate some of the negative impacts of rising oil prices, the benefit is small because capacity of biofuels to economically substitute for fossil fuels on a large scale remains limited. © 2015.

AB  - Microbial lipids offer a promising feedstock for renewable biofuels. However, one of the major concerns with their conversion from lipids into suitable fuels is the high sterol content of the lipid. This is especially problematic for lipids obtained from oleaginous yeasts, as there are some indications that the sterol content could inhibit catalyst performance during hydrotreating. In this investigation a sterol-rich model feedstock (a 50:50 mixture of cholesterol and rapeseed oil, "RC50") and an unrefined microbial lipid derived from the oleaginous yeast Metschkownia pulcherrima were converted to a diesel-like fuel in a single step via catalytic cracking. Far from reducing catalyst performance the cracking of the sterol groups liberated hydrogen, resulting in a reduction in the olefin content as well as an increase in the aromatic content of the fuel. The cracking of RC50 over Pd/C resulted in a fuel with a comparable product distribution to ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD), with high levels of linear alkanes and approximately 10 wt% aromatics. Cracking of unrefined yeast lipid over Pd/C was shown to result in an energy dense, hydrocarbon fuel suitable for marine applications (unblended) or a road transport fuel at 50% v/v blends with ULSD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The future of microalgae as a sustainable feedstock for biofuel and other products is still uncertain. Although productivity and environmental benefits surpass that of many other types of feedstock, the associated costs with production and downstream processing hinder this type of technology. The microalgae biorefinery approach addresses many of these issues in which upstream and downstream processes are important. Upstream technologies associated to nutrient recovery from waste effluents have been reviewed and discussed. Potentially, waste-derived nutrients will enable the formulation of optimal growth media from wastewater at lower costs. Microalgae dewatering is still seen as a major burden. A thorough review of the associated membrane processes in the literature has highlighted lack of consistency in terms of the influence of pore size and membrane materials. Moreover, only very few pilot-scale cost estimates could be found. The fractionation of microalgae products is perhaps the less developed area in the context of a microalgae biorefinery. Membrane filtration for the recovery of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates from microalgae is still an infant technology and major developments are expected to take place within the next few years. This review highlights the achievements, potential and future challenges of integrating membrane technology into microalgae-based biorefineries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On one hand, n-butanol as a potential alternative bio-fuel is accepted more and more attention presently in the fields of both scientific research and commercial market; on the other hand, some n-butanol's (or its mixtures blended with conventional fossil fuels) combustion properties, especially the flame propagation characteristic, are still unknown widely or profoundly, especially under the ICE (internal combustion engine) operating conditions. Within these conditions, pressure and temperature are two critical factors affecting the flame's propagation characteristic. Driven by these facts, in this study, we investigated the laminar flame characteristics of n-butanol, iso-octane and their blends by simulations. First, the experimental data on n-butanol's laminar burning velocity were collected, and the development of n-butanol's chemical kinetic mechanisms was reviewed. Then, the mechanisms used in this study can be chosen, and the numerical results can be validated by experimental data. Based on this, we extended the condition range, which is limited in experimental measurements, to that of realistic applications by numerical method; besides, correlations including the influences of pressure and temperature are developed and extended to consider the mixture fuel blended between n-butanol and iso-octane (which represents the gasoline in SL, laminar burning velocity), this is useful to use the alcohol fuels for SI (spark-ignition) engines in an even better fashion; furthermore, their correlated parameters were resolved carefully through a wide range of data. From results, our correlations are sufficient in accuracy to describe the effects mentioned above. Within each effect, for better understanding the apparent influence on SL, the effects of thermal, density ratio and chemical kinetic are discussed respectively. In addition, our correlations were compared to those in literature widely; these comparisons suggested that the inherent law of laminar flames of fuels still deserves more attentions and investigations. Our investigation is expected to make a step on the understanding of this field. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identifying renewable energy alternatives in transport is particularly complicated, since the end-user can vary from a single-person car to a cargo ship. The aim of this paper is to aid this process by comparing 7 different methods for producing transport fuels in terms of the resources required, the conversion processes used, the fuel obtained, and the transport demand met. The results indicate that electricity should be prioritised as a transport fuel in the future since it is the most efficient and cheapest pathway. However, since electricity is not suitable for all modes of transport, some form of energy dense fuel is also necessary. The results in this paper suggest that this fuel will be produced by hydrogenating either biomass or carbon dioxide, depending on the residual biomass available. Biomass gasification, steam electrolysis, and carbon capture are key technologies in the future for these fuels. Based on the assumptions in this study, some of the renewable fuels proposed here would be cheaper than oil in the year 2050. However, this is based on fuel production costs only and does do not consider other key costs, such as the infrastructure costs, which will be considered in the future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work investigates the design and modeling of fully integrated processes which utilize renewable feedstocks as raw materials by evaluating alternative technology options and possible process integrations to select the optimal configuration according to calculated process yields and economic profit criteria. The analysis is carried out by exploiting the advantages of process simulation and a novel hybrid optimization framework which includes a two layer optimization strategy composed of strategic and operational level decisions. Additionally, an integrated software platform is developed to incorporate experimentally-derived kinetics of complex biological reactions in process simulation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an advanced biofuel production facility which has alternative technology choices for each section of the plant is utilized. The results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, and an optimal configuration for a lignocellulosic biorefinery is obtained. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Thermobifida fusca is a cellulolytic bacterium with potential to be used as a platform organism for sustainable industrial production of biofuels, pharmaceutical ingredients and other bioprocesses due to its capability of potential to convert plant biomass to value-added chemicals. To best develop T. fusca as a bioprocess organism, it is important to understand its native cellular processes. In the current study, we characterize the metabolic network of T. fusca through reconstruction of a genome-scale metabolic model and proteomics data. The overall goal of this study was to use multiple metabolic models generated by different methods and comparison to experimental data to gain a high-confidence understanding of the T. fusca metabolic network. Results: We report the generation of three versions of a metabolic model of Thermobifida fusca sp. XY developed using three different approaches (automated, semi-automated, and proteomics-derived). The model closest to in vivo growth was the proteomics-derived model that consists of 975 reactions involving 1382 metabolites and account for 316 EC numbers (296 genes). The model was optimized for biomass production with the optimal flux of 0.48 doublings per hour when grown on cellobiose with a substrate uptake rate of 0.25 mmole/h. In vivo activity of the DXP pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis was also confirmed using real-time PCR. Conclusions:iTfu296 provides a platform to understand and explore the metabolic capabilities of the actinomycete T. fusca for the potential use in bioprocess industries for the production of biofuel and pharmaceutical ingredients. By comparing different model reconstruction methods, the use of high-throughput proteomics data as a starting point proved to be the most accurate to in vivo growth. © 2014 Vanee et al.

AB  - Mobile distributed pyrolysis facilities have been proposed for delivery of a forest residue resource to bio-fuel facilities. This study examines the costs of producing hydrogen or synthetic petrol (gasoline) and diesel from feedstock produced by mobile facilities (bio-oil, bio-slurry, torrefied wood). Results show that using these feedstock can provide fuels at costs competitive to conventional bio-fuel production methods using gasification of a woodchip feedstock. Using a bio-oil feedstock in combination with bio-oil steam reforming or bio-oil upgrading can produce hydrogen or petrol and diesel at costs of 3.25 $ kg-1 or 0.86 $ litre-1, respectively, for optimally sized bio-fuel facilities. When compared on an energy basis ($ GJ-1), hydrogen production costs tend to be lower than those for synthetic petrol or diesel production across a variety of bio-fuel production pathways. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB  - Water scarcity conditions over the 21st century both globally and regionally are assessed in the context of climate change and climate mitigation policies, by estimating both water availability and water demand within the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a leading community-integrated assessment model of energy, agriculture, climate, and water. To quantify changes in future water availability, a new gridded water-balance global hydrologic model - namely, the Global Water Availability Model (GWAM) - is developed and evaluated. Global water demands for six major demand sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic, electricity generation, primary energy production, and manufacturing) are modeled in GCAM at the regional scale (14 geopolitical regions, 151 sub-regions) and then spatially downscaled to 0.5° × 0.5° resolution to match the scale of GWAM. Using a baseline scenario (i.e., no climate change mitigation policy) with radiative forcing reaching 8.8 W mĝ̂'2 (equivalent to the SRES A1Fi emission scenario) and three climate policy scenarios with increasing mitigation stringency of 7.7, 5.5, and 4.2 W mĝ̂'2 (equivalent to the SRES A2, B2, and B1 emission scenarios, respectively), we investigate the effects of emission mitigation policies on water scarcity. Two carbon tax regimes (a universal carbon tax (UCT) which includes land use change emissions, and a fossil fuel and industrial emissions carbon tax (FFICT) which excludes land use change emissions) are analyzed. The baseline scenario results in more than half of the world population living under extreme water scarcity by the end of the 21st century. Additionally, in years 2050 and 2095, 36% (28%) and 44% (39%) of the global population, respectively, is projected to live in grid cells (in basins) that will experience greater water demands than the amount of available water in a year (i.e., the water scarcity index (WSI) > 1.0). When comparing the climate policy scenarios to the baseline scenario while maintaining the same baseline socioeconomic assumptions, water scarcity declines under a UCT mitigation policy but increases with a FFICT mitigation scenario by the year 2095, particularly with more stringent climate mitigation targets. Under the FFICT scenario, water scarcity is projected to increase, driven by higher water demands for bio-energy crops. © Author(s) 2014. CC Attribution 3.0 License.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol can achieve estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions greater than 80% relative to gasoline, largely as a result of the combustion of lignin for process heat and electricity in biorefineries. Most studies assume lignin is combusted onsite, but exporting lignin to be cofired at coal power plants has the potential to substantially reduce biorefinery capital costs. We assess the life-cycle GHG emissions, water use, and capital costs associated with four representative biorefinery test cases. Each case is evaluated in the context of a U.S. national scenario in which corn stover, wheat straw, and Miscanthus are converted to 1.4 EJ (60 billion liters) of ethanol annually. Life-cycle GHG emissions range from 4.7 to 61 g CO2e/MJ of ethanol (compared with ≈95 g CO2e/MJ of gasoline), depending on biorefinery configurations and marginal electricity sources. Exporting lignin can achieve GHG emission reductions comparable to onsite combustion in some cases, reduce life-cycle water consumption by up to 40%, and reduce combined heat and power-related capital costs by up to 63%. However, nearly 50% of current U.S. coal-fired power generating capacity is expected to be retired by 2050, which will limit the capacity for lignin cofiring and may double transportation distances between biorefineries and coal power plants. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season rhizomatous perennial grass that can tolerate diverse abiotic stresses while yielding relatively high biomass, and is considered a leading biofuel feedstock for marginal lands. Nitrogen (N) is crucial for the growth and development of switchgrass, and its tolerance to low N supply and high N use efficiency are very important for its production under poor conditions. The large-scale planting of switchgrass on marginal lands could be an effective approach to solving the problem of feedstock supply for biomass energy. This study used a hydroponic experiment to evaluate the effect of N deficiency on switchgrass seedlings. Three N treatments (0, 0.15, and 1.50 mmol L− 1 Hoagland's solution) and six cultivars were used, three of each ecotype (upland and lowland). The results showed that biomass, leaf area, root surface area, net photosynthesis, and total chlorophyll content significantly decreased under low N treatments compared with those in full strength Hoagland's nutrient solution. However, once established, all plants survived extreme N stress (0 mmol L− 1) and, to some extent, were productive. Cultivar Kanlow performed best of the six cultivars under stress. Significant interactions between stress treatment and cultivars showed that breeding for cultivars with high yield and superior performance under N deficiency is warranted. The lowland outperformed the upland ecotypes under stress, suggesting that lowland cultivars may survive and be productive under a wider range of stress conditions. However, given the better adaptability of lowland ecotypes to hydroponic cultivation, further study is needed. © 2014 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS

AB  - Biofuel cropping systems are considered a potential source of renewable energy and an integral component of a sustainable energy policy. The type of biofuel crop selected for production has the capacity to substantially alter landscape composition, affecting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. To understand how increasing production of perennial grasses for biofuels may affect pollinators and pollination services, we identified 20 agricultural fields that varied in their proportion of surrounding grassland cover. Bees and pollination services were measured at each site to determine how bee abundance, diversity, and community composition responded to increasing proportions of grassland, and to quantify how pollination services changed as the proportion of grassland increased in the landscape. Bees were collected from sentinel sunflowers, and pollination services were measured by comparing seed set from open and closed sunflowers at each site. Landscape composition had a significant effect on bee abundance, diversity, and community composition with a greater abundance of bees and a more diverse bee community found visiting flowers at sites with more of the surrounding landscape in perennial grassland. In contrast, the bee community in low grassland sites was dominated by Apis mellifera, suggesting that pollination in these landscapes may be more sensitive to declines in this species. Despite these differences, the level of sunflower pollination was similar across sites, even though the bee community responded to changes in landscape composition. Increasing grassland cover through the addition of perennial biofuel plantings would be expected to support a more diverse bee community and a greater abundance of bees, yielding reliable pollination services. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) based biofuel supply chain model with multi-conversion pathways. This model was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which took economic, energy, and environmental criteria (3E) into consideration. The economic objective was measured by the total annual profit. The energy objective was measured by using the average fossil energy input per megajoule (MJ) of biofuel. The environmental objective was measured by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MJ of biofuel. After carefully consideration of the current situation in China, we chose to examine three conversion pathways: bio-ethanol (BE), bio-methanol (BM) and bio-diesel (BD). LCA was integrated to a multi-objective supply chain model by dividing each pathway into several individual parts and analyzing each part. The multi-objective MILP problem was solved using a ε-constraint method by defining the total annual profit as the optimization objective and assigning the average fossil energy input per MJ biofuel and GHG emissions per MJ biofuel as constraints. This model was then used to design an experimental biofuel supply chain for China. A surface of the Pareto optimal solutions was obtained by linear interpolation of the non-inferior solutions. The optimal results included the choice of optimal conversion pathway, biomass type, biomass locations, facility locations, and network topology structure in the biofuel supply chain. Distributed and centralized systems were also factored into our experimental system design. In addition, the influence of price change on the optimal solutions was investigated. The optimal solutions obtained in this study reveal a tradeoff between the impact of the 3E criteria. These results indicate that our model will be extremely useful for the design and planning of biofuel supply chains in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The European Union has made it a strategic objective to develop its biofuels market in order to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to help mitigate climate change and to address energy insecurity within the transport sector. Despite targets set at national and supranational levels, lignocellulosic bioethanol production has yet to be widely commercialized in the European Union. Here, we use techno-economic modeling to compare the price of bioethanol produced from short rotation coppice (SRC) poplar feedstocks under two leading processing technologies in five European countries. Results: Our evaluation shows that the type of processing technology and varying national costs between countries results in a wide range of bioethanol production prices (0.275 to 0.727/l). The lowest production prices for bioethanol were found in countries that had cheap feedstock costs and high prices for renewable electricity. Taxes and other costs had a significant influence on fuel prices at the petrol station, and therefore the presence and amount of government support for bioethanol was a major factor determining the competitiveness of bioethanol with conventional fuel. In a forward-looking scenario, genetically engineering poplar with a reduced lignin content showed potential to enhance the competitiveness of bioethanol with conventional fuel by reducing overall costs by approximately 41% in four out of the five countries modeled. However, the possible wider phenotypic traits of advanced poplars needs to be fully investigated to ensure that these do not unintentionally negate the cost savings indicated. Conclusions: Through these evaluations, we highlight the key bottlenecks within the bioethanol supply chain from the standpoint of various stakeholders. For producers, technologies that are best suited to the specific feedstock composition and national policies should be optimized. For policymakers, support schemes that benefit emerging bioethanol producers and allow renewable fuel to be economically competitive with petrol should be established. Finally, for researchers, better control over plant genetic engineering and advanced breeding and its consequential economic impact would bring valuable contributions towards developing an economically sustainable bioethanol market within the European Union. © 2014 Littlewood et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the effects on climate and air pollution of open biomass burning (BB) when heat and moisture fluxes, gases and aerosols (including black and brown carbon, tar balls, and reflective particles), cloud absorption effects (CAEs) I and II, and aerosol semidirect and indirect effects on clouds are treated. It also examines the climate impacts of most anthropogenic heat and moisture fluxes (AHFs and AMFs). Transient 20 year simulations indicate BB may cause a net global warming of ~0.4 K because CAE I (~32% of BB warming), CAE II, semidirect effects, AHFs (~7%), AMFs, and aerosol absorption outweigh direct aerosol cooling and indirect effects, contrary to previous BB studies that did not treat CAEs, AHFs, AMFs, or brown carbon. Some BB warming can be understood in terms of the anticorrelation between instantaneous direct radiative forcing (DRF) changes and surface temperature changes in clouds containing absorbing aerosols. BB may cause ~250,000 (73,000–435,000) premature mortalities/yr, with &gt;90% from particles. AHFs from all sources and AMFs + AHFs from power plants and electricity use each may cause a statistically significant +0.03 K global warming. Solar plus thermal-IR DRFs were +0.033 (+0.027) W/m2 for all AHFs globally without (with) evaporating cooling water, +0.009 W/m2 for AMFs globally, +0.52 W/m2 (94.3% solar) for all-source BC outside of clouds plus interstitially between cloud drops at the cloud relative humidity, and +0.06 W/m2 (99.7% solar) for BC inclusions in cloud hydrometeor particles. Modeled post-1850 biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel burning, AHFs, AMFs, and urban surfaces accounted for most observed global warming. © 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Expansion of oil palm plantations has led to extensive wildlife habitat conversion in Southeast Asia [1]. This expansion is driven by a global demand for palm oil for products ranging from foods to detergents [2], and more recently for biofuels [3]. The negative impacts of oil palm development on biodiversity [1, 4, 5], and on orangutans (Pongo spp.) in particular, have been well documented [6, 7] and publicized [8, 9]. Although the oil palm is of African origin, Africa's production historically lags behind that of Southeast Asia. Recently, significant investments have been made that will likely drive the expansion of Africa's oil palm industry [10]. There is concern that this will lead to biodiversity losses similar to those in Southeast Asia. Here, we analyze the potential impact of oil palm development on Africa's great apes. Current great ape distribution in Africa substantially overlaps with current oil palm concessions (by 58.7%) and areas suitable for oil palm production (by 42.3%). More importantly, 39.9% of the distribution of great ape species on unprotected lands overlaps with suitable oil palm areas. There is an urgent need to develop guidelines for the expansion of oil palm in Africa to minimize the negative effects on apes and other wildlife. There is also a need for research to support land use decisions to reconcile economic development, great ape conservation, and avoiding carbon emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Using subregional models of crop production choices in centralWisconsin and southwest Michigan, we predict biomass production, land use, and environmental impacts with details that are unavailable from national scale models. When biomass prices are raised exogenously, we find that the subregional models overestimate the supply, the land use, and the beneficial environmental aspects of perennial biomass crops. Multi-market price feedbacks tied to realistic policy parameters predict high threshold absolute prices for biomass to enter production, resulting in intensified production of biomass from annual grain crops with damaging environmental impacts. Multi-market feedbacks also predict regional specialization in energy biomass production in areas with lower yields of food crops. Policies promoting biofuels will not necessarily generate environmental benefits in the absence of environmental regulations. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Pyrolysis or combustion of waste wood can provide a renewable source of energy and produce byproducts which can be recycled back to land. To be sustainable requires that these byproducts pose minimal threat to the environment or human health. Frequently, reclaimed waste wood is contaminated by preservative-treated timber containing high levels of heavy metals. We investigated the effect of feedstock contamination from copper-preservative treated wood on the behaviour of pyrolysis-derived biochar and combustion-derived ash in plant-soil systems. Biochar and wood ash were applied to soil at typical agronomic rates. The presence of preservative treated timber in the feedstock increased available soil Cu; however, critical Cu guidance limits were only exceeded at high rates of feedstock contamination. Negative effects on plant growth and soil quality were only seen at high levels of biochar contamination (>50% derived from preservative-treated wood). Negative effects of wood ash contamination were apparent at lower levels of contamination (>10% derived from preservative treated wood). Complete removal of preservative treated timber from wood recycling facilities is notoriously difficult and low levels of contamination are commonplace. We conclude that low levels of contamination from Cu-treated wood should pose minimal environmental risk to biochar and ash destined for land application. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Industrial residues, such as fly ashes and biosolids, contain elements (e.g., N, P, K, S, Ca and Zn) that make them a viable alternative for synthetic fertilizers in forestry and agriculture. However, the use of these materials is often limited due to the presence of potentially toxic substances. It is therefore necessary to assess and, when warranted, modify the chemical and physical form of these and similar waste materials before any advantages are taken of their beneficial properties. Biofuel fly ash, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash, biosolids, peat, peat residues and gypsum board waste were combined in various proportions, and this resulted in increased leaching of N, P, S, Cu and Mn, but decreased leaching of Ca, K, Mg, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Al, As and Pb. Chemical fractionation revealed that elements Ca, K, Mg, S and Mn were predominantly exchangeable, while the rest of the elements were less mobile. Cadmium was mostly exchangeable in MSWI fly ash, but less mobile in biofuel fly ash mixtures. Recycling of MSWI fly ash in the mixtures with fertilizers is considerably less attractive, due to the high levels of salts and exchangeable Cd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of animal manure in biogas digesters has shown promise as a technology in reducing the microbial load to safe and recommended levels. We sought to treat dairy manure obtained from the Fort Hare Dairy Farm by investigating the survival rates of bacterial pathogens, through a total viable plate count method, before, during and after mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Different microbiological media were inoculated with different serial dilutions of manure samples that were withdrawn from the biogas digester at 3, 7 and 14 day intervals to determine the viable cells. Data obtained indicated that the pathogens of public health importance were 90%-99% reduced in the order: Campylobacter sp. (18 days) &lt; Escherichia coli sp. (62 days) &lt; Salmonella sp. (133 days) from a viable count of 10.1 × 103, 3.6 × 105, 7.4 × 103 to concentrations below the detection limit (DL = 102 cfu/g manure), respectively. This disparity in survival rates may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of these bacteria, available nutrients as well as the stages of the anaerobic digestion process. In addition, the highest p-value i.e., 0.957 for E. coli showed the statistical significance of its model and the strongest correlation between its reductions with days of digestion. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the specific bacterial pathogens in manure can be considerably reduced through anaerobic digestion after 133 days. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Siberian apricot, an economically and ecologically important plant in China, contains seeds high in oil and can grow on marginal land. Although this species has multiple purposes and may be a feedstock of biofuel in China, transcriptome information and molecular research on this species remain limited. RNA-Seq technology has been widely applied to transcriptomics, genomics and the development of molecular markers, and functional gene studies. In this study, we obtained 1,243,067 high-quality reads with a mean size of 425. bp in a single run, totaling 528.4. Mb of sequence data using 454 GS FLX Titanium sequencing. All reads were assembled de novo into 46,940 unigenes with a mean size of 651. bp (range: 45-5566. bp). Assembled unigenes were annotated in multiple public databases based on similarity alignments to genes and proteins. 191 unigenes involving in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism were found, among them, expression patterns of two desaturase enzymes were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), based on six tissues from Siberian apricot, the seeds had the highest expression. 7304 simple sequence repeats (SSR) were identified from 6509 unigenes, a total of 9930 primer pairs were designed, 50 primer pairs were randomly selected to validate of the usefulness, and 24 (48%) primer pairs produced bands of the expected size. These data provide a base of sequence information to improve agronomic characters and molecular marker-assisted breeding to alter the composition of fatty acids in seeds from this plant, and hence, facilitate its utilization as a future biodiesel feedstock. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Growing interest in cellulolytic clostridia with potential for consolidated biofuels production is mitigated by low conversion of raw substrates to desired end products. Strategies to improve conversion are likely to benefit from emerging techniques to define molecular systems biology of these organisms. Clostridium stercorarium DSM8532T is an anaerobic thermophile with demonstrated high ethanol production on cellulose and hemicellulose. Although several lignocellulolytic enzymes in this organism have been well-characterized, details concerning carbohydrate transporters and central metabolism have not been described. Therefore, the goal of this study is to define an improved whole genome sequence (WGS) for this organism using in-depth molecular profiling by RNA-seq transcriptomics and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Results: A paired-end Roche/454 WGS assembly was closed through application of an in silico algorithm designed to resolve repetitive sequence regions, resulting in a circular replicon with one gap and a region of 2 kilobases with 10 ambiguous bases. RNA-seq transcriptomics resulted in nearly complete coverage of the genome, identifying errors in homopolymer length attributable to 454 sequencing. Peptide sequences resulting from high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested protein extracts were mapped to 1,755 annotated proteins (68% of all protein-coding regions). Proteogenomic analysis confirmed the quality of annotation and improvement pipelines, identifying a missing gene and an alternative reading frame. Peptide coverage of genes hypothetically involved in substrate hydrolysis, transport and utilization confirmed multiple pathways for glycolysis, pyruvate conversion and recycling of intermediates. No sequences homologous to transaldolase, a central enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, were observed by any method, despite demonstrated growth of this organism on xylose and xylan hemicellulose.Conclusions: Complementary omics techniques confirm the quality of genome sequence assembly, annotation and error-reporting. Nearly complete genome coverage by RNA-seq likely indicates background DNA in RNA extracts, however these preps resulted in WGS enhancement and transcriptome profiling in a single Illumina run. No detection of transaldolase by any method despite xylose utilization by this organism indicates an alternative pathway for sedoheptulose-7-phosphate degradation. This report combines next-generation omics techniques to elucidate previously undefined features of substrate transport and central metabolism for this organism and its potential for consolidated biofuels production from lignocellulose. © 2014 Schellenberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A few years ago many analysts became aware of the bioenergy production potentials of the African agricultural sector to foster economic growth and create jobs. Unleashing such potential however requires stakeholders to deal beforehand with issues related to land, biofuels, food, and environmental policies. The objective of this study is to explore the conditions under which African countries can reap the benefits of the new bio-economy without jeopardizing food security and environmental quality. The study shows that land policies that set land rental at its marginal cost to businesses, biofuel policies that create demand through biofuels mandate, and environmental policies that encourage best management practices must be first put in place. Subsequently, African countries must participate to the capital investment in the biofuel sector. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This contribution addresses the multi-period synthesis of an optimally integrated regional biomass and bioenergy supply network through a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) approach. The production processes from different sources of biomass include first, second, and third generations of biofuels like bioethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, Fischer Tropsch diesel, and green gasoline. The aim is to maximize the sustainably viable utilization of resources by accounting for the competition between fuels and food production. An MILP model for efficient bioenergy network optimization based on four layers is extended to include several features, such as seasonality and availability of resources, enabling recycles of products and total site heat integration in order to address real-world applications with a systematic decision-making approach. The multi-period optimization of a heat-integrated biorefinery's supply network is performed through maximization of the economic performance. Economically efficient solutions are obtained with optimal selection of raw materials, technologies, intermediate and final product flows, and reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article describes the key challenges and opportunities in modeling and optimization of biomass-to-bioenergy supply chains. It reviews the major energy pathways from terrestrial and aquatic biomass to bioenergy/biofuel products as well as power and heat with an emphasis on "drop-in" liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Key components of the bioenergy supply chains are then presented, along with a comprehensive overview and classification of the existing contributions on biofuel/bioenergy supply chain optimization. This paper identifies fertile avenues for future research that focuses on multi-scale modeling and optimization, which allows the integration across spatial scales from unit operations to biorefinery processes and to biofuel value chains, as well as across temporal scales from operational level to strategic level. Perspectives on future biofuel supply chains that integrate with petroleum refinery supply chains and/or carbon capture and sequestration systems are presented. Issues on modeling of sustainability and the treatment of uncertainties in bioenergy supply chain optimization are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: A complex community of microorganisms is responsible for efficient plant cell wall digestion by many herbivores, notably the ruminants. Understanding the different fibrolytic mechanisms utilized by these bacteria has been of great interest in agricultural and technological fields, reinforced more recently by current efforts to convert cellulosic biomass to biofuels. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we have used a bioinformatics-based approach to explore the cellulosome-related components of six genomes from two of the primary fiber-degrading bacteria in the rumen: Ruminococcus flavefaciens (strains FD-1, 007c and 17) and Ruminococcus albus (strains 7, 8 and SY3). The genomes of two of these strains are reported for the first time herein. The data reveal that the three R. flavefaciens strains encode for an elaborate reservoir of cohesin- and dockerin-containing proteins, whereas the three R. albus strains are cohesin-deficient and encode mainly dockerins and a unique family of cell-anchoring carbohydrate-binding modules (family 37). Conclusions/ Significance: Our comparative genome-wide analysis pinpoints rare and novel strain-specific protein architectures and provides an exhaustive profile of their numerous lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. This work provides blueprints of the divergent cellulolytic systems in these two prominent fibrolytic rumen bacterial species, each of which reflects a distinct mechanistic model for efficient degradation of cellulosic biomass. © 2014 Dassa et al.

AB  - Catch crops are grown in crop rotation primarily for soil stabilization. The excess biomass of catch crops was investigated for its potential as feedstock for biogas production. Ten variables affecting catch crop growth and methane potential were evaluated. Field trials and methane potential were studied for 14 different catch crops species, with 19 samples harvested in 2010 and 36 harvested in 2011. Principal component analysis was applied to the data to identify the variables characterizing the potential for the different catch crops species for methane production. Two principal components explained up to 84.6% and 71.6% of the total variation for 2010 and 2011 samples, respectively. Specific methane yield, climate conditions (rainfall and temperature) and total nitrogen in the biomass were the variables classifying the different catch crops. Catch crops in the Brassicaceae and Graminaceae botanical families showed the highest methane yield. This study demonstrates the importance of the crop species when choosing a suitable catch crop for biogas production. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus, a widely planted biofeedstock, is generally regarded as a relatively low invasion concern. As a seed-infertile species, it lacks a consistent mechanism of long-distance dispersal, a key contributor to invasion rate, and constitutes a low risk for cultivation escape. However, agricultural production shelters plants from stochasticity and increases propagule pressure, enhancing the potential for low-risk species to take advantage of rare dispersal opportunities. Weed risk assessments of M. × giganteus assume the rarity of events such as scouring and flooding that would facilitate secondary dispersal of vegetative rhizome fragments and the long-term sexual inviability of escapes. Combining data from small-scale rhizome fragmentation and movement experiments, and estimates from the literature, we parameterized an individual-based model to examine M. × giganteus spread given three dispersal scenarios. We further evaluated our estimates in response to different field edge buffer widths and monitoring intensities, two key strategies advised for containing biofuel crops. We found that clonal expansion from the field edge alone was sufficient to allow the crop to outgrow buffers of 3 m or less within 11 to 15 yr with low monitoring intensities. Further, models that included the possibility of rhizome dispersal from fields and scouring at field edges demonstrate the potential for long-distance dispersal and establishment with inadequate management. Our study highlights the importance of considering minimum enforced management guidelines for growers to maintain the ecological integrity of the agricultural landscape. Nomenclature: Giant Miscanthus, Miscanthus × giganteus J. M. Greef and Deuter ex Hodk. and Renvoize. Management Implications: Previous assessments of low invasion risk for sterile Miscanthus × giganteus are contingent on the rarity of events that would disperse plant rhizomes from the field edge. Our results demonstrate the importance of implementing monitoring strategies, augmented by field edge buffers that increase detection likelihood, to contain the invasion risk from large-scale cultivation of M. × giganteus. Early detection is key to increasing the success and decreasing the cost of invasive species control. Although opportunities for rhizomes to disperse should be rare, the accumulation of infrequent escapes from large-scale cultivation should be a matter of concern. The combination of field edge buffers and consistent monitoring should form a feasible strategy for containing cultivated plant escapes. © Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - Background: Clostridium clariflavum is an anaerobic, thermophilic, Gram-positive bacterium, capable of growth on crystalline cellulose as a single carbon source. The genome of C. clariflavum has been sequenced to completion, and numerous cellulosomal genes were identified, including putative scaffoldin and enzyme subunits.
Results: Bioinformatic analysis of the C. clariflavum genome revealed 49 cohesin modules distributed on 13 different scaffoldins and 79 dockerin-containing proteins, suggesting an abundance of putative cellulosome assemblies. The 13-scaffoldin system of C. clariflavum is highly reminiscent of the proposed cellulosome system of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. Analysis of the C. clariflavum type I dockerin sequences indicated a very high level of conservation, wherein the putative recognition residues are remarkably similar to those of A. cellulolyticus. The numerous interactions among the cellulosomal components were elucidated using a standardized affinity ELISA-based fusion-protein system. The results revealed a rather simplistic recognition pattern of cohesin-dockerin interaction, whereby the type I and type II cohesins generally recognized the dockerins of the same type. The anticipated exception to this rule was the type I dockerin of the ScaB adaptor scaffoldin which bound selectively to the type I cohesins of ScaC and ScaJ.
Conclusions: The findings reveal an intricate picture of predicted cellulosome assemblies in C. clariflavum. The network of cohesin-dockerin pairs provides a thermophilic alternative to those of C. thermocellum and a basis for subsequent utilization of the C. clariflavum cellulosomal system for biotechnological application. © 2014Artzi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - As an alternative transportation fuel to petrodiesel, biodiesel has been promoted within national energy portfolio targets across the world. Early estimations of low lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biodiesel were a driver behind extensive government support in the form of financial incentives for the industry. However, studies consistently report a high degree of uncertainty in these emissions estimates, raising questions concerning the carbon benefits of biodiesel. Furthermore, the implications of feedstock blending on GHG emissions uncertainty have not been explicitly addressed despite broad practice by the industry to meet fuel quality standards and to control costs. This work investigated the impact of feedstock blending on the characteristics of biodiesel by using a chance-constrained (CC) blend optimization method. The objective of the optimization is minimization of feedstock costs subject to fuel standards and emissions constraints. Results indicate that blending can be used to manage GHG emissions uncertainty characteristics of biodiesel, and to achieve cost reductions through feedstock diversification. Simulations suggest that emissions control policies that restrict the use of certain feedstocks based on their GHG estimates overlook blending practices and benefits, increasing the cost of biodiesel. In contrast, emissions control policies which recognize the multifeedstock nature of biodiesel provide producers with feedstock selection flexibility, enabling them to manage their blend portfolios cost effectively, potentially without compromising fuel quality or emissions reductions. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability of a biofuels industry based on intensively cultivated short rotation woody crops (SRWC) requires spatial predictions of growth and yield under various environmental conditions and across large regions. The Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3PG) model was modified to evaluate the growth and yield of coppiced poplar (Populus spp). This included an additional biomass partitioning method and developing a sub-model which takes into account the impact of coppicing on post harvest regeneration, extending the applicability of the 3PG model to coppice management regimes. The parameterized model was applied to the entire Pacific Northwest of the United States, using appropriate climate and soil input data. Results predict the yield of poplar cultivation at a spatial resolution of ≈64 km2 throughout the ≈8,000,000 km2 of the study region. Existing agricultural cultivation patterns were used to estimate regional water availability for irrigation, and for non-irrigated regions, land cover features including ownership, slope, soil salinity and water table depth where used to select areas with a real potential to support a SRWC plantation. Results can be integrated with other models that allow for optimizing crop selection and biorefinery site selection. Important results include; an updated 3PG model for coppiced SRWC plantings, estimates of biomass feedstock yields under different irrigation patterns and weather conditions, and estimates for feedstock availability when combined with crop adoption scenarios.

AB  - Nannochloropsis spp. are a group of oleaginous microalgae that harbor an expanded array of lipid-synthesis related genes, yet how they are transcriptionally regulated remains unknown. Here a phylogenomic approach was employed to identify and functionally annotate the transcriptional factors (TFs) and TF binding-sites (TFBSs) in N. oceanica IMET1. Among 36 microalgae and higher plants genomes, a two-fold reduction in the number of TF families plus a seven-fold decrease of average family-size in Nannochloropsis, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta were observed. The degree of similarity in TF-family profiles is indicative of the phylogenetic relationship among the species, suggesting co-evolution of TF-family profiles and species. Furthermore, comparative analysis of six Nannochloropsis genomes revealed 68 "most-conserved" TFBS motifs, with 11 of which predicted to be related to lipid accumulation or photosynthesis. Mapping the IMET1 TFs and TFBS motifs to the reference plant TF-"TFBS motif" relationships in TRANSFAC enabled the prediction of 78 TF-"TFBS motif" interaction pairs, which consisted of 34 TFs (with 11 TFs potentially involved in the TAG biosynthesis pathway), 30 TFBS motifs and 2,368 regulatory connections between TFs and target genes. Our results form the basis of further experiments to validate and engineerthe regulatory network of Nannochloropsis spp. for enhanced biofuel production.

AB  - Background: In light of the changes in precipitation and soil water availability expected with climate change, understanding the mechanisms underlying plant responses to water deficit is essential. Toward that end we have conducted an integrative analysis of responses to drought stress in the perennial C4 grass and biofuel crop, Panicum virgatum (switchgrass). Responses to soil drying and re-watering were measured at transcriptional, physiological, and metabolomic levels. To assess the interaction of soil moisture with diel light: dark cycles, we profiled gene expression in drought and control treatments under pre-dawn and mid-day conditions.Results: Soil drying resulted in reduced leaf water potential, gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence along with differential expression of a large fraction of the transcriptome (37%). Many transcripts responded differently depending on time of day (e.g. up-regulation pre-dawn and down-regulation mid-day). Genes associated with C4 photosynthesis were down-regulated during drought, while C4 metabolic intermediates accumulated. Rapid changes in gene expression were observed during recovery from drought, along with increased water use efficiency and chlorophyll fluorescence.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that drought responsive gene expression depends strongly on time of day and that gene expression is extensively modified during the first few hours of drought recovery. Analysis of covariation in gene expression, metabolite abundance, and physiology among plants revealed non-linear relationships that suggest critical thresholds in drought stress responses. Future studies may benefit from evaluating these thresholds among diverse accessions of switchgrass and other C4 grasses. © 2014 Meyer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel production from marine microalgae has received much attention as microalgae can be cultivated on non-arable land without the use of potable water, and with the additional benefits of mitigating CO2 emissions and yielding biomass. However, there is still a lack of effective operational strategies to promote lipid accumulation in marine microalgae, which are suitable for making biodiesel since they are mainly composed of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms involved in lipid biosynthesis in microalgae under environmental stress are not well understood. Results: In this work, the combined effects of salinity and nitrogen depletion stresses on lipid accumulation of a newly isolated marine microalga, Chlamydomonas sp. JSC4, were explored. Metabolic intermediates were profiled over time to observe transient changes during the lipid accumulation triggered by the combination of the two stresses. An innovative cultivation strategy (denoted salinity-gradient operation) was also employed to markedly improve the lipid accumulation and lipid quality of the microalga, which attained an optimal lipid productivity of 223.2 mg L-1 d-1 and a lipid content of 59.4% per dry cell weight. This performance is significantly higher than reported in most related studies. Conclusions: This work demonstrated the synergistic integration of biological and engineering technologies to develop a simple and effective strategy for the enhancement of oil production in marine microalgae. © 2014 Ho et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In this paper the suitability of three perennial, herbaceous, lignocellulosic grasses (Arundo donax, Saccharum spontaneous spp. aegyptiacum and Miscanthus x giganteus) for the production of second-generation bioethanol in semi-arid Mediterranean environment was studied. Crops were established in spring 2002, supplying irrigation and nitrogen fertilization up to 2004/2005 growing season. Subsequently, crops were grown without any agronomic input and harvested annually. Data reported in this paper refers to 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 growing seasons. Aboveground dry matter (DM) yield was higher in Arundo (35.4±2.1 Mg ha-1 in 2009 and 32.2±1.9 Mg ha-1 in 2010 harvest) than in Saccharum (27.3±2.0 and 23.9±1.9 Mg ha-1, respectively) and Miscanthus (19.6±2.8 and 17.2±1.6 Mg ha-1, respectively). Structural polysaccharides of the raw material were higher in Miscanthus (63.4 %w/w) followed by Saccharum (61.5% w/w) and Arundo (57.6% w/w). The same trend was identified for the cellulose content (41.0%, 36.8% and 34.6%, respectively). The highest values in the total hemicellulose complex were observed in Saccharum (24.7%), followed by Arundo (23.1%) and Miscanthus (22.4%). The composition of structural polysaccharides leads to a higher theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) from one dry ton of Miscanthus feedstock (kg DM Mg-1), followed by Saccharum and Arundo. On the other hand, the TEY per unit surface (Mg ha-1) was greater in Arundo than in Saccharum and Miscanthus. When compared to other lignocellulosic sources used in the second-generation bioethanol technology, such as agricultural residues, woody species and other herbaceous perennial crops, Arundo, Saccharum and Miscanthus showed a great potential in terms of TEY ha-1. Given the high levels of biomass yield and composition of structural polysaccharides, the three species might be introduced into the Mediterranean cropping systems to supply lignocellulosic biomass for second-generation industrial plants or bio-refineries. © D.

AB  - Most European vineyard soils exhibit low soil fertility. They are highly vulnerable to erosion, low in soil organic matter content and, therefore, in water holding capacity and nitrate retention. The applications of biochar and biochar-compost are said to address some of these issues. We tested the ability of these amendments to improve soil quality and plant production quality in a 30-year-old vineyard in Valais, Switzerland. The amendments of biochar alone (8tha-1, produced from wood at 500°C), aerobic compost (55tha-1) and biochar-compost (8tha-1+55tha-1, mixed before the composting process) were compared to an un-amended control soil. During the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 various vine and green cover growth, vine health and grape quality parameters were monitored. Biochar and biochar-compost treatments induced only small, economically irrelevant and mostly non-significant effects over the three years. We concluded that topsoil application of higher amounts of biochar has no immediate economic value for vine growing in poor fertility, alkaline, temperate soil. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - An incubation study with four contrasting soils (Vertosol, Ferrosol, Calcarosol and Tenosol) and three biochars (oil mallee [OM-], wheat chaff [W-]) and poultry litter [PL-] all produced at 550°C) applied at 1% w/w to each of the soils was conducted (n = 4). The soils were packed in cylindrical chambers and were subjected to five cycles of four weeks of wetting and four weeks of drying. The soils received 10 atom % 15N-KNO3 - in the 1st and 5th wetting cycles. Two of the four soils (Ferrosol and Tenosol) were applied with labile carbon (C) between the 2nd and 5th wetting cycle, while the other two soils (Vertosol and Calcarosol) were amended with labile C in the 5th wetting cycle only. Peak nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the Tenosol, Ferrosol and Calcarosol occurred within the 1st wetting cycle, whereas the Vertosol without labile C did not emit N2O. However, the co-application of labile C with 15N-NO3 - to the Vertosol in the 5th wetting supported N2O emissions. The greatest reduction in N2O emissions following biochar amendment occurred due to the use of OM-biochar in the Tenosol; which decreased the emissions from 1.95 kg N2O-N ha-1 to 0.58 kg N2O-N ha-1 across the first 4 wetting/drying cycles. The majority of N2O emissions occurred during the first wetting cycle (85% water filled porosity). In contrast, application of PL-biochar did not result in a statistically significant reduction in emission of N2O. Assessing the source of emissions, the initial N2O from the Ferrosol and the Calcarosol was principally from native N-sources, while in the Tenosol between 31-57% of N2O originated from the added NO3 -. While biochars reduced the overall emissions of N2O in the Tenosol, they also reduced the proportion of the N2O originating from the supplied NO3 - during the first wetting cycle, possibly by limiting NO3 - availability to denitrifers. Towards the end of the incubation period bacterial nitrifier gene abundance (amoA) in the unamended Tenosol was lower (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the earlier wetting cycles, a trend which was not evident in the biochar amended Tenosol treatments. The nitric oxide reductase (norB) component of the denitrifier community was not significantly affected by biochar amendment but increased (p &lt; 0.05) with labile C addition in all of the Tenosol treatments (± biochar) in the later stages of the incubation. The Tenosol had the lowest abundance of nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) suggesting that its capacity to further reduce N2O to dinitrogen (N2) was lower than the other soils tested. We hypothesise that biochar amendment lowered emissions of N2O in the Tenosol by providing conditions suitable for nosZ such as increased soil pH and microbial respiration. This was evidenced by higher nosZ gene abundance in the Tenosol amended with biochar, relative to the nil-biochar control. © 2014.

AB  - The use of biofuels for road transport in Sweden has increased during the past 10. years as policymakers stimulate demand in response to concerns about climate change. Using a supply chain approach, this paper analyses: (i) existing biofuel supply chains in Sweden (biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol) in terms of security of supply, and (ii) possibilities to achieve synergies between implementation of climate change mitigation practices and security of supply objectives, through increased production and use of biofuels. We argue that synergies can arise when exposure to upstream market risk decreases, the risk of the feedstock does not correlate with the fuel that it replaces, producers can switch between feedstocks and end user vulnerability to disruptions decreases. In the current Swedish context, the features of the biogas supply chain make it the most beneficial option, followed by biodiesel. In the way it has been implemented, bioethanol is the least favourable option. The paper concludes by outlining how biofuels could contribute to security of supply in the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Jatropha curcas is being promoted as a new bioenergy crop in tropical and subtropical regions due to its high amount of seed oil and its potential capacity to grow on marginal land for biofuel production. However, the productivity of the plant is constrained by the unfavorable flowering time and inflorescence architecture, which render harvesting of seeds time-consuming and labor-intensive. These flowering-related traits have limited further widespread cultivation of Jatropha. Results: We identified a Jatropha curcas homolog of Flowering locus T (JcFT) and demonstrated its function by genetic complementation of the Arabidopsis ft mutant. The JcFT expression level was found to be remarkably correlated with leaf age. Overexpression of JcFT in Jatropha reduced flowering time and altered plant architecture by producing more branches. Grafting experiments suggested that the earlyflowering and alteration of plant architecture traits were graft-transmissible. We also showed that the FT-overexpressing transgenic Jatropha can be used as a root stock for grafting of scions derived from other Jatropha. Conclusion: We generated early flowering transgenic Jatropha plants that accumulate higher levels of the florigen FT. Not only early flowering but also plant growth was affected in JcFT overexpression lines. More seeds can be produced in a shorter time frame by shortening the flowering time in Jatropha, suggesting the possibility to increase seed yield by manipulating the flowering time. © 2014 Ye et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Pollination is a critical ecosystem service affected by various drivers of land-use change, such as policies and programs aimed at land resources, market values for crop commodities, local land-management decisions, and shifts in climate. The United States is the world's most active market for pollination services by honey bees, and the Northern Great Plains provide the majority of bee colonies used to meet the Nation's annual pollination needs. Legislation requiring increased production of biofuel crops, increasing commodity prices for crops of little nutritional value for bees in the Northern Great Plains, and reductions in government programs aimed at promoting land conservation are converging to alter the regional landscape in ways that challenge beekeepers to provide adequate numbers of hives for national pollination services. We developed a spatially explicit model that identifies sites with the potential to support large apiaries based on local-scale land-cover requirements for honey bees. We produced maps of potential apiary locations for North Dakota, a leading producer of honey, based on land-cover maps representing (1) an annual time series compiled from existing operational products and (2) a realistic scenario of land change. We found that existing land-cover products lack sufficient local accuracy to monitor actual changes in landscape suitability for honey bees, but our model proved informative for evaluating effects on suitability under scenarios of land change. The scenario we implemented was aligned with current drivers of land-use change in the Northern Great Plains and highlighted the importance of conservation lands in landscapes intensively and extensively managed for crops.

AB  - Background: Oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria and microalgae have attracted attention as an alternative carbon source for the next generation of biofuels. Glycogen abundantly accumulated in cyanobacteria is a promising feedstock which can be converted to ethanol through saccharification and fermentation processes. In addition, the utilization of marine cyanobacteria as a glycogen producer can eliminate the need for a freshwater supply. Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 is a fast-growing marine coastal euryhaline cyanobacteria, however, the glycogen yield has not yet been determined. In the present study, the effects of light intensity, CO2 concentration, and salinity on the cell growth and glycogen content were investigated in order to maximize glycogen production in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. Results: The optimal culture conditions for glycogen production in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 were investigated. The maximum glycogen production of 3.5 g L-1 for 7 days (a glycogen productivity of 0.5 g L-1 d-1) was obtained under a high light intensity, a high CO2 level, and a nitrogen-depleted condition in brackish water. The glycogen production performance in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 was the best ever reported in the -polyglucan (glycogen or starch) production of cyanobacteria and microalgae. In addition, the robustness of glycogen production in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 to salinity was evaluated in seawater and freshwater. The peak of glycogen production of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 in seawater and freshwater were 3.0 and 1.8 g L-1 in 7 days, respectively. Glycogen production in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 maintained the same level in seawater and half of the level in freshwater compared with the optimal result obtained in brackish water. Conclusions: We conclude that Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 has high glycogen production activity and glycogen can be provided from coastal water accompanied by a fluctuation of salinity. This work supports Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 as a promising carbohydrate source for biofuel production. © 2014 Aikawa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In the current literature, the life cycle, technoeconomic, and resource assessments of microalgae-based biofuel production systems have relied on growth models extrapolated from laboratory-scale data, leading to a large uncertainty in results. This type of simplistic growth modeling overestimates productivity potential and fails to incorporate biological effects, geographical location, or cultivation architecture. This study uses a large-scale, validated, outdoor photobioreactor microalgae growth model based on 21 reactor- and species-specific inputs to model the growth of Nannochloropsis. This model accurately accounts for biological effects such as nutrient uptake, respiration, and temperature and uses hourly historical meteorological data to determine the current global productivity potential. Global maps of the current near-term microalgae lipid and biomass productivity were generated based on the results of annual simulations at 4,388 global locations. Maximum annual average lipid yields between 24 and 27 m3·ha-1·y -1, corresponding to biomass yields of 13 to 15 g·m -2·d-1, are possible in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia. The microalgae lipid productivity results of this study were integrated with geography-specific fuel consumption and land availability data to perform a scalability assessment. Results highlight the promising potential of microalgae-based biofuels compared with traditional terrestrial feedstocks. When water, nutrients, and CO 2 are not limiting, many regions can potentially meet significant fractions of their transportation fuel requirements through microalgae production, without land resource restriction. Discussion focuses on sensitivity of monthly variability in lipid production compared with annual average yields, effects of temperature on productivity, and a comparison of results with previous published modeling assumptions.

AB  - Background: Chlorella is one of the few microalgae employed for human consumption. It typically has a high protein content, but it can also accumulate high amounts of lipids or carbohydrates under stress conditions and, for this reason, it is of interest in the production of biofuels. High production costs and energy consumption are associated with its cultivation. This work describes a strategy to reduce costs and environmental impact of Chlorella biomass production for food, biofuels and other applications. Results: The growth of four Chlorella strains, selected after a laboratory screening, was investigated outdoors in a low-cost 0.25 m2 GWP-II photobioreactor. The capacity of the selected strains to grow at high temperature was tested. On the basis of these results, in the nitrogen starvation trials the culture was cooled only when the temperature exceeded 40°C to allow for significant energy savings, and performed in a seawater-based medium to reduce the freshwater footprint. Under nutrient sufficiency, strain CH2 was the most productive. In all the strains, nitrogen starvation strongly reduced productivity, depressed protein and induced accumulation of carbohydrate (about 50%) in strains F&amp;M-M49 and IAM C-212, and lipid (40 - 45%) in strains PROD1 and CH2. Starved cultures achieved high storage product productivities: 0.12 g L-1 d -1 of lipids for CH2 and 0.19 g L-1 d-1 of carbohydrates for F&amp;M-M49. When extrapolated to large-scale in central Italy, CH2 showed a potential productivity of 41 t ha-1 y -1 for biomass, 16 t ha-1 y-1 for protein and 11 t ha-1 y-1 for lipid under nutrient sufficiency, and 8 t ha-1 y-1 for lipid under nitrogen starvation. Conclusions: The environmental and economic sustainability of Chlorella production was enhanced by growing the organisms in a seawater-based medium, so as not to compete with crops for freshwater, and at high temperatures, so as to reduce energy consumption for cooling. All the four selected strains are good candidates for food or biofuels production in lands unsuitable for conventional agriculture. Chlorella strain CH2 has the potential for more than 80 tonnes of biomass, 32 tonnes of protein and 22 tonnes of lipid per year under favourable climates. © 2014 Guccione et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Coproduction of biofuels with biochar (the carbon-rich solid formed during biomass pyrolysis) can provide carbon-negative bioenergy if the biochar is sequestered in soil, where it can improve fertility and thus simultaneously address issues of food security, soil degradation, energy production, and climate change. However, increasing biochar production entails a reduction in bioenergy obtainable per unit biomass feedstock. Quantification of this trade-off for specific biochar-biofuel pathways has been hampered by lack of an accurate-yet-simple model for predicting yields, product compositions, and energy balances from biomass slow pyrolysis. An empirical model of biomass slow pyrolysis was developed and applied to several pathways for biochar coproduction with gaseous and liquid biofuels. Here, we show that biochar production reduces liquid biofuel yield by at least 21 GJ Mg-1 C (biofuel energy sacrificed per unit mass of biochar C), with methanol synthesis giving this lowest energy penalty. For gaseous-biofuel production, the minimum energy penalty for biochar production is 33 GJ Mg-1 C. These substitution rates correspond to a wide range of Pareto-optimal system configurations, implying considerable latitude to choose pyrolysis conditions to optimize for desired biochar properties or to modulate energy versus biochar yields in response to fluctuating price differentials for the two commodities. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We present a global analysis of CO2 emission reductions from the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet consistent with stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm. The CO2 emission reductions are described by g CO2/km emission targets for average new light-duty vehicles on a tank-to-wheel basis between 2010 and 2050 that we call CO 2 glide paths. The analysis accounts for growth of the vehicle fleet, changing patterns in driving distance, regional availability of biofuels, and the changing composition of fossil fuels. New light-duty vehicle fuel economy and CO2 regulations in the U.S. through 2025 and in the EU through 2020 are broadly consistent with the CO2 glide paths. The glide path is at the upper end of the discussed 2025 EU range of 68-78 g CO2/km. The proposed China regulation for 2020 is more stringent than the glide path, while the 2017 Brazil regulation is less stringent. Existing regulations through 2025 are broadly consistent with the light-duty vehicle sector contributing to stabilizing CO2 at approximately 450 ppm. The glide paths provide long-term guidance for LDV powertrain/fuel development. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The increasing demand for palm oil for uses in biofuel and food products is leading to rapid expansion of oil palm agriculture. Methyl chavicol (also known as estragole and 1-allyl-4-methoxybenzene) is an oxygenated biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) that was recently identified as the main floral emission from an oil palm plantation in Malaysian Borneo. The emissions of methyl chavicol observed may impact regional atmospheric chemistry, but little is known of its ability to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The photo-oxidation of methyl chavicol was investigated at the European Photoreactor chamber as a part of the atmospheric chemistry of methyl chavicol (ATMECH) project. Aerosol samples were collected using a particle into liquid sampler (PILS) and analysed offline using an extensive range of instruments including; high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-ITMS), high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOFMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). The SOA yield was determined as 18 and 29% for an initial VOC mixing ratio of 212 and 460 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) respectively; using a VOC:NOx ratio of ∼5:1. In total, 59 SOA compounds were observed and the structures of 10 compounds have been identified using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The addition of hydroxyl and/or nitro-functional groups to the aromatic ring appears to be an important mechanistic pathway for aerosol formation. This results in the formation of compounds with both low volatility and high O:C ratios, where functionalisation rather than fragmentation is mainly observed as a result of the stability of the ring. The SOA species observed can be characterised as semi-volatile to low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA and LVOOA) components and therefore may be important in aerosol formation and growth. © 2014 Author(s).

AB  - The utilization of agro-industrial wastes such as whey as raw materials for the production of bio-ethanol is gaining importance as a result of the attractiveness of renewable fuel alternatives due to exhaustion of fossil fuel sources coupled with the positive impact to the environment. Here, we report the isolation of two Kluyveromyces spp. designated as BM4 and P41, able to produce ethanol as main fermentation product from fermenting whey. Three different molecular biological approaches including, the RFLP analysis of the 5.8S-ITS rDNA, the sequence of the 5.8S-ITS rDNA region and the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene were applied for accurate identification. While RFLP analysis of 5.8S-ITS region failed to accurate the differentiation between the two species, sequencing of this region and D1/D2 region of the 26S rRNA gene verified the identification. PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 5.8S-ITS rRNA and D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA genes revealed that the isolates BM4 and P41 were highly related to Kluyveromyces marxianus and Kluyveromyces lactis with homology of 99% for both. In addition, phylogenetic analysis indicated that both BM4 and P41 shared a cluster with K. marxianus and K. lactis, respectively. The fermentative performance of both strains on cheese whey to produce ethanol was evaluated at different parameters such as incubation temperature, initial pH, whey sugar concentrations, and yeast concentrations. Results show that the maximum ethanol productions achieved at pH 4.5 and 35 °C were 5.52% and 5.05% for K. marxianus and K. lactis, respectively. Our results demonstrated that K. marxianus and K. Lactis could be recommended for cheese whey bioremediation in the environment and produce renewable biofuel. © 2014.

AB  - Surface coal mines prior to 1950 in the USA were generally left without any reclamation. As government regulations advanced since then, mine operators were required to backfill the area and plant grasses or trees. After the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) was passed in 1977 in the USA, mine operators were required to conduct pre-mining analyses of the site and to designate a land use that could be achieved after mining. Successful reclamation, as needed to satisfy today’s societal demands, requires engineering, design, and purposeful reconstruction of the full mining disturbance, not just its surface, and control of waters leaving the mine site. Effective reclamation on modern American coal mines is fully integrated with the mining operation. A suitable and effective post-mining land use that is sustainable for future generations is crucial to the long-term success and profitability of the mining business and to the future economic benefits of the landowner. Accepted post-mining land uses in the USA are: (1) prime farmland, (2) hay land and pasture, (3) biofuel crops, (4) forestry, (5) wildlife habitat, and (6) building site development. Policies and regulations for each post-mining land use were developed and practices to achieve successful and sustainable land uses were established. Post-mining conditions should provide ecosystem services and produce lands capable of supporting societal needs in the future. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - This article analyzes the consequences of enhanced biofuel demand in regions and countries of the world that have announced plans to implement or expand on biofuel policies. The analysis considers not only mandatory blending targets for transportation fuels, but also voluntary ones. The chosen quantitative modeling approach is two-fold: it combines a multi-sectoral economic model (LEITAP) with a spatial bio-physical land use model (IMAGE 2.4). This paper adds to existing research by considering biofuel policies in the EU, the US and various other countries with considerable agricultural production and trade, such as Brazil, India and China. Moreover, the combination of the two modeling systems allows for the observation of changes in both economic and bio-physical indicators. The results show that some indicators with high political relevance, such as agricultural prices and greenhouse gas emissions from land use, do not necessarily react proportionally to increasing demand for agricultural products from the biofuel sector. This finding should be considered when designing biofuel policies because these indicators are directly relevant for food security and climate change.

AB  - Agriculture is closely affected by climate. Over the past decade, biofuels have emerged as another important factor shaping the agricultural sector. We ask whether the presence of the US ethanol sector can play a role in moderating increases in US corn price variability, projected to occur in response to near-term global warming. Our findings suggest that the answer to this question depends heavily on the underlying forces shaping the ethanol industry. If mandate-driven, there is little doubt that the presence of the corn-ethanol sector will exacerbate price volatility. However, if market-driven, then the emergence of the corn-ethanol sector can be a double-edged sword for corn price volatility, possibly cushioning the impact of increased climate driven supply volatility, but also inheriting volatility from the newly integrated energy markets via crude oil price fluctuations. We find that empirically the former effect dominates, reducing price volatility by 27%. In contrast, mandates on ethanol production increase future price volatility by 54% in under future climate after 2020. We also consider the potential for liberalized international corn trade to cushion corn price volatility in the US. Our results suggest that allowing corn to move freely internationally serves to reduce the impact of near-term climate change on US corn price volatility by 8%. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Several challenges have to be overcome for the production of biofuel from algae to be commercialized. Key among those challenges is the management of contamination in open ponds; without technology to do this, biomass cannot be produced economically. A number of successful open pond technologies have been developed that manage contamination by creating an extreme environment that limits the amount of contamination and improves the stability of these systems. However, these solutions are neither aligned with the economics of fuel production, which demand low costs and high volumes, nor are they suited to many strains of algae considered candidates for fuel production. This work describes a possible solution developed by Sapphire Energy, Inc., to the contamination challenge of open pond cultivation with a strain of algae considered suitable for the production of biofuel. This example illustrates an integrated solution that incorporates pest identification, tracking, and management, and it focuses on a primitive fungal pest that has been shown to crash open ponds of algae used for the production of biofuels. The implementation of this solution can prevent these crashes and offers an approach to managing contamination in open ponds, thereby advancing the prospect of using algae as an economically viable strategy for the production of biofuels. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

AB  - This study outlined an integrated approach for obtaining several products, such as biodiesel, gossypol, sterols, raffinose, and nontoxic cottonseed meal from cottonseed via modified two-phase extraction (TPE), supercritical methanol transesterification and other technologies. The modified TPE could not only simplify the steps of separating substances, but also improve the quality of cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal. The suitable conditions of modified TPE were as follows: the petroleum ether/methanol volume rate of 1:3, the extraction temperature of 40°C, and the extraction time of 20min. The supercritical methanol transesterification had a favorable yield of biodiesel with shorter time. The conversion of cottonseed oil was up to 97.5% with the temperature of 270°C, the molar ratio of methanol to oil of 40, and a reaction time of 40min at 10MPa. Meanwhile, with the suitable conditions, the purity of the obtained gossypol, sterols and raffinose could be got to 92.1%, 89.8% and 94.2%, respectively. This integrated biorefinery could be useful for comprehensive development and utilization of cottonseed with fewer steps and lower cost. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) specifies that biomass feedstocks must be sustainable and are not directly implicated with conversion of areas of high carbon stock and biodiversity. There are concerns that first generation biofuels from food-based crops will lead to negative indirect impacts on food prices and place pressure on agricultural land. The RED incentivises the use of non-food and land biomass resources by awarding them with financial credits and assigning them a zero greenhouse gas (GHG) 'cost'. This paper questions whether there are any GHG implications with straw removal from soil that should be accounted for in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of straw-based bioethanol. Emission savings of 21-58% are calculated for straw-bioethanol compared to conventional fossil fuels. The direct GHG implications of straw removal from soil are highly dependent on assumptions on the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) experienced during straw removal, as well as replacing nutrients removed in straw. The results show that these impacts have the potential to reduce the GHG emission savings to -133%. If straw was alternatively incorporated into the soil, this could sequester between 0.58 and 2.24tonnes CO2 eq./ha, whereas substitution of fossil fuels would avoid 0.46 and 1.16tonnes CO2 eq./ha, although the full accountable benefit of straw removal is questionable as it is easily reversible. Understanding the full implications of straw removal on GHG emissions relies on further research on residue removal limitations, the impact that losses of SOC has on soil quality, as well as determining whether straw will be acquired from increased removal from soil or displacement from existing markets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants typically incorporate one or various auxiliary boilers operating in parallel to the solar field to facilitate start up operations, provide system stability, avoid freezing of heat transfer fluid (HTF) and increase generation capacity. The environmental performance of these plants is highly influenced by the energy input and the type of auxiliary fuel, which in most cases is natural gas (NG). Replacing the NG with biogas or biomethane (BM) in commercial CSP installations is being considered as a means to produce electricity that is fully renewable and free from fossil inputs. Despite their renewable nature, the use of these biofuels also generates environmental impacts that need to be adequately identified and quantified. This paper investigates the environmental performance of a commercial wet-cooled parabolic trough 50MWe CSP plant in Spain operating according to two strategies: solar-only, with minimum technically viable energy non-solar contribution; and hybrid operation, where 12% of the electricity derives from auxiliary fuels (as permitted by Spanish legislation). The analysis was based on standard Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology (ISO 14040-14040). The technical viability and the environmental profile of operating the CSP plant with different auxiliary fuels was evaluated, including: NG; biogas from an adjacent plant; and BM withdrawn from the gas network. The effect of using different substrates (biowaste, sewage sludge, grass and a mix of biowaste with animal manure) for the production of the biofuels was also investigated. The results showed that NG is responsible for most of the environmental damage associated with the operation of the plant in hybrid mode. Replacing NG with biogas resulted in a significant improvement of the environmental performance of the installation, primarily due to reduced impact in the following categories: natural land transformation, depletion of fossil resources, and climate change. However, despite the renewable nature of the biofuels, other environmental categories like human toxicity, eutrophication, acidification and marine ecotoxicity scored higher when using biogas and BM. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A significant problem encountered in the gas turbine industry with fuel products is the degradation of fuel and fuel systems by micro-organisms, which are largely bacteria, embedded in biofilms. These micro-organisms cause system fouling and other degradatory effects, extending often to sudden failure of components with cost implications. Current methods of assessment are only postimpact evaluation and do not necessarily quantify the effects of fuel degradation on engine performance and emission. Therefore, effective models that allow predictive condition monitoring are required for engine's fuel system reliability, especially with readily biodegradable biofuels. The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of biofouling in gas turbines and the development of a biomathematical model with potentials to predict the extent and assess the effects of microbial growth in fuel systems. The tool takes into account mass balance stoichiometry equations of major biological processes in fuel biofouling. Further development, optimization, and integration with existing Cranfield in-house simulation tools will be carried out to assess the overall engine performance and emission characteristics. This new tool is important for engineering design decision, optimization processes, and analysis of microbial fuel degradation in gas turbine fuels and fuel systems. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - This study examines three agriculture management practices with the aim of improving the environmental performance of corn-derived products such as bioethanol. Corn production is energy intensive and contributes to water quality degradation and global warming, thus affecting the environmental impact of corn-derived ethanol. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of three management strategies: tillage, fertilizer choices and the use of buffer strips to sequester nutrients. Detailed energy, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus inventories are compiled to represent corn production scenarios within the US Corn Belt. The LCA was developed using GREET 1.8 (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) and emission factors with statistical analyses to estimate energy consumption, associated air emissions, and aqueous nutrient runoff potentials. Results show that using manure fertilizers as opposed to synthetic fertilizers requires less energy, however the use of manure generates more CH4, N2O, CO2 and results in more variable concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus leaching from farmlands. No tillage emits less greenhouse gas emissions, sequesters more soil organic carbon and slightly reduces nutrient runoff compared with conventional tillage practices. Building buffer strips of certain widths is an efficient way to reduce N and P discharge to surrounding waters with minimal effect on the energy or global warming profile. Based on the results of the LCA studies, replacing conventional tillage with no till, and installing buffer strips can improve environmental performances of corn derived ethanol. © 2014.

AB  - Cassava based bioethanol production is a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels and commercial production is already well established in several countries. A production based on small holder production may involve a transformation of the existing production system and it is therefore imperative to investigate opportunities and barriers for expansion of cassava production. This paper investigates the potential for an expansion of cassava cultivation for bioethanol production in Southern Mali. It is based on a questionnaire survey with 65 households in 2 villages in Loulouni municipality, which represent two major agro-ecological environments in the Soudan-zone in Mali. The results reveal that farmers are experienced cassava producers and are interested in an expansion of cassava cultivation for bioethanol production and that suitable areas are available, especially for an expansion of the Attieké cassava variety. Little competition with food crops is likely, as cassava most likely would replace cotton as primary cash crop, following the decline of cotton production since 2005 and hence food security concerns appear not to be an issue. Stated price levels to motivate an expansion of cassava production are close to acceptable levels to make bioethanol production profitable and the advantages of a continuous demand at agreed prices may motivate farmers to accept prices which would make bioethanol production competitive. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies the greenhouse gas emissions from biowaste, waste water treatment plant sludge and agricultural biomass based biogas use as a transportation fuel and compares the transportation use with the electricity and heat production and composting of feedstock. The research is conducted using Life cycle assessment methods and the calculation follow the directive 2009/28/EC, ISO 14040 standard and Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The use of biogas in transportation sector led in all studied cases to reductions of GHG emissions compared to fossil transportation fuels. The GHG reductions varied from 49% to 84%. Biogas production and use in electricity and heat production also led to GHG reductions compared to composting of feedstock but the reductions are not as high as in transportation use in most of cases. In addition if biogas is already used in energy production, it should be considered carefully whether the advantages of directing biogas to transportation purposes are profitable from a GHG emission point of view. However the GHG reductions are heavily depended on local energy systems. This creates challenges for the policy makers and leads to need for system scale comparisons. The wider use of biogas as a transportation fuel has a potential for high GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium that degrades cellulose by using a highly effective cellulosome, a macromolecular complex consisting of multiple cellulose degrading enzymes organized and attached to the cell surface by non-catalytic scaffoldins. However, due largely to lack of efficient methods for genetic manipulation of C. thermocellum, it is still unclear how the different scaffoldins and their functional modules contribute to cellulose hydrolysis. Results: We constructed C. thermocellum mutants with the primary scaffoldin CipA (cellulosome- integrating protein A) truncated at different positions or lacking four different secondary scaffoldins by using a newly developed thermotargetron system, and we analyzed cellulose hydrolysis, cellulosome formation, and cellulose binding of the mutants. A CipA truncation that deletes six type I cohesin modules, which bind cellulolytic enzymes, decreased cellulose hydrolysis rates by 46%, and slightly longer truncations that also delete the carbohydrate binding module decreased rates by 89 to 92%, indicating strong cellulosome-substrate synergy. By contrast, a small CipA truncation that deletes only the C-terminal type II dockerin (XDocII) module detached cellulosomes from the cells, but decreased cellulose hydrolysis rates by only 9%, suggesting a relatively small contribution of cellulosome-cell synergy. Disruptants lacking any of four different secondary scaffoldins (OlpB, 7CohII, Orf2p, or SdbA) showed moderately decreased cellulose hydrolysis rates, suggesting additive contributions. Surprisingly, the CipA-ΔXDocII mutant, which lacks cell-associated polycellulosomes, adheres to cellulose almost as strongly as wild-type cells, revealing an alternate, previously unknown cellulose-binding mechanism. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the important role of cellulosome-substrate synergy in cellulose degradation, demonstrate a contribution of secondary scaffoldins, and suggest a previously unknown, non-cellulosomal system for binding insoluble cellulose. Our findings provide new insights into cellulosome function and impact genetic engineering of microorganisms to enhance bioconversions of cellulose substrates. © 2014 Hong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Cheap fossil oil resources are becoming depleted and crude oil prices are rising. In this context, alternatives to fossil fuel-derived carbon are examined in an effort to improve the security of carbon resources through the development of novel technologies for the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable feedstocks such as biomass. The general concept unifying the conversion processes for raw biomass is that of the biorefinery, which integrates biofuels with a selection of pivot points towards value-added chemical end products via so-called “platform chemicals”. While the concept of biorefining is not new, now more than ever there is the motivation to investigate its true potential for the production of carbon-based products. A variety of renewable chemicals have been proposed by many research groups,many of thembeing categorized as drop-ins, while others are novel chemicals with the potential to displace petrochemicals across several markets. To be competitive with petrochemicals, carbohydrate-derived products should have advantageous chemical properties that can be profitably exploited, and/or their production should offer cost-effective benefits. The production of drop-ins will likely proceed in short term since the markets are familiar, while the commercial introduction of novel chemicals takes longer and demands more technological and marketing effort. Rather than describing elaborate catalytic routes and giving exhaustive lists of reactions, a large part of this review is devoted to creating a guideline for the selection of the most promising (platform) chemicals derived via chemical-catalytic reaction routes from lignocellulosic biomass. The major rationale behind our recommendations is a maximum conservation of functionality, alongside a high atom economy. Nature provides us with complex molecules like cellulose and hemicellulose, and it should be possible to transform them into chemical products while maintaining aspects of their original structure, rather than taking them completely apart only to put them back together again in a different order, or turning them into metabolites and CO2. Thus, rather than merely pursuing energy content as in the case of biofuels, the chemist sees atom efficiency, functional versatility, and reactivity as the key criteria for the successful valorization of biomass into chemicals. To guide the choice of renewable chemicals and their production, this review adopts the original van Krevelen plots and develops alternative diagrams by introducing a functionality parameter F and a functionality index F:C (rather than O:C). This index is more powerful than the O index to describe the importance of functional groups. Such plots are ideal to assess the effect of several reaction types on the overall functionality in biomass conversion. The atom economy is an additional arbitrator in the evaluation of the reaction types. The assessment is illustrated in detail for the case of carbohydrate resources, and about 25 chemicals, including drop-ins as well as novel chemicals, are selected. Most of these chemicals would be difficult to synthesize from petrochemicals feeds, and this highlights the unique potential of carbohydrates as feedstocks, but, importantly, the products should have a strong applied dimension in existing or rising markets. Ultimately, the production scales of those markets must be harmonized to the biomass availability and its collection and storage logistics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Lifecycle analysis (LCA) metrics of greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly being used to select technologies supported by climate policy. However, LCAs typically evaluate the emissions associated with a technology or product, not the impacts of policies. Here, we show that policies supporting the same technology can lead to dramatically different emissions impacts per unit of technology added, due to multimarket responses to the policy. Using a policy-based consequential LCA, we find that the lifecycle emissions impacts of four US biofuel policies range from a reduction of 16.1 gCO2e to an increase of 24.0 gCO2e per MJ corn ethanol added by the policy. The differences between these results and representative technology-based LCA measures, which do not account for the policy instrument driving the expansion in the technology, illustrate the need for policy-based LCA measures when informing policy decision making. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We present spatial and temporal variations of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in the upper troposphere (UT) observed mainly by the Civil Aircraft for Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) passenger aircraft for the years 2005-2011. The CH3Cl mixing ratio in the UT over Europe was higher than that observed at a European surface baseline station throughout the year, indicative of a persistent positive vertical gradient at Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. A series of flights over Africa and South Asia show that CH3Cl mixing ratios increase toward tropical latitudes, and the observed UT CH3Cl level over these two regions and the Atlantic was higher than that measured at remote surface sites. Strong emissions of CH3Cl in the tropics combined with meridional air transport through the UT may explain such vertical and latitudinal gradients. Comparisons with carbon monoxide (CO) data indicate that noncombustion sources in the tropics dominantly contribute to forming the latitudinal gradient of CH3Cl in the UT. We also observed elevated mixing ratios of CH3Cl and CO in air influenced by biomass burning in South America and Africa, and the enhancement ratios derived for CH3Cl to CO in those regions agree with previous observations. In contrast, correlations indicate a high CH3Cl to CO ratio of 2.9 ± 0.5 ppt ppb-1 in the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone and domestic biofuel emissions in South Asia are inferred to be responsible. We estimated the CH3Cl emission in South Asia to be 134 ± 23 Gg Cl yr-1, which is higher than a previous estimate due to the higher CH3Cl to CO ratio observed in this study. © 2014.

AB  - Background: The Rapid Bioconversion with Integrated recycle Technology (RaBIT) process reduces capital costs, processing times, and biocatalyst cost for biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels by reducing total bioprocessing time (enzymatic hydrolysis plus fermentation) to 48 h, increasing biofuel productivity (g/L/h) twofold, and recycling biocatalysts (enzymes and microbes) to the next cycle. To achieve these results, RaBIT utilizes 24-h high cell density fermentations along with cell recycling to solve the slow/incomplete xylose fermentation issue, which is critical for lignocellulosic biofuel fermentations. Previous studies utilizing similar fermentation conditions showed a decrease in xylose consumption when recycling cells into the next fermentation cycle. Eliminating this decrease is critical for RaBIT process effectiveness for high cycle counts. Results: Nine different engineered microbial strains (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis strains, Zymomonas mobilis 8b, and Escherichia coli KO11) were tested under RaBIT platform fermentations to determine their suitability for this platform. Fermentation conditions were then optimized for S. cerevisiae GLBRCY128. Three different nutrient sources (corn steep liquor, yeast extract, and wheat germ) were evaluated to improve xylose consumption by recycled cells. Capacitance readings were used to accurately measure viable cell mass profiles over five cycles. Conclusion: The results showed that not all strains are capable of effectively performing the RaBIT process. Acceptable performance is largely correlated to the specific xylose consumption rate. Corn steep liquor was found to reduce the deleterious impacts of cell recycle and improve specific xylose consumption rates. The viable cell mass profiles indicated that reduction in specific xylose consumption rate, not a drop in viable cell mass, was the main cause for decreasing xylose consumption. © 2014 Sarks et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination in croplands has been a serious concern because of its high health risk through soil-food chain transfer. A field experiment was conducted in 2010-2012 in a contaminated rice paddy in southern China to determine if bioavailability of soil Cd and Pb could be reduced while grain yield was sustained over 3 years after a single soil amendment of wheat straw biochar. Contaminated biochar particles were separated from the biochar amended soil and microscopically analyzed to help determine where, and how, metals were immobilized with biochar. Biochar soil amendment (BSA) consistently and significantly increased soil pH, total organic carbon and decreased soil extractable Cd and Pb over the 3 year period. While rice plant tissues' Cd content was significantly reduced, depending on biochar application rate, reduction in plant Pb concentration was found only in root tissue. Analysis of the fresh and contaminated biochar particles indicated that Cd and Pb had probably been bonded with the mineral phases of Al, Fe and P on and around and inside the contaminated biochar particle. Immobilization of the Pb and Cd also occurred to cation exchange on the porous carbon structure. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the environmental impact of biodiesel and hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel derived from camelina oil in terms of global warming potential, human health, ecosystem quality, and energy resource consumption. The life cycle inventory is based on production activities in the Canadian Prairies and encompasses activities ranging from agricultural production to oil extraction and fuel conversion. The system expansion method is used in this study to avoid allocation and to credit input energy to co-products associated with the products displaced in the market during camelina oil extraction and fuel processing. This is the preferred allocation method for LCA analysis in the context of most renewable and sustainable energy programs. The results show that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1MJ of camelina derived biodiesel ranged from 7.61 to 24.72g CO2 equivalent and 3.06 to 31.01kgCO2/MJ equivalent for camelina HRJ fuel. Non-renewable energy consumption for camelina biodiesel ranged from 0.40 to 0.67MJ/MJ; HRJ fuel ranged from -0.13 to 0.52MJ/MJ. Camelina oil as a feedstock for fuel production accounted for the highest contribution to overall environmental performance, demonstrating the importance of reducing environmental burdens during the agricultural production process. Attaining higher seed yield would dramatically lower environmental impacts associated with camelina seed, oil, and fuel production. The lower GHG emissions and energy consumption associated with camelina in comparison with other oilseed derived fuel and petroleum fuel make camelina derived fuel from Canadian Prairies environmentally attractive. © 2014.

AB  - Improving the public understanding and acceptance of biofuels - those characterised as "advanced" or "next generation" in particular - is generally considered a key challenge of biofuel politics. A worthy objective as such, fostering consensus and enhancing public acceptance and acceptability is highly problematic as the sole objective for the production of expertise in biofuel policy. This paper examines the role of Brazilian experts in the production and use of evidence in the international and national biofuel controversies in 2007-2013. In particular, the article examines the interaction between experts and other stakeholders in the processes whereby the various participants in the debate use diverse forms of expertise in order to legitimise and delegitimise the country's sugarcane ethanol fuel policy, and thereby to influence the acceptance of Brazilian ethanol fuel. The paper concludes by examining the behaviour of these experts from four perspectives on the role of expertise in policymaking, and argues in favour of greater attention to public conflict and controversy as not only unavoidable, but indeed as essential elements in democratic decision-making and construction of robust evidence for biofuel policy decisions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - As the terrestrial and marine effects of climate change continue to intensify, the value of natural habitats as a form of protection against a variety of ecological issues is becoming clear. Coastal wetlands, for example, provide protection against incoming storm surges and extreme weather, serve to improve water quality through the sequestration of various pollutants, and offer serious potential as a new source of biofuel. Unfortunately, many of the areas that have been affected by coastal habitat loss still suffer from the same problems that caused those ecosystems to change in the first place. Cities continue to release effluence into estuaries; hydrological engineering projects continue to redirect waterways that change flow and sediment patterns; and increasing populations in coastal areas all assert significant pressures on intertidal ecosystems. This ongoing changing of the landscape-and the length of time that anthropogenic factors have been influencing these habitats-has made modern-day environmental planning and management important yet complicated pursuits. As a result, planners and managers must constantly look for new tools to better understand their environment. Incorporating historically derived environmental data into geographic information systems (GIS) can enhance the quality of ecological models, which subsequently offers environmental planners and managers with a more robust understanding of the ecosystems encompassed within their project areas. © 2014 Published with license by Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Biomass is an important renewable energy source that holds large potential as feedstock for the production of different energy carriers in a context of sustainable development, peak oil and climate change. In developing countries, biomass already supplies the bulk of energy services and future use is expected to increase with more efficient applications, such as the production of biogas and liquid biofuels for cooking, transportation and the generation of power. The aim of this study is to establish the amount of Ghana's energy demand that can be satisfied by using the country's crop residues, animal manure, logging residues and municipal waste. The study finds that the technical potential of bioenergy from these sources is 96 PJ in 2700 Mm3 of biogas or 52 PJ in 2300 ML of cellulosic ethanol. The biogas potential is sufficient to replace more than a quarter of Ghana's present woodfuel use. If instead converted to cellulosic ethanol, the estimated potential is seven times the estimated 336 ML of biofuels needed to achieve the projected 10% biofuels blends at the national level in 2020. Utilizing the calculated potentials involves a large challenge in terms of infrastructure requirements, quantified to hundreds of thousands of small-scale plants. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As biofuel production continues to increase, so will demand for forests to provide sources of biomass feedstocks. Intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations cover 15.8 million ha of the southeastern United States. Intercropping of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) within loblolly pine stands offers an opportunity to use interbed space to produce an herbaceous biomass feedstock. Furthermore, removal of post-harvest woody residues could act as another forest-based biomass feedstock. Understanding how managing forests for biofuel production influences soil nitrogen (N) cycling and availability is crucial given the critical role N plays in terrestrial ecosystem productivity. Therefore, our objective was to study effects of harvest residue removal and pine-switchgrass intercropping on soil extractable NH4+ and NO3 We used a randomized complete block design, consisting of four blocks of seven plots (0.8. ha) established in the summer of 2008 on a recently harvested 34-year-old loblolly pine plantation in the Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA. Ion exchange membranes were deployed in the top 10. cm of mineral soil starting in June 2009 and replaced continuously every 4-6. weeks through December 2011. Presence of switchgrass significantly reduced soil extractable NH4+ and NO3-, amounting to a total reduction of 39% and 60%, respectively, over the course of the timeframe (30. months) of this study. There was evidence that intercropping of switchgrass increased extractable NO3- in the adjacent pine bed, although this result was only found in the final 6. months of the study. Presence or absence of harvest residues and/or interbed pines in the interbeds generally had no effect on soil inorganic N pools. These results indicate that switchgrass production effectively utilized inorganic N during a time when mineral N supply was greater than N demand by loblolly pines. Assessment of the long-term effects of switchgrass intercropping on soil nutrient cycling and availability and pine health and productivity will be essential to determine environmental and economic sustainability of intercropping. © 2014.

AB  - Brassicaceae oilseeds can serve as potential feedstocks for renewable biofuels to offset demand for petroleum-based alternatives. However, little is known about oilseed crop yield potential and N use in semiarid, wheat (Triticum spp.)-based cropping systems that dominate the northern Great Plains (NGP). A 5-yr study was conducted in northeast Montana to investigate the yield potential of a direct seeded system of durum (T. durum Desf.) in rotation with either chemical fallow or three Brassicaceae oilseeds: camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz], crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst. ex R.E. Fries), and canola-quality Brassica juncea L. Overall, results from the study indicated that seed yield in the three Brassicaceae oilseeds tested in rotation with durum was related (P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.68) to a nitrogen recovery index (NRI), indicating the importance of nitrogen use (NU) efficiency in dryland oilseed production, and that B. juncea generally used N more efficiently than crambe and camelina. Similarly, NRI was related (P &lt; 0.001; r2 = 0.72) to grain yield in durum following oilseeds. Grain yield of durum following B. juncea was similar to durum following fallow and greater than durum following camelina or crambe. Durum following crambe tended to use N more inefficiently than durum following camelina, B. juncea, or fallow. Differences in yield and N use of durum and oilseeds varied among years, which underscores the need to further develop management tools to optimize durum-oilseed cropping systems in highly variable rainfall environments typical of the NGP. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - Wood fly ash from biofuel combustion plants is landfilled commonly as a waste, but research of this material is needed because it may reduce future fertilizer requirements. We investigated the effect of the ash application on potential changes in pH, nutrient, and potentially toxic element (in our case As, Cd, and Pb) content and mobility in soils. Wood fly ash in doses up to 1% (w/w) was added to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in potentially toxic element-contaminated loam (Cambisol) and sandy clay loam (Fluvisol) soil material in 3-yr pot experiment. The potentially toxic element contents in soils exceeded the maximum permissible limits for Czech soils, but the plant availability was, thanks to ash addition, limited. The effect of wood ash was greater in the Cambisol where Cd, Zn, and also Pb showed similar trends, and their content in plant decreased (Cd by 60%, Zn by 50%, and Pb by 45%), whereas the nutrient contents tended to increase in plants. Differences were usually insignificant (α= 0.05) in the Fluvisol between treatments, and Ca, Mg, and P contents were highest in the treatment without ash addition. The influence of soil changes on element uptake and distribution within the aboveground plant biomass was also observed. These findings are an important step on providing evidence of the benefits of using wood fly ash as a fertilizer supplement, because potentially toxic element contents in wheat grown in contaminated soils with ash addition were low and decreased, whereas the concentrations of major nutrients increased. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - A total of nine oilseeds with more than 15 wt% oil have been investigated for evaluating them as feedstock for biodiesel industries. Fatty acid profiles of all the nine oil samples have been determined by GC-MS analysis. The saponification numbers, gross heats of combustion of the oils and those of corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as well as cetane indices of the FAMEs have been calculated empirically. Iodine values have been determined experimentally. These values have been used for predicting the quality of the corresponding biodiesels. If prepared from these oils, biodiesels are likely to meet the major specification of biodiesel standards of the USA, Germany and European Standard Organisation. Seed oil from Cucumis sativus is found rich in linoleic acid which is considered an essential fatty acid of biological significance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A variety of anaerobic bacteria have been shown to transfer electrons obtained from organic compound oxidation to the surface of electrodes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to produce current. Initial enrichments for iron (III) reducing bacteria were set up with sediments from the haloalkaline environment of Soap Lake, Washington, in batch cultures and subsequent transfers resulted in a culture that grew optimally at 7.0% salinity and pH 11.0. The culture was used to inoculate the anode chamber of a MFC with formate as the electron source. Current densities up to 12.5 mA/m2 were achieved by this bacterium. Cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrated that an electron mediator, methylene blue, was required to transfer electrons to the anode. Scanning electron microscopic imaging of the electrode surface did not reveal heavy colonization of bacteria, providing evidence that the bacterium may be using an indirect mode of electron transfer to generate current. Molecular characterization of the 16S rRNA gene and restriction fragment length profiles (RFLP) analysis showed that the MFC enriched for a single bacterial species with a 99% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene of Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans. Though modest, electricity production was achieved by a haloalkaliphilic bacterium at pH 11.0 and 7.0% salinity. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - Background: Microbial bioconversion of photosynthetic biomass is a promising approach to the generation of biofuels and other bioproducts. However, rapid, high-yield, and simple processes are essential for successful applications. Here, biomass from the rapidly growing photosynthetic marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was fermented using yeast into bioethanol. Results: The cyanobacterium accumulated a total carbohydrate content of about 60% of cell dry weight when cultivated under nitrate limitation. The cyanobacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using lysozyme and two alpha-glucanases. This enzymatic hydrolysate was fermented into ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae without further treatment. All enzyme treatments and fermentations were carried out in the residual growth medium of the cyanobacteria with the only modification being that pH was adjusted to the optimal value. The highest ethanol yield and concentration obtained was 0.27 g ethanol per g cell dry weight and 30 g ethanol L-1, respectively. About 90% of the glucose in the biomass was converted to ethanol. The cyanobacterial hydrolysate was rapidly fermented (up to 20 g ethanol L-1 day-1) even in the absence of any other nutrient additions to the fermentation medium. Conclusions: Cyanobacterial biomass was hydrolyzed using a simple enzymatic treatment and fermented into ethanol more rapidly and to higher concentrations than previously reported for similar approaches using cyanobacteria or microalgae. Importantly, as well as fermentable carbohydrates, the cyanobacterial hydrolysate contained additional nutrients that promoted fermentation. This hydrolysate is therefore a promising substitute for the relatively expensive nutrient additives (such as yeast extract) commonly used for Saccharomyces fermentations. © 2014 Möllers et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Gasification is a promising pathway for the conversion of biomass into energy products. In particular, the syngas generated through biomass gasification is of great interest for hydrogen production. Based on an overview of technological options, a base-case system for hydrogen production via biomass gasification is defined, and its environmental and thermodynamic performance is evaluated through a life cycle assessment and an exergetic analysis. The case study involves poplar gasification in a low-pressure char indirect gasifier, catalytic tar destruction, cold wet gas cleaning, syngas conversion and hydrogen purification. The calculated exergetic efficiency of the plant is 48%, a value comparable to that of conventional coal gasification technologies for hydrogen production. The total exergy loss of the plant (mainly associated with the flue gas streams) is found to be 4.6% of the fuel exergy provided to the overall plant, while 47% of the overall fuel exergy vanishes as exergy destruction within the individual components of the plant. The life cycle assessment of the system covers from poplar cultivation to hydrogen purification. Seven impact potentials are considered: cumulative energy demand, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, land competition, acidification and eutrophication. The life-cycle energy balance of the system suggests a relatively promising energy performance. Poplar cultivation and harvesting, biomass pre-treatment and syngas cleaning are identified as the subsystems with the largest contributions to the environmental impacts. Measures to enhance the environmental and energy performance of the system should focus on minimizing the poplar feedstock demand, improving the logistical planning for biomass supply, reducing the natural gas demand of the steam reforming subsystem, and optimizing the electricity demand of the gas cleaning subsystem. Lower consumption levels of fertilizers and diesel for poplar cultivation and harvesting should also be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Although the system for producing yellow corn grain is well established in the US, its role among other biofeedstock alternatives to petroleum-based energy sources has to be balanced with its predominant purpose for food and feed as well as economics, land use, and environmental stewardship. We model land usage attributed to corn ethanol production in the US to evaluate the effects of anticipated technological change in corn grain production, ethanol processing, and livestock feeding through a multi-disciplinary approach. Seven scenarios are evaluated: four considering the impact of technological advances on corn grain production, two focused on improved efficiencies in ethanol processing, and one reflecting greater use of ethanol co-products (that is, distillers dried grains with solubles) in diets for dairy cattle, pigs, and poultry. For each scenario, land area attributed to corn ethanol production is estimated for three time horizons: 2011 (current), the time period at which the 15 billion gallon cap for corn ethanol as per the Renewable Fuel Standard is achieved, and 2026 (15 years out). Results: Although 40.5% of corn grain was channeled to ethanol processing in 2011, only 25% of US corn acreage was attributable to ethanol when accounting for feed co-product utilization. By 2026, land area attributed to corn ethanol production is reduced to 11% to 19% depending on the corn grain yield level associated with the four corn production scenarios, considering oil replacement associated with the soybean meal substituted in livestock diets with distillers dried grains with solubles. Efficiencies in ethanol processing, although producing more ethanol per bushel of processed corn, result in less co-products and therefore less offset of corn acreage. Shifting the use of distillers dried grains with solubles in feed to dairy cattle, pigs, and poultry substantially reduces land area attributed to corn ethanol production. However, because distillers dried grains with solubles substitutes at a higher rate for soybean meal, oil replacement requirements intensify and positively feedback to elevate estimates of land usage. Conclusions: Accounting for anticipated technological changes in the corn ethanol system is important for understanding the associated land base ascribed, and may aid in calibrating parameters for land use models in biofuel life-cycle analyses. © 2014 Mumm et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Increased phosphorus (P) loadings threaten the health of the world's largest freshwater resource, the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL). To understand the linkages between land use and P delivery, we coupled two spatially explicit models, the landscape-scale SPARROW P fate and transport watershed model and the Land Transformation Model (LTM) land use change model, to predict future P export from nonpoint and point sources caused by changes in land use. According to LTM predictions over the period 2010-2040, the GL region of the U.S. may experience a doubling of urbanized areas and agricultural areas may increase by 10%, due to biofuel feedstock cultivation. These land use changes are predicted to increase P loadings from the U.S. side of the GL basin by 3.5-9.5%, depending on the Lake watershed and development scenario. The exception is Lake Ontario, where loading is predicted to decrease by 1.8% for one scenario, due to population losses in the drainage area. Overall, urban expansion is estimated to increase P loadings by 3.4%. Agricultural expansion associated with predicted biofuel feedstock cultivation is predicted to increase P loadings by an additional 2.4%. Watersheds that export P most efficiently and thus are the most vulnerable to increases in P sources tend to be found along southern Lake Ontario, southeastern Lake Erie, western Lake Michigan, and southwestern Lake Superior where watershed areas are concentrated along the coastline with shorter flow paths. In contrast, watersheds with high soil permeabilities, fractions of land underlain by tile drains, and long distances to the GL are less vulnerable. © 2014.

AB  - Background: Cyanobacteria are an attractive candidate for the production of biofuel because of their ability to capture carbon dioxide by photosynthesis and grow on non-arable land. However, because huge quantities of water are required for cultivation, strict water management is one of the greatest issues in algae- and cyanobacteria-based biofuel production. In this study, we aim to construct a lytic cyanobacterium that can be regulated by a physical signal (green-light illumination) for future use in the recovery of biofuel related compounds. Results: We introduced T4 bacteriophage-derived lysis genes encoding holin and endolysin under the control of the green-light regulated cpcG2 promoter in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. When cells harboring the lysis genes were illuminated with both red and green light, we observed a considerable decrease in growth rate, a significant increase in cellular phycocyanin released in the medium, and a considerable fraction of dead cells. These effects were not observed when these cells were illuminated with only red light, or when cells not containing the lysis genes were grown under either red light or red and green light.These results indicate that our constructed green-light inducible lytic system was clearly induced by green-light illumination, resulting in lytic cells that released intracellular phycocyanin into the culture supernatant. This property suggests a future possibility to construct photosynthetic genetically modified organisms that are unable to survive under sunlight exposure. Expression of the self-lysis system with green-light illumination was also found to greatly increase the fragility of the cell membrane, as determined by subjecting the induced cells to detergent, osmotic-shock, and freeze-thaw treatments. Conclusions: A green-light inducible lytic system was constructed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The engineered lytic cyanobacterial cells should be beneficial for the recovery of biofuels and related compounds from cells with minimal effort and energy, due to the fragile nature of the induced cells. Furthermore, the use of light-sensing two-component systems to regulate the expression of exogenous genes in cyanobacteria promises to replace conventional chemical inducers in many bioprocess applications, impacting the limiting water management issues. © 2014 Miyake et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Algae are an appealing source for bioenergy due to their high yields relative to terrestrial energy crops. The high cost of production, however, has prohibited commercialization. Hydrothermal liquefaction is a technology that converts more of the algae into oil than alternative technologies, thereby reducing the amount of expensive pond infrastructure and energy required for cultivation. We incorporate recent experimental results into an analysis that models the economic and life cycle performance of an algal biorefinery across a range of reaction conditions. Two strategies are explored: one pathway with gasification of the aqueous waste products for onsite energy recovery and another pathway featuring cultivation of Escherichia coli on the aqueous products and recycling of the biomass back through the reactor for boosted oil yields. We found that the maximum net energy ratio of 1.9 and minimum global warming potential of 1.0 kg CO2e L-oil-1 occurred with gasification, along with the minimum reaction temperature explored, 250 °C, and reaction times close to 1 h. The optimal economic and occupied land results occurred at a maximum temperature of 400 °C and with the shortest reaction time explored of 5 min. The cost of algal oil at these conditions was 1.64 L-oil-1 (or 263 bbl-1). For the regrowth pathway, the land footprint could be further reduced by 10%, and the optimal cost could be reduced to 1.59 L-oil-1. Forgoing gasification had a significantly detrimental effect on the other two metrics. Given the importance of economics to an algal biorefinery's operations, this could be a viable option. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Many different feedstocks are under consideration for the practical production of biofuels from lignocellulosic materials. The best choice under any particular combination of economic, agronomic, and environmental conditions depends on multiple factors. The use of old fields, restored prairie, or marginal lands to grow biofuel feedstocks offers several potential benefits including minimal agronomic inputs, reduced competition with food production, and high biodiversity. However, a major component of such landscapes is often herbaceous dicotyledonous plants, also known as forbs. The potential and obstacles of using forbs as biofuel feedstocks compared to the more frequently considered grasses and woody plants are poorly understood. Results: The factors that contribute to the yield of fermentable sugars from four representative forbs were studied in comparison with corn stover. The forbs chosen for the study were lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album), goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota). These plants are taxonomically diverse, widely distributed in northern temperate regions including the continental United States, and are weedy but not invasive. All of the forbs had lower total glucose (Glc) content from all sources (cell walls, sucrose, starch, glucosides, and free Glc) compared to corn stover (range 16.2 to 23.0% on a dry weight basis compared to 39.2% for corn stover). When digested with commercial enzyme mixtures after alkaline pretreatment, yields of Glc as a percentage of total Glc were lower for the forbs compared to corn stover. Enzyme inhibition by water-extractable compounds was not a significant contributor to the lower yields. Based on experiments with optimized cocktails of pure glycosyl hydrolases, enzyme imbalance probably accounted for much of the lower yields. Addition of xyloglucanase and α-xylosidase, two enzymes targeting Glc-containing polysaccharides that are more abundant in dicotyledonous plants compared to grasses, enhanced Glc yields from lamb's quarters, but Glc yields were still lower than from corn stover. Conclusion: The potential utilization of forb-rich plant communities as biofuel feedstocks must take into account their lower Glc content compared to grasses such as corn stover. Furthermore, new enzyme mixtures tailored to the different cell wall composition of forbs will have to be developed. © 2014 Jabbour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Agave, which is well known for tequila and other liquor production in Mexico, has recently gained attention because of its attractive potential to launch sustainable bioenergy feedstock solutions for semi-arid and arid lands. It was previously found that agave cell walls contain low lignin and relatively diverse non-cellulosic polysaccharides, suggesting unique recalcitrant features when compared to conventional C4 and C 3 plants. Results: Here, we report sugar release data from fungal enzymatic hydrolysis of non-pretreated and hydrothermally pretreated biomass that shows agave to be much less recalcitrant to deconstruction than poplar or switchgrass. In fact, non-pretreated agave has a sugar release five to eight times greater than that of poplar wood and switchgrass. Meanwhile, state of the art techniques including glycome profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Simon's Stain, confocal laser scanning microscopy and so forth, were applied to measure interactions of non-cellulosic wall components, cell wall hydrophilicity, and enzyme accessibility to identify key structural features that make agave cell walls less resistant to biological deconstruction when compared to poplar and switchgrass. Conclusions: This study systematically evaluated the recalcitrant features of agave plants towards biofuels applications. The results show that not only does agave present great promise for feeding biorefineries on semi-arid and arid lands, but also show the value of studying agave's low recalcitrance for developments in improving cellulosic energy crops. © 2014 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Unpleasant odours generated from waste management facilities represent an environmental and societal concern. This multi-year study documented odour and total reduced sulfur (TRS) abatement in four experimental landfill biocovers installed on the final cover of the Saint-Nicéphore landfill (Canada). Performance was evaluated based on the reduction in odour and TRS concentrations between the raw biogas collected from a dedicated well and the emitted gases at the surface. Odour analyses were carried out by the sensorial technique of olfactometry, whereas TRS analyses followed the pulse fluorescence technique. The large difference of 2-5 orders of magnitude between raw biogas (average odour concentration=2,100,000OUm-3) and emitted gases resulted in odour removal efficiencies of close to 100% for all observations. With respect to TRS concentrations, abatement efficiencies were all greater than 95%, with values averaging 21,000ppb of eq. SO2 in the raw biogas. The influence of water infiltration on odour concentrations was documented and showed that lower odour values were obtained when the 48-h accumulated precipitation prior to sampling was higher. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: A framework for the inclusion of land use impact assessment and a set of land use impact indicators has been recently proposed for life cycle assessment (LCA) and no case studies are available for forest biomass. The proposed methodology is tested for Scandinavian managed forestry; a comparative case study is made for energy from wood, agro-biomass and peat; and sensitivity to forest management options is analysed. Methods: The functional unit of this comparative case study is 1 GJ of energy in solid fuels. The land use impact assessment framework of the United Nations Environment Programme and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP-SETAC) is followed and its application for wood biomass is critically analysed. Applied midpoint indicators include ecological footprint and human appropriation of net primary production, global warming potential indicator for biomass (GWPbio-100) and impact indicators proposed by UNEP-SETAC on ecosystem services and biodiversity. Options for forest biomass land inventory modelling are discussed. The system boundary covers only the biomass acquisition phase. Management scenarios are formulated for forest and barley biomass, and a sensitivity analysis focuses on impacts of land transformations for agro-biomass. Results and discussion: Meaningful differences were found in between solid biofuels from distinct land use classes. The impact indicator results were sensitive to land occupation and transformation and differed significantly from inventory results. Current impact assessment method is not sensitive to land management scenarios because the published characterisation factors are still too coarse and indicate differences only between land use types. All indicators on ecosystem services and biodiversity were sensitive to the assumptions related with land transformation. The land occupation (m2a) approach in inventory was found challenging for Scandinavian wood, due to long rotation periods and variable intensities of harvests. Some suggestions of UNEP-SETAC were challenged for the sake of practicality and relevance for decision support. Conclusions: Land use impact assessment framework for LCA and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) indicators could be applied in a comparison of solid bioenergy sources. Although forest bioenergy has higher land occupation than agro-bioenergy, LCIA indicator results are of similar magnitude or even lower for forest bioenergy. Previous literature indicates that environmental impacts of land use are significant, but it remains questionable if these are captured with satisfactory reliability with the applied LCA methodology, especially for forest biomass. Short and long time perspectives of land use impacts should be studied in LCA with characterisation factors for all relevant timeframes, not only 500 years, with a forward-looking perspective. Characterisation factors need to be modelled further for different (forest) land management intensities and for peat excavation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to compare the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of two cellulosic bioenergy pathways (i.e., bioethanol and bioelectricity) using different references and functional units. It also aims to address uncertainties associated with a comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) for the two bioenergy pathways. Methods: We develop a stochastic, comparative life cycle GHG analysis model for a switchgrass-based bioenergy system. Life cycle GHG offsets of the biofuel and bioelectricity pathways for cellulosic bioenergy are compared. The reference system for bioethanol is the equivalent amount of gasoline to provide the same transportation utility (e.g., vehicle driving for certain distance) as bioethanol does. We use multiple reference systems for bioelectricity, including the average US grid, regional grid in the USA according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), and average coal-fired power generation, on the basis of providing the same transportation utility. The functional unit is one unit of energy content (MJ). GHG offsets of bioethanol and bioelectricity relative to reference systems are compared in both grams carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare of land per year (g CO2-eq/ha-yr) and grams carbon dioxide equivalents per vehicle kilometer traveled (g CO2-eq/km). For the latter, we include vehicle cycle to make the comparison meaningful. To address uncertainty and variability, we derive life cycle GHG emissions based on probability distributions of individual parameters representing various unit processes in the life cycle of bioenergy pathways. Results and discussion: Our results show the choice of reference system and functional unit significantly changes the competition between switchgrass-based bioethanol and bioelectricity. In particular, our results show that the bioethanol pathway produces more life cycle GHG emissions than the bioelectricity pathway on a per unit energy content or a per unit area of crop land basis. However, the bioethanol pathway can offer more GHG offsets than the bioelectricity pathway on a per vehicle kilometer traveled basis when using bioethanol and bioelectricity for vehicle operation. Given the current energy mix of regional grids, bioethanol can potentially offset more GHG emissions than bioelectricity in all grid regions of the USA. Conclusions: The reference and functional unit can change bioenergy pathway choices. The comparative LCA of bioenergy systems is most useful for decision support only when it is spatially explicit to address regional specifics and differences. The difference of GHG offsets from bioethanol and bioelectricity will change as the grid evolves. When the grids get cleaner over time, the favorability of bioethanol for GHG offsets increases. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess and calculate the potential impacts of climate change on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potentials of combined production of whole corn bioethanol and stover biomethanol, and whole soybean biodiesel and stalk biomethanol. Both fuels are used as substitutes to conventional fossil-based fuels. The product system includes energy crop (feedstock) production and transportation, biofuels processing, and biofuels distribution to service station. Methods: The methodology is underpinned by life cycle thinking. Crop system model and life cycle assessment (LCA) model are linked in the analysis. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer - crop system model (DSSAT-CSM) is used to simulate biomass and grain yield under different future climate scenarios generated using a combination of temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2. Historical weather data for Gainesville, Florida, are obtained for the baseline period (1981-1990). Daily minimum and maximum air temperatures are projected to increase by +2.0, +3.0, +4.0, and +5.0 °C, precipitation is projected to change by ±20, 10, and 5 %, and atmospheric CO2 concentration is projected to increase by +70, +210, and +350 ppm. All projections are made throughout the growing season. GaBi 4.4 is used as primary LCA modelling software using crop yield data inputs from the DSSAT-CSM software. The models representation of the physical processes inventory (background unit processes) is constructed using the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database v2.0. Results and discussion: Under current baseline climate condition, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions savings per hectare from corn-integrated biomethanol synthesis (CIBM) and soybean-integrated biomethanol synthesis (SIBM) were calculated as -8,573.31 and -3,441 kg CO2-eq. ha-1 yr-1, respectively. However, models predictions suggest that these potential GHG emissions savings would be impacted by changing climate ranging from negative to positive depending on the crop and biofuel type, and climate scenario. Increased atmospheric level of CO2 tends to minimise the negative impacts of increased temperature. Conclusions: While policy measures are being put in place for the use of renewable biofuels driven by the desire to reduce GHG emissions from the use of conventional fossil fuels, climate change would also have impacts on the potential GHG emissions reductions resulting from the use of these renewable biofuels. However, the magnitude of the impact largely depends on the biofuel processing technology and the energy crop (feedstock) type. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Stakeholders in plantation forestry are increasingly aware of the importance of the ecosystem services and non-market values associated with forests. In New Zealand, there is significant interest in establishing species other than Pinus radiata D. Don (the dominant plantation species) in the belief that alternative species are better suited to deliver these services. Significant risk is associated with this position as there is little objective data to support these views. To identify which species were likely to be planted to deliver ecosystem services, a survey was distributed to examine stakeholder perceptions. Stakeholders were asked which of 15 tree attributes contributed to the provision of five ecosystem services (amenity value, bioenergy production, carbon capture, the diversity of native habitat, and erosion control/water quality) and to identify which of 22 candidate tree species possessed those attributes. These data were combined to identify the species perceived most suitable for the delivery of each ecosystem service. Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl. closely matched the stakeholder derived ideotypes associated with all five ecosystem services. Comparisons to data from growth, physiological and ecological studies demonstrated that many of the opinions held by stakeholders were inaccurate, leading to erroneous assumptions regarding the suitability of most candidate species. Stakeholder perceptions substantially influence tree species selection, and plantations established on the basis of inaccurate opinions are unlikely to deliver the desired outcomes. Attitudinal surveys associated with engagement campaigns are essential to improve stakeholder knowledge, advancing the development of fit-for-purpose forest management that provides the required ecosystem services. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - This study presented life cycle water footprints (WFs) of biofuels from biomass in China based on the resource distribution, climate conditions, soil conditions and crop growing characteristics. Life cycle WFs including blue, green and gray water were evaluated for the selected fuel pathways. Geographical differences of water requirements were revealed to be different by locations the results indicated that water irrigation requirements were significantly different from crop to crop, ranging from 2-293, 78-137, and 17-621 m 3/ha, for sweet sorghum, cassava, and Jatropha curcas L., respectively. Four biofuel pathways were selected on this basis to analyze the life cycle WF: cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi, sweet sorghum based bioethanol in Northeast China, Jatropha curcal L. based biodiesel in Yunnan and microalgae based biodiesel in Hainan the life cycle WFs of bioethanol from cassava and sweet sorghum were 3708, and 17 156 m3 per ton of bioethanol, respectively, whereas for biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas L. and microalgae, they were 5787, and 31 361 m3 per ton of biodiesel, respectively the crop growing stage was the main contributor to the whole life cycle of each pathway. Compared to blue and green water, gray water was significant due to the use of fertilizer during the growing of biomass. From the perspective of the WF, cassava based bioethanol in Guangxi and Jatropha based biodiesel in Yunnan were suitable for promotion, whereas the promotion for microalage based biodiesel in Hainan required improvement on technology. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Waste rock piles from historic mining activities remain unvegetated as a result of metal toxicity and high acidity. Biochar has been proposed as a low-cost remediation strategy to increase soil pH and reduce leaching of toxic elements, and improve plant establishment. In this laboratory column study, biochar made from beetle-killed pine wood was assessed for utility as a soil amendment by mixing soil material from two mine sites collected near Silverton, Colorado, USA with four application rates of biochar (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% vol:vol). Columns were leached seven times over 65. days and leachate pH and concentration of toxic elements and base cations were measured at each leaching. Nutrient availability and soil physical and biological parameters were determined following the incubation period. We investigated the hypotheses that biochar incorporation into acidic mine materials will (1) reduce toxic element concentrations in leaching solution, (2) improve soil parameters (i.e. increase nutrient and water holding capacity and pH, and decrease compaction), and (3) increase microbial populations and activity. Biochar directly increased soil pH (from 3.33 to 3.63 and from 4.07 to 4.77 in the two materials) and organic matter content, and decreased bulk density and extractable salt content in both mine materials, and increased nitrate availability in one material. No changes in microbial population or activity were detected in either mine material upon biochar application. In leachate solution, biochar increased base cations from both materials and reduced the concentrations of Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in leachate solution from one material. However, in the material with greater toxic element content, biochar did not reduce concentrations of any measured dissolved toxic elements in leachate and resulted in a potentially detrimental release of Cd and Zn into solution at concentrations above that of the pure mine material. The length of time of effectiveness and specific sorption by biochar is variable by element and the toxic element concentration and acidity of the initial mine material. © 2014.

AB  - This paper contributes to our understanding of why delegitimising focusing events, combined with the mobilisation of policy losers, does not always result in major policy change by undermining a monopolistic policy image and policy subsystem. Based on a close enquiry of American biofuel policy development, it argues that we can make headway in this endeavour by focusing on three factors: first, the congruence of a policy image with core values of the polity; second, the multidimensionality of a policy image; and third, policy image management strategies that maintain cohesion among coalition supporters and respond to outside criticism. In understanding better why some policy images (and policy monopolies) prove resilient when they come under assault, this paper offers a single case plausibility probe supported by indicative evidence from other policy studies. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - Bio-energy demand is known to be influenced by geographical origin and social equity. This paper aims to highlight the influence of the proximity between biomass production and energy consumption on the demand for alternative bio-fuels. In the context of Burkina Faso, we explore potential demand for Jatropha oil (. Jatropha curcas) as a diesel substitute among engine owners. Survey data are based on a between-groups design: one group of respondents experiencing a local supply chain, while the other a global one. Results show that proximity has a significant effect on potential demand itself and on the formation and strength of beliefs regarding Jatropha oil. In a local supply chain context, the demand is superior and seems to be guided more by a certain economic and technical rationality. Conversely, the prospect of a Jatropha oil produced outside the village restrains demand and this latter is more determined by contextual factors and social interaction. Our analysis confirms that demand does not only depend on technical and economic factors such as price but also on the integration of the biomass production and processing in the socioeconomic life of local rural populations. Understanding demand construction and assessing underlying beliefs are key success factors for bio-energy projects. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Colombian biofuels are used in the transportation sector at low-percentage blends of biofuel-fossil fuel (until 8:92, volume basis). Since energy policies encourage the increment of Bioenergy percentage in energy matrix, the biofuels production and use should be increased during the next years. In this work, the environmental assessment of several scenarios involving current and promising biofuel supply chains was made. The aim of this paper was the assessment of several possible alternatives to increase the biofuels production from current agricultural supply chains. Sugarcane, cassava, oil-palm and jatropha were considered as feedstocks for the analysis. The environmental assessment included calculations of the greenhouse gas emissions and the potential environmental impacts, using the life cycle assessment approach. The results indicated that the current biofuels production mitigates environmental impacts in comparison to fossil fuels production and use. Additionally, biofuels production using promising feedstocks could be environmentally competitive if the production processes are improved. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Meeting European renewable energy production targets is expected to cause significant changes in land use patterns. With an EU target of obtaining 20% of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, national and local policy makers need guidance on the impact of potential delivery strategies on ecosystem goods and services to ensure the targets are met in a sustainable manner. Within agroecosystems, models are available to explore consequences of such policy decisions for food, fuel and fibre production but few can describe the effect on biodiversity. This paper describes the integration and application of a farmland bird population model within a geographical information system (GIS) to explore the consequences of land use changes arising from different strategies to meet renewable energy production targets. Within a 16,000. ha arable dominated case study area in England, the population growth rates of 19 farmland bird species were predicted under baseline land cover, a scenario maximising wheat production for bioethanol, and a scenario focused on mix of bioenergy sources. Both scenarios delivered renewable energy production targets for the region (> 12 kWh per person per day) but, despite differences in resultant landscape composition, the response of the farmland bird community as a whole to each scenario was small and broadly similar. However, this similarity in overall response masked significant intra- and inter-specific variations across the study area and between scenarios suggesting contrasting mechanisms of impact and highlighting the need for context dependent, species-level assessment of land use change impacts. This framework provides one of the first systematic attempts to spatially model the effect of policy driven land use change on the population dynamics of a suite of farmland birds. The GIS framework also facilitates its integration with other ecosystem service models to explore wider synergies and trade offs arising from national or local policy interventions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Clostridium autoethanogenum strain JA1-1 (DSM 10061) is an acetogen capable of fermenting CO, CO2 and H2 (e.g. from syngas or waste gases) into biofuel ethanol and commodity chemicals such as 2,3-butanediol. A draft genome sequence consisting of 100 contigs has been published. Results: A closed, high-quality genome sequence for C. autoethanogenum DSM10061 was generated using only the latest single-molecule DNA sequencing technology and without the need for manual finishing. It is assigned to the most complex genome classification based upon genome features such as repeats, prophage, nine copies of the rRNA gene operons. It has a low G + C content of 31.1%. Illumina, 454, Illumina/454 hybrid assemblies were generated and then compared to the draft and PacBio assemblies using summary statistics, CGAL, QUAST and REAPR bioinformatics tools and comparative genomic approaches. Assemblies based upon shorter read DNA technologies were confounded by the large number repeats and their size, which in the case of the rRNA gene operons were ∼5 kb. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Paloindromic Repeats) systems among biotechnologically relevant Clostridia were classified and related to plasmid content and prophages. Potential associations between plasmid content and CRISPR systems may have implications for historical industrial scale Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) fermentation failures and future large scale bacterial fermentations. While C. autoethanogenum contains an active CRISPR system, no such system is present in the closely related Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528. A common prophage inserted into the Arg-tRNA shared between the strains suggests a common ancestor. However, C. ljungdahlii contains several additional putative prophages and it has more than double the amount of prophage DNA compared to C. autoethanogenum. Other differences include important metabolic genes for central metabolism (as an additional hydrogenase and the absence of a phophoenolpyruvate synthase) and substrate utilization pathway (mannose and aromatics utilization) that might explain phenotypic differences between C. autoethanogenum and C. ljungdahlii. Conclusions: Single molecule sequencing will be increasingly used to produce finished microbial genomes. The complete genome will facilitate comparative genomics and functional genomics and support future comparisons between Clostridia and studies that examine the evolution of plasmids, bacteriophage and CRISPR systems. © 2014 Brown et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Brown macroalgae represent an ideal source for complex polysaccharides that can be utilized as precursors for cellulosic biofuels. The lack of recalcitrant lignin components in macroalgae polysaccharide reserves provides a facile route for depolymerization of constituent polysaccharides into simple monosaccharides. The most abundant sugars in macroalgae are alginate, mannitol, and glucan, and although several classes of enzymes that can catabolize the latter two have been characterized, studies of alginate-depolymerizing enzymes have lagged. Here, we present several crystal structures of Alg17c from marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans along with structure-function characterization of active site residues that are suggested to be involved in the exolytic mechanism of alginate depolymerization. This represents the first structural and biochemical characterization of a family 17 polysaccharide lyase enzyme. Despite the lack of appreciable sequence conservation, the structure and β-elimination mechanism for glycolytic bond cleavage by Alg17c are similar to those observed for family 15 polysaccharide lyases and other lyases. This work illuminates the evolutionary relationships among enzymes within this unexplored class of polysaccharide lyases and reinforces the notion of a structure-based hierarchy in the classification of these enzymes. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Locating sites for new algae cultivation facilities is a complex task. The climate must support high growth rates, and cultivation ponds require appropriate land and water resources, as well as transportation and utility infrastructure. We employ our spatiotemporal Biomass Assessment Tool (BAT) to select promising locations based on the open-pond cultivation of Arthrospira sp. and strains of the order Sphaeropleales. A total of 64 000 sites across the southern United States were evaluated. We progressively applied screening criteria and tracked their impact on the number of potential sites, geographic location, and biomass productivity. Both strains demonstrated maximum productivity along the Gulf of Mexico coast, with the highest values on the Florida peninsula. In contrast, sites meeting all selection criteria for Arthrospira were located along the southern coast of Texas and for Sphaeropleales were located in Louisiana and southern Arkansas. Results were driven mainly by the lack of oil pipeline access in Florida and elevated groundwater salinity in southern Texas. The requirement for low-salinity freshwater (&lt;400 mg L-1) constrained Sphaeropleales locations; siting flexibility is greater for salt-tolerant species like Arthrospira. Combined siting factors can result in significant departures from regions of maximum productivity but are within the expected range of site-specific process improvements. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Farms in the glaciated tallgrass prairie region of North America are topographically heterogeneous with wide-ranging soil quality. This environmental heterogeneity may affect choice and placement of species planted for biomass production. We designed replicated experiments and monitored farm-scale production to evaluate the effects of landscape position, vegetation type, and year on yields of monocultures and mixtures. Research was conducted on a 262-ha South Dakota working farm where cropland had been replanted with a variety of native grassland types having biofuel feedstock potential. Vegetation type (diverse mixture or switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L.] monoculture) and year interacted to influence yield in replicated experiments (p&lt;0.10). Mean annual switchgrass yield above a stubble height of 10cm was 9.3Mgha-1 in two replicated experiments, and was greater than yield of mixtures (7.3Mgha-1) in 6 of 7 year×vegetation type combinations. Landscape position interacted with year and vegetation type to influence yield (p&lt;0.10). Variability was generally greatest at the lowest landscape position. On the farm's larger fields (0.4-46ha), three-year mean yields of switchgrass monocultures cut at ground level (12.7Mgha-1) were also greater than yields of mixtures (9.7Mgha-1) but both were less than prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) monoculture yield (13.2Mgha-1) in a restored wetland. A combination of prairie monocultures and mixtures, strategically placed across a farm landscape, could offer a balance of productivity, ecosystem services, and income with potential as biofuel feedstock and other income streams (hay, seed, beef). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As the main driver for bioenergy is to enable society to transform to more sustainable fuel and energy production systems, it is important to safeguard that bioenergy deployment happens within certain sustainability constraints. There is currently a high number of initiatives, including binding regulations and several voluntary sustainability standards for biomass, bioenergy and/or biofuels. Within IEA Bioenergy studies were performed to monitor the actual implementation process of sustainability regulations and certification, evaluate how stakeholders are affected and envisage the anticipated impact on worldwide markets and trade. On the basis of these studies, recommendations were made on how sustainability requirements could actually support further bioenergy deployment. Markets would gain from more harmonization and cross-compliance. A common language is needed as 'sustainability' of biomass involves different policy arenas and legal settings. Policy pathways should be clear and predictable, and future revisions of sustainability requirements should be open and transparent. Sustainability assurance systems (both through binding regulations and voluntary certification) should take into account how markets work, in relation to different biomass applications (avoiding discrimination among end-uses and users). It should also take into account the way investment decisions are taken, administrative requirements for smallholders, and the position of developing countries. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - Low carbon energy technologies are not deployed in a social vacuum; there are a variety of complex ways in which people understand and engage with these technologies and the changing energy system overall. However, the role of the public's socio-environmental sensitivities to low carbon energy technologies and their responses to energy deployments does not receive much serious attention in planning decarbonisation pathways to 2050. Resistance to certain resources and technologies based on particular socio-environmental sensitivities would alter the portfolio of options available which could shape how the energy system achieves decarbonisation (the decarbonisation pathway) as well as affecting the cost and achievability of decarbonisation. Thus, this paper presents a series of three modelled scenarios which illustrate the way that a variety of socio-environmental sensitivities could impact the development of the energy system and the decarbonisation pathway. The scenarios represent risk aversion (DREAD) which avoids deployment of potentially unsafe large-scale technology, local protectionism (NIMBY) that constrains systems to their existing spatial footprint, and environmental awareness (ECO) where protection of natural resources is paramount. Very different solutions for all three sets of constraints are identified; some seem slightly implausible (DREAD) and all show increased cost (especially in ECO). © 2014 Brighid Moran Jay et al.

AB  - Arecaceae Schultz-Sch. (Palmae Juss.), a member of the monocotyledon group, is considered one of the oldest extant angiosperm families on Earth. This family is highly valuable because of its species diversity, its occurrence in a wide range of habitats, and its status as an integral part of the culture and the family-based economy of many traditional and nontraditional communities. The main objectives of this study were to perform an ethnobotanical study involving these palms and a "Quilombola" (Maroon) community in the municipality of Cavalcante, GO, Brazil. The variables gender, age, and formal schooling had no influence on the number of species recognized and used by the Kalungas. Ethnobotanical studies based on traditional knowledge in addition to use and management of palms are fundamental aspects for planning and appliance of public policies directed to the use of natural resources and improvement of life quality. © 2014 Renata Corrêa Martins et al.

AB  - Background: The yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima, previously utilised as a biological control agent, was evaluated for its potential to produce lipids for biofuel production. Results: Cultivation in low cost non-sterile conditions was achieved by exploiting its ability to grow at low temperature and pH and to produce natural antimicrobial compounds. Although not previously classified as oleaginous, a combination of low temperature and restricted nutrient availability triggered high levels of oil production in M. pulcherrima cultures. This regime was designed to trigger the sporulation process but prevent its completion to allow the accumulation of a subset of a normally transitional, but oil-rich, 'pulcherrima' cell type. This approach resulted in yields of up to 40% lipid, which compares favourably with other oleaginous microbes. We also demonstrate that M. pulcherrima metabolises glycerol and a diverse range of other sugars, suggesting that heterogeneous biomass could provide a suitable carbon source. M. pulcherrima also grows well in a minimal media containing no yeast extract. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the yeast to produce lipids inexpensively on an industrial scale by culturing the yeast in a 500 L, open air, tank reactor without any significant contamination. Conclusions: The production of antimicrobial compounds coupled to efficient growth at low temperature and pH enables culture of this oleaginous yeast in inexpensive, non-sterile conditions providing a potential route to economic biofuel production. © 2014 Santamauro et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Low-carbon biofuel sources are being developed and evaluated in the United States and Europe to partially offset petroleum transport fuels. Current and potential biofuel production systems were evaluated from a long-term continuous no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) field trial under differing harvest strategies and nitrogen (N) fertilizer intensities to determine overall environmental sustainability. Corn and switchgrass grown for bioenergy resulted in near-term net greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of -29 to -396 grams of CO2 equivalent emissions per megajoule of ethanol per year as a result of direct soil carbon sequestration and from the adoption of integrated biofuel conversion pathways. Management practices in switchgrass and corn resulted in large variation in petroleum offset potential. Switchgrass, using best management practices produced 3919±117 liters of ethanol per hectare and had 74±2.2 gigajoules of petroleum offsets per hectare which was similar to intensified corn systems (grain and 50% residue harvest under optimal N rates). Co-locating and integrating cellulosic biorefineries with existing dry mill corn grain ethanol facilities improved net energy yields (GJ ha-1) of corn grain ethanol by &gt;70%. A multi-feedstock, landscape approach coupled with an integrated biorefinery would be a viable option to meet growing renewable transportation fuel demands while improving the energy efficiency of first generation biofuels.

AB  - Solar energy installations in deserts are on the rise, fueled by technological advances and policy changes. Deserts, with a combination of high solar radiation and availability of large areas unusable for crop production are ideal locations for large solar installations. However, for efficient power generation, solar infrastructures use large amounts of water for construction and operation. We investigated the water use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with solar installations in North American deserts in comparison to agave-based biofuel production, another widely promoted potential energy source from arid systems. We determined the uncertainty in our analysis by a Monte Carlo approach that varied the most important parameters, as determined by sensitivity analysis. We considered the uncertainty in our estimates as a result of variations in the number of solar modules ha-1, module efficiency, number of agave plants ha-1, and overall sugar conversion efficiency for agave. Further, we considered the uncertainty in revenue and returns as a result of variations in the wholesale price of electricity and installation cost of solar photovoltaic (PV), wholesale price of agave ethanol, and cost of agave cultivation and ethanol processing. The life-cycle analyses show that energy outputs and GHG offsets from solar PV systems, mean energy output of 2405 GJ ha-1 year-1 (5 and 95% quantile values of 1940-2920) and mean GHG offsets of 464 Mg of CO2 equiv ha -1 year-1 (375-562), are much larger than agave, mean energy output from 206 (171-243) to 61 (50-71) GJ ha-1 year -1 and mean GHG offsets from 18 (14-22) to 4.6 (3.7-5.5) Mg of CO2 equiv ha-1 year-1, depending upon the yield scenario of agave. Importantly though, water inputs for cleaning solar panels and dust suppression are similar to amounts required for annual agave growth, suggesting the possibility of integrating the two systems to maximize the efficiency of land and water use to produce both electricity and liquid fuel. A life-cycle analysis of a hypothetical colocation indicated higher returns per m3 of water used than either system alone. Water requirements for energy production were 0.22 L MJ-1 (0.28-0.19) and 0.42 L MJ -1 (0.52-0.35) for solar PV-agave (baseline yield) and solar PV-agave (high yield), respectively. Even though colocation may not be practical in all locations, in some water-limited areas, colocated solar PV-agave systems may provide attractive economic incentives in addition to efficient land and water use. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The potential for widespread use of domestically available energy resources, in conjunction with climate change concerns, suggest that biomass may be an essential component of U.S. energy systems in the near future. Cellulosic biomass in particular is anticipated to be used in increasing quantities because of policy efforts, such as federal renewable fuel standards and state renewable portfolio standards. Unfortunately, these independently designed biomass policies do not account for the fact that cellulosic biomass can equally be used for different, competing energy demands. An integrated assessment of multiple feedstocks, energy demands, and system costs is critical for making optimal decisions about a unified biomass energy strategy. This study develops a spatially explicit, best-use framework to optimally allocate cellulosic biomass feedstocks to energy demands in transportation, electricity, and residential heating sectors, while minimizing total system costs and tracking greenhouse gas emissions. Comparing biomass usage across three climate policy scenarios suggests that biomass used for space heating is a low cost emissions reduction option, while biomass for liquid fuel or for electricity becomes attractive only as emissions reduction targets or carbon prices increase. Regardless of the policy approach, study results make a strong case for national and regional coordination in policy design and compliance pathways. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increasing the use of biofuels influences atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Although widely recognized, uncertainties related to the particular impacts are typically ignored or only partly considered. In this paper, various sources of uncertainty related to the GHG emission savings of biofuels are considered comprehensively and transparently through scenario analysis and stochastic simulation. Technology and feedstock production chain-specific factors, market-mediated factors and climate policy time frame issues are reflected using as a case study Fischer-Tropsch diesel derived from boreal forest biomass in Finland. This case study shows that the GHG emission savings may be positive or negative in many of the cases studied, and are subject to significant uncertainties, which are mainly determined by market-mediated factors related to fossil diesel substitution. Regardless of the considerable uncertainties, some robust conclusions could be drawn; it was likely of achieving some sort of but unlikely of achieving significant savings in the GHG emissions within the 100 year time frame in many cases. Logging residues (branches) performed better than stumps and living stem wood in terms of the GHG emission savings, which could be increased mainly by blocking carbon leakage. Forest carbon stock changes also significantly contributed to the GHG emission savings. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Whilst transport biofuels have enjoyed strong political support in Europe for much of the past decade, concerns over their full impacts have an almost equally long history. Since 2008 these concerns have centred most intently upon the land-use change impacts of biofuel production, whereby increased demand for biofuels leads nonagricultural landscapes to be converted-either directly or indirectly-into agricultural ones. Amongst other things, biofuel-driven land-use change might potentially lead to significant emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), losses of biodiversity, reduced ecosystem resilience, degradation of soil and water resources, declines in regional food security, or even land rights infringements through so-called 'land-grabbing'. Political debates surrounding biofuel-driven land-use change in Europe have historically been restricted, however, to considerations of technical modelling work addressing the GHG emissions that might result from this process, thereby ignoring a wide range of alternative issues. Adopting a discursive-institutionalist perspective, this paper scrutinises two interrelated sets of dynamics pertaining to the handling of this political issue in Europe. First, it examines how the specific bureaucratic context of Brussels has itself been constitutive of the discursive practices used by policy makers to establish and retain control of the prevailing political conception of biofuel-driven land-use change. Second, it examines how these practices have inevitably led to what Scott terms a "narrowing of vision" in policy makers' approach to this problem, with concomitant implications for the role occupied by conceptions of 'place' in the policy process. In both instances the argument is made that such interactions exclude critical perspectives on what is at stake in the drive for biofuels from relevant policy-making procedures altogether. In light of these conclusions, I contend that future geographical analyses of environmental policy making writ large should pay greater attention to the interactions of discourse and place, particularly if they are to better understand the precise mechanisms through which political controversy is ultimately managed and settled in modern democratic contexts today.

AB  - This paper analyzes the scientific practices that constitute carbon economies by rendering carbon countable, fungible, and governable. Examining US biofuel governance, I draw on field research and document and policy analyses to consider the roles state, private industry, and civil society actors play in negotiating scientific practice in biofuel governance and to explore the geographically uneven consequences of contrasting science- society configurations. This research illustrates the complex and contradictory roles of nature's quantification and state-supported science in carbon economies. Although nature's quantification as carbon was initially used as a technology of opposition and accountability to limit vested interest power and maintain biofuels' greenhouse gas reduction capacity, it ultimately served industry interests by focusing policy deliberation on technical issues industry deftly navigated and away from policy rationale, value conflict, and biofuels' broader social-ecological consequences. Drawing attention to state-supported environmental risk assessment and place-based approaches to integrating science and agriculture, this research describes multiple, conflicting modes of state scientific practice and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple scientific perspectives in climate change research and intervention. I argue that, rather than focusing on mitigating climate change through universal, carbon-focused science alone, future science-society configurations should include efforts to build institutional capacity for transformation and adaptation to confront uneven and changing social-ecological circumstances using site-specific scientific knowledge.

AB  - In this paper I propose to push the frontier of global value chain (GVC) governance analysis through the concept of 'polarity'. Much of the existing GVC literature has focused on 'unipolar' value chains, where one group of 'lead firms' inhabiting a specific function in a chain plays a dominant role in governing it. Some scholars have explored the dynamics of governance in GVCs characterized as 'bipolar', where two sets of actors in different functional positions both drive the chain. I expand this direction further to suggest conceptualizing governance within a continuum between unipolarity and multipolarity. Empirically, I do so by examining the evolutionary dynamics of governance in biofuel value chains, with specific focus on the key regulatory and institutional features that facilitated their emergence and expansion. First, I examine the formation, evolution, and governance of three national/regional value chains (in Brazil, the US, and the EU); then, I provide evidence to support a trend towards the increasing but still partial formation of a global biofuel value chain and examine its governance traits.

AB  - Technoscientific innovation has played a central role in UK biofuel policy. When the government was proposing mandatory targets in 2007-08, public controversy over 'unsustainable biofuels' was channelled into prospects for future biofuels to avoid environmental harm and land-use conflicts. This vision serves as an imaginary-a feasible, desirable future. Societal benefits have been envisaged according to specific models of economic competitiveness, valuable knowledge, and environmental sustainability- together comprising a prevalent imaginary of future 'sustainable biofuels'. This has informed institutional change along two lines. First, targets are envisaged as a temporary transition until future 'advanced biofuels' make liquid fuel more sustainable. Second, UK research institutes realign their priorities towards seeking investment from foreign counterparts and global energy companies, in the name of making UK science and industry more competitive. Together these measures have been justified as necessary for a transition to advanced biofuels which would better contribute to a low-carbon economy. Although this imaginary may eventually be transformed into reality, initially realised has been institutional change that reinforces infrastructural dependence on liquid fuel for the internal combustion engine. As an imaginary, then, 'sustainable biofuels' can help explain how a policy agenda promotes one future, while marginalising alternatives.

AB  - The bio-economy is characterised by aspirations of replacing the fossil-based economy with biobased energy, resources and processes; biofuels are particularly popular. This new shift comes with multiple risks and uncertainties in both industrialised and developing economies. The uptake of biofuels is inextricably linked to and legitimised by policy processes involving a complicated nexus of vested interests, political aspirations, and technological drivers, and a range of associated factors. In this paper we describe the characteristics of and contours along which two national biofuels policies in India and South Africa have been articulated and developed. In doing so we establish how a biofuels regime has gained legitimacy, becoming embedded into policy processes dictated largely through specific networks and reflective of the rationalising effect of global and local narratives. We analyse how pro-poor 'win-win' narratives gained purchase amongst different actors and in turn how they were used as a basis for biofuels policies. The case studies are, however, complex and differentiated, pointing towards sociopolitical nuances and structural subtleties.

AB  - The only sustainable environmental friendly source of carbon for liquid fuel production is biomass, which is fixed by plants using atmospheric CO2. However, a major challenge for biomass-based routes is to economically produce the enormous quantities of liquid hydrocarbons needed by the transportation and chemical sector. The fast pyrolysis oil possesses many undesirable properties making it chemically far from a crude oil replacement. In hydropyrolysis process, bio-oil formed is of better quality than that formed under inert atmosphere and has relatively low oxygen content. At present, there are no systematic studies on the hydropyrolysis of biomass, which can give a detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of the process. In addition to this, only several concepts have been proposed, which can be experimented. This review aims to provide a clear insight of the existing hydropyrolysis concepts and experiments carried out by different groups so far, along with the challenges and opportunities in the area. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate anaerobic digestibility of artichoke waste resulting from industrial transformation. A series of batch anaerobic digestion tests was performed in order to evaluate the biochemical methane potential of the matrix in respect of the process. A comparison of the different performances of the laboratory-scale reactors operating in mesophilic conditions and utilizing three different values of the inoculum/substrate ratio was carried out. The best performance was achieved with an inoculum/substrate ratio of 2. Artichoke-processing byproducts showed a classical organic waste decomposition behaviour: a fast start-up phase, an acclimation stage, and a final stabilization phase. Following this approach, artichoke waste reached chemical oxygen demand removal of about 90% in 40 days. The high methane yield (average 408.62 mL CH4 gvs-1 voltatile solids), makes artichoke waste a good product to be utilized in anaerobic digestion plants for biogas production. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - With respect to waste sorting, Shanghai sets an example for other Chinese cities on the standardized treatment of kitchen waste (KW) in China. According to the results of investigation, about 560 kilo tons of KW from different sources in Shanghai were produced in 2011. Of this, 45.6% (255.6 kilo tons) was collected and transported properly by a comprehensive and formal collection and transportation system. Landfilling and incineration, which are the traditional treatment technologies used, show downward trends because of increasing environmental awareness and land restrictions. Feed production, composting and biodiesel refining play increasingly important roles in the recycling of KW. Safe disposal, reduced KW quantity, public education, and technological innovation are still problematic issues and need to be considered in future waste management in Shanghai. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a dominant, perennial C4 grass of North American tallgrass prairies with cultivars that are widely used in grassland restoration, pastures, and landscaping. However, these cultivars may be genetically dissimilar to small, remnant populations, raising concerns about altered genetic composition of native populations through gene flow. To address this issue on a local scale in Ohio and Illinois, we used microsatellite markers to characterize genetic diversity and differentiation of 10 remnant prairie populations (5 in each state) and 8 common cultivars. The bulk of genetic variation was found to reside within rather than among wild populations, consistent with the outcrossing breeding system of switchgrass. Genetic diversity was similar among the remnant populations despite large differences in area (approximately 2-2,590ha), highlighting the importance of small native populations as reservoirs of variation and potential seed sources for prairie restoration. Cultivars generally had similar levels of variation to the wild populations, but we found clear genetic dissimilarity between wild and cultivated gene pools (especially for Kanlow, but also Trailblazer, Blackwell, Dacotah, Summer, and Sunburst cultivars). This suggests that using cultivars in local prairie restoration efforts may alter the genetic composition of wild populations. Whether such changes are deemed as negative depends on the cultivar under consideration and specific conservation goals for preserving native switchgrass populations. Patterns of genetic variation in remnant prairie populations and potential cultivar sources can be used to develop guidelines for restoration as well as future planting of cultivars for biofuels. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Purpose: Forest residues are becoming an increasingly important bioenergy feedstock. This study evaluates the environmental impacts associated with the production of fuel chips from eucalypt logging residues in Portugal, in order to identify the supply chains and machinery that bring the best environmental performance. Besides, the stages and operations with the largest environmental impact are identified. Methods: Life cycle assessment methodology is used starting with forest management up to delivery of chips to power plant. Three different configurations for logging residue processing were simulated as follows: roadside chipping of loose residues, terminal chipping of loose residues, and terminal chipping of bundled residues. In addition, the use of different equipment for tree felling and extraction of logging residue was considered the default impact assessment methodology was the CML. In a sensitivity analysis, calculations were performed using characterization factors recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). Different allocation criteria were tested for partitioning the environmental burdens between wood and forest residues produced during the stage of forest management. Results and discussion: Roadside chipping of loose residues seems to have less impacts regardless of the equipment used in tree felling and residue forwarding. However, for photochemical oxidant formation, this is not the case when trees are felled with a chainsaw when the CML methodology is applied. For the systems with terminal chipping, the better option will depend both on type of machinery used and distances traveled between the forest site and the power plant the forest management stage has a relevant contribution to all the supply chains analyzed. Chipping and bundling have also important impacts, as well as forwarding when this operation is accomplished with a modified farm tractor. Moreover, transports have a significant impact when loose residues are chipped in a terminal. Conclusions: The choice of the allocation method between wood and residues affects significantly the absolute results, but it is irrelevant when the objective is to select the best supply chain configuration the results obtained are valid for the input data considered, which rely on average values representative of the current most typical practices in Portugal. However, this methodology can also be applied as a decision supporting tool to select the supply chain with the best environmental performance on a case by case basis, using site-specific data. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biochar is a co-product from biomass pyrolysis that can sequester carbon when applied to soils. It may also reduce N2O and CH4 emissions from soils, increase fertilizer efficiency, increase soil organic carbon, and increase crop yields. Treatment of these additional agricultural effects in life cycle analyses (LCAs) of pyrolysis-based liquid fuels could significantly influence LCA results. In this study, we include these effects in analyses of fast and slow pyrolysis. We also consider scenarios in which biochar is combusted to produce electricity. Probability distribution functions are developed for biochar yield and carbon content whereas average, minimum, and maximum values for biochar's stability factor and agricultural effects are developed from a thorough literature review and used in baseline and sensitivity analyses. Overall, life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for pyrolysis-based gasoline are lower when biochar is applied to soil than when it is combusted. Carbon abatement (CA) values of fast and slow pyrolysis fuel production systems are comparable. CA is reduced for an alternative fast pyrolysis system in which the pyrolysis oil is combusted for heat and electricity generation rather than upgraded to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the baseline case with biochar soil application, inclusion of agricultural effects reduces GHG emissions by 2.1 g CO2e/MJ from 16 g CO2e/MJ. Biochar carbon content and yield exert the strongest influence on GHG emissions results. Results are also sensitive to biochar's ability to suppress N2O emissions and increase soil organic carbon, which are subject to high uncertainty. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - On-going human population growth and changing patterns of resource consumption are increasing global demand for ecosystem services, many of which are provided by soils. Some of these ecosystem services are linearly related to the surface area of pervious soil, whereas others show non-linear relationships, making ecosystem service optimization a complex task. As limited land availability creates conflicting demands among various types of land use, a central challenge is how to weigh these conflicting interests and how to achieve the best solutions possible from a perspective of sustainable societal development. These conflicting interests become most apparent in soils that are the most heavily used by humans for specific purposes: urban soils used for green spaces, housing, and other infrastructure and agricultural soils for producing food, fibres and biofuels. We argue that, despite their seemingly divergent uses of land, agricultural and urban soils share common features with regards to interactions between ecosystem services, and that the trade-offs associated with decision-making, while scale- and context-dependent, can be surprisingly similar between the two systems. We propose that the trade-offs within land use types and their soil-related ecosystems services are often disproportional, and quantifying these will enable ecologists and soil scientists to help policy makers optimizing management decisions when confronted with demands for multiple services under limited land availability. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study compared the economic and environmental impacts of torrefaction on bioenergy supply chains against conventional pellets for scenarios where biomass is produced in Mozambique, and undergoes pre-processing before shipment to Rotterdam for conversion to power and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels. We also compared the impacts of using different land quality (productive and marginal) for feedstock production, feedstocks (eucalyptus and switchgrass), final conversion technologies (XtY and CXtY) and markets (the Netherlands and Mozambique). At current conditions, the torrefied pellets (TOPs) are delivered in Rotterdam at higher cost (7.3-7.5 $/GJ) than pellets (5.1-5.3 $/GJ). In the long term, TOPs costs could decline (4.7-5.8 $/GJ) and converge with pellets. TOPs supply chains also incur 20% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than pellets. Due to improved logistics and lower conversion investment, fuel production costs from TOPs are lower (12.8-16.9 $/GJFT) than from pellets (12.9-18.7 $/GJFT). Co-firing scenarios (CXtY) result in lower cost fuel (but a higher environmental penalty) than 100% biomass fired scenarios (XtY). In most cases, switchgrass and the productive region of Nampula provide the lowest fuel production cost compared to eucalyptus and the marginally productive Gaza region. Both FT and ion in Mozambique are more costly than in Rotterdam. For the Netherlands, both FT and power production are competitive against average energy costs in Western Europe. The analysis shows that large-scale bioenergy production can become competitive against fossil fuels. While the benefits of TOPs are apparent in logistics and conversion, the current higher torrefaction costs contribute to higher biofuel costs. Improvements in torrefaction technology can result in significant performance improvements over the future chain. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Global biofuels production grew rapidly from 2007 to 2012, led by the United States and Brazil, the world's two largest fuel-ethanol-producing systems. In this paper we provide insights into the characteristics of mature Brazilian sugarcane and maturing US dry mill corn ethanol industries. Both systems continue to improve as measured by life cycle data such as total renewable energy produced per unit of fossil energy consumed [renewable energy ratio (RER)]. Sugarcane self-benchmarking systems showed RER values of 7.0 in 2002 to 9.4 in 2009 as the industry started to switch to mechanized harvesting. The average US RER improved from 1.1 to 1.7 from 2000 to 2010. RERs of 4.4 to 5.5 are observed in corn ethanol plants employing natural gas or corn stover combined heat and power. Ethanol systems configured to produce ethanol and electricity had similar net energy balances (a ratio of net energy produced to energy contained in the fuel). One measure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions (biomass use efficiency) compares the effectiveness of displacing carbon from combustion of fossil fuels with renewable carbon. Advanced corn ethanol systems reach higher GHG emission reduction levels compared to sugarcane ethanol by displacing coal-based electricity. Sugarcane systems achieve double the GHG emissions reductions per unit of harvested land relative to corn ethanol because sugarcane and corn are grown as perennial and annual crops in tropical and temperate climatic zones, respectively. Carbon dioxide capture and storage systems could offer additional GHG emission reductions for both corn and sugarcane ethanol systems. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The expected expansion of bioenergy in Brazil has raised concerns about the implications for its current comfortable situation of water resources availability. As water availability within the Brazilian territory is uneven, the bioenergy expansion might represent different impacts on the water resources of different regions. This work assessed, at the municipal and state levels, (i) the green and blue water footprint (WF) of the main liquid biofuels produced in Brazil (sugarcane ethanol and biodiesel); (ii) the impacts of full and salvage irrigation strategies on sugarcane WF; and (iii) the water demand for different agricultural land use scenarios. For the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Goiás, the WF of sugarcane ethanol was evaluated around 71 L MJ-1, while in the state of Paraná it reaches 100 L MJ-1. For biodiesel, values were between 40 and 50 L MJ-1. The blue WF was negligible for both biofuels, as the use of irrigation is still limited in Brazil today. Additionally, the analysis showed that full and salvage irrigation strategies would lead to lower WFs in all states considered, though in the expense of larger volumes of blue WF. Regarding land use change, the results suggested that additional evapotranspiration is occurring due to sugarcane expansion. Nevertheless, given the current situation of the Brazilian water basins, there is no evidence that sugarcane expansion over these areas will lead to critical pressure on water resources. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Switchgrass is a promising bioenergy source that is perennial, productive, native to a broad geographic region, and can grow on marginal, nitrogen (N)-poor soils. Understanding N dynamics in switchgrass is critical to predicting productivity, conserving N, and optimizing the timing of harvest. We examined seasonal changes in N distribution in above- and belowground tissues in switchgrass to quantify N retranslocation rates. Above- and belowground biomass from three sites (two in PA and one in NE) were collected and analyzed for biomass growth and N concentrations at 30-day intervals from June through October. Total living plant mass ranged from 10.3 ± 2.4 standard error (SE) to 14.9 ± 2.5 SE Mg ha-1. Belowground mass comprised 52-57 % of total mass. Blades had the highest N concentration during summer, ranging from 6 to 22 g kg-1 N. Aboveground N concentrations decreased from September until autumn senescence, whereas belowground N concentration increased from August until senescence. Across the sites, total N retranslocated from aboveground to belowground components between September and October averaged 16.5 ± 7.1 (SE) kg ha-1 N representing 26.7 % of the average maximum N content of aboveground biomass. Based on N fertilizer costs, delayed harvest would conserve some N and provide financial savings on fertilizer ($9 ha-1) if harvest occurs after senescence but before overwinter biomass loss. However, biomass losses of even 10 % will negate potential economic savings accrued from N retention. To maximize environmental and economic savings from N retranslocation and to simultaneously minimize harvest losses, it would be optimal to harvest switchgrass as soon as possible after complete senescence. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The C4 perennial grasses Miscanthus × giganteus and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) are emerging bioenergy crops. They are attractive because they are productive and recycle nutrients to the overwintering belowground rhizomes, before the dry shoots are harvested. They are therefore expected to require minimal fertilizer inputs, a desirable trait for any crop. Until now, Europe has had the only long-term trials of M. × giganteus, and these have either shown no or a small effect of nitrogen fertilization, while trials of P. virgatum in the USA have shown a clear positive effect of N fertilization. This study exploited the first long-term trials of M. × giganteus in the USA, and first side-by-side comparison with P. virgatum, to test the hypothesis that N fertilization would only improve yields of the latter. A split-plot N fertility treatment (0, 67, 134, and 202 kg(N) ha-1) was added to &gt;5-year-old replicated stands of the two crops at seven locations on contrasting soils in the US Midwest. Averaged across all locations, M. × giganteus yields increased significantly from 23.4 Mg ha-1 with no N fertilization to 28.9 Mg ha-1 (+25 %) at a N application rate of 202 kg ha-1. P. virgatum also showed significant yield increases from 10.33 Mg ha-1 at 0 kg(N) ha-1 to 13.6 Mg ha-1 (+32 %) at 202 kg(N) ha-1. Both species therefore responded to N fertilization and to a similar extent. The increase per unit of added N was small compared to crops such as Zea mays and unlikely to be economically worthwhile. Nitrogen fertilization arrested most of the long-term yield decline that would otherwise have occurred in P. virgatum, but eliminated only about 40 % of the decline observed in M. × giganteus, suggesting additional causal factors for long-term yield decline in this crop. While the crops responded to nitrogen addition at some locations, they did not at others. Therefore a one-case-fits-all optimum fertilization rate cannot be prescribed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Soils of contaminated agrosystems represent potential arable land surfaces for the production of non-alimentary crops. The aim of this study is to monitor changes in belowground biodiversity (Collembola), potentially occurring following establishment of perennial biomass crop systems on contaminated agricultural land. We selected, within an agricultural trial, two different biomass crops, miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and an annual wheat crop (Triticum sp.) used as a control. About 20-fold more individuals were found under miscanthus and switchgrass than under wheat. The highest mean number of species was found under miscanthus being 30% greater than in switchgrass and 424% than in annual wheat. Furthermore, abundance and species richness of the three collembolan life-forms (epedaphic, hemiedaphic, and euedaphic) differed between the crops leading to distinctly different assemblages. On metal contaminated soils, perennial bioenergy crops have the potential to increase belowground faunal diversity and abundance with the identity of crops as a critical factor driving soil animal assemblages. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The microbial community structure of a stable pilot-scale thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor digester stabilized on poultry litter was investigated. This 40-m3 digester produced biogas with 57 % methane, and chemical oxygen demand removal of 54 %. Bacterial and archaeal diversity were examined using both cloning and pyrosequencing that targeted 16S rRNA genes. The bacterial community was dominated by phylum Firmicutes, constituting 93 % of the clones and 76 % of the pyrotags. Of the Firmicutes, class Clostridia (52 % pyrotags) was most abundant followed by class Bacilli (13 % pyrotags). The bacterial libraries identified 94 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and pyrosequencing identified 577 OTUs at the 97 % minimum similarity level. Fifteen OTUs were dominant (≥2 % abundance), and nine of these were novel unclassified Firmicutes. Several of the dominant OTUs could not be classified more specifically than Clostridiales, but were most similar to plant biomass degraders, including Clostridium thermocellum. Of the rare pyrotag OTUs (&lt;0.5 % abundance), 75 % were Firmicutes. The dominant methanogen was Methanothermobacter which has hydrogenotrophic metabolism, and accounted for &gt;99 % of the archaeal clones. Based on the primary methanogen, as well as digester chemistry (high VA and ammonia levels), we propose that bacterial acetate oxidation is the primary pathway in this digester for the control of acetate levels. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The 'food vs. fuel' debate inspired the concept of indirect land use change (iLUC). Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors for iLUC are proposed for inclusion into carbon footprints (CF) of biofuels. The range of published iLUC values is enormous: from about 200% below, up to 1700% above the CF values of fossil fuels. From the perspective of life cycle assessment (LCA) and CF science, single iLUC factors are currently more representative for the approach or model used than for the crop or biofuel assessed. The scientific robustness is not sufficient for political and corporate decision making. None of the relevant international standards of LCA or CF require the inclusion of iLUC. The iLUC concept deserves credit for raising awareness of a relevant problem but it is not the solution. Science and policy should focus on proactive real world mitigation of iLUC rather than reactive and theoretical iLUC factors. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Background: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which contain two or more double bonds in their backbone, are the focus of intensive global research, because of their nutritional value, medicinal applications, and potential use as biofuel. However, the ability to produce these economically important compounds is limited, because it is both expensive and technically challenging to separate omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) from natural oils. Although the biosynthetic pathways of some plant and microalgal ω-3 PUFAs have been deciphered, current understanding of the correlation between fatty acid desaturase content and fatty acid synthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is incomplete. Results: We constructed a series of homologous vectors for the endogenous and exogenous expression of Δ6 and Δ15 fatty acid desaturases under the control of the photosynthesis psbA2 promoter in transgenic Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. We generated six homologous recombinants, harboring various fatty acid desaturase genes from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Gibberella fujikuroi and Mortierella alpina. These lines produced up to 8.9 mg/l of α-linolenic acid (ALA) and 4.1 mg/l of stearidonic acid (SDA), which are more than six times the corresponding wild-type levels, at 20°C and 30°C. Thus, transgenic expression of Δ6 and Δ15 fatty acid desaturases enhances the accumulation of specific ω-3 PUFAs in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Conclusions: In the blue-green alga Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, overexpression of endogenous and exogenous genes encoding PUFA desaturases markedly increased accumulation of ALA and SDA and decreased accumulation of linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid. This study lays the foundation for increasing the fatty acid content of cyanobacteria and, ultimately, for producing nutritional and medicinal products with high levels of essential ω-3 PUFAs. © 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Globalization drives a process of diet convergence among developing and developed countries that challenges the predictions about future patterns of food consumption. To address this issue, the objective of this article is to map the range of the possible future diet changes and to explore their impact on agriculture using the Nexus Land-Use model. This model computes agricultural intensification in the crop and livestock sectors at the global scale, based on an architecture accounting for the different types of food calories. By considering four scenarios built on distinct assumptions regarding diet convergence, this article sheds light on the pivotal role of diet changes as drivers of tensions on agriculture and land use and shows the uncertainty associated with processes of diet convergence for foresight exercises on food and agriculture. Finally, the interactions between food production and the other land-use patterns are explored by testing the sensitivity of our results to assumptions regarding biofuel production, deforestation, potential crop yields, and nutrient-use efficiency. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

AB  - What does it mean to have an Anthropocene body? The Anthropocene period is putatively defined by flows of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives (fuels, plastics, fertilizers, etc.), and the very term 'Anthropocene' suggests an increasing awareness of the finitude and contingency of contemporary corporealities. This article explores the idea of modelling an Anthropocene body as a living/non-living metabolic process. While identifying bodies with molecules raises a host of problems, metabolism and hydrocarbon biomolecules display a gamut of forms of possession and ways of having a body. Conversion between living and non-living forms of possession can be traced in contemporary genomic science and particularly in synthetic biology as they engineer microbes to produce next-generation biofuels. In contrast to fossil fuels, these fuels derive from genomically re-engineered microbes that digest biomass or photosynthesize to produce hydrocarbons. The problematic contemporary production of these fuels might help us to articulate what it means to have a body as a metabolic manifold of living and non-living forms of possession. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - A carbon tax on fuel would penalize carbon intensive fuels like gasoline and shift fuel consumption to less carbon intensive alternatives like biofuels. Since biofuel production competes for land with agricultural production, a carbon tax could increase land rents and raise food prices. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel in the presence of a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher land rent and food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix, especially if biofuel is subsidized. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biofuels are the first feasible option for greenhouse gas emission reduction in aviation. This paper uses the lead markets framework to consider potential advantages in process plant required to produce 2nd generation biofuels for aviation. Germany and Brazil both have the potential to develop a lead market. They are active in technology development and have a demand interest through a significant aircraft and airline industry. The USA has also been found to be a country with a very high lead market potential. Since the technology is at a demonstration stage, market information for the assessment of lead market advantages is not available. However, there are a range of indicators of firm activity and market potential that can be combined to make a general assessment. For this case, it is necessary for the lead market framework to be extended to consider international technology networks instead of a national lead market. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article looks at sustainable development and globalization from the perspective of the eco-innovation literature for the case of biofuels in transport. It assesses the potential for newly industrialized countries (NICs) to develop technology and hence export markets in biofuel equipment. An analysis of innovation indicators suggests those countries that have strong capacities in eco-innovation in general. The analysis considers demand and regulatory factors in addition to technological capabilities in biofuels and complementary sectors. A very large global market in biofuels for transport could develop. The case of biofuels in Brazil shows that demand-oriented innovation policy coordinated with supply-oriented research and development policies can be successful in NICs for developing markets in new technologies for sustainability. Brazil, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and South Africa, as well as Indonesia, Thailand, and possibly India, have the favorable combination of high biofuel production potential and the requisite technological capability to develop internationally competitive second-generation biofuel production technologies. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

AB  - Competitive production costs compared to conventional fuels are imperative for biofuels to gain market shares, as current tax advantages for biofuels are only temporary. Comparing production costs of different biofuels with fossil fuels is a challenge due to the complexity of influencing factors. The objective of this research paper is threefold: 1) to project future bio-fuel feedstock prices based on the crude oil price development, the price index for agricultural products, growth in world population, growth in wealth per capita income, and change in energy consumption per capita, 2) to simulate production costs under consideration of likely economies of scale from scaling-up production size and technological learning and 3) to compare different biofuels and fossil fuels by scenario analysis. A calculation model for biofuel production is used to analyse projected production costs for different types of biofuels in Europe for 2015 and 2020. Unlike engineering oriented bottom-up approaches that are often used in other biofuel studies, the macro-economic top-down approach applied in this study enables an economic comparison and discussion of various fuel types based on reference scenarios of crude oil prices of €50, €100, €150 and €200 per barrel. Depending on the specific raw material prices as well as the conversion costs, the analysis delivered a differentiated view on the production costs and thus on the competitiveness of each individual type of fuel. The results show that 2nd generation biofuels are most likely to achieve competitive production costs mid- to long-term when taking into account the effects from technological learning and production scale size as well as crude oil price scenarios between €50 and €200 per barrel for both reference years. In all crude oil price scenarios, bioethanol from lignocellulosic raw materials as well as biodiesel from waste oil are associated with high cost saving potentials which enable them to outperform fossil fuels and 1st generation biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In 2007, Brazil entered the European Union's (EU) list of strategic partners; a token of recognition of the place Brazil occupies in current global affairs. Although promoting bilateral environmental convergence is a stated priority, cooperation between the EU and Brazil in this policy field is largely under-researched, raising interesting questions as to whether the current state of play could support EU claims for the normative orientation of its external environmental policy. Through an analysis of partnership activities in the fields of deforestation and biofuels, we suggest that while normative intentions may be regarded as a motivating force, critically viewing EU foreign environmental policy through a 'soft imperialism' lens could offer a more holistic understanding of the current state of bilateral cooperation. While the normative power thesis can be substantiated with regard to deforestation, we argue that by erecting barriers to shield its domestic biofuels production, the EU is placing trade competitiveness and economic growth above its normative aspirations. Subsequently, the partial adoption of sustainable development as an EU norm leads to policy incoherence and contradictory actions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Corn stover was used for manufacturing 2nd generation bioethanol following a biorefinery scheme based on fractionation by autohydrolysis and further Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) of pretreated solids. Autohydrolysis was performed under a wide range of severities to identify conditions leading simultaneously to a liquid phase containing hemicellulosic saccharides (accounting for up to 68% of initial xylan) and to a solid phase with high enzymatic susceptibility. SSF experiments were carried out under a variety of experimental conditions to assess the effects of the major operational variables. The glucan conversion into ethanol reached values up to 86%, with a bioethanol concentration of 37.8. g/L. Fed-batch operation in the SSF stage allowed the utilization of higher solid loadings, allowing an increase in the bioethanol concentration up to 51.6. g/L, or to reduce the amount of enzymes needed for reaching a given conversion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spatially heterogeneous patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) are related to topographically-defined soil moisture levels within Midwestern tallgrass prairies. While roots are regarded as the main contributor to SOC formation, relatively little is known about how fine root dynamics respond to landscape-level changes in soil moisture, and thus the mechanisms promoting spatial heterogeneity of SOC remain uncertain. We evaluated SOC, fine root (≤2. mm) biomass, production, decomposition, and vertical rooting distributions among landscape positions varying in soil moisture within 25+ year old restored tallgrass prairies in Wisconsin, USA. We hypothesized that SOC, root biomass, and root production would increase, while root decomposition would decline with increasing soil moisture. Additionally, we hypothesized that relative root biomass and production distributions would become shallower as soils became wetter. We found no relationship between soil moisture and root biomass, production, or their vertical distributions, but decomposition decreased and SOC increased as expected with increasing soil moisture. However, we also observed a strong relationship between soil moisture and species assemblages, suggesting that community composition changed in response to soil moisture. Our findings indicate that SOC was highest in seasonally wet, lowland landscape positions due to greatly reduced root decomposition, not due to changes in root production or relative distributions. We suggest that species turnover may have reduced the effect of soil moisture on root biomass and production, thereby maintaining similar root production under notably disparate soil moisture conditions. Considering continued interest in monoculture biofuel plantings and their potential to sequester C in roots and soils, additional research is necessary at the landscape scale to elucidate the importance of species spatial heterogeneity on grassland belowground C dynamics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The 2009 Renewable Energies Directive (RED) has set up ambitious targets concerning biofuel consumption in the European Union by 2020. Nevertheless, budgetary constraints and growing concerns about the environmental integrity of first-generation biofuels have imposed a phasing out of the fiscal instruments to promote them. Focusing on France, this paper combines an exogenous increase in oil prices and tax policies on fossil fuels. The objective is to determine the efficiency of an alternative incentive scheme for biodiesel consumption based on a higher price of the fossil fuel substitute. Policy simulations are implemented through a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated on 2009 French data. The results show that the 10% biodiesel mandate set by the RED would not be achieved even if the fixed taxes on diesel reach the same level as those on gasoline. Although integrating the rise in oil prices into the fiscal framework improves the biodiesel penetration rate, it remains below the target. Moreover, we find that the effects of biofuel consumption are limited to the biofuel chain sectors. In other agricultural sectors, the substitution effect of biodiesel with diesel is partially offset by the pricing effect induced by higher energy production costs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method is the instrument of choice for quantifying environmental impacts; in particular, it is useful for estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with bioethanol production from agricultural residues such as straw. The LCA methodology considers process steps across bioethanol production from the crude feedstock to the standardized product bioethanol. However, agro-ecological constraints concerning raw material availability, such as the long-term conservation of soil fertility through the incorporation of straw on the field, are not taken into account within current LCA methodologies. Therefore, in this study, a method for soil organic carbon balancing was applied to ensure the sustainable supply of biomass. In addition to the GHG balance of bioethanol production from straw, the potential availability of straw for energy conversion was estimated on the regional level for Germany and its Federal States. The results of the GHG balance were heavily dependent on the chosen allocation method between grain and straw, and the amount of straw available for potential use as an energy source was largely determined by the structure of existing agricultural production. Potential regions for a 2nd generation bioethanol plant based on the available quantity of feedstock straw are shown in a case study for the German provinces. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this present investigation, the biofuel alga Botryococcus braunii (B. braunii) was mass cultivated in 10 m2 open raceway pond at batch mode. This study was mainly focused on the kinetics and thermodynamics approach for total lipid and hydrocarbon extraction. At batch mode cultivation the alga produced highest dry biomass of 23 g m-2 d-1. The algal cells were harvested by autoflocculation method and dried. Different pre-treatment methods, solvents systems and optimization of extraction parameters were carried out in the dry biomass containing moisture less than 1 wt%. This reveals ultrasonication combined with chloroform: methanol, extracted maximum of 24.2 wt% total lipid and hydrocarbon. Temperature effects (308-338 K) on kinetics were investigated. The extraction follows first order kinetics and their rate constants and activation energy were determined as 3.0431 s -1and 36.7214 kJ mol-1 respectively. Thermodynamic activation parameters ΔG≠, ΔH≠ and ΔS≠ were measured, which suggest that the process was endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper gives an overview on the traditional Jatropha curcas L. (physic nut) production practices as a multipurpose vegetable resource in the Totonacapan, Mexico, and the social acceptability of changes involved both in its agronomic management and use, promotion by the Mexican Energy Ministry through a special program, which, in the case for J. curcas L., includes, exclusively, toxic genotypes. In this region, there is important infra-specific genetic diversity for non-toxic genotypes, which have been used by the local indigenous population for centuries, mainly for human consumption (roasted seeds). In contrast with other studies about the industrial-scale productivity of physic nut as a monoculture for biodiesel yield, this research assessed the several functions of this species within local, traditional agroecosystems and as part of the family's diet. In order to evaluate the pertinence of its diffusion in relation with the Totonac economy, the feasibility of implementing the official program was critically assessed, by using a binary logistic mathematical model for the "farmers' willingness to adopt it. The results show the following barriers to agricultural adoption: (1) a low financial capacity of farmers; (2) the current price instability of J. curcas seeds; (3) the Totonac familys' need to cultivate all the plant species involved in their agroecosystems for economic and cultural reasons. Nevertheless, J. curcas remains as a very important plant resource for the local people, with several important contributions to farmers' livelihoods, and multiple roles (economic, ecological and cultural) that add resilience to the Totonac's traditional agroecosystems. The monoculture of J. curcas established only for biodiesel production in different regions of Mexico, has not led to a significant increase in the income of local farmers, because government policies have been ineffective in recognizing the several functions of this species in the local agroecosystems from the peasant' perspective. This critical situation could be repeated in the Totonacapan, negatively affecting, not only the local non-toxic genotypes, but also this ancestral culture and consequently the Totonac's economy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the absence of an infrastructure for the harvest, storage and purchase of cellulosic biomass, contracting is an important mechanism through which biorefineries can ensure adequate feedstock supply. We develop an optimization model to assess the economic potential of dedicated energy crops when profit-maximizing farmers allocate croplands of varying quality toward biomass in response to multi-year contracts. We evaluate the economic competitiveness of perennial grasses with traditional commodity crops, in a case study of switchgrass production in Tennessee. Assuming short-term contracts, we consider the importance of payment structure, land quality, energy crop yield and projected commodity crop returns on a farmer's decision to accept a contract for biomass production. We find that a wholesale contract, in which the farmer is guaranteed a price per unit biomass, is most effective on the highest quality of land, while a contract in which the farmer is guaranteed a price per acre is most effective on lower quality land. From the biorefinery perspective, a wholesale contract is most effective for short-term contracts while an acreage contract is most effective for long-term contracts. Breakeven pricing will only secure feedstock from farmers who produce commodity crops with unfavorable price outlooks on lower quality land; therefore, the contract price must include a premium in order to compete for space in the crop mix. The yield profile of energy crops has a significant effect on the terms at which short-term contracts will be accepted and land allocated toward feedstock production. The extent to which energy crop yields observed in field trials can be maintained at commercial scale also has a substantial effect on the scale at which farmers would be willing to participate in energy crop production. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transformation of the lipids extracted from duck tallow into biodiesel was achieved using activated alumina and CO2 under ambient pressure (1bar). Crude fatty acids (~98% assay) were also esterified to help us understand and validate the noncatalytic biodiesel conversion mechanisms. Its conversion efficiency was nearly 93.5(±0.5)%. The transformation of crude fatty acid into biodiesel proves that this newly developed technology for the production of biodiesel combines esterification of free fatty acids and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process that has a 98.5(±0.5)% conversion efficiency to biodiesel within 1min at 350-500°C. This paper addresses the simplest methodology for the production of biodiesel. Herein, it is confirmed that the main driving force of biodiesel conversion in the noncatalytic transesterification reaction is temperature rather than pressure. Noncatalytic biodiesel transformation can be achieved in the presence of a porous material via a thermochemical process in a continuous flow system. This noncatalytic biodiesel transformation was enhanced under the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A changing global environment, rising population and increasing demand for biofuels are challenging agriculture and creating a need for technologies to increase biomass production. Here we demonstrate that the inhibition of poly (ADPribose) polymerase activity is a promising technology to achieve this under non-stress conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the basis of this growth enhancement via leaf series and kinematic cell analysis as well as single leaf transcriptomics and plant metabolomics under non-stress conditions. These data indicate a regulatory function of PARP within cell growth and potentially development. PARP inhibition enhances growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by enhancing the cell number. Time course single leaf transcriptomics shows that PARP inhibition regulates a small subset of genes which are related to growth promotion, cell cycle and the control of metabolism. This is supported by metabolite analysis showing overall changes in primary and particularly secondary metabolism. Taken together the results indicate a versatile function of PARP beyond its previously reported roles in controlling plant stress tolerance and thus can be a useful target for enhancing biomass production. © 2014 Schulz et al.

AB  - Infrastructure systems are becoming increasingly complex and interdependent, for example, the growing biofuel economy in the United States that is creating new interdependencies between agriculture, biorefining, and transportation. Questions arise of the consequences of these new and expanding interdependencies on overall system performance. This paper proposes the differentiation between linear and nonlinear interdependency that, though elementary, is useful for describing the joint behavior of interdependent systems. Linear interdependency is where representative variables of systems of interest change linearly with each other, while nonlinear interdependency is where the variables change with each other but in some other manner. This paper uses Pearson's correlation coefficient to quantify the linear interdependency between the transportation and biorefining subsystems within a larger biofuel infrastructure system based on Monte Carlo simulation results of a mathematical programming model of the system. The results are analyzed to derive relationships between linear interdependency and system performance, which in this paper is defined as the joint reliability and vulnerability of the two subsystems. The results indicate that generally, if all other factors are equal, greater linear interdependency may lead to a greater combined reliability but also a greater combined vulnerability. The results also suggest the centralization of biorefining facilities to be a key factor affecting the linear interdependency between the two subsystems such that a system with a single large biorefinery is likelier to experience both the transportation and biorefining subsystems failing at the same time, but the combined consequences of the failures are likely to be less severe than the consequences of failure of a comparable decentralized system. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - We present a novel bottom-up approach to estimate biofuel-induced land-use change (LUC) and resulting CO2 emissions in the U.S. from 2010 to 2022, based on a consistent methodology across four essential components: land availability, land suitability, LUC decision-making, and induced CO2 emissions. Using high-resolution geospatial data and modeling, we construct probabilistic assessments of county-, state-, and national-level LUC and emissions for macroeconomic scenarios. We use the Cropland Data Layer and the Protected Areas Database to characterize availability of land for biofuel crop cultivation, and the CERES-Maize and BioCro biophysical crop growth models to estimate the suitability (yield potential) of available lands for biofuel crops. For LUC decisionmaking, we use a county-level stochastic partial-equilibrium modeling framework and consider five scenarios involving annual ethanol production scaling to 15, 22, and 29 BG, respectively, in 2022, with corn providing feedstock for the first 15 BG and the remainder coming from one of two dedicated energy crops. Finally, we derive high-resolution above-ground carbon factors from the National Biomass and Carbon Data set to estimate emissions from each LUC pathway. Based on these inputs, we obtain estimates for average total LUC emissions of 6.1, 2.2, 1.0, 2.2, and 2.4 gCO2e/MJ for Corn-15 Billion gallons (BG), Miscanthus × giganteus (MxG)-7 BG, Switchgrass (SG)-7 BG, MxG-14 BG, and SG-14 BG scenarios, respectively. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Air pollution emissions regulation can affect the location, size, and technology choice of potential biofuel production facilities. Difficulty in obtaining air pollutant emission permits and the cost of air pollution control devices have been cited by some fuel producers as barriers to development. This paper expands on the Geospatial Bioenergy Systems Model (GBSM) to evaluate the effect of air pollution control costs on the availability, cost, and distribution of U.S. biofuel production by subjecting potential facility locations within U.S. Clean Air Act nonattainment areas, which exceed thresholds for healthy air quality, to additional costs. This paper compares three scenarios: one with air quality costs included, one without air quality costs, and one in which conversion facilities were prohibited in Clean Air Act nonattainment areas. While air quality regulation may substantially affect local decisions regarding siting or technology choices, their effect on the system as a whole is small. Most biofuel facilities are expected to be sited near to feedstock supplies, which are seldom in nonattainment areas. The average cost per unit of produced energy is less than 1% higher in the scenarios with air quality compliance costs than in scenarios without such costs. When facility construction is prohibited in nonattainment areas, the costs increase by slightly over 1%, due to increases in the distance feedstock is transported to facilities in attainment areas. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Despite the potential opportunities, there remain widespread concerns about bioenergy and biofuel feedstock sustainability, assessment and policy. This paper illustrates the value of the Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) for transparently presenting evidence and judgements relating to four biomass options that are potentially suitable for supplying heat to a university-sized facility. The RIAM approach provides comparable scores for: soybean biodiesel, waste cooking oil biodiesel, anaerobically co-digested food waste and manure; and timber pellets made from sawmill by-product. The high-level nature of the RIAM allows the user to structure a broader range of considerations and contingencies than the life-cycle approach embodied in EU biofuel legislation. We advocate the RIAM not as a substitute for LCA or any other form of assessment in a bioenergy context, but as a means of synthesising the results of different types of impact assessment and for making broader debates and uncertainties explicit, such that non-specialist knowledge users are both guided and made aware of differing scientific and stakeholder opinion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper aims to identify the lessons that should be learnt from how biofuels have been envisioned from the aftermath of the oil shocks of the 1970s to the present, and how these visions compare with biofuel production networks emerging in the 2000s. Working at the interface of sustainable innovation journey research and geographical theories on the spatial unevenness of sustainability transition projects, we show how the biofuels controversy is linked to characteristics of globalised industrial agricultural systems. The legitimacy problems of biofuels cannot be addressed by sustainability indicators or new technologies alone since they arise from the spatial ordering of biofuel production. In the 1970-80s, promoters of bioenergy anticipated current concerns about food security implications but envisioned bioenergy production to be territorially embedded at national or local scales where these issues would be managed. Where the territorial and scalar vision was breached, it was to imagine poorer countries exporting higher-value biofuel to the North rather than the raw material as in the controversial global biomass commodity chains of today. However, controversy now extends to the global impacts of national biofuel systems on food security and greenhouse gas emissions, and to their local impacts becoming more widely known. South/South and North/North trade conflicts are also emerging as are questions over biodegradable wastes and agricultural residues as global commodities. As assumptions of a food-versus-fuel conflict have come to be challenged, legitimacy questions over global agri-business and trade are spotlighted even further. In this context, visions of biofuel development that address these broader issues might be promising. These include large-scale biomass-for-fuel models in Europe that would transform global trade rules to allow small farmers in the global South to compete, and small-scale biofuel systems developed to address local energy needs in the South. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The promotion of biofuels as energy for transportation in the world is mainly driven by the perspective of oil depletion, the concerns about energy security and global warming. In Argentina, the legislation has imposed the use of biofuels in blend with fossil fuels (5 to 10%) in the transport sector.The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of corn-based ethanol production in the province of Santa Fe in Argentina based on the life cycle assessment methodology.The studied system includes from raw materials production to anhydrous ethanol production using dry milling technology. The system is divided into two subsystems: agricultural system and refinery system. The treatment of stillage is considered as well as the use of co-products (distiller's dried grains with solubles), but the use and/or application of the produced biofuel is not analyzed: a cradle-to-gate analysis is presented. As functional unit, 1. MJ of anhydrous ethanol at biorefinery is chosen.Two life cycle impact assessment methods are selected to perform the study: Eco-indicator 99 and ReCiPe. SimaPro is the life cycle assessment software used. The influence of the perspectives on the model is analyzed by sensitivity analysis for both methods.The two selected methods identify the same relevant processes. The use of fertilizers and resources, seeds production, harvesting process, corn drying, and phosphorus fertilizers and acetamide-anillide-compounds production are the most relevant processes in agricultural system. For refinery system, corn production, supplied heat and burned natural gas result in the higher contributions. The use of distiller's dried grains with solubles has an important positive environmental impact. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to investigate the relationship between CO2 emissions (COEs) stemming from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing and their affecting factors. Eight affecting factors, namely, Population (P), Urban Population (UP); the Output Values of Primary Industry (PIOV), Secondary Industry (SIOV), and Tertiary Industry (TIOV); and the Proportions of Primary Industry's Output Value (PPIOV), Secondary Industry's Output Value (PSIOV), and Tertiary Industry's Output Value (PTIOV), are chosen. PCA is employed to eliminate the multicollinearity of the affecting factors. Two principal components, which can explain 92.86% of the variance of the eight affecting factors, are chosen as variables in the regression analysis. Ordinary least square regression is used to estimate multiple linear regression models, in which COEs and the principal components serve as dependent and independent variables, respectively. The results are given in the following. (1) Theoretically, the carbon intensities of PIOV, SIOV, and TIOV are 2573.4693, 552.7036, and 606.0791kt per one billion $, respectively. The incomplete statistical data, the different statistical standards, and the ideology of self sufficiency and peasantry appear to show that the carbon intensity of PIOV is higher than those of SIOV and TIOV in China. (2) PPIOV, PSIOV, and PTIOV influence the fluctuations of COE. The parameters of PPIOV, PSIOV, and PTIOV are -2706946.7564, 2557300.5450, and 3924767.9807kt, respectively. As the economic structure of China is strongly tied to technology level, the period when PIOV plays the leading position is characterized by lagging technology and economic developing. Thus, the influence of PPIOV has a negative value. As the increase of PSIOV and PTIOV is always followed by technological innovation and economic development, PSIOV and PTIOV have the opposite influence. (3) The carbon intensities of P and UP are 1.1029 and 1.7862kt per thousand people, respectively. The carbon intensity of the rural population can be inferred to be lower than 1.1029kt per thousand people. The characteristics of poverty and the use of bio-energy in rural areas result in a carbon intensity of the rural population that is lower than that of P. © 2013.

AB  - Luxembourg aims at complying with the EU objective of attaining a 14% use of bioenergy in the national grid by 2020. The increase of biomethane production from energy crops could be a valuable option in achieving this objective. However, the overall environmental benefit of such option is yet to be proven. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) has shown to be a useful tool to evaluate the environmental suitability of future energy scenarios and policies. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the environmental consequences of modifying the Luxembourgish agricultural system to increase maize production for biomethane generation. A total of 10 different scenarios were modelled using a partial equilibrium (PE) model to identify changes in land cultivation based on farmers' revenue maximisation, which were then compared to the baseline scenario, i.e. the state of the agricultural sector in 2009. The results were divided into three different consequential decision contexts, presenting differing patterns in terms of land use changes (LUCs) but with minor shifts in environmental impacts. Nevertheless, energy from maize production would imply substantially higher environmental impacts when compared with the current use of natural gas, mainly due to increases in climate change and agricultural land occupation impacts. The results are discussed based on the consequences they may generate on the bioenergy policy, the management of arable land, the changes in import-export flows in Luxembourg and LUCs in the domestic agricultural system. In addition, the specific PE. +. LCA method presented intends to be of use for other regional studies in which a high level of site-specific data is available. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Carbon sources for biofuel production are wide-ranging and their availability depends on the climate and soil conditions of the land where the production chain is located. Henequen (Agave fourcroydes Lem.) is cultivated in Yucatán, Mexico to produce natural fibers from the leaves, and a juice containing fructans is produced during this process. Fructans can be hydrolyzed to fructose and glucose and metabolized into ethanol by appropriate yeasts. In Mexico, different Agave species provide the carbon source for (distilled and non-distilled) alcoholic beverage production using the stem of the plant, whilst the leaves are discarded. In this work, we investigated the effect of thermal acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of the juice on the amount of reducing sugars released. Growth curves were generated with the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus and fermentations were then carried out with Kluyveromyces marxianus to determine alcohol yields.Results: With thermal acid hydrolysis, the greatest increase in reducing sugars (82.6%) was obtained using 5% H2SO4 at 100°C with a 30 min reaction time. Statistically similar results can be obtained using the same acid concentration at a lower temperature and with a shorter reaction time (60°C, 15 min), or by using 1% H2SO4 at 100°C with a 30 min reaction time. In the case of enzymatic hydrolysis, the use of 5.75, 11.47 and 22.82 U of enzyme did not produce significant differences in the increase in reducing sugars. Although both hydrolysis processes obtained similar results, the difference was observed after fermentation. Ethanol yields were 50.3 ± 4 and 80.04 ± 5.29% of the theoretical yield respectively.Conclusions: Final reducing sugars concentrations obtained with both thermal acid and enzymatic hydrolysis were similar. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a good ethanol producer, did not grow in the hydrolysates. Only Kluyveromyces marxianus was able to grow in them, giving a higher ethanol yield with the enzymatic hydrolysate. The leaves account for a non-negligible weight of the total agave plant biomass, so this work complements the knowledge already developed on agave fermentations by making it possible to produce ethanol from almost the entire plant (stem and leaves). © 2014 Villegas-Silva et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The extent of syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) and the levels of known SAO bacteria and acetate- and hydrogen-consuming methanogens were determined in sludge from 13 commercial biogas production plants. Results from these measurements were statistically related to the prevailing operating conditions, through partial least squares (PLS) analysis. This revealed that high abundance of microorganisms involved in SAO was positively correlated with relatively low abundance of aceticlastic methanogens and high concentrations of free ammonia (>160. mg/L) and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Temperature was identified as another influencing factor for the population structure of the syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria (SAOB). Overall, there was a high abundance of SAOB in the different digesters despite differences in their operating parameters, indicating that SAOB are an enduring and important component of biogas-producing consortia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale production of lignocellulosic biofuel is a potential solution to sustainably meet global energy needs. One-step consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is a potentially advantageous approach for the production of biofuels, but requires an organism capable of hydrolyzing biomass to sugars and fermenting the sugars to ethanol at commercially viable titers and yields. Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic anaerobe, can ferment cellulosic biomass to ethanol and organic acids, but low yield, low titer, and ethanol sensitivity remain barriers to industrial production. Here, we deleted the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in ethanol tolerant strain of C. thermocellum adhE*(EA) in order to allow use of previously developed gene deletion tools, then deleted lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) to redirect carbon flux towards ethanol. Upon deletion of ldh, the adhE*(EA) Δldh strain produced 30% more ethanol than wild type on minimal medium. The adhE*(EA) Δldh strain retained tolerance to 5% v/v ethanol, resulting in an ethanol tolerant platform strain of C. thermocellum for future metabolic engineering efforts.

AB  - Biodiesel is a green and popular renewable fuel and unlike mineral diesel, produces fewer toxic emissions. Jatropha curcas Linn is a nonedible fruit that commonly used in biodiesel production. This study evaluated the impacts of Jatropha seeds maturity on quantity and quality of yield oil. Production of biodiesel from Jatropha oil and ethanol using natrium hydroxide as the catalyst by transesterification was performed on half-matured (yellow) and matured (black) Jatropha seeds. Experimental investigations have been carried out to examine properties and performance of Jatropha, and different blends of Jatropha oil-diesel (JOD) in comparison to a petroleum-based diesel fuel. Half-matured stage of Jatropha is shown to produces 2.5% less oil than the matured stage. The quality of the maturity stages quantified in terms of mean square error (MSE), and the matured stage showed 13% better performance in contrast to the half-matured stage. Matured stage JOD blends indicate closer performance to petroleum-based diesel and can be used as a biodiesel without engine modification. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Utilizing cyanobacteria as a bioenergy resource is difficult due to the cost and energy consuming harvests of microalgal biomass. In this study, an auto-floating system was developed by increasing the photobiological H 2 production in the heterocysts of filamentous cyanobacteria. An amount of 1.0â€...μM of diuron, which inhibited O 2 production in cyanobacteria, resulted in a high rate of H 2 production in heterocysts. The auto-floating process recovered 91.71% ± 1.22 of the accumulated microalgal biomass from the liquid media. Quantification analysis revealed that 0.72-1.10â€...μmol H 2 per mg dry weight microalgal biomass was necessary to create this auto-floating system. Further bio-conversion by using anaerobic digestion converted the harvested microalgal biomass into biogas. Through this novel coupled system of photobiological H 2 production and anaerobic digestion, a high level of light energy conversion efficiency from solar energy to bioenergy was attained with the values of 3.79% ± 0.76.

AB  - These last few years, the name of soybeans soared as a source of biodiesel. Soy biodiesel is an alternative fuel produced from soybean oil. Soybean potential as an alternative renewable energy source because it is expected to have the highest energy content compared to other alternative fuels. Opportunities to develop biodiesel using soybean oil in Indonesia is quite large, considering the soybean is a commodity that is already known and widely cultivated almost in all over Indonesia. In addition, the use of soybean for biofuel feedstock is expected to motivate farmers to cultivate soybeans, so their use is not limited to non-energy raw materials. Soybean varieties that have a high oil content as well as high yield is a source of major biodiesel feedstock. From 73 soybean varieties that have been released in Indonesia, has an average oil content of 18%. Varieties with high oil content can be used as raw material for biodiesel. Research on the use of soy as an ingredient of energy crops (biodiesel) have been carried out. In fact, soybean oil is the vegetable oil feedstock for most of the biodiesel being produced in the United States today. With the potential for soybean crops in Indonesia, both in terms of availability of land and varieties, the use of soybean oil for biofuel development in Indonesia is the flagship prospective materials for bio fuel substitute than other plants in the future. © IJRED.

AB  - Seaweeds are taxonomically diverse group of marine plants from which the land plants diverged over fifty crore years ago. Traditionally having been classified based on plant color as green, brown and red, modern molecular systematic evidences suggest that these plants are extraordinarily diverse. A number of seaweeds are edible and have been projected as a future food source. Seaweeds are also important to humanity in a number of ways, including as a source of medicines, food supplements, industrial chemicals, and as a potential candidate for biofuel research and CCS (carbon capture and sequestration). This article introduces the readers to the fascinating world of marine biology in general and seaweeds in particular, with an emphasis on Indian flora. © 2014 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Two jatropha business models are compared on seven key sustainability areas of concern, which are operationalized into various quantitative and qualitative indicators. The assessment is based on two Tanzanian real-life cases, a wide range of primary and secondary sources are used. Results indicate that both the decentralized smallholder model and the centralized plantation model can lead to positive socio-economic and environmental impacts, but substantial differences are also apparent. The smallholder model scores better on land rights, GHG balance and biodiversity and it reaches more people, whereas the plantation model creates more employment and higher (local prosperity) benefits for smaller numbers of people, and could lead to higher yields. Negative impacts of the smallholder model are minimal, whereas the plantation model could lead to decreased food security, loss of land rights and biodiversity. This could permanently affect the livelihood situation of the local population, but this is not inevitable as there is considerable scope for implementing mitigating policies. The way in which a particular model is implemented in practice, its management and company values, can have a major influence. However, the biggest hurdle towards achieving sustained positive societal impacts in both models is their marginal profitability at current yields, costs and prices. Still, these results are highly sensitive to uncertain yields and oil prices. Better outcomes in the future are therefore not foreclosed. A reliable sustainability assessment requires many location-specific and operational company data. More quantitative indicators areideally required to improve assessment of social impacts and effects on environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar is a renewable, useful material that can be utilized in many different applications. Biochar is commonly produced via pyrolysis methods using a retort-style oven with inert gas. Gasification is another method that can utilize pyrolysis to produce biochar. This method has significant processing advantages; it can be carried out in normal atmospheric conditions, eliminating the use of inert gas, is more amenable to scale up, and provides heat that can be used to generate power and/or help recoup processing costs. In this work, a simple gasification process using a top-lit updraft style cookstove was used to produce biochars from corn stover, wheat straw, and wheat straw treated with glycerin, which were then compared to biochars made using the more conventional retort oven pyrolysis process. The glycerin-treated wheat straw biochar from the gasification process had carbon content. >. 70% and an ash content of 25% which was equal or better than the same biochar produced using the retort oven. This biochar has also shown successful use as a peat moss replacement in horticultural applications. This shows that gasification is a simpler, more cost-effective means to produce biochars and should be considered for horticultural and other similar applications. © 2014.

AB  - Due to mounting concerns related to fossil fuel use and problems with their supply, the use of alternative sources of energy is increasing. One of the alternative sources is biomass and the European Union has adopted a biofuel directive that describes targets for the use of biofuels in the transport sector. The majority of biofuels produced in Europe comes from rapeseed. In this study, we focused on analyzing the efficiency of rapeseed biodiesel production. Energy efficiency in terms of Energy Return On Energy Invested (EROEI) was analyzed for two EU countries (Poland and The Netherlands) with different agro-ecological systems. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) accounted for inputs, processes and outputs of energy in the biodiesel production system. Input parameters were derived from literature as well as from farmer's interviews. The use of the outputs-straw, meal, and glycerin-were included in the LCI system boundary. The EROEI values ranged from 1.73 to 2.36 in Poland and from 2.18 to 2.60 in the Netherlands. The low number of respondents makes it risky to draw hard conclusions about these values but the patterns observed show that intensifying the production process and increasing yield bears very little or no benefit in terms of energy produced. Due to a higher amount of organic manure and consequently lower amount of artificial fertilizers used in crop growth in the Netherlands, the rapeseed biodiesel production system in the Netherlands is more efficient than in Poland. In both cases, the EROEI is quite low. More detailed spatial energy efficiency assessments are required to determine if and where sustainable production may be possible. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Stillage is the main wastewater from ethanol production, containing a high chemical oxygen demand in addition to acidic and corrosive characteristics. Though stillage may be used as a soil fertilizer, its land application may be considered problematic due its high polluting potential. Anaerobic digestion represents an effective alternative treatment to reduce the pollution load of stillage. In addition, the methane gas produced within the process may be converted to energy, which can be directly applied to the treatment plant. The objective of this paper was to investigate the energetic potential of anaerobic digestion applied to stillage in the sugarcane ethanol industry. An overall analysis of the results indicates energy recovery capacity (ERC) values for methane ranging from 3.5% to 10%, respectively, for sugarcane juice and molasses. The processes employed to obtain the fermentable broth, as well as the distillation step, represent the main limiting factors to the energetic potential feasibility. Considering financial aspects the annual savings could reach up to US$ 30 million due to anaerobic digestion of stillage in relatively large-scale distilleries (365,000 m3 of ethanol per year). The best scenarios were verified for the association between anaerobic digestion of stillage and combustion of bagasse. In this case, the fossil fuels consumption in distilleries could be fully ceased, such the ERC of methane could reach values ranging from 140% to 890%. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - The emergence of biofuel as a renewable energy source offers opportunities for significant climate change mitigation and greater energy independence to many countries. At the same time, biofuel represents the possibility of substitution between energy and food. For developing countries like India, which imports over 75% of its crude oil, fossil fuels pose two risks-global warming pollution and long-term risk that oil prices will undermine real living standards. This paper examines India's options for managing energy price risk in three ways: biofuel development, energy efficiency promotion, and food productivity improvements. Our salient results suggest that biodiesel shows promise as a transport fuel substitute that can be produced in ways that fully utilize marginal agricultural resources and hence promote rural livelihoods. First-generation bioethanol, by contrast, appears to have a limited ability to offset the impacts of oil price hikes. Combining the biodiesel expansion policy with energy efficiency improvements and food productivity increases proved to be a more effective strategy to enhance both energy and food security, help mitigate climate change, and cushion the economy against oil price shocks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel production in Brazil has grown from 736m3 in 2007 to 2.7Mm3 in 2012. It is an emergent bioenergy for which it is important to guarantee environmental sustainability. The objective of this article is to characterise the biodiesel production chain in Brazil, to identify potential environmental impacts and to analyse key drivers and barriers for biodiesel environmental sustainability. This article explores these aspects and focusses on the increasing demand for the main feedstocks for biodiesel production in Brazil: soybean oil and beef tallow. The impacts of land use and land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and water, as well as the energy balance, were found to be critical for the environmental sustainability assessment and development of biodiesel chains. Increasing agriculture yields, diversifying feedstocks and adopting ethyl transesterification can contribute to minimise environmental impacts. It was also found that environmental impacts could be mitigated by appropriate policies aiming at an integrated optimisation of food and bioenergy production and through agro-economic-ecological zoning, allowing adequate use of land for each purpose. Despite the limitation and weakness of some sustainability tools and initiatives, certification and zoning can play an important role in the sustainability of the emerging biodiesel production in Brazil. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work compares the return on investments (ROI) of oil versus biofuels in Brazil. Although several renewable energy sources might displace oil, the country's forte is sugarcane biofuels. In our analysis we carry out simplified benefit-cost analyses of producing oil fields, pre-salt oil fields (without and with enhanced oil recovery), a business as the usual ethanol scenario, and a high ethanol scenario. Excluding the ROI from existing oil fields, which is the highest, when the discount rate is 4% or more, the ROI of the high ethanol scenario is greater than that of the ROI of pre-salt oil. Considering a US$40/t CO2 tax, the high ethanol scenario's ROI is greater than the pre-salt oil's ROI if a discount rate of 2% or more is adopted. Moreover, the high ethanol scenario throughput up to 2070 compares to 97% of the pre-salt oil reserve without EOR, and demands 78% of its investment. Pre-salt oil production declines beyond 2042 when the country might become a net oil importer. In contrast, ethanol production reaches 2.1millionboe per day, and another 0.9millionboe of fossil demand is displaced through bioelectricity, yielding a total of 3millionboe (62% of the country's oil demand). © 2013.

AB  - This paper describes and analyses the multi-actor governance process that made Mozambique the first African nation-state to develop a national policy framework for sustainable biofuels. The paper draws on findings from action research conducted in Mozambique between December 2008 and July 2012. We analyse interactions between the changing governance context, the course of the multi-actor governance process, and the choices in relation to governance framework characteristics and content for four successive stages of governance framework development. This provides the basis for reflection on the competences required for effective multi-actor sustainability governance, and a discussion about the role of the nation-state in sustainability governance of global economies such as biofuels. The governance framework for sustainable biofuels has contributed to a more transparent and secure investment climate for biofuels in Mozambique. Key factors for success were (1) the presence of different types of competences during the various stages of the governance framework development, (2) closing the gap between 'licences to sell' and 'licences to produce' across different governance levels, and (3) balancing between the short- and long-term objectives for biofuel production in Mozambique and requirements of global biofuel markets. Developing-country nation-states can provide an essential contribution to these success-factors for global governance of sustainable biofuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The maximum amount of land for growing switchgrass for ethanol is estimated for a region in the southeastern U.S. Breakeven capacities are calculated for land in row crops, hay, pasture and marginal land. Characteristics of land categories inform potential land use change impacts as well as switchgrass profitability. Variable yields within and across land categories are translated into distributions of switchgrass net revenue. Breakeven curves are generated for a range of switchgrass prices. These curves provide upper bounds for further analysis of actual switchgrass adoption in context of broader economic forces and possible policy mechanisms to minimize environmental impacts. A farm-gate price of $55Mg-1 is estimated for half of marginal and pasturelands to break even with switchgrass. At this price, only 20% of land in hay and a small fraction of row crop hectares break even. Half of hay and row crops hectares break even at approximately $90Mg-1 and $100Mg-1, respectively. At $60Mg-1, sufficient land area can profitably produce switchgrass for ethanol to displace approximately 10% of gasoline consumed in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina; however, this price only indicates breakeven capacity implying that higher prices may be necessary to realize 10% displacement. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this proof-of-concept study we demonstrate that co-processing of an acidic bio-oil (pH. <. 3) produced by the fast pyrolysis of sawmill residue hardwood chips with alkaline (pH. >. 12) Red Mud bauxite mining waste originating from the Bayer process can lead to a synergistic upgrading and value addition to both feed materials. The co-processing reaction is carried out in a pressure reactor at 365. °C and yields a stabilized, much less acidic and more energy-dense bio-oil with an oxygen content of 3.5% and heating value of 34. kJ/g compared to 43.1% and 12. kJ/g, respectively, for the crude oil. In the same reaction the Red Mud acts as a sacrificial catalyst and is converted into a partially reduced magnetic neutral gray material with a carbon content of ~33% (w/w). This neutralized material may have possible use as an iron ore, iron ore pelletization binder or soil additive. The co-processing of the two waste streams - one derived from forestry by-products, the other from bauxite mining and processing operations - may thus offer attractive economic and ecologic synergies. Two principle possible scenarios for an actual realization for such a process on a larger scale are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass has become important as an alternative to fossil fuels and as a means to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly in tropical regions such as Brazil. Therefore, the demand for energy crops has increased strongly, and among such crops, palm oil is distinctive because of its productivity and well-developed production techniques. This paper intends to evaluate crude palm oil's GHG balance through a life-cycle assessment approach. This study is based on the average data of an ideal palm oil system in the northern region of Brazil. In the production of crude palm oil, a large amount of CO2 sequestration occurs during the growth of palm oil trees. In contrast, the greatest emissions are biotic CO2, which returns to the atmosphere and emissions from fertilizer production. The GHG balance of an oil palm plantation is approximately-208kg CO2-equiv./1000kg crude palm oil per year. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel has become one of the most attractive fuels since it was globally understood the renewability of its nature. Glycerol is a major byproduct of biodiesel production which is often regarded as a waste stream which is accompanied by a significant disposal cost. The effect of glycerol on the performance of a cascade of two anaerobic continuous stirred tank (CSTR) reactors treating thickened sludge at mesophilic conditions was investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of glycerol as a co-substrate during the anaerobic treatment of sewage sludge. For this purpose, feed mixtures of sewage sludge supplemented with 0%, 2%, 3% and 4% (v/v) glycerol were tested at hydraulic retention times between 12.3d and 19.7d. By adding 4% of glycerol, the system failed due to overloading. In all other cases, biodegradability of mixtures estimated to be higher than 88%, while the methane yield coefficient was 0.8 Lbiogas/g TVSremoved. Moreover, co-digestion improved biogas production by 3.8-4.7 times. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper we present an energy review of the waste generated by shrub species in soils of low fertility for use as fuel in a power plant. The residues analysed belong to the species: Rhamus alaternus, Ulex europaeus, Prunus spinosa, Smilax aspera, Erica sp., Rubus ulmifolius, and Pteridium aquilinum. Gross calorific value (GCV), net calorific value (NCV), density, elementary chemical analysis, moisture content, percentage of ash, productivity, energy density and FVI (fuel value index) have been measured. These parameters have been determined for three levels of moisture (maximum, medium and minimum). At medium moisture level, the residues of U. europaeus are those that reach the greatest FVI, 20,000. In the other extreme is the P. aquilinum with an FVI of 403. The average productivity of waste, in tha-1, of each species has been determined in order to know how much energy is stored per hectare. U. europaeus and P. spinosa are the species which accumulate more energy per hectare, with similar values of around 81MJha-1yr-1 and installed power of 2.59Wha-1. The energy recovery of the waste in a thermal power plant would generate an annual revenue of 14.6M€, taking into account that 40% of the forest land covered by shrub in Cantabria is used for this purpose. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Future Midwestern Landscapes (FML) project is part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Ecosystem Services Research Program. The goal of the FML project is to quantify changes in ecosystem services across the Midwestern region as a result of the growing demand for biofuels. Watershed models are an efficient way to quantify ecosystem services of water quality and quantity. By calibrating models, we can better capture watershed characteristics before they are applied to make predictions. The Kaskaskia River watershed in Illinois was selected to investigate the effectiveness of different calibration strategies (single-site and multi-site calibrations) for streamflow, total suspended sediment (TSS) and total nitrogen (TN) loadings using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Four USGS gauges were evaluated in this study. Single-site calibration was performed from a downstream site to an upstream site, and multi-site calibration was performed and fine-tuned based on the single-site calibration results. Generally, simulated streamflow and TSS were not much affected by different calibration strategies. However, when single-site calibration was performed at the most downstream site, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for TN ranged between -0.09 and 0.53 at the other sites; and when single-site calibration was performed at the most upstream site, the NSE values ranged between -8.38 and -0.07 for the other sites. The NSE values for TN were improved to 0.5 - 0.59 for all four sites when multi-site calibration was performed. The results of the multi-site calibration and validation showed an improvement on model performance on TN and highlighted that multi-site calibrations are needed to assess the hydrological and water quality processes at various spatial scales. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The production of six regionally important cellulosic biomass feedstocks, including pine, eucalyptus, unmanaged hardwoods, forest residues, switchgrass, and sweet sorghum, was analyzed using consistent life cycle methodologies and system boundaries to identify feedstocks with the lowest cost and environmental impacts. Supply chain analysis was performed for each feedstock, calculating costs and supply requirements for the production of 453,592 dry tonnes of biomass per year. Cradle-to-gate environmental impacts from these modeled supply systems were quantified for nine mid-point indicators using SimaPro 7.2 LCA software. Conversion of grassland to managed forest for bioenergy resulted in large reductions in GHG emissions due to carbon uptake associated with direct land use change. By contrast, converting forests to cropland resulted in large increases in GHG emissions. Production of forest-based feedstocks for biofuels resulted in lower delivered cost, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and lower overall environmental impacts than the agricultural feedstocks studied. Forest residues had the lowest environmental impact and delivered cost per dry tonne. Using forest-based biomass feedstocks instead of agricultural feedstocks would result in lower cradle-to-gate environmental impacts and delivered biomass costs for biofuel production in the southern U.S.

AB  - Background: The search for promising and renewable sources of carbohydrates for the production of biofuels and other biorenewables has been stimulated by an increase in global energy demand in the face of growing concern over greenhouse gas emissions and fuel security. In particular, interest has focused on non-food lignocellulosic biomass as a potential source of abundant and sustainable feedstock for biorefineries. Here we investigate the potential of three Brazilian grasses (Panicum maximum, Pennisetum purpureum and Brachiaria brizantha), as well as bark residues from the harvesting of two commercial Eucalyptus clones (E. grandis and E. grandis x urophylla) for biofuel production, and compare these to sugarcane bagasse. The effects of hot water, acid, alkaline and sulfite pretreatments (at increasing temperatures) on the chemical composition, morphology and saccharification yields of these different biomass types were evaluated. Results: The average yield (per hectare), availability and general composition of all five biomasses were compared. Compositional analyses indicate a high level of hemicellulose and lignin removal in all grass varieties (including sugarcane bagasse) after acid and alkaline pretreatment with increasing temperatures, whilst the biomasses pretreated with hot water or sulfite showed little variation from the control. For all biomasses, higher cellulose enrichment resulted from treatment with sodium hydroxide at 130°C. At 180°C, a decrease in cellulose content was observed, which is associated with high amorphous cellulose removal and 5-hydroxymethyl-furaldehyde production. Morphological analysis showed the effects of different pretreatments on the biomass surface, revealing a high production of microfibrillated cellulose on grass surfaces, after treatment with 1% sodium hydroxide at 130°C for 30 minutes. This may explain the higher hydrolysis yields resulting from these pretreatments, since these cellulosic nanoparticles can be easily accessed and cleaved by cellulases. Conclusion: Our results show the potential of three Brazilian grasses with high productivity yields as valuable sources of carbohydrates for ethanol production and other biomaterials. Sodium hydroxide at 130°C was found to be the most effective pretreatment for enhanced saccharification yields. It was also efficient in the production of microfibrillated cellulose on grass surfaces, thereby revealing their potential as a source of natural fillers used for bionanocomposites production. © 2014 Lima et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The microbial conversion of sugars to fuels is a promising technology, but the byproducts of biomass pretreatment processes and the fuels themselves are often toxic at industrially relevant levels. One promising solution to these problems is to engineer efflux pumps to secrete fuels and inhibitory chemicals from the cell, increasing microbial tolerance and enabling higher fuel titer. Toward that end, we used a directed evolution strategy to generate variants of the Escherichia coli AcrB efflux pump that act on the non-native substrate n-butanol, enhancing growth rates of E. coli in the presence of this biofuel by up to 25%. Furthermore, these variants confer improved tolerance to isobutanol and straightchain alcohols up to n-heptanol. Single amino acid changes in AcrB responsible for this phenotype were identified. We have also shown that both the chemical and genetic inactivation of pump activity eliminate the tolerance conferred by AcrB pump variants, supporting our assertion that the variants secrete the non-native substrates. This strategy can be applied to create an array of efflux pumps that modulate the intracellular concentrations of small molecules of interest to microbial fuel and chemical production. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Total phosphorous (TP) and total suspended sediment (TSS) pollution is a problem in the US Midwest and is of particular concern in the Great Lakes region where many water bodies are already eutrophic. Increases in monoculture corn planting to feed ethanol based biofuel production could exacerbate these already stressed water bodies. In this study we expand on the previous studies relating landscape variables such as land cover, soil type and slope with changes in pollutant concentrations and loading in the Great Lakes region.The Rock River watershed in Wisconsin, USA was chosen due to its diverse land use, numerous lakes and reservoirs susceptible to TSS and TP pollution, and the availability of long-term streamflow, TSS and TP data. Eight independent subwatersheds in the Rock River watershed were identified using United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites that monitor flow, TSS and TP. For each subwatershed, we calculated land use, soil type, and terrain slope metrics or variables. TSS and TP from the different subwatersheds were compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and associations and relationships between landscape metrics and water quality (TSS and TP) were evaluated using the partial least square (PLS) regression. Results show that urban land use and agricultural land growing corn rotated with non-leguminous crops are associated with TSS and TP in streams. This indicates that increasing the amount of corn rotated with non-leguminous crops within a subwatershed could increase degradation of water quality. Results showed that increase in corn-soybean rotation acreage within the watershed is associated with reduction in stream's TSS and TP. Results also show that forest and water bodies were associated with reduction in TSS and TP. Based on our results we recommend adoption of the Low Impact Development (LID) approach in urban dominated subwatersheds. This approach attempts to replicate the pre-development hydrological regime by reducing the ratio of impervious area to natural cover wherever possible, as well as recycling or treating stormwater runoff using filter strips, ponds and wetlands. In agriculturally dominated subwatersheds, we recommend increasing corn-soybean rotation, keeping corn on areas with gentle slope and soils with lower erodibility. © 2013.

AB  - Increased corn production and removal of corn stover for biofuel production can adversely affect water quality, soil fertility and productivity due to low nitrogen (N) use efficiency. In this study, the average annual county-level N balances in Iowa are calculated for three corn-involved rotations: corn-soybean (C-S), corn-corn-soybean (C-C-S) and continuous corn (C-C), receiving either synthetic-N or manure fertilizer under 0, 30, 50 and 75% corn stover removal scenarios. Geo-referenced data on soil, crop and livestock are used to estimate net changes in total N balance in the mineral form after accounting all soil N inflows and outflows. Under a zero stover removal scenario, a state average for net N was 34kgha-1yr-1. Approximately 86% of the land area in the three corn-involved rotations receives synthetic-N fertilizer, and 24% of total synthetic-N treated land is estimated with net N of 24kgha-1yr-1 (i.e., average net N for synthetic-N treated rotations) or more. Manure-treated rotations are estimated to have 2-6 times higher net N than synthetic-N treated rotations; continuous corn rotations contributing to a higher net N. The northern and central crop districts dominated by animal and corn production have higher net N. Removal of corn stover reduces net N, and synthetic-N treated rotations are estimated to be affected the most. The percentage of total synthetic-N treated rotations estimated with net N of 24kgha-1yr-1 or more lowers from 24% under no stover harvesting to 3% under 75% stover (mass basis) removal scenario. Conversely, the areas with negative net N increase from 1% with no stover harvesting to 10% under 75% harvesting. This study will help prioritize the regions in which management practices that reduce nitrogen loss are most needed, and those regions most suitable from a nutrient balance standpoint for sustainable stover harvesting. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biochar is an important carbon-rich product that is generated from biomass sources through pyrolysis. Biochar (charcoal) can be both used directly as a potential source of solid biofuels and as soil amendments for barren lands. The aim of this study was investigate influence of pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical properties and structure of biochar. The biochars were produced by pyrolysis of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) using a fixed-bed reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures (400-700°C). The produced biochars were characterized by proximate and elemental analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, particle size distributions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results showed that both chemical and surface properties of the biochars were significantly affected by the pyrolysis temperature. Aromatic hydrocarbons, hydroxyl and carbonyl compounds were the majority components of the biochar. The biochar obtained at 700°C had a high fixed carbon content (66.16%) as well as a high heating value, and therefore it could be used as solid fuel, precursor in the activated carbons manufacture (specific surface area until 25.38 m2 g-1), or to obtain category-A briquettes. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - MADS-box genes are important transcription factors for plant development, especially floral organogenesis. Brachypodium distachyon is a model for biofuel plants and temperate grasses such as wheat and barley, but a comprehensive analysis of MADS-box family proteins in Brachypodium is still missing. We report here a genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene family in Brachypodium distachyon. We identified 57 MADS-box genes and classified them into 32 MIKCc-type, 7 MIKC*-type, 9 Mα, 7 Mβ and 2 Mγ MADS-box genes according to their phylogenetic relationships to the Arabidopsis and rice MADS-box genes. Detailed gene structure and motif distribution were then studied. Investigation of their chromosomal localizations revealed that Brachypodium MADS-box genes distributed evenly across five chromosomes. In addition, five pairs of type II MADS-box genes were found on synteny blocks derived from whole genome duplication blocks. We then performed a systematic expression analysis of Brachypodium MADS-box genes in various tissues, particular floral organs. Further detection under salt, drought, and low-temperature conditions showed that some MADS-box genes may also be involved in abiotic stress responses, including type I genes. Comparative studies of MADS-box genes among Brachypodium, rice and Arabidopsis showed that Brachypodium had fewer gene duplication events. Taken together, this work provides useful data for further functional studies of MADS-box genes in Brachypodium distachyon. © 2014 Wei et al.

AB  - Various policy instruments along with increasing oil prices have contributed to a sixfold increase in global biofuels production over the last decade (2000-2010). This rapid growth has proved controversial, however, and has raised concerns over potential conflicts with global food security and climate changemitigation. To address these concerns, policy support is now focused on advanced or second-generation biofuels instead of crop-based first-generation biofuels. This policy shift, together with the global financial crisis, has slowed the growth of biofuels production, which has remained stagnant since 2010. Based upon a review of the literature, this paper examines the potential long-run contribution of biofuels to the global energy mix, particularly for transportation. We find that the contribution of biofuels to global transportation fuel demand is likely to be limited to around 5% over the next 10-15 years. However, a number of studies suggest that biofuels could contribute up to a quarter of global transportation fuel demand by 2050, provided technological breakthroughs reduce the costs of sustainably produced advanced biofuels to a level where they can compete with petroleum fuels. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Background: This study was to determine if feeding laying hens with defatted diatom microalgal biomass (DFA) from biofuel production affected their egg production and health status.Methods: Five replicates of 5 individually caged ISA Babcock White leghorn hens were fed 4 diets, including a corn-soybean meal control diet, a diet containing 7.5% DFA substituting for soybean meal, and diets containing 7.5% or 15% DFA substituting for corn and soybean meal. Body weights, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of egg production, egg size, egg mass, and several characteristics of eggs were determined at 4 and 8 wk. Venous blood was sampled at 4 and 8 wk for measurement of 5 biomarkers of health.Results: The 15% DFA diet decreased (P < 0.05) feed intake, egg production, and plasma uric acid concentrations as compared with the control diet, but increased (P < 0.05) egg albumen weight and height compared with the 7.5% DFA diets. The two levels of DFA produced dose-dependent (P < 0.05) changes in three color measures of egg yolk, without affecting four hen plasma biochemical indicators of health.Conclusions: Feeding laying hens with 7.5% DFA in the corn-soybean meal diet for 8 wk had no adverse effect on their health, egg production, or egg quality, but 15% inclusion reduced feed intake, egg production, and efficiency of feed utilization. © 2014 Leng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The idea of renewable and regenerative resources has inspired research for more than a hundred years. Ideally, the only spent energy will replenish itself, like plant material, sunlight, thermal energy or wind. Biodiesel or ethanol are examples, since their production relies mainly on plant material. However, it has become apparent that crop derived biofuels will not be sufficient to satisfy future energy demands. Thus, especially in the last decade a lot of research has focused on the production of next generation biofuels. A major subject of these investigations has been the microbial fatty acid biosynthesis with the aim to produce fatty acids or derivatives for substitution of diesel. As an industrially important organism and with the best studied microbial fatty acid biosynthesis, Escherichia coli has been chosen as producer in many of these studies and several reviews have been published in the fields of E. coli fatty acid biosynthesis or biofuels. However, most reviews discuss only one of these topics in detail, despite the fact, that a profound understanding of the involved enzymes and their regulation is necessary for efficient genetic engineering of the entire pathway. The first part of this review aims at summarizing the knowledge about fatty acid biosynthesis of E. coli and its regulation, and it provides the connection towards the production of fatty acids and related biofuels. The second part gives an overview about the achievements by genetic engineering of the fatty acid biosynthesis towards the production of next generation biofuels. Finally, the actual importance and potential of fatty acid-based biofuels will be discussed. © 2014Janßen and Steinbüchel; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Declines in insect pollinators across Europe have raised concerns about the supply of pollination services to agriculture. Simultaneously, EU agricultural and biofuel policies have encouraged substantial growth in the cultivated area of insect pollinated crops across the continent. Using data from 41 European countries, this study demonstrates that the recommended number of honeybees required to provide crop pollination across Europe has risen 4.9 times as fast as honeybee stocks between 2005 and 2010. Consequently, honeybee stocks were insufficient to supply >90% of demands in 22 countries studied. These findings raise concerns about the capacity of many countries to cope with major losses of wild pollinators and highlight numerous critical gaps in current understanding of pollination service supplies and demands, pointing to a pressing need for further research into this issue. © 2014 Breeze et al.

AB  - As global warming continues to be a challenge, there is urgency to look into fossil fuel alternatives for sustainable energy supplies which have also been hastened by the volatility of crude oil prices and the fact that fossil fuel depletion is clearly in sight. Zimbabwe has not been spared of the negative effects of climate change which have affected both the food and energy sectors. This has proved to be a major challenge for the sustainable development of the country's economy. In an effort to be energy independent, the country has for over decades looked into the prospect of utilising its vast biomass resources to produce biofuels. These programmes have been met with a number of challenges which has seen most such projects not succeeding. The current paper gives a narration of the history of biofuel programmes in Zimbabwe looking at their driving factors and reasons that led to their collapses. Lack of a national biofuel policy is identified as the major factor that has been the missing link in the past and must be addressed. The paper goes further to call for the crafting of a National Biofuel Policy for Zimbabwe highlighting the major thematic issues it would need to cover. An implementation plan for the programme has been proposed.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) is perennial, C4 grass with great potential as a biofuel crop. An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that control mineral uptake, distribution and remobilization will benefit sustainable production. Nutrients are mobilized from aerial portions to below-ground crowns and rhizomes as a natural accompaniment to above-ground senescence post seed-set. Mineral uptake and remobilization is dependent on transporters, however, little if any information is available about the specific transporters that are needed and how their relative expression changes over a growing season. Using well-defined classes of mineral transporters, we identified 520 genes belonging to 40 different transporter classes in the tetraploid switchgrass genome. Expression patterns were determined for many of these genes using publically available transcriptomic datasets obtained from both greenhouse and field grown plants. Certain transporters showed strong temporal patterns of expression in distinct developmental stages of the plant. Gene-expression was verified for selected transporters using qRT-PCR. By and large these analyses confirmed the developmental stage-specific expression of these genes. Mineral analyses indicated that K, Fe, Mg, Co, and As had a similar pattern of accumulation with apparent limited remobilization at the end of the growing season. These initial analyses will serve as a foundation for more detailed examination of the nutrient biology of switchgrass. © 2014 Palmer, Saathoff, Waters, Donze, Heng-Moss, Twigg, Tobias and Sarath.

AB  - This scoping study assesses the contribution that woody biomass could make to feedstock supply for an aviation biofuel industry in Queensland. The inland 600-900 mm rainfall zone, including the Fitzroy Basin region, is identified as an area that is particularly worthy of closer study as it has potential for supply of woody biomass from existing native regrowth (brigalow and other species) as well as from new plantings. New analyses carried out for this study of Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata trials suggest biomass plantings could produce harvestable yield of aboveground dry mass of about 85 t ha-1 over a 10-year rotation at relatively low-rainfall (600-750 mm mean annual precipitation) sites and about 115 t ha-1 at medium-rainfall (750-900 mm) sites. Estimates of productivity for native regrowth suggest potential productivity should be around 40 t ha-1 during the initial decade after clearing when systems are managed for bioenergy rather than grazing. In this paper, potential production systems are described, and sustainability issues are briefly considered. It is concluded that more detailed studies focused particularly on biomass production would be worthwhile, and further research requirements are briefly discussed. © 2014 CSIRO.

AB  - Recent climate change, environmental design, and ecological conservation policies require new and existing urban developments to mitigate and offset carbon dioxide emissions and for cities to become carbon neutral. Some North American models and tools are available and can be used to quantify the carbon offset function of urban trees. But, little information on urban tree carbon storage and sequestration exists from the European Southern Alps. Also, the use of these North American models in Europe has never been assessed. This study developed a protocol to quantify aboveground carbon (C) storage and sequestration using a subsample of urban trees in Bolzano, Italy, and assessed two existing and available C estimation models. Carbon storage and sequestration were estimated using city-specific dendrometrics and allometric biomass equations primarily from Europe and two other United States models; the UFORE (Urban Forest Effects Model) and the CUFR Tree Carbon Calculator (CTCC). The UFORE model carbon storage estimates were the lowest while the CUFR Tree Carbon Calculator (CTCC) C sequestration estimates were the highest. Results from this study can be used to plan, design, and manage urban forests in northern Italy to maximize C offset potential, provide ecosystem services, and for developing carbon neutral policies. Findings can also be used to predict greenhouse gas emissions from tree maintenance operations as well as estimating green waste yield from landscape maintenance activities and its use as biofuel and compost. Managers need to be aware that available models and methods can produce statistically different C storage and sequestration estimates. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The aim of this article is to highlight and discuss the impacts of National Programme for Production and Use of Biodiesel - PNPB. This programme has some unique characteristics such as the incentive to social inclusion and local development by family farmers inclusion as oilseeds suppliers of biodiesel production, in this sense this study focus on biodiesel producer acquisition of raw material from family farmers, because it receives the strongest institutional pressures from the regulatory framework of PNPB. The study shows that the raw material acquisition strategy and processes has been arranged in a direction that guarantees and support the policy goals, many times in detriment of efficiency. The response given to the programme had led to it reinforcement and continuation. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Decisions involving strain selection, biomass to biofuel technology, and the location of cultivation facilities can strongly influence the economic viability of an algae-based biofuel enterprise. We summarize our past results in a new analysis to explore the relative economic impact of these design choices. Our growth model is used to predict average biomass production for two saline strains (Nannochloropsis salina and Arthrospira sp.), one fresh to brackish strain (Chlorella sp., DOE strain 1412), and one freshwater strain (order Sphaeropleales). Biomass to biofuel conversion is compared between lipid extraction and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technologies. National-scale models of water, CO 2 (as flue gas), land acquisition, site leveling, construction of connecting roads, and transport of HTL oil to existing refineries are used in conjunction with estimates of fuel value (from HTL) to prioritize and select from 88,692 unit farms (UF, 405 ha in pond area), a number sufficient to produce 136E + 9 L year -1 of renewable diesel [36 billion gallons year -1 (BGY)]. Strain selection and choice of conversion technology have large economic impacts, with differences between combinations of strains and biomass to biofuel technologies being up to $10 million year -1 UF -1 . Results based on the most productive strain, HTL-based fuel conversion, and resource costs show that the economic potential between geographic locations within the selection can differ by up to $4 million year -1 UF -1 , with 1.8 BGY of production possible from the most cost-effective sites. The local spatial variability in site rank is extreme, with very high and low sites within 10 kms of each other. Colocation with flue gas sources has a strong influence on rank, but the most costly resource component varies from site to site. The highest rank UFs are located predominantly in Florida and Texas, but most states south of 37°N latitude contain promising locations. © 2014 Venteris, Wigmosta, Coleman and Skaggs.

AB  - There are calls for biofuel imports from developing countries to be restricted. The imports which are either in the form of end-product (bioethanol or biodiesel) or feedstock (oil palm, sugar cane molasses, etc) are allegedly produced in ways which can threaten the environment and violate human rights. This article finds that there is no specific regime for trade in biofuels within the WTO system. Hence any restriction on such trade is governed by the existing trade regimes including tariffs and nontariff measures. However, the existing WTO tariff and non-tariff (TBT, anti-dumping and anti-subsidy) regimes are still inadequate in ensuring that measures are taken against biofuel feedstock and products that were produced in unsustainable ways. The use of these measures without being subject to clear defining rules will create a danger that they serve a protectionist rather than social or environmental objectives.

AB  - With this paper, we examine the current state of global governance of biofuels and assess the potential regulatory and non-regulatory mechanisms for such governance. We ask two questions: a) what are the current efforts and initiatives towards the global governance of biofuels; and b) which form of global governance is more likely to emerge in the field of bioenergy. We come to the conclusion that institution building through private governance and non-state actor partnerships can offer a viable and effective means of governance. However, the primacy of partnerships and networks in global governance also means a number of pitfalls to avoid, especially with regard to legitimacy and inclusion. Drawing lessons from the fields of forest and marine policy, we close with a number of policy recommendations for better private initiatives and partnerships for global governance of biofuels. © Firenze University Press.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable energy source produced from natural oils and fats, and is being used as a substitute for petroleum diesel. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50:50 %vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15.6, 17.5 and 21.5 %w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 %w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37.6%), palmitic acid (39.8%), oleic (11.7%), and stearic acid (8.6%). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and glycerin ratio (glycerin content from 20-40%) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19.3-21.6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel. © 2014 BRTeam.

AB  - Background: Clostridium thermocellum is a model thermophilic organism for the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic substrates. The majority of publications studying the physiology of this organism use substrate concentrations of ≤10 g/L. However, industrially relevant concentrations of substrate start at 100 g/L carbohydrate, which corresponds to approximately 150 g/L solids. To gain insight into the physiology of fermentation of high substrate concentrations, we studied the growth on, and utilization of high concentrations of crystalline cellulose varying from 50 to 100 g/L by C. thermocellum. Results: Using a defined medium, batch cultures of C. thermocellum achieved 93% conversion of cellulose (Avicel) initially present at 100 g/L. The maximum rate of substrate utilization increased with increasing substrate loading. During fermentation of 100 g/L cellulose, growth ceased when about half of the substrate had been solubilized. However, fermentation continued in an uncoupled mode until substrate utilization was almost complete. In addition to commonly reported fermentation products, amino acids - predominantly L-valine and L-alanine - were secreted at concentrations up to 7.5 g/L. Uncoupled metabolism was also accompanied by products not documented previously for C. thermocellum, including isobutanol, meso- and RR/SS-2,3-butanediol and trace amounts of 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 1-propanol. We hypothesize that C. thermocellum uses overflow metabolism to balance its metabolism around the pyruvate node in glycolysis. Conclusions: C. thermocellum is able to utilize industrially relevant concentrations of cellulose, up to 93 g/L. We report here one of the highest degrees of crystalline cellulose utilization observed thus far for a pure culture of C. thermocellum, the highest maximum substrate utilization rate and the highest amount of isobutanol produced by a wild-type organism. © 2014 Holwerda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Biogas is a renewable energy carrier which is used for heat and power production or, in the form of purified methane, as a vehicle fuel. The formation of methane from organic materials is carried out by a mixed microbial community under anaerobic conditions. However, details about the microbes involved and their function are limited. In this study we compare the metagenomes of four parallel biogas reactors digesting a protein-rich substrate, relate microbiology to biogas performance, and observe differences in these reactors' microbial communities compared to the original inoculum culture. Results: The biogas process performance during the startup phase of four parallel continuous stirred tank reactors (designated R1, R2, R3, and R4) co-digesting fish waste and cow manure was studied. The microbial composition of the inoculum (day 0) and the four reactors at day 59 was studied and compared using 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. In the inoculum and the reactor samples, the Bacteria Clostridium and Syntrophomonas were highly abundant, and the dominating methanogen was the hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus. Syntrophic prokaryotes frequently found in biogas reactors with high concentrations of ammonium and volatile fatty acids were detected in all samples. The species Candidatus Cloacimonas acidaminovorans of the candidate phylum Cloacimonetes (WWE1) increased in all reactors and was the dominating bacterium at day 59. In particular, this bacterium showed a very high abundance in R1, which distinguished this reactor significantly from the other reactors in terms of microbial composition. Methane production and the reactor slurry characteristics were monitored in the digestion period. Generally all four reactors operated stably and showed rather similar characteristics. The average methane production in the reactors varied between 0.278 and 0.296 L gVS-1, with the lowest production in R1. Conclusions: This study showed that four parallel reactors co-digesting manure and fish waste silage operated stably during a startup phase. Several important Archaea and Bacteria degrading the protein-rich substrate were identified. In particular, microorganisms involved in syntrophic methane production seemed to be important. The detailed characterization of the microbial communities presented in this work may be useful for the operation of biogas plants degrading substrates with high concentrations of proteins. © 2014 Solli et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Petroleum is highly affecting the economic development of developing countries. This study was undertaken because of the economic impact of petroleum in Ethiopia and is a model for developing countries. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of petroleum on the economy of the country and the prospect of biofuel to solve this adverse problem. National expense of petroleum was analyzed by using data collected from Ethiopian National Bank and Petroleum Enterprise. In 2007/08 fiscal year, the amount of petroleum imported showed 16% increase from the previous year while in the same period expenditure on petroleum was increased by 71%. This was due to the sharp increase in the price of petroleum in the international market. Thus in the last seven years, the cost of petroleum import was increased almost exponentially. From 2000/01 to 2009/10, the volume and value of diesel imported was grown exponentially. To lower the economic impact of petroleum, it is important to invest an alternative energy sources as substitutes and it can also address environmental problems on the other hand. The biofuels have economic significant to generate income for farmers and also creates job opportunity for the society thereby contributes a lot for economic development of the developing countries. This finding may provide basic knowledge of the role biofuel for petroleum substitute and thereby provides inputs to policy-makers, entrepreneurs, researchers, industrial actors and the society as a whole, thereby to facilitate biofuel production from the available resources. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - A perennial switchgrass, (Panicum virgatum L.), (C4) that is native to North America has good potential for biomass production because of its wide geographic distribution and adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. Insects can significantly impact the yield and quality of biofuel crops. If switchgrass are to be grown on marginally arable land or in monoculture, it are likely to be plagued with herbivore pests and plant diseases at a rate that exceeds what would be expected if the plants were not stressed in this manner. This biofuel crop has been under evaluation for commercial growing in Ukraine for eight years. However, insect diversity and the potential impact of pests on biomass production of this feedstock have not been accessed yet. The objective of our study, started in 2011, is a survey of switch grass insects by trophic groups and determine species that have pest status at two sites in the Central part of Ukraine (Kiev and Poltava regions). In Poltava site we investigated the effect of nine varieties of switchgrass (lowland and upland) to insects' diversity. We assessed changes over time in the densities of major insects' trophic groups, identifying potential pests and natural enemies. Obtained results indicates that different life stages of herbivorous insects from Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera orders were present on switchgrass during the growing season. Our study results suggests that choice of variety has an impact on trophic groups' structure and number of insects from different orders on swicthgrass. Herbivores and beneficial insects were the only groups that showed significant differences across sampling dates. The highest population of herbivores insects we recorded on 'Alamo' variety for studied years, although herbivore diversity tended to increase on 'Shelter', 'Alamo' and 'Cave-in-Rock' during 2012 and 2013. 'Dacotah', 'Nebraska', 'Sunburst', 'Forestburg' and 'Carthage' showed the highest level of beneficial insects during our study.

AB  - Agriculture and forestry face the future challenge of finding climate-friendly and regenerative methods of powering their field and forest machinery. Alternative fuel and drive concepts have been presented by industry in the past but, so far, these have been unable to establish themselves against the dominating diesel-fuelled internal combustion engine. Such concepts include internal combustion engines and the fuels fatty acid methyl ester "biodiesel", rapeseed oil/vegetable oil fuel, "HVO" hydrogenated vegetable oils and biomethane, but also electrical drive with energy supply via fuel cells with hydrogen or using accumulators. The alternatives were discussed and evaluated according to 14 criteria in a technical discussion with experts from industry, associations and scientific institutions. Currently, the use of rapeseed oil fuel and biodiesel in internal combustion engines for agricultural and forestry work machinery is most advantageous for more climate protection and resource saving and is simultaneously rapidly applicable.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential of meeting the energy needs of a rural community using renewable energy resources. The research was conducted in the municipality of Raków in the Świętokrzyskie Region. A new aspect of the research is an attempt to balance current and potential energy production from renewable sources. The studies included such resources as: solar, hydro, wind, and biogas derived from energetic and forestry plants. We divided renewable sources into existing, potential, and overall for a period until 2020. The assessment of the current state was based on a stocktaking of existing sources of energy, and prospective on the basis of potential and real opportunities, and trend analysis of the development of these energy sources. Currently, renewable sources cover only 2.2% of energy needs of the community, while electricity covers about 24% of the demand. The production of heat from renewable sources can now cover the needs of 120%, and has the potential to cover in 256%, including the biomass obtained on set-aside of 30%. The surplus of heat energy can be transferred to the outside. © 2014, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - What are the sub-national implications, in policy and practice, of environmental policy integration (EPI) in EU and Swedish bioenergy policy? Focusing on the exceptional bioenergy expansion within the Biofuel Region in north Sweden, this paper discusses cross-level implications of supranational and national policy decisions on bioenergy; whether environmental perspectives are observable also in sub-national bioenergy discussions; and explores the drivers of sub-national bioenergy development in a multi-level governance setting. The study finds that higher-level EPI plays an important role for sub-national bioenergy development. The degree of sub-national EPI in bioenergy and the type of renewables invested in is to a large extent set by top-down influence from the EU and national level through agenda setting, policy goals and economic mechanisms. Local policy entrepreneurs play an important role for finding ‘win-win’-solutions that can help initiating local energy projects and ensure sub-national EPI, but environmental- economic - rather than merely economic - motives for getting involved are important to ensure long-term local commitment to renewable energy projects. © 2014, Europa Grande.

AB  - The interest in biofuels is growing globally and the demand for bioenergy throughout the European Union will expand considerably in the following years. Numerous studies have shown that energy resulted from green plants has much to offer, as it is renewable and largely carbon-neutral compared with fossil fuel combustion. However, this is an increasingly controversial issue due to its strong impact on economy, environment and land use. Romania is one of the European Union Member States with a large biofuel production resources, owing to its high land agricultural area and good conditions for cereal and oilseed growth. There has been an increasing tendency to grow biofuels in the Romanian cultivated areas over the last decades; however, it is difficult to know if biofuel production is sustainable in this part of Europe and what impact may have unsustainable production since there is no or scientific research on this topic. The aim of this paper is to present the dynamics of biofuel crops (biodiesel) areas in Romania over the last decade, and to introduce a short review on the possible impacts on the environment, greenhouse gas emissions (GES) and land use in order to defend the need of information for our particular situation.

AB  - Effect of various chemical pretreatments (HCl, H2SO4, NaOH, H2O2 and NaOH/H2O2) and ultrasonication pretreatment for delignification to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis was evaluated for Salvinia cucullata. After pretreatment, saccharificationwas carried out using crude cellulase enzymes produced from Trichoderma reesei Rut C30. The alkaline/ oxidative pretreatment gavemaximumreducing sugar yield of 341.8 mg/g of dry biomass.When this S. cucullatawas used in the pond for sewage treatment, the chemical oxygen demand, totalKjeldahl nitrogen and PO4 removal rates were found to be 84.7 ± 3, 84.4 ± 1 and 94.0 ± 1 %, respectively, making it possible to grow this plant in oxidation pond while simultaneously offering adequate treatment to the sewage. The biomass yield of 39 ± 2 t/ha-year was observed in this experiment, with potential to produce reducing sugar in the range of 12.6-14.0 t/ha-year for biofuels production. Thus, harvested biomass from aquatic pond can be used for biofuel without having conflict with agricultural land. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - The U.S., Brazil and a number of European and other countries worldwide have introduced various support schemes for bioethanol and biodiesel. The advantage of these biofuels is that they are relatively easily integrated with the current fossil fuel-based transport sector, at least up to a certain point. However, recent studies point to various negative effects of expanding the production of first generation (1G) biofuels further. 1G biofuels' problems can be overcome by a transition to second generation (2G) biofuels. So far, 2G biofuels are much more costly to produce. We therefore ask: to what extent is targeted support to 2G biofuels likely to bring costs down? Additionally, are current support schemes for biofuels well designed in order to promote the development of 2G biofuels? We find that the prospects for cost reduction look better for 2G bioethanol than for 2G biodiesel. Bioethanol made from cellulose is far from a ripe technology, with several cost-reducing opportunities yet to be developed. Hence, targeted support to cellulosic ethanol might induce a switch from 1G to 2G biofuels. However, we find little evidence that production and use of 1G bioethanol will bridge the conversion to 2G bioethanol. Hence, to the extent that private investment in the development of 2G bioethanol is too low, current support schemes for 1G biofuels may block 2G bioethanol instead of promoting it. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The present study was carried out in open private commercial field in El-Behira Governorate, Egypt (30″54′34, 87″N and 30″ 42′ 33, 78″ E) during the period from 15 February 2013 to 26 April 2013. The study deals with the effect of seven different concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) (control zero, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 ppm) for 12 h and three types of planting media (sand, sand: peat moss l:l(v/v) and peat moss) on root performance of Jatropha curcas L. and Euphorbia tirucalli cuttings. Data were collected ten weeks after planting the cuttings. Three experiments were conducted where in Experiment 1: Cuttings were taken from two years old of Jatropha curcas L. terminal branches 6-8 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 1500 ppm>1000 ppm>3000 ppm>2500 ppm >2000 ppm>500 ppm> control. In case of propagation 1500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best (6.8 roots/cutting, 1.32 cm root length, 71.1 rooting percentage, 3.1 g fresh weight, 1.5 leaves/cutting, 2.4 cm length of the longest leaf and 38 days to sprout). In Experiment 2: Cuttings were taken from four years old of Jatropha curcas L. terminal branches 15-17 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 2500 ppm >3000 ppm >2000 ppm>1500 ppm>500 ppm>1000 ppm>control. In case of propagation 2500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best for (8.3 roots/cutting, 5.6 cm root length, 68.8 rooting percentage, 14.8 g fresh weight, 3.1 leaves/cutting, 4.6 cm length of the longest leaf and 50 days to sprout). In Experiment 3: Cuttings were taken from terminal branches of Euphorbia tirucalli 20-22 cm length treated with IBA at different concentration showed the rooting behavior in the order: 2500 ppm>1500 ppm>2000 ppm>3000 ppm>1000 ppm>500 ppm>control. In case of propagation 2500 ppm IBA treatment was found to be the best for (8.2 roots/cutting, 11.8 cm root length, 73.3 rooting percentage, 5.2 g fresh weight, 7.7 leaves /cutting and 46 days to sprout). The types of planting media treatment showed the rooting behavior in order: Sand>sand: Peat moss 1:1 (v/v)>peat moss for both cuttings of Jatropha curcas and Euphorbia tirucalli in all three experiment. © 2014 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - The production of biofuels (e.g., ethanol and biodiesel) requires a significant amount of water during feedstock production, transportation, and its conversion into biofuels. Therefore present study devoted to study the impact of biofuel production on water demand in Alberta. In scenario # 1, it is assumed that ethanol is produced from both wheat and wheat straw and that biodiesel is produced from rapeseed. Scenario #2 proposes ethanol production from wheat only and biodiesel production from rapeseed. The water requirements for biofuel production in both scenarios are calculated for Alberta for the year 2025. Data on the current availability of water in Alberta indicate that the Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, and Peace River basins of northern Alberta have enough water to grow crops for the production of biofuels. In 2025, Alberta will have to produce 3,754 million liters of ethanol and 270 million liters of biodiesel to meet the projected levels. If biofuels are produced from the crops grown in the abovementioned northern river basins, the province of Alberta should be able to meet biofuel demand in 2025 sustainably. The water requirement from these river basins for biofuel production will increase to 5.2%, 0.6%, and 11.6%, respectively, of the natural flow in scenario # 1 whereas, for scenario #2, the water requirement from these rivers basins will increase to 5.2%, 2.3%, and 16.1%, respectively, of natural flow. These increases in the requirements are much lower than the possible allowed withdrawal levels.

AB  - A large amount of agricultural waste was generated all over the world, which could cost many problems such as environment pollution, GHG (greenhouse gas) emission, and serious disease. A review of the literature published in 2013 on topics relating to agricultural waste issues is presented, and about 180 papers were selected. The main treatment methods of agricultural waste can be biodegradation, composing, digestion, and hydrolysis. Researchers paid more attention on the waste reuse, focusing on t he environmental friendly utilization such as producing of biofuel, construction material, active carbon, adsorbent etc. Moreover, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to evaluate the economic and environmental impact widely.

AB  - The increasing use of food commodities for biofuel production may intensify the competition for arable land. To test this hypothesis we analyze the effects of crude oil prices on prices, areas and quantities of selected food commodities empirically. On the world level the crude oil price Granger causes an increasing area use for the production of maize, soybean oil, sugar and wheat. For the U.S., we find that the maize price is the key variable influencing the total area used for cereal production. In Indonesia and Malaysia the palm oil price has effects on the cultivated area for rice.

AB  - Indonesia has committed to gradually increase share of biofuel to at least 5% on its national energy mix in 2025. Therefore, all biofuel resources need to be explored, including jatropha oil. Objectives of this study were to identify suitable Jatropha curcas L. accessions for biodiesel production and collect them for future breeding program. In this study, fourteen accessions were collected from four major islands in Indonesia. All collected accessions were grown on sub-optimal land at Agro Techno Park in South Sumatera for agronomic and genetic evaluations. Dice’s similarity coefficients between accessions were calculated and a dendrogram was constructed based on agronomic and genetic similarity matrices using the un-weighted pair-group mean algorithm. Results of this study indicated that agronomic similarities were higher among accessions collected from the same island or with neighboring island with similar agroclimate, as observed on accessions collected from Sumatera and Kalimantan. Jawa and Sulawesi accessions were in a different cluster. Accession clusters based on genetic traits was different from those based on agronomic characteristics, suggesting that environment played significant roles in influencing phenotypic characteristics. Nine crossings were made between genetically-distant accessions. Progeny with highest seed oil yield of 171.69 g/plant was from crossing between IDR (Inderalaya, Sumatera) as female and PNT (Pontianak, Kalimantan) as male parent. In addition, five other progenies exhibited heterosis effect (LMPxPDI; PDIxMDN; CRPxPDI; IDRxPLG; and PDIxLMP) are recommended for breeding programs. Seed oil yield of progenies was higher if genetic similarity coefficient between parents was lower. © 2014, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although recognized as a promising microbial cell factory for producing biofuels, current productivity in cyanobacterial systems is low. To make the processes economically feasible, one of the hurdles, which need to be overcome is the low tolerance of hosts to toxic biofuels. Meanwhile, little information is available regarding the cellular responses to biofuels stress in cyanobacteria, which makes it challenging for tolerance engineering. Using large proteomic datasets of Synechocystis under various biofuels stress and environmental perturbation, a protein co-expression network was first constructed and then combined with the experimentally determined protein-protein interaction network. Proteins with statistically higher topological overlap in the integrated network were identified as common responsive proteins to both biofuels stress and environmental perturbations. In addition, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to distinguish unique responses to biofuels from those to environmental perturbations and to uncover metabolic modules and proteins uniquely associated with biofuels stress. The results showed that biofuel-specific proteins and modules were enriched in several functional categories, including photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and amino acid metabolism, which may represent potential key signatures for biofuels stress responses in Synechocystis. Network-based analysis allowed determination of the responses specifically related to biofuels stress, and the results constituted an important knowledge foundation for tolerance engineering against biofuels in Synechocystis. © 2014 Pei, Chen, Wang, Qiao and Zhang.

AB  - Available estimates of the land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels differ significantly across economic models. This paper focuses on the impacts of price-induced yield assumptions on U.S. corn ethanol results. These assumptions have dramatic impacts within the FAPRI modeling framework, but limited ones within the GTAP-BIO model. I show that these sensitivity to yield assumption results are not comparable because the ex ante land and production elasticities assumed in these two models are not comparable. The analysis reveals that the current focus solely on the value of the price-induced yield elasticity can be misleading. © 2014 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - Carbonaceous and soluble ionic species of PM1.0 and PM10 were measured along with the absorption and scattering properties and aerosol number size distributions at Gosan Climate Observatory (GCO) from January to September 2008. The daily averaged equivalent black carbon (EBC) measured as aerosol absorption exhibited two types of spectral dependence with a distinct maximum (peak) at either 370 nm or 880 nm, by which two subsets were extracted and classified into the respective groups (370 and 880 nm). The 370 nm group was distinguished by high organic carbon (OC) concentrations relative to elemental carbon (EC) and sulfate, but sulfate was predominant for the 880 nm group. The PM1.0 OC of the 370 nm group was mainly composed of refractory and pyrolized components that correlated well with PM1.0 EC1, referred to as char EC, which suggests biofuel and biomass combustion as the source of these OC fractions, particularly during winter. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and the number size distributions implied that aerosols of the 370 nm group were externally mixed upon transport in fast-moving air masses that passed through the Beijing area in about one day. In contrast, the aerosols of the 880 nm group were characterized by high sulfate concentrations, and seemed to be internally mixed during slow transport over the Yellow Sea region over approximately 2 to 4 days. The absorption and scattering coefficients of the 880 nm group were noticeably higher compared to those of the 370 nm group. The average absorption ångström exponent (AAE) was estimated to be 1.29 and 1.0 for the 370 and 880 nm groups, respectively, in the range 370-950 nm. These results demonstrated that the optical properties of aerosols were intimately linked to chemical composition and mixing state, characteristics determined both by source and atmospheric aging processes. In OC dominant aerosols, absorption was enhanced in the UV region, which was possibly due to refractory and pyrolized OC compounds. Under sulfate dominant conditions, the sulfate coating on BC particles likely contributed to the absorption of the longer visible light. Consequently, single scattering albedo (SSA) was higher for the 880 nm group than for the 370 nm group, emphasizing that the relative abundances of absorbing and scattering constituents are also important in estimating the climate effect of aerosols. © Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Promotion of biogas production to generate energy is associated with several eU policy initiatives such as increasing the production of electricity and thermal energy, energy independence, and the reduction of gHg emissions. Besides, one of the topical problems is the increasing amount of organic waste and residue from agriculture, industry, and households, thereby making waste management, recycling, and waste reduction one of the government policy priorities. Terefore, energy production from biogas that forms in the fermentation process of various waste, including agricultural wastes, provides environmental, social, and economic gains, and it plays a signifcant role from both the bioeconomic and energy policy perspectives. to reach both the international and the national policy targets in renewable energy production, all eU member states use several support mechanisms. In latvia four support mechanisms are used for production of electricity and heat from renewables - obligatory state purchase of electricity, guarantee of a set price, release from paying the electricity tax for the energy, produced from the renewable resources and public (eU structural fund) funding for investments, and one support mechanism for production of biofuel. In few recent years in latvia, the support mechanisms described above have created a motivating support system for joining the biogas production sector, but due to the pressure of the manufacturing enterprises and households the government intends to change the support policy and the amount of the support for electricity production from biogas. it creates instability and increases political risks for biogas producers thus obstructing the development of the sector. Te current article reviews the former and current support policy for biogas production in eU and latvia and gives an insight to the signifcance of political risks in the production of biogas from agriculture biomass. © lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2014.

AB  - As a sterile hybrid, Miscanthus×giganteus must be vegetatively propagated. Previous work has shown that propagation method may negatively impact not only yield of M.×giganteus, but also winter survival. However, these studies only considered rhizome and micropropagated M.×giganteus. Recently, stem propagated plants have also become available to the US market. Similar to micropropagation, these propagules do not rely on rhizomes to produce planting stock, but little is known about the yield potential or survival of stem propagated plants in the field. Here we addressed these questions in a replicated, side-by-side comparison of rhizome and stem propagated plants at three sites in Iowa, USA. We found no propagule related differences in above- or belowground biomass, establishment losses or winter losses of M.×giganteus. Yields averaged 24.7 (±3.5)Mgha-1. Though M.×giganteus productivity frequently peaks in the third year after planting, second year yields in Iowa were not significantly different than third. Additionally, winter mortality was very low, averaging only 1.2% during the first two winters. Establishment mortality, however, was significantly greater (P<0.0001) and averaged 23.7%. We found M.×giganteus is productive in Iowa, with yields similar or higher than other US trials, and that stem propagated M.×giganteus performed very similarly to rhizome propagated M.×giganteus. While much research has been conducted on cold tolerance and winter survival in M.×giganteus, future research should also address establishment losses to reduce planting costs, the major upfront expense in M.×giganteus production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) concluded that algal strain improvement is the most important cost-reduction factor for commercial-scale production of algal-derived biofuel. Strain improvement may be aided by computer models that simulate growth and lipid synthesis under a variety of environmental conditions. Early phytoplankton growth models were developed empirically under the assumption of steady-state growth. Simple Monod or Droop-type constructs fail outside conditions from which they were derived. Mechanistic models incorporate structures that are based on theoretical principles and whose components are derived from real processes being simulated. One of the most common approaches to incorporating mechanistic components is to develop model constructs based on one or more acclimation mechanisms. It is likely that current phytoplankton models can be improved by incorporating multiple growth factors, basing them on mechanistic principles, and employing both threshold and multiplicative components as needed. Furthermore, the current understanding of both phytoplankton growth and lipid kinetics is weak and demands more research in this area if real strain improvement is to be achieved. © 2014 ASABE.

AB  - Climate change will alter ecosystem metabolism and may lead to a redistribution of vegetation and changes in fire regimes in Northern Eurasia over the 21st century. Land management decisions will interact with these climate-driven changes to reshape the region's landscape. Here we present an assessment of the potential consequences of climate change on land use and associated land carbon sink activity for Northern Eurasia in the context of climate-induced vegetation shifts. Under a 'business-as-usual' scenario, climate-induced vegetation shifts allow expansion of areas devoted to food crop production (15%) and pastures (39%) over the 21st century. Under a climate stabilization scenario, climate-induced vegetation shifts permit expansion of areas devoted to cellulosic biofuel production (25%) and pastures (21%), but reduce the expansion of areas devoted to food crop production by 10%. In both climate scenarios, vegetation shifts further reduce the areas devoted to timber production by 6-8% over this same time period. Fire associated with climate-induced vegetation shifts causes the region to become more of a carbon source than if no vegetation shifts occur. Consideration of the interactions between climate-induced vegetation shifts and human activities through a modeling framework has provided clues to how humans may be able to adapt to a changing world and identified the trade-offs, including unintended consequences, associated with proposed climate/energy policies. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Analytical techniques are vital for the development of new added-value materials and products from biomass, such as liquid biofuels, by evaluating the quality and chemical composition of the raw materials and all materials and byproducts in the production process. This also enables the evaluation and implementation of environmental laws and better understanding of the economics of new biomass processes. Different analytical techniques are applied to different biomass feedstocks, such as sugarcane, soybean, corn, forests, pulp and paper, waste and agricultural residues, dependent on the final end biofuel product. This chapter highlights how the use of analytical chemistry can be used as a tool to ensure quality and sustainability of the biomass and liquid biofuels, with, some aspects of green analysis also considered. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Despite the challenges, depending on the local conditions and practices, renewable energy sources are already a significant contribution to the energy mix. Although this is true for electricity generation, the same does not apply for the transportation sector, where the available renewable sources are limited and still have a modest impact in the overall consumption. In this context, advanced biofuels such as microalgae are worldwide believed to be a better choice for achieving the goals of incorporating non-food-based biofuels into the biofuel market and overcoming landuse issues. Compared to other biofuel technologies, the most favorable factors for the cultivation of microalgae for the production of biofuels are they can be grown in brackish water and on non-fertile land, and the oil yield production is far superior. Main challenges are currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization, since the majority of economic and financial analyses rely on pilot-scale projects. Environmental issues are most likely to diverge opinions from experts. This chapter presents a review of microalgae cultivation (species, usage, processes, and culture) and biofuel production, highlighting advantages and challenges of algae biofuel. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Although biofuels have the potential to supplement conventional petroleum fuels in a variety of energy applications, and as transport fuels in particular, their use also poses some problems from an environmental perspective. Concerns exist relating to whether positive net energy (and therefore effective greenhouse gas mitigation) can be derived from biofuels, whether the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks leads to significant environmental degradation and whether their use could hamper the implementation of a more long-term transport energy paradigm. Yet a clear understanding of these issues, together with the more important technical aspects relating to biomass cultivation and biofuel production, has the potential to ensure that biofuels can play a successful role in weaning the planet off its current carbon dependency. In particular, the ability to assess the total life cycle of biofuels from cradle to grave emerges as a particularly important consideration in ensuring that cultivation and production processes are optimized. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Biofuel policies around the world have, in general, been driven by concerns relating to energy security, greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement and regional development. However, in major biofuel markets, these policies have led to market distortions that have problematized the achievement of the longer-term objectives associated with biofuels. In particular, prioritization of certain economic goals, like assisting rural areas, has hindered the achievement of other outcomes, such as decoupling national energy security from fossil fuel prices and achieving the greatest possible emission abatement. A shift towards next-generation equivalents is desirable, but the currently low price of conventional fuel and the high production costs of advanced biofuels currently act as a barrier to commercialization. These barriers are most likely to be overcome as conventional fuel resources become depleted and advanced biofuel technologies mature over time. Until then, government intervention will be crucial in determining the industry’s future. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - The current taxation benefits for biofuels are only temporary. Therefore, biofuel production costs need to be able to compete with those of conventional fuels in order to gain market share in the future. However, highly complex influencing factors make a comparison of biofuel production costs with those of fossil fuels challenging. This chapter has three major goals: (1) a projection of future feedstock prices for biofuels based on the development of the price for crude oil, (2) a simulation of the effects of likely economies of scale from scaling-up production size and technological learning on production costs and (3) a scenario analysis comparing different biofuels and fossil fuels. European biofuel production costs for 2015 as well as 2020 are projected based on a calculation model for biofuel production. Our scenarios assume prices for crude oil between Euro 50 and Euro 200 per barrel for both reference years. Our results indicate that mid- to long-term, second-generation biofuels are very likely to achieve competitive production costs, if technological learning and economies of scale are factored in. Bioethanol made from lignocellulosic biomass and biodiesel from waste oil promise the highest cost-saving potential in all crude price scenarios and are capable of outperforming fossil fuels and first-generation biofuels in the future. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - Biofuel has come up as an important alternative to diversifying the global energy matrix, with economic, social, and environmental impact. Currently, Brazil is the main supplier and one of the top consumers of biofuels in the world, and has prioritized the use of soy as a raw material for the biofuel industry, as well as the sugarcane for producing ethanol; both industries use more than 8 million hectares of cropped land and employ over 1 million people every year. Considering the importance of this subject for the energy matrix and Brazilian economy, we sought to analyze the concentration level for each one of these industries, as well as its impact in pricing. The results point to a low concentration of the biodiesel market, where its production is centralized in four Brazilian states: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo. This low concentration implies high competitiveness and homogenous average prices in the last couple of years (2011 and 2012), for companies holding 80 % of the market, as well as other firms in this industry. On the other hand, the industrial concentration level of the ethanol distribution channels has significantly grown, thus implying a significant and positive correlation between the increase of concentration and the increase of the contribution margin in this industry. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - As a result of the global fuel crisis of the early 1970s, coupled with concerns for the environment, the use of biofuel has been on the increase in many regions throughout the world. At present, a total of approximately 30 billion (30×109) liters of biofuel are utilized worldwide annually, although most countries rely hugely on the first generation biofuel. The limitations of the first and second generation biofuel gave rise to current interest in algae as a promising alternative to these conventional biofuel sources. Algal biomass could provide a lion's share of the global transport fuel requirements in future. The present review highlights some important developments in, and potentials of algaculture as a major biomass resource of the future. However, the major constraint to commercial-scale algae farming for energy production is the cost factor, which must be addressed adequately before its potentials can be harnessed. © 2014 Chinese Materials Research Society.

AB  - Small-scale biogas digesters are widely promoted worldwide as a sustainable technology to manage livestock manure. In Vietnam, pig slurry is commonly applied to biogas digesters for production of gas for electricity and cooking with the effluent being used to fertilize field crops, vegetables and fish ponds. Slurry may contain a variety of zoonotic pathogens, e.g. Salmonella spp., which are able to cause disease in humans either through direct contact with slurry or by fecal contamination of water and foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of Salmonella spp. and the fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, E. coli, and spores of Clostridium perfringens in biogas digesters operated by small-scale Vietnamese pig farmers. The serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility of the Salmonella spp. isolated were also established. The study was conducted in 12 farms (6 farms with and 6 farms without toilet connected) located in Hanam province, Vietnam. Sampling of pig slurry and biogas effluent was done during two seasons. Results showed that the concentration of enterococci, E. coli, and Clostridium perfringens spores was overall reduced by only 1-2log10-units in the biogas digesters when comparing raw slurry and biogas effluent. Salmonella spp. was found in both raw slurry and biogas effluent. A total of 19 Salmonella serovars were identified, with the main serovars being Salmonella Typhimurium (55/138), Salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (19/138), Salmonella Weltevreden (9/138) and Salmonella Rissen (9/138). The Salmonella serovars showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns to those previously reported from Vietnam. When promoting biogas, farmers should be made aware that effluent should only be used as fertilizer for crops not consumed raw and that indiscriminate discharge of effluent are likely to contaminate water recipients, e.g. drinking water sources, with pathogens. Relevant authorities should promote safe animal manure management practices to farmers and regulations be updated to ensure food safety and public health. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Willows are one of the most important tree species for landscaping, biofuel and raw timber. Screening salttolerant willow varieties is an effective approach to balance wood supply and demand. However, more salt-tolerant willow varieties are required and little is known regarding the mechanism of salt tolerance at the gene expression level. In this paper, two willow varieties were studies in terms of their differences in salt-tolerances and mechanism of salt tolerance at the level of VP1 gene expression. The results showed that Salix L0911 (L0911) had higher biomass than Salix matsudana (SM), and salt injuries were less severe in L0911 than in SM. The activities of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, as well as the contents of soluble protein and proline, were higher in L0911 than in SM, whereas the contents of Na+ and K+, as well as the Na+/K+ ratio, were lower in L0911 than in SM. Two VP1 genes (VP1.1 and VP1.2) cloned in L0911 and SM had similar sequences and structures. VP1.1 and VP1.2 belonged to different subgroups. Total expression levels of the VP1.1 gene in both roots and leaves of L0911 were higher than that in SM under normal conditions. Under salt stress, expression of VP1 in SM roots initially increased and then decreased, whereas the expression of VP1 in leaves of L0911 and SM, as well as in roots of L0911, decreased with increasing salt concentrations. This study increased our understanding of the salt-tolerance mechanism of willow and may facilitate the selection of salt-tolerant willow resources. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - The notion that global agricultural output needs to double by 2050 is oft repeated. Using a new International Agricultural Prospects (iAP) Model, to project global agricultural consumption and production, we find in favour of a future where aggregate agricultural consumption (in tonnes) increases more modestly, by around 69 per cent (1.3 per cent per year) from 2010 to 2050. The principal driver of this result is a deceleration in population growth in the decades ahead. Per capita income growth and changing demographics (generally ageing population) have significant but secondary roles in spurring growth in agricultural consumption, as does our projected growth in the use of agricultural feedstocks to meet the growth we envisage in biofuel demand. Worldwide (but not equally everywhere), crop yield growth has generally slowed over the past decade or so. Notwithstanding a projected continuance of this slowdown, the prospective improvements in crop productivity are still sufficient to reduce per capita cropland use, such that land devoted to crops would need to increase by less than 10 per cent. Even in our upper-bound (high-consumption) scenario, we estimate that there remains sufficient productive agricultural land to more than meet the demand without ploughing-in additional forest-dominated lands. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how the complexities introduced by trends in agricultural productivity and climate change affect the future of global food security. We use a partial equilibrium model of global agriculture incorporating a food security module that links changes in the average dietary energy intake to shifts in the full caloric distribution, allowing us to compute changes in the incidence, headcount and average depth of malnutrition. After validating the model against an historical period, we implement a series of future scenarios to understand the impacts of key exogenous drivers on selected food security outcomes. Our results show improvements in global food security for the period 2006-2050. Despite growing population and increased biofuel demand, baseline income growth, coupled with projected increases in agricultural productivity lead to a 24 per cent rise in global average dietary energy intake. Consequently, the incidence of malnutrition falls by 84 per cent, lifting more than half a billion people out of extreme hunger. However, these results hinge heavily on agricultural productivity growth. Without such growth, there could be a substantial setback on food security improvements. Climate change adds uncertainty to these projections, depending critically on the crop yield impacts of increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

AB  - Second generation biofuels utilising agricultural by-products (e.g. straw), or dedicated energy crops (DECs) produced on'marginal' land, have been called for. A structured telephone survey of 263 livestock farmers, predominantly located in the west or 'marginal' upland areas of England captured data on attitudes towards straw use and DECs. Combined with farm physical and business data, the survey results show that 7.2% and 6.3% of farmers would respectively consider growing SRC and miscanthus, producing respective maximum potential English crop areas of 54,603 ha and 43,859 ha. If higher market prices for straw occurred, most livestock farmers would continue to buy straw. Reasons for not being willing to consider growing DECs include concerns over land quality, committing land for a long time period, lack of appropriate machinery, profitability, and time tofinancial return; a range of moral, land quality, production conflict and lack of crop knowledge factors were also cited. Results demonstrate limited potential for the production of DECs on livestock farms in England. Changes in policy support to address farmer concerns with respect to DECs will be required to incentivise farmers to increase energy crop production. Policy support for DEC production must be cognisant of farm-level economic, tenancy and personal objectives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sorghum crop provides excellent forage in dry land areas. It has ability to tolerate high temperature and grow under minimal soil moisture. Sugar content in Sorghum is of prime importance regarding, animal feed value as well as biofuel production. However, high level of HCN toxin production is a serious problem associated with this crop which could be lethal to animals if ingested in greater quantities. In this study hydrocyanic acid and sugar content dynamics were determined on two forage sorghum cultivars i.e. JS-2002 and Chakwal sorghum at different developmental stages (bootinga and 50% headingb). Fertilizer treatments of nitrogen (0, 60 and 120 kg ha-1) and sulphur levels (0, 20 and 40 kg ha-1) were applied in replicates. The experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design. The results clearly depicted that increase in nitrogen levels gradually increased the HCN and sugar contents irrespective to sulphur and delayed harvesting times. Increase in HCN (21a &amp; 22b%) and brix value (56a &amp; 59b%) was found more at 120 kg N ha-1 when compared with 0 kg N ha-1 (control) treatment. Similarly increase in sulphur application caused increase in brix value however; inverse relationship with HCN content was recorded. Results also indicated that sorghum cultivar JS-2002 produced 27a &amp; 40b% decline in HCN content while 8a &amp; 18b% more sugar content when compared with Chakwal sorghum. Seasonal variations resulted maximum sugar production of 14.9, 25.6% and HCN content of 21.9 &amp; 13.1 mg/100g during different year time (2010 and 2009 when compared with 2008, respectively) probably due to variation in seasonal rainfall. Three years field study indicate that JS-2002 produced less HCN with low dose of N application (0 kg ha-1) and higher application of sulphur (40 kg ha-1) while more brix value at 40 kg S and 120 kg N ha-1 under sub-tropical rainfed conditions. © 2014, Society of Field Crops Science.

AB  - In Brazil, the State of Goiás is one of sugarcane expansion's frontiers to meet the growing demand for biofuels. The objective of this study was to identify the municipalities where there were replacement of annual crops (mainly grains) by sugarcane in the state of Goiás, as well as indicate correlations between the sugarcane expansion and the family farming production, in the period between 2005 and 2010. For this purpose, grains crop mask and sugarcane crop mask, obtained from satellite images, were intersected using geoprocessing techniques. It was also used IBGE data of sugarcane production and planted area, and data of family farming production linked with the National Food Acquisition Program (PAA), in relation to the number of cooperatives and family farmers. The crops masks and data tables of the National Food Acquisition Program were provided by National Food Supply Agency. There were 95 municipalities that had crops replacement, totaling 281,554 hectares of grains converted to sugarcane. We highlight the municipalities of Santa Isabel, Iaciara, Maurilândia, and Itapaci, where this change represented more than half of their agricultural areas. In relation to family farming, the sugarcane expansion in the state of Goiás has not affected their activities during the period studied.

AB  - Background: Chemical and physical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass improves substrate reactivity for increased microbial biofuel production, but also restricts growth via the release of furan aldehydes, such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). The physiological effects of these inhibitors on thermophilic, fermentative bacteria are important to understand; especially as cellulolytic strains are being developed for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosic feedstocks. Identifying mechanisms for detoxification of aldehydes in naturally resistant strains, such as Thermoanaerobacter spp., may also enable improvements in candidate CBP microorganisms. Results: Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E, an anaerobic, saccharolytic thermophile, was found to grow readily in the presence of 30 mM furfural and 20 mM 5-HMF and reduce these aldehydes to their respective alcohols in situ. The proteomes of T. pseudethanolicus 39E grown in the presence or absence of 15 mM furfural were compared to identify upregulated enzymes potentially responsible for the observed reduction. A total of 225 proteins were differentially regulated in response to the 15 mM furfural treatment with 152 upregulated versus 73 downregulated. Only 87 proteins exhibited a twofold or greater change in abundance in either direction. Of these, 54 were upregulated in the presence of furfural and 33 were downregulated. Two oxidoreductases were upregulated at least twofold by furfural and were targeted for further investigation. Teth39-1597 encodes a predicted butanol dehydrogenase (BdhA) and Teth39-1598, a predicted aldo/keto reductase (AKR). Both genes were cloned from T. pseudethanolicus 39E, with the respective enzymes overexpressed in E. coli and specific activities determined against a variety of aldehydes. Overexpressed BdhA showed significant activity with all aldehydes tested, including furfural and 5-HMF, using NADPH as the cofactor. Cell extracts with AKR also showed activity with NADPH, but only with four-carbon butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde. Conclusions: T. pseudethanolicus 39E displays intrinsic tolerance to the common pretreatment inhibitors furfural and 5-HMF. Multidimensional proteomic analysis was used as an effective tool to identify putative mechanisms for detoxification of furfural and 5-HMF. T. pseudethanolicus was found to upregulate an NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase 6.8-fold in response to furfural. In vitro enzyme assays confirmed the reduction of furfural and 5-HMF to their respective alcohols. © 2014 Clarkson et al.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for microalgae biofuel infrastructure are sometimes neglected during a life-cycle analysis (LCA). Construction materials were found for a baseline facility designed to produce renewable diesel in the United States. Material use was amortized over the material lifetime of thirty years and then, using emission factors available in GREET 2, energy use and GHG emissions were found per MJ of renewable diesel (MJ RD). For the baseline, infrastructure GHG emissions were 8.9gCO2e/MJ RD. Plastic and concrete had the largest emissions, and the growth ponds used the most materials of any unit operation. Fossil fuels comprised 97% of all energy use, which came predominately from natural gas at 0.090MJ/MJ RD. A sensitivity analysis showed that changes to the pond liner thickness and material lifetime had the largest effects with the lifetime increasing the GHG emissions 28% over the baseline. Increasing the productivity (up to 50g/m2/d) or lipid content (up to 50wt.%) decreased the emissions. Infrastructure emissions were compared to those from the fuel-cycle of a reduced emission scenario, showing that infrastructure related emissions ranged from 17% to 57% of the fuel-cycle emissions, with higher values at lower productivities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: To ensure reliable sources of energy and raw materials, the utilization of sustainable biomass has considerable advantages over petroleum-based energy sources. Photosynthetic algae have attracted attention as a third-generation feedstock for biofuel production, because algae cultivation does not directly compete with agricultural resources, including the requirement for productive land and fresh water. In particular, cyanobacteria are a promising biomass feedstock because of their high photosynthetic capability. Results: In the present study, the expression of the flv3 gene, which encodes a flavodiiron protein involved in alternative electron flow (AEF) associated with NADPH-coupled O2 photoreduction in photosystem I, was enhanced in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Overexpression of flv3 improved cell growth with corresponding increases in O2 evolution, intracellular ATP level, and turnover of the Calvin cycle. The combination of in vivo 13C-labeling of metabolites and metabolomic analysis confirmed that the photosynthetic carbon flow was enhanced in the flv3-overexpressing strain. Conclusions: Overexpression of flv3 improved cell growth and glycogen production in the recombinant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Direct measurement of metabolic turnover provided conclusive evidence that CO2 incorporation is enhanced by the flv3 overexpression. Increase in O2 evolution and ATP accumulation indicates enhancement of the AEF. Overexpression of flv3 improves photosynthesis in the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by enhancement of the AEF. © 2014 Hasunuma et al.

AB  - The notion of renewable energy provides an important mechanism for diversifying an energy portfolio, which ultimately would have numerous benefits including increased energy resilience, reduced reliance on foreign energy supplies, reduced GHG emissions, development of a green energy sector that contributes to economic growth, and providing a sustainable energy supply. The conversion of autotrophic algae to liquid transportation fuels is the basis of several decades of research to competitively bring energy-scale production into reality; however, many challenges still remain for making algal biofuels economically viable. Addressing current challenges associated with algal production systems, in part, requires the ability to assess spatial and temporal variability, rapidly evaluate alternative algal production system designs, and perform large-scale assessments considering multiple scenarios for thousands of potential sites. We introduce the development and application of the Algae Logistics Model (ALM) which is tailored to help address these challenges. The flexible nature of the ALM architecture allows the model to: 1) interface with external biomass production and resource assessment models, as well as other relevant datasets including those with spatiotemporal granularity; 2) interchange design processes to enable operational and economic assessments of multiple design configurations, including the integration of current and new innovative technologies; and 3) conduct trade-off analysis to help understand the site-specific techno-economic trade-offs and inform technology decisions. This study uses the ALM to investigate a baseline open-pond production system determined by model harmonization efforts conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy. Six sites in the U.S. southern-tier were sub-selected and assessed using daily site-specific algae biomass productivity data to determine the economic viability of large-scale open-pond systems. Results show that costs can vary significantly depending on location and biomass productivity and that integration of novel dewatering equipment, order of operations, and equipment scaling can also have significant impacts on economics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A warm sunny climate and unoccupied arid land as in the American Southwest are favorable for algal cultivation. However, additional resource constraints affect the overall viability of specific sites and regions. We investigated tradeoffs between growth rate, water, and CO2 availability and costs for two strains: Nannochloropsis salina and Chlorella sp. We conducted site selection exercises to produce 7.95E+10Lyr-1 (21billiongalyr-1 (BGY)) of renewable diesel (RD). Experimental trials from the National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bio-Products (NAABB) team informed the growth model of our Biomass Assessment Tool. We simulated RD production by both lipid extraction (LE) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Sites were screened for the availability of freshwater and flue gas, and prioritized by the net value of biofuel minus water (the least-expensive and available source) and flue gas delivery costs. Water sources considered were ground waters ranging in salinity from fresh to brines and seawater. We found that HTL produced more RD per unit biomass than LE, resulting in an improvement in economic efficiency of 76%. Selections constrained by production and water were concentrated along the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic coasts. Adding flue gas constraints increased the spatial distribution to include sites nationwide. The 21BGY target required ~3.8millionha of mainly forest (41.3%) and pasture (35.7%). Exclusion in favor of barren and scrub lands forced most production to the southwestern US, but with increased water consumption (5.7 times) and decreased economic efficiency (-38%). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The promotion of biofuels as energy for transportation in the industrialised countries is mainly driven by the perspective of oil depletion, concerns about energy security and global warming. Nevertheless, the production of biofuels entails emissions to the environment coming from the different stages in the product life cycle. This paper evaluates the environmental impact of pure rapeseed biodiesel (B100) production and consumption in the public transport sector, in terms of GHG emissions released by every stage in the life cycle, in order to identify proper interventions to reduce the emissions. The methodology applied to this purpose is an Attributional Life Cycle Analysis (ALCA). The Agricultural phase results to be the process that produces the highest GHG emissions, mainly because of the production and the use of nitrogen fertiliser.

AB  - The last decade has seen a rapid increase in the production and consumption of biodiesel in the EU. This development has been especially stimulated by EU policy as a means to promote energy security and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, in recent years, biodiesel production has been questioned due to the possible impact on food prices. This paper aims to explore the impact of EU biodiesel prices on diesel and rapeseed oil prices, using a Vector Error Corrections Model (VECM). Impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions are also computed in order to investigate the interrelationships within the relevant time series. Unlike the predominant literature, which mainly addresses the US and Brazilian ethanol sector, this paper focuses on the European biodiesel market. Our results suggest that biodiesel prices are mainly affected by feedstock prices, but there is no strong evidence that changes in biodiesel prices affect food prices.

AB  - Industrialized countries’ dependence on fossil fuels has been distressing for a long time for countries that do not have self-sufficiency, whether for environmental, economic, geopolitical, or other reasons. In this context, it is understood that the burning of fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) increasing the risk of intensifying climatic disturbances that can deteriorate the processes of production, consumption, and welfare in the world. Therefore, the development of alternative energy sources can provide solutions for the gaps, since reducing exposure to the vulnerability of supply and price volatility, environmental issues, and even the development of new investment opportunities in these countries. This is due to the possibility of developing innovations in the production and processing industry, which would contribute to the economic activity. Thus, increasing the use of bioenergy is one of the existing ways to reconcile the need to expand the supply of energy with the slowdown in global warming, i.e., the most important and disseminated use would be the biomass power generated by the consumption of biofuels, once it reduces GGE emissions. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - The cultivation of microalgae in wastewater leads to the removing of nutrients and at the same time, produces biomass which can be further exploited as a biofuel. At the same time, Tetraselmis sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. have a high nutritional value, and for this reason they have been widely used as a food supply in the aquaculture industry for hatchery grown herbivores. The aim of current study was to compare the biomass accumulation of two microalgae species Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis chuii cultivated in wastewater originate from recirculation aquaculture system (RA S) and explore their abilities for nitrogen and phosphorus compound removal. A bioreactor consisted of 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 250 mL of wastewater from semi closed recirculation aquaculture system. The cultures were maintained at room temperature (25-27ºC) under a fluorescent light with a light:dark photoperiod of 15 h: 9 h, with sterile air containing 2% (v/v) CO2. Optical density, chlorophyll and carotenoids were measured for the biomass evaluation for a 10 days growth period. In our study N. oculata removed 78.4% of total nitrogen and 92% of nitrate. At the end of experiment for T. chuii cultivation in wastewater, phosphorus decreased by 79%, which was by 26.7% higher, compared to that of the phosphorus removal rate of N. oculata. © 2014, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

AB  - The interest in biofuels is growing globally and the demand for bioenergy throughout the European Union will expand considerably in the following years. Numerous studies have shown that energy resulted from green plants has much to offer, as it is renewable and largely carbon-neutral compared with fossil fuel combustion. However, this is an increasingly controversial issue due to its strong impact on economy, environment and land use. Romania is one of the European Union Member States with a large biofuel production resources, owing to its high land agricultural area and good conditions for cereal and oilseed growth. There has been an increasing tendency to grow biofuels in the Romanian cultivated areas over the last decades; however, it is difficult to know if biofuel production is sustainable in this part of Europe and what impact may have unsustainable production since there is no or scientific research on this topic. The aim of this paper is to present the dynamics of biofuel crops (biodiesel) areas in Romania over the last decade, and to introduce a short review on the possible impacts on the environment, greenhouse gas emissions (GES) and land use in order to defend the need of information for our particular situation.

AB  - Over the last ten years biofuels production has increased dramatically. One of the main factors is the rise in world oil prices, coupled with heightened interest in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about energy security. The increment in production has been driven by governmental interventions. In the US, the world's largest fuel ethanol producer, strong financial incentives are guaranteed for biofuel manufacturers. While, in the European Union, the worlds largest biodiesel producer, biofuel consumption is mostly driven by blending mandates in both France and Germany. In the case of Malaysia, biodiesel started to be exported since 2006. The policy mandate of B5 blend of palm oil based biodiesel into diesel in all government vehicles was implemented in Februarv 2009. It is expected that the blend of B5 will be increased to B10 in future. This paper seeks to examine the impact of BIO on the Malaysian palm oil market. A structural econometric model consisting of eight structural equations and four identities was proposed in this study. The model has been estimated by two stage least squares method using annual data for the period 1976-2011. The specification of the structural model is based on a series of assumptions about general economic conditions, agricultural policies and technological change. The study indicates that counterfactual simulation of an increase from B5 to B10 predicts a positive increase (23.31 per cent) in palm oil domestic consumption. 109.3 per cent decrease in stock. 0.07 per cent increase in domestic price of palm oil and a marginal (0.05 percent) Increase in production. An increase in domestic demand would make Malaysia more competitive regionally and globally with benefits accruing to all Malaysians.

AB  - Anthropogenic-induced climate changes and population growth projected by 2050, combined with global economic growth driven by emerging markets, suggest that greater stress will be placed on water, food, and energy resources in the future. These resources are interdependent and are linked in a complex global network of trade. As pressures on the three resources grow, three-way interactions arise so that a solution to address scarcity in one cannot be achieved without impact on the others. The water security, food security, and energy security trilemma creates a multidimensional web that is a structurally complex network with dynamic links among resources that vary in both weight and direction. Because structure affects function, characterizing the network anatomy that links the resources in three-way interactions is helpful when setting goals to meet resource security. We argue that water plays a central role in shaping interactions and that the main scarcity issues occur with trade-offs between thermoelectric power generation and agriculture, between hydroelectric power generation and agriculture, and between biofuel production and food production. Three illustrations—the Apalachicola–Chattahoochee–Flint River Basin in the southeastern United States, the island nation of Sri Lanka, and Brazil—capture the main three-way interactions that we have identified. Although the problems that strew the path to global sustainability are massive, we suggest alternatives along both technological and nontechnological paths to meet future needs.

AB  - Widespread implementation of conservation tillage systems during cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) production in the Atlantic Coastal Plain region of the U.S. has substantially reduced erosion and sediment loss. However, the benefits of conservation tillage in these cropping systems are being threatened by weather shifts that include increased frequency of high-intensity rainfall, policies that encourage the removal of crop residues as cellulosic feedstocks for energy production, and increased herbicide resistance in weeds. Long-term integrated studies are needed to quantify potential impacts. We evaluated runoff and sediment loss from six 0.2 ha fields located on a gently sloping hillslope in a Southern Atlantic Coastal Plain landscape over ten years (2000-2009) during rotational cottonpeanut production, with a rye (Secale cereale) winter cover crop. Half of the fields were in conventional tillage (CT; inversion tillage with cover crop residue incorporation prior to planting), and half were in strip tillage (ST), which is a commonly used conservation tillage practice in the region. Fields were laid out as contrasting tillage pairs at upper, middle, and lower landscape positions and irrigated as needed. Runoff and sediment load from CT fields was significantly greater than from ST fields at each landscape position. Over the 10-year study period, mean annual total sediment load was 1823 kg ha -1 year-1 from CT fields and 237 kg ha-1 year-1 from ST fields (an 87% difference), and runoff was reduced by 41%. A soil tolerance value (T) of 2,200 kg ha-1 year-1 was exceeded in three out of ten years in CT fields and never exceeded in ST fields. On a monthly basis, extreme events (&gt;90th percentile; 10%) accounted for 61% to 72% of the 10-year total sediment load for the CT system (341 to 2,828 kg ha-1 month-1) and 73% to 84% for the ST system (49 to 593 kg ha-1 month-1). The rainfall and irrigation total was above the normal monthly rainfall in 83% of these extreme monthly periods (mean 179 mm, range 81 to 316 mm). Sediment load was greatest in summer and spring, and during cotton production. The study results improve estimates of the increase in rainfall event size tolerated by CT vs. ST cropping systems, demonstrate the benefits of conservation tillage management during cotton and peanut production, and are expected to guide management decisions that focus on reducing sediment loss in this landscape. Specifically, the results point to the use of cover crops and strip tillage as essential best management practices for this purpose.

AB  - This article investigates the transition dynamics related to Jatropha developments in Mozambique. The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The global demand for energy, particularly for transport fuels, will continue to increase significantly in the future. In addition to other options, like increased technological efficiencies, traffic reduction or modal shift, biofuels are promoted to contribute strongly to the transport sector in the years to come. Biofuels are also promoted as part of the EU strategy for decarbonising the transport sector with the aim of reducing associated GHG emissions. This paper considers some of the most important biofuels. A selection of biofuel options (biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, hydrotreated vegetable oils and fats, lignocellulosic-based fuels) were characterised by their conversion technologies and stage of development. They were analysed, concerning technical (overall efficiency), economic (investments and biofuel production costs) and environmental aspects (GHG performance). Additionally, GHG mitigation costs were calculated with regard to the GHG-based biofuel quota. © 2014, Müller Langer et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - The main objectives of the current study were to evaluate the potential effects of biochar derived from sugar cane bagasse (SC-BC) and orange peel (OP-BC) on improving the physicochemical properties of a metal smelter contaminated soil, and determining its potentiality for stabilizing Pb and As in soil. To achieve these goals, biochar was produced in a small-scale biochar producing plant, and an incubation experiment was conducted using a silt loam metal-contaminated soil treated with different application rates of biochar (0-10% w/w). The obtained results showed that, the addition of SC-BC and OP-BC increased significantly the soil aggregate stability, water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, organic matter and N-status in soil. SC-BC considerably decreased the solubility of Pb to values lower than the toxic regulatory level of the toxicity characteristics leaching procedure extraction (5mgL-1). The rise in soil pH caused by biochar application, and the increase of soil organic matter transformed the labile Pb into less available fractions i.e. "Fe-Mn oxides" and "organic" bound fractions. On the other hand, As was desorbed from Fe-Mn oxides, which resulted in greater mobility of As in the treated soil. We concluded that SC-BC and OP-BC could be used successfully for remediating soils highly contaminated with Pb. However, considerable attention should be paid when using it in soil contaminated with As. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels from microalgae are potentially important sources of liquid renewable energy. Algae are not yet produced on a large scale, but research shows promising results. This study assesses the blue water footprint (WF) and land use of algae-based biofuels. It combines the WF concept with an energy balance approach to determine the blue WF of net energy. The study considers open ponds and closed photobioreactors (PBRs). All systems have a positive energy balance, with output-input ratios ranging between 1.13 and 1.98. This study shows that the WF of algae-based biofuels lies between 8 and 193 m3/GJ net energy provided. The land use of microalgal biofuels ranges from 20 to 200 m2/GJ net energy. For a scenario in which algae-based biofuels provide 3.5% of the transportation fuels in the European Union in 2030, the system with the highest land productivity needs 17,000 km2 to produce the 850 PJ/yr. Producing all algae-based biofuels through the system with the highest water productivity would lead to a blue WF of 7 Gm3/yr, which is equivalent to 15% of the present blue WF in the EU28. A transition to algae-based transportation fuels will substantially increase competition over water and land resources. © 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Countries lacking fresh water sources such as Tunisia, must use the sea water and the non-arable lands for the culture of microalgae to produce biofuel and overcome the national energy demand. In this framework, a green microalgae CTM 20032, was isolated from the coastal solar saltern at Sfax, Tunisia and was tested for its ability to accumulate lipid under autotrophic growth condition. The isolate was identified as Dunaliella sp. on the basis of 18S rDNA analysis. The dry weight of Dunaliella sp. was composed of lipids 100 mg g-1, proteins 435 mg g-1, carbohydrates 300 mg g-1, chlorophylls 38.8 mg g-1, carotenes 18 mg g-1 and polyphenols 83 mg g-1. The lipid GC-FID analysis showed that main fatty acids are Octadecanoic acid C18:0 48%, Hexadecatrienoic acid 16:3 40% and Octadecatrienoic acid 18:3 7.5%. Nitrogen and phosphorus depletions during 6 culture days resulted in Dunaliella sp. lipid content increase up to 54 and 45% (dw) respectively. Under nitrogen starvation, Dunaliella sp. fatty acid pattern is typical of the Dunaliella genus and mainly composed of 58% of C16:0, 20.5% of C18:0 and 15% of C18:1. Whereas under phosphorus starvation, its profile of fatty acids was mainly represented by 80% of C16:0, 8.5% of C18:0 and 12.5% of C18:1. Stressful conditions drive Dunaliella sp. to accumulate up to 95% of its lipids under form of saturated and monounsaturated triglycerides form and thereby being suitable for biodiesel production.

AB  - Biofuels represent for the European Union an important energy source, and their production has been encouraged by a series of policies aimed at controlling oil prices, reaching the security of the energy supply and cutting the greenhouse gas emissions. This paper deals with the production of biofuels from the point of view of its economic sustainability and of the effects that the EU directives have had on the Italian productive context. Besides, this paper presents the outcome of an empiric study based on the economic sustainability of the production of rapeseed intended to fuel a new power plant. The study, conducted in the territory of the Viterbo Province (Italy), singles out the various types of rapeseed seeds that best adapt to the climatic-environmental features of the territory and, based on their yield and the production target of the new power plant, ascertains the land area to be reconverted or to be devoted to this type of crop. © 2014 Enrico Maria Mosconi et al.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in peatlands rely on consistently highwater tables. Anthropogenic pressures including drainage, burning, land conversion for agriculture, timber, and biofuel production, cause loss of peat-forming vegetation and exposure of previously anaerobic peat to aerobic decomposition. This can shift peatlands from net CO2 sinks to large CO2 sources, releasing carbon held for millennia. Peatlands also export significant quantities of carbon via fluvial pathways, mainly as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We analyzed radiocarbon (14C) levels of DOC in drainage water from multiple peatlands in Europe and Southeast Asia, to infer differences in the age of carbon lost from intact and drained systems. In most cases, drainage led to increased release of older carbon from the peat profile but withmarked differences related to peat type. Very low DOC-14C levels in runoff from drained tropical peatlands indicate loss of very old (centuries to millennia) stored peat carbon. High-latitude peatlands appearmore resilient to drainage; 14Cmeasurements from UK blanket bogs suggest that exported DOC remains young (&lt;50 years) despite drainage. Boreal and temperate fens and raised bogs in Finland and the Czech Republic showed intermediate sensitivity. We attribute observed differences to physical and climatic differences between peatlands, in particular, hydraulic conductivity and temperature, as well as the extent of disturbance associated with drainage, notably land use changes in the tropics. Data from the UK Peak District, an area where air pollution and intensive land management have triggered Sphagnum loss and peat erosion, suggest that additional anthropogenic pressures may trigger fluvial loss of much older (&gt;500 year) carbon in high-latitude systems. Rewetting at least partially offsets drainage effects on DOC age. © 2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are storage compounds synthesized by numerous microorganisms and have attracted the interest of industry since they are biobased and biodegradable alternatives to fossil fuel-derived plastics. Among PHAs, poly(3-hydroxypropionate) [poly(3HP)] has outstanding material characteristics and exhibits a large variety of applications. As it is not brittle like, e.g., the best-studied PHA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3HB)], it can be used as a plasticizer in blends to improve their properties. Furthermore, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is considered likely to become one of the new industrial building blocks, and it can be obtained from poly(3HP) by simple hydrolysis. Unfortunately, no natural organism is known to accumulate poly(3HP) so far. Thus, several efforts have been made to engineer genetically modified organisms capable of synthesizing the homopolymer or copolymers containing 3HP. In this review, the achievements made so far in efforts to obtain biomass which has accumulated poly(3HP) or 3HP-containing copolymers, as well as the properties of these polyesters and their applications, are compiled and evaluated. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the feasibility of utilising roadside vegetation for biogas production in Denmark. The potential biomass yield, methane yields, and the energy balances of using roadside grass for biogas production was investigated based on spatial analysis. The results show that the potential annual yield of biomass obtainable from roadside verges varies widely depending on the local conditions. The net energy gain (NEG) from harvest, collection, transport, storage and digestion of roadside vegetation was estimated to range from 60,126-121,476 GJ, corresponding to 1.5-3.0% of the present national energy production based on biogas. The estimated values for the energy return on invested energy (EROEI) was found to range from 2.17 to 2.88. The measured contents of heavy metals in the roadside vegetation was seen not to exceed the legislative levels for what can be applied as fertilizer on agricultural land, neither does it reach levels considered as inhibitory for the anaerobic fermentation process. From a practical point of view, few challenges were identified related to the acquisition and processing of the roadside vegetation. Considering the positive net energy gains, further energy investments for management of these challenges can be made. Despite the somewhat low EROEI values, the use of this resource could however result in other positive externalities, such as improved biodiversity of the verges and recycling of nutrients. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There has been little attention paid to Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) as a mechanism for bioenergy crop tolerance to water limitation, in part, because potential yields of CAM plants have been assumed to be lower than those of most commonly studied bioenergy crops. The photochemical efficiency, water-use efficiency (WUE), biomass production, and fuel yield potentials of CAM, C3, and C4 plants that are considered or already in use for bioenergy are reviewed here. The theoretical photosynthetic efficiency of CAM plants can be similar to or greater than other photosynthetic pathways. In arid conditions, the greater WUE of CAM species results in theoretical biomass yield potentials that are 147% greater than C4 species. The realized yields of CAM plants are similar to the theoretical yields that account for water-limiting conditions. CAM plants can potentially be viable commercial bioenergy crops, but additional direct yield measurements from field trials of CAM species are still needed. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol based on agricultural residues is a potential alternative to fossil fuel. This new alternative is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) compared to the current fossil fuel used for transportation. Many countries have legislated a renewable fuel standard (RFS) with biofuel blending regulations for transportation fuel. The aim of this study is to estimate the potential quantity of rice straw and ethanol production with the associated cost and CO2-equivalent GHGs. It also examines the environmental implications of the RFS considering all stages from cradle to gate, including rice straw collection and ethanol distribution. The available production of rice straw ethanol is about 1.2 billion L considering the current demand, which can achieve the 5% ethanol blended gasoline (E5) standard in South Korea. The optimum cost for ethanol from rice straw is expected to be 0.956 US$ L-1 with 6,000 Mg d-1 by constructing two biorefineries in Dangjin and Gwangju. Domestic ethanol from rice straw can reduce CO2-equivalent GHGs to 2,614 g L-1 (90.6%), and imported ethanol from Brazil can reduce CO2-equivalent GHGs to 1,907 g L-1 (66.1%) compared to conventional gasoline (2,885 g of CO2-equivalent GHGs L-1). Considering the amount of expected displacement for current domestic gasoline, the potential GHG reduction can be 1.0 million Mg of CO2-equivalent GHGs per year, and the blended fuel price (1.864 US$ L-1) would be similar to that of conventional gasoline (1.870 US$ L-1) with E5. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The demand for energy alternatives to oil are increasing global biofuel production and, consequently, the biofuel crops cultivation. In Brazil, the emergence of flex-fuel vehicles resumed the importance of ethanol production, resulting in a new phase of Brazilian sugar cane crop expansion. Several issues related to the sustainability of biofuel production have been discussed in the literature, such as the effect on food production and food security, the environmental impact of land use change and social effects in the field. This study aims to analyze the land use change in the Oeste Paulista region, caused by the expansion of sugar cane cultivation. Between 2003 and 2012, the Oeste Paulista region represented more than half of the expansion of this crop in São Paulo state, the largest producer in Brazil. This paper used the Shift-Share model to decompose the agricultural areas variation and to calculate the replacement of the main activities analyzed. The results revealed that, in the analyzed region, the expansion of sugar cane area has occurred predominantly by replacing pasture and, consequently, by cattle activity. © 2014, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - World energy demand is expected to continue increasing in the coming years. This situation has created a worldwide pressure for the development of alternative fuel and energy sources, pursuing a more environmentally friendly usage of biofuels. The EU has the target of generating 20% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. Member States have different individual targets to meet this overall target. Meanwhile in the United States, there are about 750 million acres [300 million hectares] of forestland, with slightly more than two-thirds classified as timberland or land capable of producing 20 cubic feet per acre [1.4 m3 per hectare] annually of roundwood. Given these circumstances, this research aimed to understand the U.S. opportunities to export woody biomass based on the targets that the European Union has imposed to its Member States. The data collected allowed several scenario developments by identifying the possible EU's biomass deficits and U.S.'s capacity to supply the gaps. Considering the physical availability, the U.S. would be able to satisfy between 42 and 48% depending on the energy efficiency scenario. Nevertheless, when considering reasonable biomass prices, only a small portion of the EU demand could be covered by the U.S.

AB  - Microbial communities that deconstruct plant biomass have broad relevance in biofuel production and global carbon cycling. Biomass pretreatments reduce plant biomass recalcitrance for increased efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. We exploited these chemical pretreatments to study how thermophilic bacterial consortia adapt to deconstruct switchgrass (SG) biomass of various compositions. Microbial communities were adapted to untreated, ammonium fiber expansion (AFEX)-pretreated, and ionicliquid (IL)-pretreated SG under aerobic, thermophilic conditions using green waste compost as the inoculum to study biomass deconstruction by microbial consortia. After microbial cultivation, gravimetric analysis of the residual biomass demonstrated that both AFEX and IL pretreatment enhanced the deconstruction of the SG biomass approximately 2-fold. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) experiments and acetyl bromide-reactive-lignin analysis indicated that polysaccharide hydrolysis was the dominant process occurring during microbial biomass deconstruction, and lignin remaining in the residual biomass was largely unmodified. Small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene amplicon libraries revealed that although the dominant taxa across these chemical pretreatments were consistently represented by members of the Firmicutes, the Bacteroidetes, and Deinococcus- Thermus, the abundance of selected operational taxonomic units (OTUs) varied, suggesting adaptations to the different substrates. Combining the observations of differences in the community structure and the chemical and physical structure of the biomass, we hypothesize specific roles for individual community members in biomass deconstruction. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Germany is required by European Union legislation to achieve a 10% mixture of renewable energy in all road transport fuels by the year 2020. This paper intends to quantify the water use impacts of Germany's compliance with the transport fuel goal of the EU Renewables Directive. Although the stated purpose of this Directive is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector and address energy security concerns, a more encompassing analysis considering sustainable development paths must include other environmental impacts, including water resource use. The water footprint indicator can contribute to a more intelligent environmental analysis of biofuel targets, although it alone cannot attest to the sustainability of human water use. This research builds upon the results of a similar study that aimed to quantify the freshwater impacts of meeting this EU transport fuel goal across Member States. By looking more closely at the case of Germany, country-specific data can be used in the analysis that lead to different results than those reached in the previous study. Results indicate that achieving a 10% mixture of biofuels in the road transport sector could lead to a 64% increase in the water footprint of the transport fuel sector when compared to a baseline scenario of no policy implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel plantations have been hyped as a means to reinvigorate Africa's rural areas. Yet there is still apprehension about the negative environmental and social impacts of large-scale commercial biofuel production around rising food prices, land grabbing, ecological damage, and disruption of rural livelihoods. Given the extent of Jatropha curcas production in Ghana and Ethiopia and Castor bean (Ricinus communis) in Ethiopia, this paper presents the results of a study that assessed the socio-economic implications of industrial Jatropha plantations on local livelihoods in Ghana, and of industrial Jatropha and Castor plantations on local livelihoods in Ethiopia. This study used primary data collected from 234 households in Ghana and 165 in Ethiopia. The cultivation of Jatropha and Castor has had several important effects on local livelihoods in the study sites, most notably decreases in household landholdings due to the arrival of industrial Jatropha or Castor plantations; and the resulting changes these plantations have caused in household socio-economic status, food security, fallow periods, and fodder availability. We consider how a lack of meaningful consultation between local people, their traditional authorities and the biofuel company managers, along with shortcomings in each country's broader land acquisition process and poor land use information, may have contributed to these overall negative effects on local livelihoods. We conclude by suggesting several ways that emerging biofuel industries could be improved from the perspective of local people and their livelihoods. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Cellulosic waste represents a significant and underutilized carbon source for the biofuel industry. Owing to the recalcitrance of crystalline cellulose to enzymatic degradation, it is necessary to design economical methods of liberating the fermentable sugars required for bioethanol production. One route towards unlocking the potential of cellulosic waste lies in a highly complex class of molecular machines, the cellulosomes. Secreted mainly by anaerobic bacteria, cellulosomes are structurally diverse, cell surface-bound protein assemblies that can contain dozens of catalytic components. The key feature of the cellulosome is its modularity, facilitated by the ultra-high affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction. Due to the enormous number of cohesin and dockerin modules found in a typical cellulolytic organism, a major bottleneck in understanding the biology of cellulosomics is the purification of each cohesin- and dockerin-containing component, prior to analyses of their interaction. As opposed to previous approaches, the present study utilized proteins contained in unpurified whole-cell extracts. This strategy was made possible due to an experimental design that allowed for the relevant proteins to be "purified" via targeted affinity interactions as a function of the binding assay. The approach thus represents a new strategy, appropriate for future medium- to high-throughput screening of whole genomes, to determine the interactions between cohesins and dockerins.We have selected the cellulosome of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus for this work due to its exceptionally complex cellulosome systems and intriguing diversity of its cellulosomal modular components. Containing 41 cohesins and 143 dockerins, A. cellulolyticus has one of the largest number of potential cohesin-dockerin interactions of any organism, and contains unusual and novel cellulosomal features.We have surveyed a representative library of cohesin and dockerin modules spanning the cellulosome's total cohesin and dockerin sequence diversity, emphasizing the testing of unusual and previously-unknown protein modules. The screen revealed several novel cell-bound cellulosome architectures, thus expanding on those previously known, as well as soluble cellulose systems that are not bound to the bacterial cell surface. This study sets the stage for screening the entire complement of cellulosomal components from A. cellulolyticus and other organisms with large cellulosome systems. The knowledge gained by such efforts brings us closer to understanding the exceptional catalytic abilities of cellulosomes and will allow the use of novel cellulosomal components in artificial assemblies and in enzyme cocktails for sustainable energy-related research programs. © 2014 Hamberg et al.

AB  - Incorporation of dedicated herbaceous energy crops into row crop landscapes is a promising means to supply an expanding biofuel industry while benefiting soil and water quality and increasing biodiversity. Despite these positive traits, energy crops remain largely unaccepted due to concerns over their practicality and cost of implementation. This paper presents a case study for Hardin County, Iowa, to demonstrate how subfield decision making can be used to target candidate areas for conversion to energy crop production. Estimates of variability in row crop production at a subfield level are used to model the economic performance of corn (Zea mays L.) grain and the environmental impacts of corn stover collection using the Landscape Environmental Analysis Framework (LEAF). The strategy used in the case study integrates switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) into subfield landscape positions where corn grain is modeled to return a net economic loss. Results show that switchgrass integration has the potential to increase sustainable biomass production from 48% to 99% (depending on the rigor of conservation practices applied to corn stover collection), while also improving field level profitability of corn. Candidate land area is highly sensitive to grain price (0.18 to 0.26 $·kg-1) and dependent on the acceptable subfield net loss for corn production (ranging from 0 to -1000 $·ha-1) and the ability of switchgrass production to meet or exceed this return. This work presents the case that switchgrass may be economically incorporated into row crop landscapes when management decisions are applied at a subfield scale within field areas modeled to have a negative net profit with current management practices. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The sugarcane industry in Brazil has been considered promising for the production of advanced fuels and bio-based products. However, the sugarcane crop requires high volumes of fossil fuel for cultivation and transport. The use of biodiesel as a diesel substitute could reduce the environmental burdens associated with this high consumption. This work performed a stochastic evaluation of the environmental and economic implications of the integrated production of sugarcane bioethanol and soybean biodiesel, in comparison with the traditional sugarcane-to-ethanol process. The analysis was focused on the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso and São Paulo, where this integration would be particularly attractive. The environmental aspects addressed were the fossil energy use and the GHG emissions in a cradle-to-gate approach. The economic analysis comprised the evaluation of the net present value of an incremental cash flow generated by the soybean production and by the adjacent plants of oil extraction and biodiesel. Results indicate that the integrated system is likely to improve the ethanol environmental performance, especially with regard to the fossil energy use. The integration is economically feasible but highly uncertain; however, it could be significantly improved through fiscal incentives to biodiesel producers, founded on the reduction of fossil energy use and on improvements in logistics. In addition, the proposed model may also assist in the design of other integrated systems applied to the sugarcane sector in Brazil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate the sustainability, in terms of greenhouse gases emission saving, of a new potential bio-ethanol production chain in comparison with the most common ones. The innovation consists of producing bio-ethanol from different types of no-food grapes, while usually bio-ethanol is obtained from matrices taken away from crop for food destination: sugar cane, corn, wheat, sugar beet. In the past, breeding programs were conducted with the aim of improving grapevine characteristics, a large number of hybrid vine varieties were produced and are nowadays present in the Viticulture Research Centre (CRA-VIT) Germplasm Collection. Some of them are potentially interesting for bio-energy production because of their high production of sugar, good resistance to diseases, and ability to grow in marginal lands. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of grape ethanol energy chain was performed following two different methods: i) using the spreadsheet BioGrace, developed within the Intelligent Energy Europe program to support and to ease the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC implementation; ii) using a dedicated LCA software. Emissions were expressed in CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). These two tools gave very similar results. The overall emissions impact of ethanol production from grapes on average is about 33 g CO2eq MJ-1 of ethanol if prunings are used for steam production and 53 g CO2eq MJ-1 of ethanol if methane is used. The comparison with other bio-energy chains points out that the production of ethanol using grapes represents an intermediate situation in terms of general emissions among the different production chains. The results showed that the sustainability limits provided by the normative are respected to this day. On the contrary, from 2017 this production will be sustainable only if the transformation processes will be performed using renewable sources of energy. © E.

AB  - Background: Members of the thermophilic, anaerobic Gram-positive bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor grow optimally at 65 to 78°C and degrade lignocellulosic biomass without conventional pretreatment. Decomposition of complex cell wall polysaccharides is a major bottleneck in the conversion of plant biomass to biofuels and chemicals, and conventional biomass pretreatment includes exposure to high temperatures, acids, or bases as well as enzymatic digestion. Members of this genus contain a variety of glycosyl hydrolases, pectinases, and xylanases, but the contribution of these individual enzymes to biomass deconstruction is largely unknown. C. hydrothermalis is of special interest because it is the least cellulolytic of all the Caldicellulosiruptor species so far characterized, making it an ideal naïve system to study key cellulolytic enzymes from these bacteria. Results: To develop methods for genetic manipulation of C. hydrothermalis, we selected a spontaneous deletion of pyrF, a gene in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, resulting in a strain that was a uracil auxotroph resistant to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). This strain allowed the selection of prototrophic transformants with either replicating or non-replicating plasmids containing the wild-type pyrF gene. Counter-selection of the pyrF wild-type allele on non-replicating vectors allowed the construction of chromosomal deletions. To eliminate integration of the non-replicating plasmid at the pyrF locus in the C. hydrothermalis chromosome, we used the non-homologous Clostridium thermocellum wild-type pyrF allele to complement the C. hydrothermalis pyrF deletion. The autonomously replicating shuttle vector was maintained at 25 to 115 copies per chromosome. Deletion of the ChyI restriction enzyme in C. hydrothermalis increased the transformation efficiency by an order of magnitude and demonstrated the ability to construct deletions and insertions in the genome of this new host. Conclusions: The use of C. hydrothermalis as a host for homologous and heterologous expression of enzymes important for biomass deconstruction will enable the identification of enzymes that contribute to the special ability of these bacteria to degrade complex lignocellulosic substrates as well as facilitate the construction of strains to improve and extend their substrate utilization capabilities. © 2014 Groom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels have raised controversy regarding their environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The complexity of biofuel decisions and investments by both industry and society requires integration of scientific knowledge, public information, and values from a diversity of sources. Environmental assessments can identify multiple impacts of different options. Open and collaborative knowledge creation can support decisions in two ways: by building trust and credibility and by developing more robust understanding of key issues. Open assessment is a decision-support method that allows widespread participation in a transparent and freely accessible process. In this article, we evaluate two open assessment case studies concerning biodiesel production. The evaluation compiles the participants’ views regarding the potential of the assessment process to influence decisions in terms of quality of content, applicability, efficiency, and openness. According to the evaluation, openness can be feasibly implemented and is much appreciated by participants. More experience using broad and active participation is needed for further development of methods and tools. However, the currently common practices of closed and disengaged processes limit decision making. In addition, suitable tools and practices, as well as the inclusion of participants with appropriate skills, are needed to facilitate open collaboration. © 2014 ProQuest.

AB  - Biodiesel is the most used biofuel, but a large scale production requires processes which have an economic competitiveness and a low environmental impact. Microalgae easily provide oil to converted into biodiesel: they can be cultivated on non-arable land and, thus, contribute to CO2 mitigation. The major economic concern depends on the oil extraction process: oil extraction by ionic liquids is one of the most convenient and environmental-friendly processes for biodiesel production, promising to be the benchmark for upcoming biodiesel production in large scale plants. The novelty of this work lies in the process simulation of oil extraction using ionic liquids, implemented by Aspen HYSYS V7.3, a professional tool which is commonly used for the industrial process design, simulation, setting and control. The application of such tools could foster the large scale application of innovative technologies, largely reducing the time required to transform a concept design into an industrial productive application..

AB  - We are faced with the problem of energy/carbon dioxide (CO2) in the coming decades. Microalgae has been considered as one of the most promising biomass feedstocks for the production of biofuels. Meanwhile, the productivity of these photosynthetic microorganisms in converting CO2 into carbon-rich lipids, which are only a step or two away from biodiesel, significantly exceed that of agricultural crops without competing for arable land. Worldwide, research and demonstration programs are being carried out to develop the technologies required to expand algal lipid production from a craft to a major industrial process. This paper describes the recent advances on microalgae used for biofuel (e.g., biohydrogen, biodiesel and bioethanol) production, including their cultivation, harvesting, and processing. In addition, the various aspects associated with the design of microalgae production units are described, providing an overview of the current state of the development of algae cultivation systems (photobioreactors and open ponds). Algal cultivation systems integrated with algae-based biorefineries could yield diverse bioresources, such as biodiesel, green gasoline, bio-jet fuel, isolated proteins, food starches, textiles, organic fertilizers, which can mitigate the costs of biofuel production. Algae cultivation becomes a closed-loop engineered ecosystem by utilizing the energy, nutrients and CO2 held within residual waste materials to provide all necessary inputs except sunlight. Consequently, developing this biotechnology is a tangible step towards a waste-free sustainable society. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

AB  - Providing food and other products to a growing human population while safeguarding natural ecosystems and the provision of their services is a significant scientific, social and political challenge. With food demand likely to double over the next four decades, anthropization is already driving climate change and is the principal force behind species extinction, among other environmental impacts. The sustainable intensification of production on current agricultural lands has been suggested as a key solution to the competition for land between agriculture and natural ecosystems. However, few investigations have shown the extent to which these lands can meet projected demands while considering biophysical constraints. Here we investigate the improved use of existing agricultural lands and present insights into avoiding future competition for land. We focus on Brazil, a country projected to experience the largest increase in agricultural production over the next four decades and the richest nation in terrestrial carbon and biodiversity. Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil's 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32-34% of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49-52% of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems. As a result up to 14.3Gt CO2 Eq could be mitigated. The fact that the country poised to undergo the largest expansion of agricultural production over the coming decades can do so without further conversion of natural habitats provokes the question whether the same can be true in other regional contexts and, ultimately, at the global scale. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - In a global context in which obtaining new energy sources is of paramount importance, the production of biodiesel from plant crops is a potentially viable alternative to the use of fossil fuels. Among the species used to produce the raw material for biodiesel, Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) has enjoyed increased popularity in recent years, due partly to its ability to grow in degraded zones and under arid and semi-arid conditions. The present study evaluates the potential for JCL production under irrigation with non-conventional water resources in abandoned agricultural soils of the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), which is one of the most arid parts of the European Union. JCL growth and productivity are compared during the first 39 months of cultivation in two soil types (clay-loam and sandy-loam) and with two irrigation water qualities: recycled urban wastewater (RWW) and desalinated brackish water (DBW). The results indicate that JCL growth (in terms of plant height and stem diameter) was significantly influenced both by soil type and water quality, with better development observed in the sandy-loam soil under RWW irrigation. Productivity, measured as cumulative seed production, was not affected by soil type but was affected by water quality. Production under RWW irrigation was approximately seven times greater than with DBW (mean ~2142 vs. 322 kg · ha-1). The higher nutrient content, especially P, K and Mg, and lower B content of the RWW were found to be key factors in the greater productivity observed under irrigation with this type of water. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - On an uranium-mining-influenced area, sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) were grown on a small-scaled plot. Subsamples of sunflowers were harvested 34, 66, 96, 108, 140, and 170 days after sowing. Contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Th, U, Zn, and rare earth elements (REEs, La-Lu) were determined in the sunflower shoots, as well as total and bioavailable contents of these 25 elements in the soil taken on the day of sowing and after the last harvest. Shoot contents alone were not sufficient to evaluate the extraction capacity of the sunflowers. Instead total extracted masses (product of biomass and element content) had to be calculated. The total extracted mass increased for most of the elements until 140 days after sowing. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) as ratio between element content in shoot and soil, were calculated for this time to evaluate the phytoextraction efficiency. BCFs ≥1 (relating total soil contents) and thus a very effective extraction was calculated for Cd. The BCFs, based on mobile soil contents, were ≥1 for all elements, except for U and REEs (La-Lu). Consequently, the sunflower is able to extract many elements effectively from the direct harmful soil fraction. To reduce the contents of Cd and Ni down to levels, where the mining-influenced area could be classified as arable land would require 55 and 207 sunflower growth cycles. Although this is quite a long time, the uranium-mining-influenced area could be successively remediated, while growing biofuel crops, without interfering with food production. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Switchgrass is a perennial crop producing high amounts of biomass for good quality pellet production. The objective of this study is to examine the efficiency of different cultural practices of switchgrass for pellet production under field conditions for four different N-fertilization (0, 80, 160 and 240kgha-1) and two different irrigation levels (0 and 250mm), in two soils in central Greece with rather different moisture status over the period 2009-2012. Moreover, comparison between three harvest methods (two different types of bales and silage) was made. The results derived from this study revealed that the bale at 22kg is the harvesting practice with the highest costs while there was reduction of efficiency scores when nitrogen levels increased. At both environments the efficiency scores followed the same trend, confirming that low levels of nitrogen fertilization enhance the economic competitiveness of switchgrass production. Palamas site is the area where switchgrass for pellet production had positive income ranging from 400 to 1600€ha-1, while Velestino site had always negative. Therefore, places like Velestino with non-aquic soil should be avoided for switchgrass. These data suggest that growing switchgrass for solid biofuel production as energy crop is a worthwhile decision only in areas with a moderately shallow groundwater table (aquic soil) or maybe in high precipitation regions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Four lipid extraction methods (Bligh & Dyer, hexane & isopropanol, dichloromethane & methanol, and hexane) were evaluated to extract lipid from freeze- and oven-dried fungus Mortierella isabellina ATCC42613. The highest lipid yield (41.8%) was obtained from Bligh & Dyer extraction on the oven-dried fungal biomass with a methanol:chloroform:water ratio of 2:1:0.8. Other lipid extraction methods on both freeze- and oven-dried samples had lipid yields ranging from 20.7% to 35.9%. Non-polar lipid was the main lipid class (more than 90% of total lipid) in M. isabellina. Regarding fatty acid profile, there was no significant difference on fatty acid concentration between different drying and extraction methods. Estimation of biodiesel fuel properties using correlative models further demonstrated that the fungal biodiesel is a good alternative to fossil diesel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgal bioenergy systems are gaining attention as a commercial biotechnical platform for producing renewable transportation fuels. In recent years, process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) has been extensively applied to understand the life cycle environmental impacts of emerging microalgal biofuel systems. However, conventional process-based LCA fails to account for the role of ecological goods and services within fuel and product life cycles. Additionally, traditional life cycle energy analysis suffers from several limitations such as ignoring the difference in quality and substitutability of resources, and accounting for only the first law of thermodynamics. To address these shortcomings, a hybrid Ecologically based-LCA (EcoLCA) model is developed to quantify the contribution of ecological resources within the algae-to-fuel supply chain and to compare the resource intensity of producing microalgal derived renewable diesel (RD) to that of petroleum diesel (PD). Multiple thermodynamic return on investment (ROI) metrics and performance indicators are used to quantify the consumption of ecological goods and services, environmental impacts, and resource intensity of producing microalgal RD. Results indicate that the quality corrected thermodynamic return on investment and renewability index for microalgal RD ranges from 0.17 to 0.44 and 3.51% to 6.36% respectively, depending on the choice of coproduct options and processing technologies. This work reveals that algae-to-fuel systems are highly dependent on non-renewable ecological resources reflected in their low renewability index; have a low quality corrected thermodynamic ROI (<1) and thus are not energetically viable; and are more ecologically resource intensive as compared to their petroleum equivalent - potentially negating their environmental benefits. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

AB  - Cellulosic biomass is an abundant and promising energy source. To make cellulosic biofuels competitive against conventional fuels, conversion of rigid plant materials into sugars must become efficient and cost-effective. During cellulose degradation, cellulolytic enzymes generate cellobiose (β-(1→4)-glucose dimer) molecules, which in turn inhibit such enzymes by negative feedback. β-Glucosidases (BGLs) cleave cellobiose into glucose monomers, assisting overall cellulolytic activities. Therefore, BGLs are essential for efficient conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels, and it is important to characterize newly isolated BGLs for useful traits. Here, we report our discovery that the indigenous Taiwanese fungus Chaetomella raphigera strain D2 produces two molecular weight variants of a single BGL, D2-BGL (shortened to "D2"), which differ in O-glycosylation. The more extensively O-glycosylated form of native D2 (nD2L) has increased activity toward the natural substrate, cellobiose, compared to the less O-glycosylated form (nD2S). nD2L is more stable at 60°C, in acidic pH, and in the presence of the ionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate than nD2S. Furthermore, unlike nD2S, nD2L does not display substrate inhibition by an artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl glucopyranoside (pNPG), and the glucose feedback inhibition kinetics of nD2L is competitive (while it is non-competitive for nD2S), suggesting that these two glycovariants of D2 bind substrates differently. Interestingly, D2 produced in a heterologous system, Pichia pastoris, closely mimics properties of nD2S. Our studies suggest that O-glycosylation of D2 is important in determining its catalytic and biochemical properties. © 2014 Yoneda et al.

AB  - The global transition from fossil fuel-based energy sources to renewable energy sources will be most effective, for at least the near future, by utilizing local resources and existing infrastructure. In many areas of the eastern United States, forest residue is abundant and can be used in existing facilities to supplement coal in coal-fired power plants. Thus forest residue has potential as a renewable energy source that could be effectively utilized in the near future. This study uses GIS to estimate the potential quantity of forest residue available for use in coal-fired power plants in the eastern United States. Transportation costs limit the distance over which it is feasible to transport forest residue to the power plants and these costs may fluctuate depending on economic conditions. Thus, we consider three scenarios in our analysis assuming the maximum feasible transport distances to be 60, 80, and 100 km. In the eastern U.S., the total annual forest residue available to coal plants is approximately 29.4, 40.2, and 48.2 million dry tons, respectively, for maximum transport distances of 60, 80, and 100 km. Assuming an 80 km transport distance, forest residue has the potential to reduce coal consumption by 22.3 million tons per year. Under this scenario, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by almost 58.1 million tons per year, and NOx and SOx emissions would be reduced by 69.3 and 122.6 thousand tons respectively. This analysis suggests that by offsetting coal use, forest residue has the potential to substantially reduce power plant emissions.

AB  - Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in existing managed pine (Pinus spp.) forests potentially can produce a biofuel feedstock without encumbering additional arable land. However, it is not clear how intercropping, which changes understory vegetation composition and structure, may influence rodent communities. Therefore, as part of a broader effort to examine ecological sustainability of an intercropping management system, we investigated whether intercropping switchgrass in intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands affected rodent community structure and population demographics in a managed forest landscape. We conducted seven live-trapping sessions during June-August 2012 on three intensively managed pine stands (control) and three intensively managed pine stands intercropped with switchgrass (treatment). Pine stands intercropped with switchgrass had lower rodent community evenness (P=0.02) and diversity (P=0.03) than control stands primarily because of greater hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) abundance in intercropped stands (P=0.02). However, there was no treatment effect on cotton rat survival or recruitment. Our results suggest the switchgrass intercropping system in our study influenced rodent community structure via effects on hispid cotton rats during the early successional stage of a loblolly pine stand. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Residues from oranges' plantations and processing may play an important role as biofuels for heat and power production in Mediterranean countries. The management of ashes produced during combustion is a great issue for the energy sector. Ash quality from lab-scale fluidized bed tests of these residues was evaluated in terms of operational parameters, environmental impact and potential uses with respect to legislative restrictions. Bottom and fly ashes were characterized by mineralogical, chemical, particle size distribution and thermal analyses, at different excess air ratios, fuel feed rates and fuel mixing ratios. The results showed that fly ashes were rich in Ca, K, P and Sr minerals. Slagging/fouling potential of pruning was very low, however that of peels and leaves was significant. The effect of excess air ratio or fuel feed rate on the quality of ashes was small. In the case of blends, the composition of the ashes varied between those of the blend components. Fly ashes of orange tree residues could be utilized as soil amendment agents, secondary building materials, or for road construction. Their environmental impact upon land recycling or management strategies is expected to be very low. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha's potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Large-scale land acquisition in Africa has been the concern and the focus of growing global literature on land grabbing. The upswing in biofuel investments in Ghana led to large-scale land acquisitions by the private sector presided over by chiefs. This research investigates how chiefs, in playing their traditional roles in the acquisition of land and as arbitrators, were, in most instances, the cause and the solution to the ensuing conflicts in the various communities. Data was collected through interviews, use of questionnaires and focus group discussions. Some of the conflict issues include loss of farmlands or other communal lands, disagreements on the land acquisition processes, the quantum and mode of execution of compensation payments and the existence or contents of social responsibility agreements. Furthermore, the use of negotiation, mediation and courts by people in these communities relative to arbitration by chiefs is increasing. The Government of Ghana needs to strengthen the public sector land institutions and put in place stronger and binding mechanisms for resolving disputes arising from large-scale acquisitions of land to cushion the effect of the weakening confidence in the chieftaincy institution. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents results from comprehensive field surveys of jatropha projects in Mozambique, Tanzania and Mali in 2012. The article singles out the salient economic and social impact results and derives lessons. The results clearly demonstrate the weak business case for jatropha biofuel production at this time. Plantations were found to be unviable because of insurmountable up-front capital requirements in combination with slow and unreliable crop maturation, inefficient oil pressing owing to a lack of scale and experience, inadequate utilization of by-products, and competitively-priced fossil diesel and palm oil. For smallholders, jatropha only has limited value as a hedge crop in environmentally and economically disadvantaged areas. Better prospects have to wait for the advent of improved jatropha varieties. Social impacts from the perspective of project managers were rather mixed: overall, food security perceptions were positive and no massive forced human displacements were noted so far, though some disputes over land access and compensation were reported. Labor legislation was apparently respected on plantations, and positive gender effects, regional income/employment effects and better public facilities were also reported. The projects generated considerable employment, albeit mostly of a temporary nature, as lack of economic viability had caused many projects to close down again. When introducing next-generation biofuel projects, bettermonitoring by various actor groups is recommended, as well as long-term investment plans that include integral exit strategies. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Methylglucuronoarabinoxylan (MeGAXn) from agricultural residues and energy crops is a significant yet underutilized biomass resource for production of biofuels and chemicals. Mild thermochemical pretreatment of bagasse yields MeGAXn requiring saccharifying enzymes for conversion to fermentable sugars. A xylanolytic bacterium, Paenibacillus sp. strain JDR-2, produces an extracellular cell-associated GH10 endoxylanse (XynA1) which efficiently depolymerizes methylglucuronoxylan (MeGAXn) from hardwoods coupled with assimilation of oligosaccharides for further processing by intracellular GH67 α-glucuronidase, GH10 endoxylanase, and GH43 β-xylosidase. This process has been ascribed to genes that comprise a xylan utilization regulon that encodes XynA1 and includes a gene cluster encoding transcriptional regulators, ABC transporters, and intracellular enzymes that convert assimilated oligosaccharides to fermentable sugars. Here we show that Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 utilized MeGAXn without accumulation of oligosaccharides in the medium. The Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 growth rate on MeGAXn was 3.1-fold greater than that on oligosaccharides generated from MeGAXn by XynA1. Candidate genes encoding GH51 arabinofuranosidases with potential roles were identified. Following growth on MeGAXn, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR identified a cluster of genes encoding a GH51 arabinofuranosidase (AbfB) and transcriptional regulators which were coordinately expressed along with the genes comprising the xylan utilization regulon. The action of XynA1 on MeGAXn generated arabinoxylobiose, arabinoxylotriose, xylobiose, xylotriose, and methylglucuronoxylotriose. Recombinant AbfB processed arabinoxylooligosaccharides to xylooligosaccharides and arabinose. MeGAXn processing by Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 may be achieved by extracellular depolymerization by XynA1 coupled to assimilation of oligosaccharides and further processing by intracellular enzymes, including AbfB. Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 provides a GH10/GH67 system complemented with genes encoding intracellular GH51 arabinofuranosidases for efficient utilization of MeGAXn. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - This research asks and answers a question that had been avoided by all the previous research on biofuels impacts. That is, to what extent are the US and EU biofuels sustainability criteria binding in the sense that if applied, sufficient land would be available to implement the programs? In answering the question, we simulate the global land by agro-ecological zone that would be needed to supply feedstocks for the US and EU biofuel programs using an advanced version of the GTAP-BIO model. Then we estimate the global area of land that would not be available due to sustainability criteria restrictions, again by agro-ecological zone. Finally, we determine the extent to which the US and EU sustainability criteria are binding and find that they are not binding at the biofuel levels currently targeted by the US and EU. In addition, we evaluate the same question, but this time freezing global food consumption, and get the same answer-plenty of land is available to meet the targets and supply food demands. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The level of cellulolytic activity in different areas of the gut of the terrestrial slug Arion ater was assayed at different temperatures and pH values. To do this, crude gut proteins were isolated and assayed using modified dinitrosalicylic acid reducing sugar assay. Crude protein samples were also separated and cellulolytic activity identified using in gel CMC zymography and esculin hydrate activity gel assays. pH and temperature profiling revealed optimum cellulolytic activity between pH. 5.0 and 6.0 for different gut regions and retention of up to 90% of activity at temperatures up to 50. °C. Zymograms and activity gels revealed multiple endoglucanase and β-glucosidase enzymes. To further investigate the source of this cellulolytic activity bacterial isolates from the gut were tested for endoglucanase and β-glucosidase activity using growth plate assays. 12 cellulolytic microbes were identified using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. These include members of the genera Buttiauxella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia and Klebsiella. Gut metagenomic DNA was then subjected to PCR, targeting a 400. bp region of the 16SrDNA gene which was subsequently separated and individuals identified using DGGE. This identified members of the genera Citrobacter, Serratia, Pectobacterium, Acinetobacter, Mycoplasma, Pantoea and Erwinia. In summary, multiple glycoside hydrolase enzymes active over a broad range of temperature and pH values in a relatively under studied organism were detected, indicating that the gut of A. ater is a viable target for intensive study to identify novel carbohydrate active enzymes that may be used in the biofuel industry. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Growing bioenergy feedstocks can provide a long-term sustainable production system for marginal land resources and is essential for minimizing food vs. fuel competition for prime croplands. However, the term "marginal" is too often used in research reports without being defined. We here suggest that clearly specifying the biophysical factors and agroeconomic context contributing to marginality will greatly enhance the utility and comparability of published research. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Bioenergy crops may help achieve multiple energy, economic, and environmental objectives in the US Midwest, but a portfolio of crops must first be developed and tested in comparison to the current standard, maize (Zea mays L.). The nascent, but long-term and ongoing Landscape Biomass Project in Boone County, Iowa, USA examines five cropping systems including continuous maize, a modified maize-soy [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation, nurse cropped maize-switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), double-cropped triticale (Triticosecale × Whit.)/sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), and intercropped triticale-aspen (Crandon [Populus alba × Populus grandidentata]) over an elevation gradient. Here, we report perennial establishment and crop productivity across five landscape positions during the first 4 years (2009-2012) of this experiment. Perennials (switchgrass and aspen) established successfully across the gradient with minimal effect of landscape position. Continuous maize had the highest biomass yields both within and over growing seasons, but they declined over time. In comparison, the diversified and perennial systems had lower, but stable or increasing yields over time, despite extreme weather conditions. Landscape position did not consistently influence biomass yield; its effect depended on year and cropping system. Cropping system productivity was generally consistent across the landscape within a given year with greater variability between years. Findings help explain why landscape is often disregarded in Midwestern crop management: it does not seem to substantially drive crop, and thus economic, performance in the short term. Conversely, related Landscape Biomass studies find landscape influences important ecosystem functions (e.g., soil carbon storage) and should be an integral management consideration. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Many studies have assessed the technical feasibility of producing bioenergy crops on agricultural lands. However, while it is possible to produce large quantities of agricultural biomass for bioenergy from lignocellulosic feedstocks, very few of these studies have assessed farmers' willingness to produce these crops under different contracting arrangements. The purpose of this paper is to examine farmers' willingness to produce alternative cellulosic biofuel feedstocks under different contractual, market, and harvesting arrangements. This is accomplished by using enumerated field surveys in Kansas with stated choice experiments eliciting farmers' willingness to produce corn stover, sweet sorghum, and switchgrass under different contractual conditions. Using a random utility framework to model the farmers' decisions, the paper examines the contractual attributes that will most likely increase the likelihood of feedstock enterprise adoption. Results indicate that net returns above the next best alternative use of the land, contract length, cost share, financial incentives, insurance, and custom harvest options are all important contract attributes. Farmers' willingness to adopt and their willingness-to-pay for alternative contract attributes vary by region and choice of feedstock. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Since terrestrial biomass-based ethanol has environmental and economic vulnerability, seaweed-based bioethanol is emerging as a new biofuel. To investigate the sustainability of seaweeds as bioethanol feedstock, this study quantitatively assesses the energy, freshwater, and fertilizer requirements; land-related carbon balance; and bioethanol productivity of seaweed biomass through comparison with terrestrial biomass. Also, the metal resource potential of seaweeds is assessed because valuable metals can be recovered from seaweed fermentation residue. Compared to corn grain and stover, seaweeds exhibit competitive energy requirements and ethanol productivity. Seaweed cultivation does not incur carbon debt derived from land use change and requires less freshwater than corn grain but more than switchgrass in cultivation and fermentation. Seaweed cultivation also does not require fertilizer application despite the high content of nitrogen and phosphorus. Seaweeds exhibit high resource potential for gold and silver. Therefore, seaweed biomass has high potential as a sustainable bioethanol feedstock. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The paper estimates the potential contribution of Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus) and short rotation coppice (SRC; in Great Britain often willow and poplar species, e.g. Salix. viminalis L. x S. viminalis var Joruun) to the heat and electricity needs in Great Britain to 2050 under climate change, using a model system which is composed of a partial equilibrium model and two process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models. If the whole available area of land suitable for Miscanthus and SRC of 8 Mha is considered, results show that the contribution of Miscanthus and SRC to the heat and electricity supply would be significant. Under the projected climate and an imposed energy policy to 2050, the potential contribution would range from 139, 291 GWh to 230, 605 GWh for heat and from 112, 481 GWh to 127, 868 GWh for electricity by 2050. This would provide over 60 % of total heat and electricity needs in Great Britain. Using realistic implementation scenarios on just 0.4 Mha of land, Miscanthus and SRC could still contribute more than 5 % of heat and electricity needs in Great Britain. We conclude that Miscanthus and SRC have the potential to form part of a diverse renewable energy portfolio for Great Britain. In addition to climate and energy policy, the contribution of Miscanthus and SRC to heat and electricity will be impacted by the efficiency of combined heat and power (CHP) and alternative energy crops, and the area of land eventually used for dedicated bioenergy crops. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - With many of the poor people in Brazil living in rural areas, local governments have intensified their efforts to design and implement effective policies that boost rural development. In 2004, a national program for production and use of biodiesel was launched aiming at increasing income among less endowed family farmers across the country. With expectations building on further expansion of the mandatory blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel, national and local government bodies are challenged by the search for policies able to foster biodiesel crop production through the wider cultivation of crops that produce more oil than soybean (e.g. sunflower and castor bean) and by improving the participation of less endowed farmers, especially in semi-arid regions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform an ex-ante integrated assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of four biodiesel policy scenarios towards different farm types in a semi-arid and more humid region of southeast Brazil. The applied modelling framework was a combination of a technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) and a bio-economic farm model (FSSIM). We explored the impact of market-driven (bonus price policy), input provision (fertiliser and land preparation policy) and oil production (oil mill policy) policy scenarios on soybean farmers in Chapada Gaúcha and maize/beans farmers in Montes Claros. The impacts of the different policies on farm gross margins, oil crop production, labour requirements, nitrogen losses and biocide residues were assessed against the baseline scenario. Our results indicated that the scope for biodiesel crops on smallholder, non-soybean producers in Montes Claros is less evident than in Chapada Gaúcha, particularly among the less endowed farmers for whom the increase in farm gross margin in all scenarios is limited to only 6% while oil production was 140. kg per farm, which is very low compared to the 41% increase and more than 48,000. kg of oil of soybean producers. The most effective policy scenario was the provision of inputs such as fertiliser and land preparation. Because in Montes Claros farmers have limited access to fertiliser, machinery and biocides, strategies that enable farmers to increase their cropped area (i.e. land preparation policy more than doubled the crop area) and crop yield levels (i.e. fertiliser policy almost quadrupled crop yields) have highest potential to benefit these farming systems. © 2014.

AB  - This study discussed the effects of different concentrations (0.625, 1.875 and 3.125 mM) of copper (Cu) in the form of CuSO4 on biomethane production and on the dynamics of microbial communities during the mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) of cow manure. The effects on biomethane production were found to depend on CuSO4 concentrations. After 50 days of AD, treatment A3 (3.125 mM) had lower cumulative biomethane production than the no-Cu control. The maximum value of cumulative biomethane production was detected under treatment A2 (1.875 mM). These results suggested that the stimulation or inhibition to biomethane production might be related to the concentration and chemical forms of Cu. Moreover, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was used to discuss the dynamics of microbial communities. Results revealed that different concentrations of CuSO4 had effects on the richness and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities. The predominance of Bacteroidetes bacterium (GU339485.1) was verified through the sequencing of the dominant DGGE bands. Furthermore, Bacteroidetes bacterium could be detected during the whole AD process and is adaptable to a certain concentration range of CuSO4. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - As U.S. energy policy turns to bioenergy, and second-generation biofuels in particular, to foster energy security and environmental benefits, consideration should be given to the implications of climate risk for the incipient bioenergy industry. As a case-in-point, we review evidence from the 2012 U.S. drought, underscoring the risk of extreme weather events to the agricultural sector in general, and the bioenergy supply chain in particular, including reductions in feedstock production and higher prices for agricultural commodities and biofuels. We also use a risk management framework developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to review current understanding regarding climate-related hazards, exposure, and vulnerability of the bioenergy supply chain with a particular emphasis on the growing importance of lignocellulosic feedstocks to future bioenergy development. A number of climate-related hazards are projected to become more severe in future decades, and future growth of bioenergy feedstocks is likely to occur disproportionately in regions preferentially exposed to such hazards. However, strategies and opportunities are available across the supply chain to enhance coping and adaptive capacity in response to this risk. In particular, the implications of climate change will be influenced by the expansion of cellulosic feedstocks, particularly perennial grasses and woody biomass. In addition, advancements in feedstock development, logistics, and extension provide opportunities to support the sustainable development of a robust U.S. bioenergy industry as part of a holistic energy and environmental policy. However, given the nascent state of the cellulosic biofuels industry, careful attention should be given to managing climate risk over both short- and long-time scales. © 2014.

AB  - The Illinois clone of Miscanthus×. giganteus has many traits of an ideal biomass crop, including sterility, which significantly limits invasive potential. However, this sterility necessitates vegetative propagation, a time and labor intensive process that currently challenges the crop's adoption. Traditionally propagated by rhizome segments, M.×. giganteus can also reproduce by stems like its relative, sugarcane. Previous work indicates, however, that non-traditional propagation of M.×. giganteus can affect developmental morphology of resultant plants in the field. We investigated the effect of stem propagation on developmental morphology (part I, this paper), and survival and yield (part II), of field-grown M.×. giganteus (Illinois clone) plants at three sites in Iowa, USA during the second and third year of growth. Although stem propagation affected morphology compared to traditional rhizome propagation, the differences were less pronounced than reported for hormone-aided micropropagation. Observed differences (and similarities) between stem and rhizome propagated plants were consistent between different growing environments and years, despite extreme weather. Rhizome propagated plants had larger basal circumferences (146.2. cm vs. 134.7. cm on average, P= 0.0107), but stem propagated plants had more stems per plant (38 vs. 33 on average, P= 0.0492) suggesting that these two propagation techniques result in plants with different growth strategies but may achieve similar yields. Though small, these differences persisted consistently throughout the duration of this experiment, suggesting morphological differences may be maintained over time in mature stands of M.×. giganteus. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The genus Miscanthus has great potential as a biofuel feedstock because of its high biomass, good burning quality, environmental tolerance, and good adaptability to marginal land. In this study, the genetic diversity and the relationship of 24 different natural Miscanthus sinensis populations collected from Southwestern China were analyzed by using 33 pairs of Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphism (SRAP) primers. A total of 688 bands were detected with 646 polymorphic bands, an average of 19.58 polymorphic bands per primer pair. The average percentage of polymorphic loci (P), gene diversity (H), and Shannon's diversity index (I) among the 24 populations are 70.59%, 0.2589, and 0.3836, respectively. The mean value of total gene diversity (HT) was 0.3373 ± 0.0221, while the allelic diversity within populations (H S) was 0.2589 ± 0.0136 and the allelic diversity among populations (DST) was 0.0784. The mean genetic differentiation coefficient (Gst = 0.2326) estimated from the detected 688 loci indicated that there was 76.74% genetic differentiation within the populations, which is consistent with the results from Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) analysis. Based upon population structure and phylogenetic analysis, five groups were formed and a special population with mixed ancestry was inferred indicating that human-mediated dispersal may have had a significant effect on population structure of M. sinensis. Evaluating the genetic structure and genetic diversity at morphological and molecular levels of the wild M. sinensis in Southwest China is critical to further utilize the wild M. sinensis germplasm in the breeding program. The results in this study will facilitate the biofuel feedstock breeding program and germplasm conservation. © 2014 by the authors.

The studied lipase was a low cost powdered enzyme preparation, Biolipase-R, from Biocon-Spain, a multipurpose additive used in food industry. In this respect, it is developed a study to optimize the immobilization procedure of these lipases on Sepiolite. Covalent immobilization was achieved by the development of an inorganic-organic hybrid linker formed by a functionalized hydrocarbon chain with a pendant benzaldehyde, bonded to the AlPO4 support surface. Thus, the covalent immobilization of lipases on amorphous AlPO 4/sepiolite (20/80 wt %) support was evaluated by using two different linkers (p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and benzylamine-terephthalic aldehyde, respectively). Besides, the catalytic behavior of lipases after physical adsorption on the demineralized sepiolite was also evaluated. Obtained results indicated that covalent immobilization with the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde linker gave the best biocatalytic behavior. Thus, this covalently immobilized lipase showed a remarkable stability as well as an excellent capacity of reutilization (more than five successive reuses) without a significant loss of its initial catalytic activity. This could allow a more efficient fabrication of biodiesel minimizing the glycerol waste production. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Hydrogenases are nature's efficient catalysts for both the generation of energy via oxidation of molecular hydrogen and the production of hydrogen via the reduction of protons. However, their O2 sensitivity and deactivation at high potential limit their applications in practical devices, such as fuel cells. Here, we show that the integration of an O2 -sensitive hydrogenase into a specifically designed viologen-based redox polymer protects the enzyme from O2 damage and high-potential deactivation. Electron transfer between the polymer-bound viologen moieties controls the potential applied to the active site of the hydrogenase and thus insulates the enzyme from excessive oxidative stress. Under catalytic turnover, electrons provided from the hydrogen oxidation reaction induce viologen-catalysed O 2 reduction at the polymer surface, thus providing self-activated protection from O2. The advantages of this tandem protection are demonstrated using a single-compartment biofuel cell based on an O2 -sensitive hydrogenase and H2/O2 mixed feed under anode-limiting conditions.

AB  - Growing bioenergy grasses can contribute to a great extent towards the production of biomass, and it can be a potential source of renewable energy. Such grasses, if suitable for marginal land, will solve better the problem of its competition with the cultivation of food crops in arable land. Four different potential bioenergy grasses, e.g., Saccharum arundinaceum Retz., hybrid Napier var. CO-3, Saccharum spontaneum L., and Arundo donax L. were selected based on our earlier study, and these perennial grasses were subjected to NaCl stress, a characteristic feature of marginal lands. Various measurements to assess the NaCl tolerance mechanism, e.g., MDA content, antioxidant enzyme activity, photosynthetic pigments composition, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) activities were analyzed after imparting NaCl stress and compared with the control plants. Among the grasses studied, a lower maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v/F m) and PSI and PSII activities were recorded in S. spontaneum and Napier var. CO-3 than in S. arundinaceum and A. donax. The latter two grasses showed less degradation of total chlorophyll and low MDA content. The maintenance of a better water status of A. donax and S. arundinaceum is attributed to the maintenance of favorable osmotic balance by the accumulation of the higher levels of compatible solutes, such as total soluble sugars and proline. The better performance of S. arundinaceum and A. donax under high NaCl conditions was also facilitated by the higher free radical-scavenging potential in them, as represented by the increase in peroxidase activity. These results suggest that S. arundinaceum and A. donax are better adapted to NaCl stress than S. spontaneum and Napier var. CO-3. The high NaCl tolerance potential, exhibited by S. arundinaceum and A. donax, makes them an appropriate choice for marginal lands affected by high levels of NaCl. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is an important food, feed, and biofuel crop worldwide. Its stalks are rich in sugar, largely influenced by environments and crop stage when the stalks are harvested. This study evaluated sorghum mini core collection for stalk sugar content on the basis of Brix, phenology, and agronomic traits. Accessions were first classified into five groups based on flowering to match crop phenology, which together with controls were separately grown in split-plot design in vertisol under irrigated and drought stress conditions for two postrainy seasons. The main and interaction effects were significant for most of the traits. Drought stress significantly increased the mean Brix (12.11 to 26.76%) in four of the five groups of accessions. The mean Brix increased under drought in 169 accessions, decreased in one accession, while the remaining accessions were not affected. IS 13294, 13549, 23216, 23684, 24139, 24939, and 24953 significantly recorded greater mean Brix (14.0 to 15.2%) as compared with best control, IS 33844 (12.4%), across environments. However, these accessions had lower yields and lower 100-seed weight. In contrast, IS 1004, 4698, 23891, and 28141 significantly outyielded IS 33844 by 11.7 to 22.7% and had almost the same Brix content (~13%). A hierarchical tree diagram grouped these accessions into two distinct clusters: accessions with significantly greater Brix but lower yield and those with high yield but with Brix similar to IS 33844. The grouping also separated accessions largely on the basis of geographic regions and racial classification. The identified accessions are ideal resources for the development of cultivars with bioenergy traits. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - The concept of co-production of liquid fuel (ethanol) along with animal feed on farm was proposed, and the strategy of using ambient-temperature acid pretreatment, ensiling and washing to improve ethanol production from alfalfa stems was investigated. Alfalfa stems were separated and pretreated with sulfuric acid at ambient-temperature after harvest, and following ensiling, after which the ensiled stems were subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for ethanol production. Ethanol yield was improved by ambient-temperature sulfuric acid pretreatment before ensiling, and by washing before SSF. It was theorized that the acid pretreatment at ambient temperature partially degraded hemicellulose, and altered cell wall structure, resulted in improved cellulose accessibility, whereas washing removed soluble ash in substrates which could inhibit the SSF. The pH of stored alfalfa stems can be used to predict the ethanol yield, with a correlation coefficient of +0.83 for washed alfalfa stems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interest in bioenergy crops has raised questions as to the potential of management strategies to preserve soil C pools and soil quality. Since soilsurface CO2 effluxes are a major fate of soil C, knowledge of CO2 efflux's spatial and temporal trends among bioenergy crops will facilitate advances in research on improving terrestrial C-cycle models as well as decision support tools for policy and land-Management. Our objective was to evaluate spatial and temporal dynamics of soil-Surface CO2 effluxes in bioenergy-Based corn (Zea mays L.) and reconstructed prairie systems. Systems evaluated included continuous corn (harvested for grain and 50% of the corn stover) with and without a cover crop, mixed prairies (harvested for aboveground biomass) with and without N fertilization, and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations harvested for grain. Soil-Surface CO2 effluxes, soil temperature, and soil water contents were monitored weekly from July 2008 to September 2011 and hourly during portions of 2010 and 2011. Annual soil-Surface CO2 effluxes were greater in prairies than row crops and are attributed to greater plant root respiration. Soil-Surface CO2 effluxes spatially varied among intra-crop management zones only for continuous corn with stover removal. However, the cover crop reduced CO2 efflux spatial variability 70% of the time as compared to stover removal without a cover crop. Spatial variability of effluxes was not explained by soil physical properties or conditions. Temperature-induced diurnal fluctuations of CO 2 effluxes were not evident during apparent soil-water redistribution. Further research on the mechanisms behind this process is needed followed by incorporation of mechanisms into CO2 efflux models. © Soil Science Society of America, 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison WI 53711 USA.

AB  - At the 2010 negotiations of the Conference of the Parties (COP10) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for a decision on biofuels and biodiversity, biofuels were portrayed as holding many different, conflicting characteristics. Using Callon's (1986) concept of translation, we find that the COP10 biofuel negotiations failed to advance beyond the first moment of translation, problematization, when actors are defined in relation to each other. We trace attempts by various actors to fix the identity of biofuels throughout the negotiations, using strategies such as rendering political issues "technical," relying on formal text to stabilize contested identities, and restricting the sources of knowledge relied upon. We suggest that the CBD parties experiment with new strategies, taking advantage of the COP's legal flexibility and the CBD's institutional history of engaging with the political nature of scientific knowledge. © 2014 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - With the share of intermittent renewable energies within the electricity system rising, balancing services from dispatchable power plants are of increasing importance. Highlighting the importance of the need to keeping fuel costs for flexible power generation to a minimum, the study aims to identify favourable biogas plant configurations, supplying biogas on demand. A cost analysis of five configurations based on biogas storing and flexible biogas production concepts has been carried out. Results show that additional flexibility costs for a biogas supply of 8h per day range between 2€ and 11€MWh-1 and for a 72h period without biogas demand from 9€ to 19€MWh-1. While biogas storage concepts were identified as favourable short term supply configurations, flexible biogas production concepts profit from reduced storage requirements at plants with large biogas production capacities or for periods of several hours without biogas demand. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Key message: Camelina has been highlighted as an emerging oilseed crop. Transgenic Camelina plants overexpressing Arabidopsis MYB96 exhibited drought resistance by activating expression of Camelina wax biosynthetic genes and accumulating wax load. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is an oilseed crop in the Brassicaeae family with potential to expand biofuel production to marginal land. The aerial portion of all land plants is covered with cuticular wax to protect them from desiccation. In this study, the Arabidopsis MYB96 gene was overexpressed in Camelina under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. Transgenic Camelina plants overexpressing Arabidopsis MYB96 exhibited normal growth and development and enhanced tolerance to drought. Deposition of epicuticular wax crystals and total wax loads increased significantly on the surfaces of transgenic leaves compared with that of non-transgenic plants. The levels of alkanes and primary alcohols prominently increased in transgenic Camelina plants relative to non-transgenic plants. Cuticular transpiration occurred more slowly in transgenic leaves than that in non-transgenic plants. Genome-wide identification of Camelina wax biosynthetic genes enabled us to determine that the expression levels of CsKCS2, CsKCS6, CsKCR1-1, CsKCR1-2, CsECR, and CsMAH1 were approximately two to sevenfold higher in transgenic Camelina leaves than those in non-transgenic leaves. These results indicate that MYB96-mediated transcriptional regulation of wax biosynthetic genes is an approach applicable to generating drought-resistant transgenic crops. Transgenic Camelina plants with enhanced drought tolerance could be cultivated on marginal land to produce renewable biofuels and biomaterials. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biodiesel has proven to be a reasonable substitute to petroleum diesel owing to continuous depletion and pollution caused by the latter. The uncomplicated process of production of fatty acid methyl ester or biodiesel as it is commercially known has made it an even better substitute of fossil diesel. The preparation of biodiesel involves the use of alcohol (methanol) and hydroxides (NaOH). There is a possibility that some of these compounds remain unreacted and needs to be washed with water. This residue water containing alcohol and hydroxide residues if discharged in the soil may affect its quality. This research paper deals with the effect of biodiesel effluent on various physicochemical properties of soil. The result of the research proves that the biodiesel effluent if discharged in soil will degrade soil quality. © Springer International Publishing 2014.

AB  - As the demand for biofuel products continues to rise along with the need for tertiary wastewater treatment processes to facilitate the removal of phosphorus, increasing importance is placed on the design of cultivation systems for the production of algal biomass. In addition to traditional open ponds and photobioreactors, attached algal growth systems can provide high rates of biomass production while simultaneously removing nutrients from wastewater effluent. The potential economic viability of these attached growth systems is dependent on the optimization of bed flow characteristics, inflow water quality parameters, and hydrodynamic regimes in order to maximize biomass productivity. This study monitored the productivity and nutrient removal rates of a pilot-scale attached growth system (AGS1) used to remove phosphorus from wastewater effluent at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas. These results were compared with the results from a similar system in the same watershed that was monitored in a previous study (AGS2). The performance of AGS2 was documented in a companion article in Ecological Engineering. In spite of the similarities between the systems' locations and influent characteristics, the productivities of the two systems were very different. The rates of biomass production in AGS1 and AGS2 were 4.4±4.8 and 26.7±16.0gdry weightm-2d-1, respectively. Potential reasons for the dramatic differences in performance between the two systems are explored in this article. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As concerns heighten over links between biomass production and land grabs in the global south, attention is turning to understanding the role of governance of biofuels systems, whereby decision-making and conduct are not solely determined through government regulations but increasingly shaped by non-state actors, including multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI). Launched in 2005, Bonsucro is the principal MSI that focuses on sustainability standards for sugar and sugarcane ethanol production. Bonsucro claims that because it is free from government interference and draws on scientific metrics, their standards transcend localized, political-economic contexts. In this paper, we illustrate how the local context shapes the prospects for Bonsucro sustainably certified biofuel production in relation to land and water grabs. To accomplish this, our case focuses on Colombia, which has used a range of national policy mandates to establish itself as one of the larger producers of agrofuels in Latin America. We draw on interviews with stakeholders in the sugar and ethanol industries, paired with an examination of Bonsucro principles on land rights and water use, to illustrate how the sugar industry is framing their participation in Bonsucro, and the effects of the increasing intensification of sugarcane for ethanol production on land and water access for communities. We find that within the context of Colombia, efforts such as Bonsucro provide a veil of legitimacy and authority to a system that is premised on deeply entrenched historical patterns of inequitable land ownership patterns and access to natural resources. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In recent decades, driven by the worldwide growing demand for food and biofuels, agriculture has grown exponentially at the expense of natural ecosystems. The same phenomenon is happening in Uruguay, with greater intensity on the west region of the country during the last decade, driven by the soybean crop. The objective of our study was to assess the territorial changes occurred at the landscape level, associated with agricultural intensifcation, on a department (political division) on the western region of Uruguay, between 1990 and 2009. Crop areas increased 27% during this period, advancing over native forest (BN) and grasslands/ rangelands (CN) areas. The BN decreased 30% mainly through the loss of small fragments (<10 ha). The CN was reduced by a 23%, mostly through the disappearance of fragments up to 50 ha. In relation to connectivity, average distances between patches of CN have changed from 168 m to 192 m, whereas in BN they have gone from 365 m to 255 m in 2009. This last observation is consistent with a more disperse distribution in 1990, that will become more compact by 2009 through the disappearance of small peripheral patches. The fragmentation of CN showed a slightly increment in the period, while a decrease was observed in BN, possibly caused by the disappearance of small fragments (less than 10 ha). Between 1990 and 2009, 2000 fragments of BN <10 ha and 2500 fragments from 1-100 CN have disappeared, becoming in most cases on soybean crops. The effects of this process on agricultural production has been quantifed but the impact on landscape's capacity to sustain biodiversity and provide a wide range of ecosystem goods and services, is still poorly understood.

AB  - Short rotation woody crops are being developed as a sustainable source of biomass for the production of bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. With the potential increase in demand of biomass for energy in the future, there is a need to diversify and expand its source. In the present study, we evaluated the growth performance, biomass production, energy content, and potential ethanol yields of shrub willow hybrids and native willow accessions. Shrub willow hybrids cuttings were obtained from the State University of New York through its controlled breeding program while cuttings used for native willow accessions were collected naturally. At the end of one rotation, consisting of three growing seasons, we found that shrub willow hybrids outperformed native willow accession species (P = 0.0004), with an average survival rate of 80 and 39 %, respectively. Biomass production of shrub willow hybrids and native willow accessions ranged from 7.42 to 16.0 and from 0.69 to 1.83 Mg ha-1 oven dry weight, respectively. The chemical composition (mass fraction % on dry basis) of willow hybrids and native willow accessions generally contained 39 % cellulose, 19 % hemicellulose, 25 % lignin, 1.4 % ash content, 17,500-18,500 kJ kg wood-1, and 385 L Mg-1 of theoretical ethanol yield. Energy content and potential ethanol yields on a dry weight basis did not vary between shrub willow hybrids and native willow accessions; however, the amount of biomass produced per unit land area is known to influence potential ethanol yields. Thus, we suggest that shrub willow hybrids offer promising potential as an alternative source of biomass. The results of our study suggest that four of the shrub willow hybrids evaluated have a greater potential for use as biomass energy crops on marginal lands in central Minnesota than the native willow accessions; hence, there is a need to test their potential at a larger scale. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The potential harvest of corn stover as a feedstock for biofuels to meet government mandates has raised concerns about the agronomic impacts of its removal from fields. Furthermore, in order to meet these mandates, larger quantities of stover will be required. As a result, increased attention has been placed on sustainable agronomic practices, such as cover crops. While cover crops may offer desirable benefits, adoption comes at a cost. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which cover crop costs could be compensated by additional stover removal and additional agronomic benefits from the use of cover crops. To meet the objective, we took three distinct approaches: (1) benefit-cost analysis, (2) integrated model analysis, and (3) representative farm analysis using the linear programming model PC-LP. Each approach was a different take on the same issue; however, each provided different information. First, we estimated cover crop costs and agronomic benefits and employed benefit-cost analyses, including stochastic analysis in at RISK. Second, we tested cover crops with stover removal for 24 Indiana farms using PC-LP. Cover crop costs ranged from $81.76/ha to $172.50/ha, with variability being driven by differences in the seeding rate and seed cost. Agronomic benefits included reduced erosion, which was calculated using a newly created integrated modeling system. The mean estimated reduced soil erosion with a cover crop and no residue removal was 0.72. metric tons/ha. An analysis of cover crop agronomic benefits resulted in private benefits (on-site) ranging from $91.45/ha to $192.07/ha, and $97.63/ha to $198.27/ha from society's perspective. These benefits were highly influenced by added or scavenged nitrogen (N) from the cover crop. For sensitivity we eliminated the benefit from added N and reevaluated the results. Without the N credit, benefits ranged from $74.72/ha to $134.62/ha. Benefit-cost analyses when considering the agronomic benefits of cover crops resulted in a range of a net loss of $11.09/ha to a net benefit of $87.32/ha for the private perspective. The integrated modeling system results indicated that, on average, while holding soil erosion constant, an additional 4.01. metric tons/ha of stover could be removed if a cover crop were used. Accounting for cover crop costs and stover removal, a benefit-cost analysis suggested that at a farm-gate stover price of $66.14/metric ton, net benefits ranged from a loss of $3.78/ha to a net benefit of $86.93/ha. At a farm-gate stover price of $88.18/metric ton, mean net benefit ranged from $158.81/ha to $249.52/ha.Results from the farm model (PC-LP) indicated that cover crops, along with increased stover removal, impacted crop rotations, increased the total amount of stover harvested, and had the potential to increase farm profits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The human population is rising and the availability of terrestrial land and its resources are finite and, perhaps, not sufficient to deliver enough food, energy, materials and space. Thus, it is important to (further) explore and exploit the marine environment which covers no less than 71% of the earth's surface. The marine environment is very complex but can roughty be divided into two systems: natural (e.g. wild fishing) and human-made (e.g. artificial islands). In this study, characterization factors (CF) for natural and human-made marine systems were calculated in order to be able to assess the environmental impact of occupying marine surfaces, which was not possible so far in life cycle assessment. When accounting for natural resources while occupying one of these systems, it is important to consider the primary resources that are actually deprived from nature, which differs between the natural and human-made marine systems. In natural systems, the extracted biomass was accounted for through its exergy content, which is the maximum quantity of work that the system can execute in its environment. Reference flows for marine fish, seaweeds, crustaceans and mollusks were proposed and their correlated CF was calculated. For human-made systems, the deprived land resource is, in fact, the occupied area of the marine surface. Based on potential marine net primary production data (NPP), exergy based spatial and temporal CFs for ocean areal occupation were calculated. This approach was included in the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method which makes it the first life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method capable of analyzing the environmental impact (and more specific the resource footprint) of marine areal occupation. Furthermore, the methodology was applied to two case studies: comparing resource consumption of on- and offshore oil production, and fish and soybean meal production for fish feed applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are controversial because of uncertain environmental benefits and reported social drawbacks, including 'land grabs' and threats to food security. The present study investigates the relevance of these concerns for a proposed bioethanol project in Cradock, South Africa. The proposed project is anticipated to lead to economic upliftment and could therefore contribute to reduce poverty and thus strengthen food security. With a projected annual production of up to 16,000. l ethanol per hectare, yields would be substantially higher than in most other countries. Agricultural activity would take place on existing farm land, or on biomes classified as 'least concern'. We estimate a carbon footprint reduction of ~. 30% for sugar beet ethanol in the area. Because various global biofuel concerns do not apply to the proposed Cradock fuel ethanol project, we argue for a more nuanced approach for the evaluation of biofuel projects with more focus on case-specific attributes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The widespread acquisition of land for large-scale/commercial production of biofuel crops in Ghana has raised concerns from civil society organizations, local communities and other parties, regarding the impact of these investments on local livelihoods. This paper assessed the effect of large-scale acquisition of land for production of Jatropha curcas on farmers' livelihoods in Ghana. The study was conducted in 11 communities spanning the major agro-ecological zones and political divisions across Ghana. Methods of data collection included questionnaire survey, interviews and focus group discussions. Results show that several households have lost their land to Jatropha plantations leading, in some cases, to violent conflicts between biofuel investors, traditional authorities and the local communities. Most people reported that, contrary to the belief that Jatropha does well on marginal lands, the lands acquired by the Jatropha Companies were productive lands. Loss of rights over land has affected households' food production and security, as many households have resorted to reducing the area they have under cultivation, leading to shortening fallow periods and declining crop yields. In addition, although the cultivation of Jatropha led to the creation of jobs in the communities where they were started, such jobs were merely transient. The paper contends that, even though the impact of Jatropha feedstock production on local livelihoods in Ghana is largely negative, the burgeoning industry could be developed in ways that could support local livelihoods. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Using an experiment embedded within a representative survey, this study examined the interactive effect of party identification and risk/benefit perception on public opinion about biofuels. Democrats tended to be more supportive of biofuels than Republicans. However, the effect of party identification on opinion about biofuels varied when individuals considered the risk/benefit of biofuels in different domains. Individuals who reported greater affiliation with the Democratic Party were likely to support funding biofuels research when primed with the economic risks or the social/ethical benefits of biofuels. For those who considered the social/ethical benefits of biofuels, more self-identified Democrats were likely to support biofuels production and use. However, more self-identified Democrats were less supportive of biofuels production and use when they considered the political risks of biofuels. Implications are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The generic social and socioeconomic impacts of various biofuels and fossil fuels were screened by applying Social Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Data were taken from the Social Hotspots Database on all categories for all the related themes and all indicators available. To limit the amount of data, only high and very high risk indicators were considered for each combination. The risks identified per life cycle phase were listed for each fuel assessed and the results were then aggregated by counting the number of high and very high risk indicators for that fuel.All the fossil fuels and biofuels analysed were found to display high or very high risks of negative impacts. Country of origin seemed to be of greater importance for risks than fuel type, as the most risk-related and least risk-related product systems referred to the same type of fuel, fossil oil from Russia/Nigeria and fossil oil from Norway, respectively. These results suggest that in developing policy, strict procurement requirements on social performance should be set for both fossil fuel and biofuel. However, the results must be interpreted with care owing to some limitations in the assessment, such as simplifications to life cycles, method used and data collection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Prospective bioenergy crops have caused concern about their invasive potential because they often share characteristics with known invasive species. Studies that examine the factors that limit regeneration of these crop species will be crucial for identifying vulnerable habitats and devising management strategies to reduce the likelihood of escape from cultivation. Using a response surface design, we investigated the influence of light availability, soil moisture, and litter cover on recruitment and establishment of a potential biofuel cultivar of Miscanthus as well as an invasive congener. Responses were similar for the two plant types. Light availability had a strong influence on seedling success at both stages, though light limitation prevented establishment only at the lowest light level. Although variation in recruitment rates was low within plant types, establishment varied extensively in response to different light conditions. Low variation in Miscanthus seedling recruitment that led to establishment of a seedling bank under a range of light intensities may facilitate a "sit and wait" situation that raises the likelihood of successful escapes. Therefore, management efforts that restrict seed movement and increase light competition for seedlings will be important for lowering invasion risk. As deliberate introductions of bioenergy crops increase, ecological studies that quantify conditions required for successful escapes will be key to helping agronomists and managers mitigate the risk of unintended invasions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).

AB  - The efficiency of a terrestrial ecosystem to use rainfall in production is critical in regulating the ecological functions of the earth system under global change. However, it remains unclear how rain use efficiency (RUE) will be altered by changes in climate and human activities such as biofuel harvest. In this study, we used RUE data from a long-term experiment in a tallgrass prairie to analyze the effects of warming and biofuel harvest (clipping). From 2000 to 2011, experimental warming enhanced RUE in most years, with larger positive effects in normal and wet than dry hydrological years. Clipping decreased RUE in dry and normal hydrological years, but had no impact on RUE in wet years. The observed RUE responses resulted from treatment-induced changes in both biologically ineffective (i.e., runoff and soil evaporation) and effective (i.e., transpiration) parts of precipitation. For example, litter cover was increased in warming plots, but reduced by clipping, leading to negative and positive effects on runoff and soil evaporation, respectively. The dominance of C4 species, which usually have higher water use efficiency than C3 species, was enhanced by warming, but reduced by clipping. Moreover, RUE was positively correlated with ratios of rainfall in the late growing season (June-August), when the growth of C4 plants was most active, relative to that in the other seasons. Our results indicate that RUE is positively influenced by climate warming, but negatively affected by biofuel harvest in tallgrass prairie of the Great Plains. These findings highlight the important roles of plant community structure and temporal distribution of precipitation in regulating ecosystem RUE. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - High cost of technology is seen as the primary barrier to full commercialization of cellulosic biofuels. There is broad expectation that once conversion technology breakthroughs occur, policy support is only needed to accelerate cost reductions through "learning by doing" effects. In this study, we show that droughts pose a significant economic risk to biofuel producers and consumers regardless of the rate at which technology costs fall. We model a future switchgrass derived cellulosic biorefinery industry in Kansas based on spatially resolute historic (1996-2005) weather data, representing a rainfall regime that could reflect drought events predicted to occur throughout the U.S. Midwest by climatologists (Karl etal. (2009) U.S. Global Change Research Program USA). We find that droughts reduced modeled biorefinery capacity factors, on average, by 47%, raising biofuel production costs by 35% between a modeled dry and wet year. Interestingly, we find that two logical strategies to plan for drought; (1) building large biorefineries to source feedstock from a larger area and, (2) Storing switchgrass in good production years for use in drought years; are not very effective in reducing drought risks. Our findings should be of particular concern to low carbon fuel policies like California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the U.S. Second Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS2) whose costs of compliance may be much higher than expected. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an apparent paradox, bioenergy crops offer potential benefits to a world adjusting to the challenges of climate change and declining fossil fuel stocks, as well as potential ecological and economic threats resulting from biological invasions. In considering this paradox it is important to understand that benefits and threats may not always be apparent in equal measure throughout the potential range of each candidate biofuel species. In some environments, a species could potentially produce valuable biological materials without posing a significant invasion threat. In this study, we develop a bioclimatic niche model for a candidate biofuel crop, Millettia pinnata, and apply the model to different climatic and irrigation scenarios to estimate the current and future patterns of climate suitability for its growth and naturalization. We use Australia as a case study for interpreting the niche model in terms that may be informative for both biofuels proponents and biosecurity regulators to plan management programmes that reflect the invasive potential in different areas. The model suggests that suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata in Australia are naturally restricted to the moist and semimoist tropics. Irrigation can extend the suitable growing conditions more widely throughout the tropics, and into more arid regions. Under future climate scenarios, suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata under natural rainfall contract towards the east coast, and extend southward into the subtropics. With irrigation, M. pinnata appears to have the potential in the future to naturalize across much of Australia. The bioclimatic modelling method demonstrated here is comparatively quick and easy, and can produce a rich array of data products to inform the interests of both bioenergy proponents and biosecurity regulators. We show how this modelling can support the development of spatially explicit biosecurity policies designed to manage invasion risks in a manner that balances bioenergy and biosecurity concerns. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) system is an innovative approach to maximising energy conversion from low input high diversity (LIHD) biomass. In this system water pre-treated and ensiled LIHD biomass is pressed. The press fluid is anaerobically digested to produce methane that is used to power the process. The fibrous fraction is densified and then sold as a combustion fuel. Two process options designed to concentrate the press fluid were assessed to ascertain their influence on productivity in an IFBB like system: sedimentation and the omission of pre-treatment water. By concentrating press fluid and not adding water during processing, energy production from methane was increased by 75% per unit time and solid fuel productivity increased by 80% per unit of fluid produced. The additional energy requirements for pressing more biomass in order to generate equal volumes of feedstock were accounted for in these calculations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, the potential of Cynara C. utilisation for CHP, H2 and syngas production as a precursor for second generation biofuels with respect to CO2 mitigation by means of air gasification was investigated. Gasification was conducted at a temperature range of 700-900°C at atmospheric pressure, with a main parametric study concerning the effects of temperature and various values of λ (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) on gasification product distribution. The experimental results of Cynara C. gasification showed that the yield (v/v%) of syngas is optimised at a higher temperature and lower λ, while for H2, the maximum yield in v/v% was obtained at a lower temperature. Syngas (H2+CO) reached 72.9 v/v% with a LHV of 9.84MJ/Nm3 (based on N2 free gas) at a temperature of 900°C and λ=0.2. H2 achieved a syngas yield of 22 v/v% at 700°C and λ=0.2. According to the results, producer gas is recommended for H2 production rather than for CHP. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper employs the general equilibrium model MAGNET to assess the effects of the European Commission's proposals for the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) on land use changes in the European Union and worldwide. The focus of the paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of the land use changes to different assumptions on the blending mix between ethanol and biodiesel for meeting the 5 % blending target of first generation biofuels, on the intensification level of agricultural production and on the available agricultural land. The results suggest that net land use changes (LUC) in the EU due to the revised RED are limited and are more sensitive to the share of ethanol and biodiesel in meeting the blending target compared to different assumptions on the availability of land and of yields that can be achieved when substituting land with other production factors. LUC in the rest of the world stem from increased EU imports of feedstock and of biofuels. LUC is especially sensitive to the substitution between land and fertilizer in regions with extensive agricultural production systems. In regions trading vegetable oil and oilseeds with the EU, and in regions producing ethanol, LUC is influenced by the share of ethanol in the biofuel mix used in the EU. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Production of second generation ethanol and other added value chemicals from sugarcane bagasse and straw integrated to first generation sugarcane biorefineries presents large potential for industrial implementation, since part of the infrastructure where first generation ethanol is produced may be shared between both plants. In this context, butanol from renewable resources has attracted increasing interest, mostly for its use as a drop in liquid biofuel for transportation, since its energy density is greater than that of ethanol, but also for its use as feedstock in the chemical industry. In this paper, vapor-phase catalytic production of butanol from first and second generation ethanol in a sugarcane biorefinery was assessed, using data available from the literature. The objective is to evaluate the potential of butanol either as fuel or feedstock for industry, taking into account economical/environmental issues through computer simulation. The results obtained show that, although promising, butanol sold as chemical has a limited market and as fuel presents economic constraints. In addition, investments on the butanol conversion plant could be an obstacle to its practical implementation. Nevertheless, environmental assessment pointed out advantages of its use as fuel for road transportation, if compared with gasoline in terms of global environmental impacts such as global warming. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Hydrogen production (HP) from dark fermentation effluent of starch wastewater via vertical tubular photo-bioreactor was investigated. The reactor was inoculated with mixed culture of bacteria and operated at light intensity of 190W/m2. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) was varied between 0.9 to 4.0h and 3.2 to 16gCOD/l.d., respectively. Increasing the HRT from 0.9 to 2.5h, significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased HP from 1±0.04 to 3.05±0.19l/d, respectively. However, minimal increase in HP occurred when increasing the HRT up to 4.0h. The HP remained unaffected when increasing the OLR from 3.2 to 6.4gCOD/l.d. Further increase in the OLR up to 8.2 and 16gCOD/l.d., resulted in a drop in HP i.e. 0.96 and 0.19l/d, respectively. Microbial community analysis of the reactor samples showed the presence and dominance of hydrogen producing purple non-sulfur phototrophic (PNS) bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris in the reactor. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is a promising organism for biofuel production as it can produce ethanol from glucose at high rates. However, Z. mobilis does not natively ferment C5 sugars such as xylose. While it has been engineered to do so, the engineered strains do not metabolize these sugars at high rates. Previous research has identified some of the bottlenecks associated with xylose metabolism in Z. mobilis. In this work, we investigated transport as a possible bottleneck. In particular, we hypothesized that the slow uptake of xylose through the promiscuous Glf transporter may limit the efficiency of xylose metabolism in Z. mobilis. To test this hypothesis, we expressed XylE, the low-affinity xylose transporter from Escherichia coli, in a xylose-utilizing strain of Z. mobilis. Our results show that the expression of this pentose-specific transporter improves the rate of xylose utilization in Z. mobilis; however, this enhancement is seen only at high xylose concentrations. In addition, we also found that overexpression of the promiscuous Z. mobilis transporter Glf yielded similar results, suggesting that the transport bottleneck is not due to the specificity, but rather the capacity for sugar uptake. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Water and energy are interconnected resources that face regional supply limitations and contribute to environmental issues such as climate change. Pennsylvania and Arizona are creating policies to steer large transitions in their energy and water sources, respectively. This paper provides case studies using the newly developed Regional Energy & Water Supply Scenarios (REWSS) model to explore potential impacts of different pathways in these two states. Part I of this work discusses model structure, procedure, and validation.Pennsylvania has become a major producer of shale gas, but the potential for greenhouse gas emissions reductions from shale gas are uncertain. Results show only small decreases in GHG emissions if shale gas is used for electricity due to limited reductions in transportation and heating-related emissions. PA results also highlight potential water for energy issues around biofuels if irrigated feedstocks are used. Arizona faces water supply issues due to population growth and overused groundwater. Scenarios examined focus on replacing groundwater with imports or desalination. AZ results show that the use of desalination could show marginal increases in GHGs and energy consumption (2%), but the widespread deployment of solar power to offset additional GHGs would likely have a high upfront energetic cost. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of producing microalgal biodiesel via baseline and improved technological routes under several coproduct options and allocation schemes, and compares the results to traditional petroleum diesel. Multiple environmental impact categories, as well as sustainability metrics are utilized to assess the environmental sustainability and viability of emerging microalgal biofuels. Analysis reveals that for baseline scenarios the fossil energy return on investment (EROIfossil) ranges from 0.16 to 0.45, energy return on investment (EROI) from 0.15 to 0.40, and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gCO2 eq./MJ-fuel) from 142 to 352-depending on the choice of allocation methodology and coproduct option. For improved scenarios EROIfossil range from 0.50 to 1.87, EROI from 0.39 to 1.18, and life cycle GHG emissions from 35 to 141. Further analysis reveals that microalgal fuels provide benefits in only two out of the ten examined environmental impact categories-relative to petroleum diesel. The results are compelling as they suggest that the choice of production pathway and allocation scheme has a significant impact on algae's energy and environmental performance, and in select cases can alter the net energy balance and GHG reduction potential of microalgal fuel production from negative to positive. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ASB reactor was operated at ambient temperature (17-25°C) in order to avoid the need of external heating up to higher operating temperatures (e.g., up to 35°C for mesophilic digestion). Since heat requirement for raising the temperature of incoming feed for digestion is eliminated, energy recovery from anaerobic treatment of chicken manure could be realized with less operating costs. Average biogas production rates were calculated ca. 210 and 242 L per kg of organic matter removed from the ASB reactor at average hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 13 and 8.6 days, respectively. Moreover, average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of ca. 89% was observed with suspended solids removal more than 97% from the effluent of the ASB reactor. Influent ammonia, on the other hand, did not indicate any free ammonia inhibition due to dilution of the raw manure while pH and alkalinity results showed stability during the study. Microbial quantification results indicated that as the number of bacterial community decreased, the amount of Archaea increased through the effective digestion volume of the ASB reactor. Moreover, the number of methanogens displayed an uptrend like archaeal community and a strong correlation (-0.645) was found between methanogenic community and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration especially acetate. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Hydrogen demand should significantly increase in the next few years due to rapid growth of energy demand, the refinery industry's growing needs and applications such as biofuel production. To meet the demand advanced processes are being developed throughout the world in a sustainability context. Among the most studied ones is high temperature electrolysis of steam using solar photovoltaic and thermal energy. In this work, a large scale hybrid solar hydrogen production system was designed and optimized. The system consists of the solid oxide steam electrolysis system coupled to a Photovoltaic array through a Direct Current converter and coupled to a Parabolic Trough Collector through a heat exchanger network optimized using a Generalized Reduced Gradient algorithm. Under local tropical conditions, the theoretical production rate of hydrogen per second and per day recorded from simulation of interconnected system based on optimum scenario are respectively 0.064. kg/s and 1843.2. kg/day. The exergy efficiency, land used and water consumption of system component was also performed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To produce lignocellulosic biofuels economically, the complete release of monomers from the plant cell wall components, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, through pre-treatment and hydrolysis (both enzymatic and chemical), and the efficient utilization of these monomers as carbon sources, is crucial. In addition, the identification and development of robust microbial biofuel production strains that can tolerate the toxic compounds generated during pre-treatment and hydrolysis is also essential. In this work, Cupriavidus necator was selected due to its capabilities for utilizing lignin monomers and producing polyhydroxylbutyrate (PHB), a bioplastic as well as an advanced biofuel intermediate. We characterized the growth kinetics of C. necator in pre-treated corn stover slurry as well as individually in the pre-sence of 11 potentially toxic compounds in the saccharified slurry. We found that C. necator was sensitive to the saccharified slurry produced from dilute acid pre-treated corn stover. Five out of 11 compounds within the slurry were characterized as toxic to C. necator, namely ammonium acetate, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), benzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Aldehydes (e.g., furfural and HMF) were more toxic than the acetate and the lignin degradation products benzoic acid and p-coumaric acid; furfural was identified as the most toxic compound. Although toxic to C. necator at high concentration, ammonium acetate, benzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid could be utilized by C. necator with a stimulating effect on C. necator growth. Consequently, the lignin degradation pathway of C. necator was reconstructed based on genomic information and literature. The efficient conversion of intermediate catechol to downstream products of cis,cis-muconate or 2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde may help improve the robustness of C. necator to benzoic acid and p-coumaric acid as well as improve PHB productivity. © 2014 Wang, Yang, Hunsinger, Pienkos and Johnson.

AB  - This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) based multi-period and multi-objective biofuel supply chain model. The objective functions are total discounted profit, average fossil energy input per MJ biofuel and average greenhouse gases emission per MJ biofuel (economic, energy, environmental, 3E). Considering seasonal factor and storage problem, a multi-period model was required. Furthermore, to investigate the expansion of the supply chain, the time span of the model was set to be 3 years. The locations of biomass feedstock, biofuel factories and markets were considered as decision variables in the model. The non-linear objective functions were transformed into linear constraints by using the ε-constraint method. After that, the model was solved as a MILP problem. A surface of the Pareto optimal solutions was obtained by linearly interpolating the non-inferior solutions. The surface revealed the tradeoff among 3E objectives. In the case study, this model was used to design an experimental biofuel supply chain for China. © Copyright.

AB  - Pyrolysis of Milkweed was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer and a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Total liquid yield of Milkweed pyrolysis was between 40.74% and 44.19wt% between 425°C and 550°C. The gas yield increased from 27.90wt% to 33.33wt% with increasing reaction temperature. The higher heating values (HHV) of the Milkweed bio-oil were relatively high (30.33-32.87MJ/kg) and varied with reaction temperature, feeding rate and fluidization velocity. The selectivity for CO2 was highest within non-condensable gases, and the molar ratio of CO2/CO was about 3 at the different reaction conditions. The 13C NMR analysis, of the bio-oil showed that the relative concentration carboxylic group and its derivatives was higher at 425°C than 475°C, which resulted in slightly higher oxygen content in bio-oil. The pH of aqueous phase obtained at 475°C was 7.37 which is the highest reported for any lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis oils. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many countries are promoting biofuels as a substitute for scarce oil. This paper develops a dynamic model of land allocation between food and energy and shows how the model can be calibrated using standard optimization techniques. Some possible implications of the trade-offs between food and energy are discussed. Specifically, we show that the effect of mandates is mainly felt through increased land conversion, which increases indirect carbon emissions. Crude oil prices do not decrease significantly because of leakages. © 2014 Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - The bioenergy (especially biofuels) production and use has been worldly encouraged as a possible solution for the energy crisis caused by fossil fuel extraction and burnt. However, some intrinsic features of the biofuels supply chain generate notable uncertainties. The land use change can be considered a key issue of the feedstock production stage. In this work, the carbon replacement time was calculated for the cases of the oil palm growing in soils for forest, degraded lands and marginal lands. Most cultivated lands are required to increase the biodiesel production in Colombia. Additionally, the greenhouse gas emission from the land use change was calculated, when the palm crops are extended to achieve B20 blends. The results indicated that the palm crop growing on degraded and marginal lands, as well as palm cultivated in Eastern zone, do not generate carbon debt. Moreover, oil palm growing under these conditions helps to increase the carbon captures of these lands. The Eastern zone shows the highest carbon capture power.

AB  - To reduce CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce biomass rich in essential fatty acids, Chlorella vulgaris CCAP 211 was continuously grown in a tubular photobioreactor using air alone or air enriched with CO2 as the sole carbon source. While on one hand, nitrogen-limited conditions strongly affected biomass growth, conversely, they almost doubled its lipid fraction. Under these conditions using air enriched with 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16% (v/v) CO2, the maximum biomass concentration was 1.4, 5.8, 6.6, 6.8, and 6.4 gDB L-1 on a dry basis, the CO2 consumption rate 62, 380, 391, 433, and 430 mgCO2 L-1 day-1, and the lipid productivity 3.7, 23.7, 24.8, 29.5, and 24.4 mg L-1 day-1, respectively. C. vulgaris was able to grow effectively using CO2-enriched air, but its chlorophyll a (3.0-3.5 g 100gDB-1), chlorophyll b (2.6-3.0 g 100gDB-1), and lipid contents (10.7-12.0 g 100gDB-1) were not significantly influenced by the presence of CO2 in the air. Most of the fatty acids in C. vulgaris biomass were of the saturated series, mainly myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids, but a portion of no less than 45% consisted of unsaturated fatty acids, and about 80% of these were high added-value essential fatty acids belonging to the ω3 and ω6 series. These results highlight that C. vulgaris biomass could be of great importance for human health when used as food additive or for functional food production. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This article provides an economic assessment of greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with the use of biofuels for the transportation sector in Spain. The reference year used is 2010 in accordance with the target for the implementation of biofuels and other renewable fuels set down in European legislation (Directive 2003/30). The assessment is based on the premise that an increased use of biofuel will displace a similar amount of fossil fuel on a BTU basis, with the amount of biofuel used in 2010 taken as a reference point to conduct the estimates.The results show that the most cost-efficient biofuel is the biodiesel obtained from waste oil. Regarding the differences between first- and second-generation biofuels, the results show that the latter had very high associated costs. Reaching the biofuel target for 2010 by primarily using first-generation used-oil biodiesel blends would have led to a saving of 58°M€. In contrast, reaching this target by exclusively using second-generation biofuels would have led to a 1000M€ increase in total costs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In 2009 the scenic Band-e-Amir Lakes and surrounding landscapes (2800-3800. m elevation) were declared Afghanistan's first national park (BANP) with the hope that the lakes will eventually attract tourists at levels as before the war period (1979-2001). The area is rich in plant species, and was formerly populated by ibex and urial. Today fauna is impoverished and vegetation (mostly mountain steppe) is degraded due to intensive livestock grazing, dryland agriculture, and shrub collection. BANP was created in collaboration with local residents (~800 families), and longer-term plans are to upgrade biological qualities of landscapes whilst improving residents' livelihoods. To provide baselines for adequate management plans, a survey of 116 households was conducted in 15 villages. Most families were subsistent agro-pastoralists. Population growth was ~2.2% annually. Estimates of mostly free-ranging livestock populations were ~19,900 sheep and goats, ~2500 cattle, and ~2100 donkeys and horses. Grazing impacts were evident, especially near villages. Families collected ~3.1. t of shrubs and ~0.4. t of cattle dung annually as biofuel. Estimates indicated that ≥0.7% of BANP area was cleared of shrubs annually. Dryland agriculture covered ~3.4% area. Other resource uses (collection of reed, medicinal plants, hunting, fishing) were assessed. Further research is needed on spatial patterns of resource exploitation and vegetation ecology. Promotion of alternative energy sources could alleviate pressures on shrub resources. Steep lands should be better protected (possibly fenced) from livestock and human impacts. Environmental workshops with residents and integration of locals in research projects could enhance management effectiveness and acceptance of park rules. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A pyrolysis of compost for the production of syngas with an explicit H 2/CO = 2 or H2/CO = 3 was investigated in this study. The composts were obtained from nonhybrid (perennial) grasses (NHG) and hybrid (perennial) grasses (HG). Discrepancies in H2 evolution profiles were found between NHG and HG composts. In addition, positive correlations for NHG composts were obtained between (i) H2 yield and lignin content, (ii) H2 yield and potassium content, and (iii) CO yield and cellulose content. All composts resulted in H2/CO = 2 and five of the nine composts resulted in H2/CO = 3. Exceptionally large higher heating values (HHVs) of pyrolysis gas, very close to HHVs of feedstock, were obtained for composts made from mountain brome (MB, 16.23 MJ/kg), hybrid Becva (FB, 16.45 MJ/kg), and tall fescue (TF, 17.43 MJ/kg). The MB and FB composts resulted in the highest syngas formation with H2/CO = 2, whereas TF compost resulted in the highest syngas formation with H2/CO = 3. © 2014 Adéla Hlavsová et al.

AB  - The ecological impact of energy production and consumption is often relegated in analytical accounts of the evolution of energy systems, where production and consumption patterns are analysed as the interaction of social, economic and technological factors. Ecological and social-ecological dynamics are, we argue, critical in the context of imperatives for access to modern energy services that are inadequate for significant sections of the world's population. The ecological impacts of energy use are often analysed as a set of externalities, many of which are uncertain or unquantifiable, particularly if they stem from earth system change such as anthropogenic climate change. Here we outline the benefits from analysing energy systems as social-ecological systems. We review the extensive literature from ecology and resilience theories, and compare the analytical domains, major findings and emphasis of social-ecological systems with socio-technical transition research. We illustrate these differences with the example of the multi-scale impacts of biofuel expansion. We show that social-ecological systems research combines analysis of interactions with ecological systems and power relations between actors in energy systems, and has the potential to do so across production, distribution and consumption domains whilst illustrating the dynamics of such energy systems, identifying potential trade-offs and regime shifts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biochar, a massive byproduct of biomass pyrolysis during biofuel generation, is a potential P source for the mitigation of P depletion. However, the chemical and biological effect of the release of P from biochar is still unclear. In this study, two types of Lysinibacillus strains (Lysinibacillus sphaericus D-8 and Lysinibacillus fusiformis A-5) were separated from a sediment and their P-solubilizing characteristics to biochar was first reported. Compared with the bacterial mixture W-1 obtained from a bioreactor, the introduction of A-5 and D-8 significantly improved P solubilization. The release of P from biochar by A-5 and D-8 reached 54% and 47%, respectively, which is comparable to that under rigorous chemical conditions. SEM images and XPS spectra demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of the biochar surface have changed in the process which may be caused by the activities of the microbes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the current land deals debate, land dispossession is often attributed to exploitative acts of agricultural investors. However, the role of equally active actors in the making of land deals such as chiefs, who customarily are custodians of land, does not feature prominently in the debate. The paper shows that the recent surge in large-scale land deals in Ghana corresponds with chiefs' pre-existing motivation to re-establish authority over land for two reasons: firstly, to formalise the use of 'stool land' to create rural development opportunities; secondly, to formalise boundaries of 'stool land' to avert potential future land litigations. Social groups lacking recognition from chiefs therefore often lose land, whereas land areas of those persons recognised by chiefs are protected, sometimes even regardless of their 'citizenship' identity in project villages. The author argues that an understanding of how local social institutions and politics mediate investment in land will enrich analyses of processes of land dispossession. © 2014 ROAPE Publications Ltd.

AB  - In the coming few decades, global freshwater demand will increase to meet the growing demand for food, fibre and biofuel crops. Raising water productivity in agriculture, that is reducing the water footprint (WF) per unit of production, will contribute to reducing the pressure on the limited global freshwater resources. This study establishes a set of global WF benchmark values for a large number of crops grown in the world. The study distinguishes between benchmarks for the green-blue WF (the sum of rain- and irrigation water consumption) and the grey WF (volume of polluted water). The reference period is 1996-2005. We analysed the spatial distribution of the green-blue and grey WFs of different crops as calculated at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5′ with a dynamic water balance and crop yield model. Per crop, we ranked the WF values for all relevant grid cells from smallest to largest and plotted these values against the cumulative percentage of the corresponding production. The study shows that if we would reduce the green-blue WF of crop production everywhere in the world to the level of the best 25th percentile of current global production, global water saving in crop production would be 39% compared to the reference water consumption. With a reduction to the WF levels of the best 10th percentile of current global production, the water saving would be 52%. In the case that nitrogen-related grey WFs in crop production are reduced, worldwide, to the level of the best 25th percentile of current global production, water pollution is reduced by 54%. If grey WFs per ton of crop are further reduced to the level of the best 10th percentile of current production, water pollution is reduced by 79%. The benchmark values provide valuable information for formulating WF reduction targets in crop production. Further studies will be required to test the sensitivity of the benchmark values to the underlying model assumptions, to see whether regionalization of benchmarks is necessary and how certain WF benchmark levels relate to specific technology and agricultural practices. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Interest to harvest wild cyanobacteria exists due to the environmental and socioeconomic risks during cyanobacteria blooms coupled with demands for nonterrestrial-based alternatives for biofuel sources. This research, therefore, sought to estimate the wild cyanobacteria harvesting potential using Nodularia spumigena, and using the Baltic Sea as the case study. Data from literature provided during years 2003-2009 were used to perform estimations. Additional benefits of harvesting were also assessed by estimating the nutrient removal and biogas production potentials from the harvested biomass. Results indicate that one boom unit has the potential to harvest approximately 3 to 700 kg dry weight of N. spumigena per hour depending on the algae concentration of the bloom. Results also suggest that nutrient removal and biogas production potentials provide substantial additional incentives to the harvesting operation during years of extensive and highly concentrated blooms. However, during nonextensive or nonconcentrated blooms such potentials are low. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2014.

AB  - Palm oil has been a major symbol of colonial Congo as produced by European companies from the fruit picked by African villagers, mostly in natural palm groves. Traditional food for the Congolese population, palm oil only became a major export product when Lever, the British soap maker, was assigned large concessions in the centre of the country in 1911. Later, a large number of smaller companies, Belgian or Portuguese, gained a monopoly on the purchase of fruit in palm oil areas. Factories, social, medical, school facilities and transport networks started to structure some territories, sometimes leading to a true regional construction, as in the Kwilu district. Yet the system presented a dark side: popular reaction movements (as the Pende revolt in 1931) resulting from constraints in recruitment; land litigation due to the assignment of vast concessions; exclusion of Africans from the management; freezing of evolution in village agriculture. Although the Congo had become the first African exporter of palm oil and the second at world scale in the 1950s, the system failed to induce a true development process. The second part of the paper examines the deterioration of the system with decolonization: abandonment of most of the oil palm mills and large plantations; departure of big companies partially recovered by local contractors; deconstruction of structures and facilities. Oil export ceased at the end of the last century. Nowadays the industrial production can no longer ensure the supply of soap factories but an artisanal system of palm oil extraction in villages covers most of the urban needs. The third part is devoted to future prospects: improvement of artisanal production; possible revival of agro-industrial production favoured by a growth in world demand; arrival of new investors (notably from Asia) and emergence of new uses - notably as biofuel-but the destruction of forests and land monopolization by foreign companies are a matter of concern. © NCG with the SRBG.

AB  - Biodiesel from jatropha has been considered as a promising alternative to fossil fuels for some time. Consequently, China started promoting jatropha as one of the options to meet its ever-increasing energy consumption, and the Chinese biodiesel industry also gained interest. However, the excitement of the biofuel industry in jatropha faded after it did not bring about the expected results. This article investigates the stagnation in jatropha development and production for biodiesel in China, using two detailed case studies of jatropha biofuel production in southeast China. It is found that the underdeveloped biodiesel policy and regulation, such as a rather late formulation of standards for biodiesel (especially the B5) and the absence of mandatory targets, is an important reason for hampering jatropha development. Besides that, lack of financial support undermined sustained jatropha planting at the farm level and lack of sustained commitment from state-owned enterprises or private companies over a long time span further contributed to jatropha project's failure. Better implementation of the rule of law, mandatory blending requirements, hazard insurance, as well as continuous financial support, might improve the continuation of jatropha plantation schemes. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Jatropha is the latest in a list of "miracle crops" that have been promoted in southern Africa for their perceived development benefits. This was based on promises of high yields, low water requirement, ability to grow on marginal land and lack of competition with food. In less than 10 years, tens of thousands of hectares were acquired for jatropha plantations and thousands of hectares were planted, most of which are now unused or abandoned. Overestimations of jatropha yields coupled with underestimations of the management costs have probably been the prime contributors to the collapse of most jatropha projects in southern African. However, a few projects still survive and show signs of possible long-term sustainability. We consider two such projects, a smallholder-based project in Malawi and a large-scale plantation in Mozambique. Though their long-term sustainability is not proven, both projects may increase resilience by diversifying household income streams and contributing to national fuel security. By identifying what seems to be working in these projects we provide insights as to why other projects may have failed in southern Africa and whether there is still place for jatropha in the region. In essence can jatropha still enhance local/national resilience or are jatropha's benefits just a myth?. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Agaves exhibit the water-conserving crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway. Some species are potential biofuel feedstocks because they are highly productive in seasonally dry landscapes. In plants with CAM, high growth rates are often believed to be associated with a significant contribution of C3 photosynthesis to total carbon gain when conditions are favourable. There has even been a report of a shift from CAM to C3 in response to overwatering a species of Agave. We investigated whether C3 photosynthesis can contribute substantially to carbon uptake and growth in young and mature Agave angustifolia collected from its natural habitat in Panama. In wellwatered plants, CO2 uptake in the dark contributed about 75% of daily carbon gain. This day/night pattern of CO2 exchange was highly conserved under a range of environmental conditions and was insensitive to intensive watering. Elevated CO2 (800 ppm) stimulated CO2 fixation predominantly in the light. Exposure to CO2-free air at night markedly enhanced CO2 uptake during the following light period, but CO2 exchange rapidly reverted to its standard pattern when CO2 was supplied during the subsequent 24 h. Although A. angustifolia consistently engages in CAM as its principal photosynthetic pathway, its relatively limited photosynthetic plasticity does not preclude it from occupying a range of habitats, from relatively mesic tropical environments in Panama to drier habitats in Mexico. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Within a few years following its ambitious promotion in 2006, the development of jatropha in Indonesia came to a halt. Claimed as a potential solution to problems in energy and poverty, the introduction of jatropha in Indonesia's energy policy had been triggered by the high oil prices in 2005. While studies by biofuel scholars have generally focused on what brought the end of the "miracle crop" hype by underlining various technical problems and the absence of market structure as the cause of its failure, few have examined jatropha as part of a policy-making trajectory, which began with, and was influenced by, the development narratives disseminated by individual actors. This article sheds light on the role of elite actors in the making of biofuel energy policy in Indonesia. Taking the case of the promotion of jatropha in 2005-2007, the article illustrates the role of the director of Indonesia's leading sugar state-owned enterprise (SOE), Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia (RNI), whose decision in promoting jatropha became influential in forwarding its narratives into the national energy and development policy in 2006. In order to discover why a specific elite actor decided to promote jatropha, the article relies on data, including the SOE's documents and interviews with key actor(s). The analysis is conducted using an actor-oriented approach, which underlines the discrepancy between the ideals and the operational practice of developmental goals. © 2014 by the author.

AB  - Ensuring increased and sustainable biomass production is critical for European countries. Short-rotation coppice (SRC) plantations on agricultural lands have a great potential to increase biomass supply for biofuels, bioenergy, and bioproducts. In Italy, SRC is based on the use of fast growing species, high planting density, and short harvesting cycles. In this study, the performance of new genotypes to be used in SRC plantations for biomass production was evaluated after three biennial rotations. At the trial plantation in Mira (Northern Italy), six different poplar (Populus) genotypes, belonging to different interspecific hybrids were studied. This plantation provided the opportunity to study the relationships between survival, biomass production and other growth parameters over multiple rotations and for a wide genotypic range. Biomass production differed significantly among rotations starting from 16Mgha-1year-1 in the first, peaking at 20Mgha-1year-1 in the second, and decreasing to 17Mgha-1year-1 in the third rotation. At the end of each rotation, significant differences among genotypes were observed in number of shoots per stool and per ha, stem diameter, tree height, and biomass production. Mean survival rates became significantly different from the other rotations only in the third rotation during which survival rate ranged from 95% for (P.×generosa)×P. nigra 'Monviso' to 75% for (P.×generosa)×P. nigra 'AF6', but non-significant difference was observed among genotypes. Skewness and inequality of shoot size distributions were genotype-dependent and increased with rotations. Highest biomass production was found for genotypes P.×canadensis '83.148.041', 'Monviso' and (P.×generosa)×P. trichocarpa 'AF8' with mean annual dry mass production of 21.7, 19.5 and 19.3Mgha-1year-1, respectively. Genotype×rotation interactions were significant on shoot size, diameter and number, but not on survival and biomass production highlighting that genotypes behaved differently over rotations. Moisture and ash content, wood specific gravity, and higher heating value were determined at the end of the third biennial rotation, and significant differences among genotypes were found. This study is critical for investigating the behavior of novel poplar genotypes with potential for commercial biomass production over multiple coppice rotations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Agave angustifolia Haw., a leaf-succulent constitutive crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant of tropical Panama, we tested whether nocturnal CO2 uptake and growth were reduced at night temperatures above 20°C. Unlike some CAM model species from habitats with pronounced day-night temperature variations, in A. angustifolia temperature affected little the relative contributions of CAM and C3 photosynthesis to growth. In plants grown under 12h light/dark regimes of 25/17, 30/22 and 35/27°C, biomass increased with temperature. Maintaining day temperature at 35°C and reducing night temperature from 27 to 17°C markedly lowered growth, a reduction partially reversed when roots were heated to 27°C. Across all treatments, whole-shoot δ13C values ranged between -14.6 and -13.2 ‰, indicating a stable proportion of CO2 was fixed at night, between 75 and 83%. Nocturnal acidification reflected growth, varying between 339 and 393mol H+ g-1 fresh mass and 63-87mol H+ cm-2. In outdoor open-top chambers, warming the air 3°C above ambient at night did not reduce biomass accumulation. The persistence of a high capacity for nocturnal CO2 fixation at the expense of a limited capacity for switching between C3 and CAM probably makes this Agave, and others like it, potential species for biomass production in seasonally-dry landscapes. © CSIRO 2014.

AB  - Microalgae are considered to be a promising alternative feedstock for next generation biofuels because of their rapid photosynthetic growth rates and less impact on land-use. In this study, we employed a series of laboratory microcosm experiments to explore effects of temperature on growth and cell characteristics of 12 species. The research results indicted a wide range of responses of population demographic rates and physiology of phytoplankton cells to temperature. Chlorophyta could grow at a wide range of temperature from 15 to 35 °C, with the optimum temperature of 20 to 30 °C, mainly around 25 °C; whereas cyanobacteria had a higher tolerance to high temperature than chlorophyta, the optimum temperature for growth was between 30 and 35 °C. At the optimum temperature, most species (mainly large-sized green algae) generally showed grow rapidly with slightly high lipid and chlorophyll a contents in algal cell, whereas chlorophyll a content in algal cell was not completely determined by algal size and volume. In conclusion the study identifies key tradeoffs among functional traits to determine the suitability of diverse algal species as biofuel feedstock, further to provide scientific basis on screening successfully the potential candidate species for use in bio-oil production under temperature stress.

AB  - Liquid biofuels can provide a much needed substitute for fossil fuels used in the transport sector. They can contribute to climate and other environmental goals, energy security and economic development. However, in order to achieve such objectives many difficulties and challenges must be overcome. In the present study, we consider these issues from the view of realizing of global sustainability. In this paper, we first give the definition of sustainable development, then economic and environmental sustainability of biofuel are discussed. Finally, the social dimensions of biofuel sustainability are prospected.

AB  - The use of biomasses is becoming increasingly appealing alternative, to give an partial solution lack of energy, with an ecofriendly approach, having on sugarcane a solid fundament; that receives the new and valuable complement of the innovative concept of the biorefineries it is productive installations, that can be summarized as to reach the higher overall yield from the raw materials, with the lowest environmental impact, at minimum energy input and giving the maximum of the energy output. The biorefinery is the true valuable option of a wide diversification, with by-products like the single cell protein and biogas from the distillery vinasse, new oxidants like methanol, second generation biofuels, biobutanol, etc. In this context this paper presents a study of five different configurations of biorefineries. Each case study being a system based on an autonomous distillery or sugar mill with an annexed distillery and coproduction of methanol from bagasse. The paper includes the use of sugarcane harvest residues (mainly straw) and a BIG-GT plant (Biomass Integrated Gasification-Gas Turbine) as alternatives to fulfill the energy demands of the complex. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The total area of short rotation coppice (SRC) in Germany has increased to about 6000ha in the last decade, without the benefit of subsidies. About 15% of Germany's total SRC area is in Bavaria. Up to now, the main focus of studies of SRC has been on experimental sites. Hence, as yet there have been no studies analyzing the sites used to cultivate SRC commercially, the management practices used, or the characteristics of the farmers who cultivate SRC. To fill this knowledge gap, we used a standardized questionnaire to gather information about SRC operators in Bavaria and their SRCs. SRC farmers differed from farmers who did not grow SRC: They had larger farms, often farmed organically, and the proportion of land they leased from other owners was lower. Furthermore, the relative forest area of SRC farmers was greater, whereas the relative area of permanent grassland was lower. The sites used for SRC cultivation showed below-average land rents, but generally were well supplied with water. The tree species cultivated in 98% of the cases was poplar. Biomass was predominantly harvested motor-manually after five to ten years for use in private wood chip heating systems. The use of marginal lands with sufficient water supply for biomass production with SRC in relatively long rotation cycles seems to be a favorable method of biomass production in southern Germany. This management practice on marginal land might be interesting for other countries because the competition with food production is low. However, economic analyses are needed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The European Commission proposed amendments to the Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC, which call for the inclusion of indirect changes in land use (iLUC) to the estimated volume of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the life cycle of transportation biofuels. The paper investigates possible emissions reductions in the life cycle of biodiesel (FAME) according to six scenarios with special focus on iLUC. Including iLUC for rapeseed biodiesel production in Poland results in GHG emission reduction lower than the required 50% starting from January 2017. However, in some rapeseed growing regions, at least 50% emission threshold can be achieved when reduced tillage (małopolskie, opolskie, pomorskie and zachodniopomorskie) or no-tillage (małopolskie, opolskie, podkarpackie, pomorskie, śla{ogonek}skie and zachodniopomorskie) is applied. All these regions are located in temperate moist climate region, which is combined with higher level of soil organic carbon sequestration compared to dry climate.It was estimated that when including iLUC in the calculations of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural sector in Poland can produce 548 thousand ton of rapeseed, which meets the Directive 2009/28/EC sustainability criteria (50% GHG emission reductions), under the condition that improvement of agricultural management (soil carbon accumulation) will occur. This production can supply 202 thousand tons of FAME, which would amount to 33% of transport fuel from renewable energy sources by 2020, according to National Renewable Energy Action Plan. After 2020, the additional amount of transportation fuels required by the Directive 2009/28/EC will have to be derived from another biofuels or renewable energy sources.

AB  - Concerns regarding the environmental and economic sustainability of petroleum based transportation fuels, including jet fuel, are driving interest into alternative fuels. The development of viable alternatives could provide benefits in terms of energy diversity thus reducing dependence on any given nation for our energy needs. This manuscript examines the drivers for alternative fuels in the light of the needs of aviation and it provides criteria wherein potential alternative jet fuels can be compared. A wide range of transportation fuels was qualitatively examined using these criteria. Because of concerns regarding their safe use and the energy efficiency loss that would be inherent in their use, alcohols and biodiesel are better suited for ground transportation. Cryogenic fuels are not feasible in the near term because of the large existing aircraft and airport infrastructure that is incompatible with these fuels. Synthetic fuels offer aviation with a wide range of potential feedstocks that could augment or potentially replace petroleum, but concerns regarding the economic cost of production and the current lack of feedstock availability limits their near term availability to aviation. © 2014.

AB  - The food commodity price inflation beginning in 2001 and culminating in the food crisis of 2007/08, and which returned in 2010, reflects a combination of several factors including economic growth, biofuel expansion, exchange rate fluctuations, and energy price inflation. To quantify these influence we developed an empirical model that also included crop inventory adjustments, a factor that is underemphasized in the literature. The study shows that, if inventory effects are not taken into account, the impacts of the various factors on food commodity price inflation would be overestimated. Although our model explains most of the price fluctuation observed in 2001-2011, it is not able to explain all of it. Other factors, such as speculation, trade policy and weather shocks, which are not included in the analysis, might be responsible for the remaining contribution to the food commodity price increase. © 2014.

AB  - For energy security, air pollution concerns, coupled with the desire to sustain the agricultural sector and revitalize the rural economy, many countries have applied ethanol as oxygenate or fuel to supplement or replace gasoline in transportation sector. Because of abundant feedstock resources and effective reduction of green-house-gas emissions, the cellulosic ethanol has attracted great attention. With a couple of pioneers beginning to produce this biofuel from biomass in commercial quantities around the world, it is necessary to solve engineering problems and complete the economic assessment in 2015-2016, gradually enter the commercialization stage. To avoid "competing for food with humans and competing for land with food", the 1st generation fuel ethanol will gradually transit to the 2nd generation cellulosic ethanol. Based on the overview of cellulosic ethanol industrialization from domestic and abroad in recent years, the main engineering application problems encountered in pretreatment, enzymes and enzymatic hydrolysis, pentose/hexose co-fermentation strains and processes, equipment were discussed from chemical engineering and biotechnology perspective. The development direction of cellulosic ethanol technology in China was addressed. © 2014 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved.

AB  - A northern adapted sugar maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid was bred by crossing temperate. ×. tropical maize for bioethanol production. Temperate. ×. tropical maize (TTM) has a prolonged vegetative growth and accumulates more sugar in the stalk compared to its respective tropical and temperature parents (White et al., 2012). In this study, the sugar concentration in the stalk was further increased by preventing pollination by shoot bagging (covering) ears. It was observed that starch content was eliminated and sugar content increased to 30.1% (w/w) in the stalks. The whole plant biomass (grain, sugars and stover) was evaluated for ethanol production. Ethanol produced from sugars and starch was comparable from milk (R3) to dent (R5) reproductive growth stages between pollinated and non-pollinated TTM, indicating that soluble sugar contents increased correspondingly with decreased starch contents. Temperate. ×. tropical maize samples from both pollinated and non-pollinated treatments had high extractives. Glucan and xylan percentages were increased in non-pollinated extractive free samples. Ethanol produced from cellulosic material was similar for both treatments. The total ethanol yield (from starch, sugar and stover) was comparable from milk (R3) to dent (R5) stages and ranged from 0.20 to 0.22. g/g biomass. The pollinated TTM produced higher biomass in the field and resulted in 624.7. gal of ethanol per acre of land. Future research in TTM could be focused on increasing biomass yield of non-pollinated TTM. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rotational perennial grass/clover has multiple effects in cropping systems dominated by cereals. This study evaluated the environmental impact of rotational grass/clover ley for anaerobic digestion in a cereal-dominated grain production system in Sweden. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare two scenarios: (i) a cropping system including only spring barley and winter wheat; and (ii) a cropping system including 2-year grass/clover ley in combination with spring barley and winter wheat. The functional unit was one tonne of grain. The two main functions of the grass/clover crop were to provide feedstock for biogas production and to act as an organic fertiliser for allocation among the cereal crops in the rotation. Special consideration was given to nitrogen (N) management and the rotational effects of the grass/clover ley. In total, 73% of the N requirement of cereals in the ley scenario was met through symbiotic N fixation. Replacing diesel with biogas and mineral fertiliser with digested grass/clover biomass (digestate) reduced the use of fossil fuels substantially, from 1480. MJ per tonne in the reference scenario to -2900. MJ per tonne in the ley scenario. Potential eutrophication per tonne grain increased in the ley scenario, mainly owing to significantly higher ammonia emissions from spreading digestate and the larger area required for producing the same amount of grain. Potential acidification also increased when N mineral fertiliser was replaced by digestate. Crops relying on symbiotic N fixation are a promising feedstock for reducing the use of non-renewable energy in the production chain of farm-based bioenergy, but careful handling of the N-rich digestate is required. Replacing cereals intended for feed or food with bioenergy crops leads to indirect land use changes (iLUC) when the displaced crops must be produced elsewhere and the benefits obtained when biofuels replace fossil fuels may thereby be outweighed. In this study, the iLUC factor assumed had a critical effect on global warming potential in the ley scenario. However, carbon sequestration and the higher yield potential of subsequent cereal crops can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from iLUC to a varying extent. We recommend that crop sequences rather than single crops be considered when evaluating the environmental impact of production systems that include perennial legumes for food, feed and bioenergy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Farmers' cropping decisions are a product of a complex mix of socio-economic, cultural, and natural environments in which factors operating at a number of different spatial scales affect how farmers ultimately decide to use their land in any given year or over a set of years. Some environmentalists are concerned that increased demand for corn driven by ethanol production is leading to conversion of non-cropland into corn production (which we label as "extensification"). Ethanol industry advocates counter that more than enough corn supply comes from crop switching to corn and increased yields (which we label as "intensification"). In this study, we determine whether either response to corn demand - intensification or extensification - is supported. This is determined through an analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) data that covers the state of Kansas and a measure of a corn demand shifter related to ethanol production - distance to the closest ethanol plant - between 2007 and 2009. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Differential Export Tax (DET) rates, or the policy of imposing high export taxes on raw commodities and low export taxes on processed goods, generate public revenues and promote production at the more processed stages of a value chain. We study the theoretical justification of this trade policy by designing a simple international trade model which shows that a tax on exports of a raw agricultural commodity in a country that exports seeds and vegetable oils increases the sum of final consumers' surplus, processing sector profits, farmers' surplus, and public revenues. We then develop a partial equilibrium model of the world's oilseed value chain and simulate the total elimination of DETs in Argentina and Indonesia, as well as the independent removal of export taxes at various stages of production in the same countries. Estimations show that removing export taxes along the entire value chain in Argentina and Indonesia reduces the local production of biofuels by only 0.4% in Argentina, while eliminating only the export tax on biofuels in Argentina leads to a 9.6% volume increase in Argentinean biofuels production. © The Author (2013).

AB  - The environmental benefits and trade-offs of automotive biofuels are well known, but less is known about aviation biofuels. We modeled the environmental impacts of three pathways for aviation biofuel in Australia (from microalgae, pongamia, and sugarcane molasses) using attributional life cycle assessments (LCAs), applying both economic allocation and system expansion. Based on economic allocation, sugarcane molasses has the better fossil energy ratio FER (1.7 MJ out/MJ in) and GHG abatement (73% less than aviation kerosene) of the three, but with trade-offs of higher water use and eutrophication potential. Microalgae and pongamia have lower FER and GHG abatement (1.0 and 1.1; 53% and 43%), but mostly avoid eutrophication and reduce water use trade-offs. All have similar and relatively low land use intensities. If produced on land where existing carbon stocks are not compromised, the sugarcane and microalgae pathways would currently meet a 50% GHG abatement requirement. Based on system expansion, microalgae and pongamia had lower impacts than sugarcane for all categories except energy input, highlighting the positive aspects of these next-generation feedstocks. The low fossil energy conservation potential of these pathways was found to be a drawback, and significant energy efficiencies will be needed before they can affect fossil energy conservation. Energy recovery from processing residues (base case) was preferable over use as animal feed (variant case), and crucial for favorable energy and GHG conservation. However this finding is at odds with the economic preferences identified in a companion technoeconomic study. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We argue that reading the local agricultural landscape is a prerequisite to understanding the plausible local impacts of external drivers for change, such as the introduction of new crops and technologies. Initially driven by a desire to understand the potential for small-scale farmers to produce jatropha biodiesel in a sustainable way, we started to examine how farmers related to trees in different parts of the agricultural landscape. This provided us with insights into small-scale processes of land enclosure and conversion, which indicate that agricultural intensification is taking place. We learned that although the landscape could in theory accommodate a lot of jatropha hedges around existing (maize dominated) arable land, farmers were only creating hedges around new fields, carved out in the grazing commons. Already well established within the settlement, jatropha can produce a range of different ecosystem services. However, our case study suggests that scalability is problematic: cultural ecosystem services can be provided at very limited levels of production; supporting ecosystem services require a certain scaling up of production; and provisioning ecosystem services, like biofuels, would require production to be increased well beyond any synergies with ongoing tree plantings or land conversion processes. © 2014 by the author(s).

AB  - This study describes the results obtained in the synthesis of a biofuel that avoids the production of glycerol by applying supported KF as alkaline heterogeneous catalyst, to generate two moles of fatty acid methyl esters and one mole of monoglyceride from one mol of triglyceride. In this respect, the selective transesterification process of sunflower oil with methanol was carried out with KF (10 wt%) supported on three different solids, Al2O3, ZnO and MgO. The standard experimental conditions employed in the heterogeneous selective methanolysis reaction were: 12 mL of sunflower oil, 2.7 mL of methanol, 0.8 g of catalyst, at 65 °C temperature and one hour of reaction time. In all cases 100% conversion was obtained, with high selectivity values, greater than 90%, and quite suitable viscosity values, 4.5-8.5 cSt. In this way, the best catalytic behavior in the first use was obtained by using Al2O3 as support. However, although in the five consecutive reuses all catalysts exhibited a continuous decrease in their catalytic activities; the lower one was for KF catalyst using MgO as support. In summary, these three KF supported catalysts are very suitable to obtain a new biofuel, similar to conventional biodiesel, applicable to diesel engines. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Bioenergy systems are an essential part of a renewable energy portfolio, particularly as only liquid biofuels can replace petroleum in key applications. Unlike fossil energy systems, bioenergy systems can potentially be sustainable, that is, able to operate indefinitely into the future. Based on our work and the work of others who have examined various sustainability aspects of bioenergy systems, we believe it is possible to operate these systems so that they are sustainably profitable, improve the welfare of local populations, and provide environmental benefits for local and global ecosystems. However achieving greater sustainability by deploying bioenergy systems will not occur without careful thought and consideration. Therefore we propose and apply a set of sustainability objectives for bioenergy systems that span the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the obstacles faced by Taiwan and other countries with limited arable land and limited biofuel feedstock in developing a biodiesel industry. Strategies to overcome these obstacles are proposed, including using non-crop feedstock, developing new technologies for manufacturing biodiesel, establishing a quality assurance system, increasing the proportion of biodiesel in blended fuels and increasing the economic value of the byproducts. Innovative technologies for either the cultivation of energy crops or biodiesel production could not only enhance local biofuel production, but also become an important export. The study also suggests that the biodiesel industry could only be developed on a sustainable manner if adequate strategies are enforced by taking into account the indirect land-use impacts as well as life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) has become one of the most rapidly expanding crops in the world. Many countries have promoted its cultivation as part of a broader rural development strategy aimed at generating paid work and producing both export commodities and biofuels. However, oil palm expansion has often occurred at the expense of ecosystems and subsistence agriculture, and on lands riddled with tenure conflicts. In this article, we analyse the implications of the combined effect of labouring in oil palm plantations and land access on households, and we discuss how these implications affect human well-being in two indigenous communities of the Polochic valley, Guatemala. Combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and land-time budget analysis at household level, we reveal how oil palm cultivation increases incomes for plantation workers' households, but decreases the productivity of maize cultivation, reduces the time that household members have available for other activities and, particularly, reduces women's resting time. In contrast, households that focus more intensively on maize cultivation show higher degrees of food security and women can allocate more time to social activities. However, our results also show that maize consumption per capita has not decreased in households working in oil palm plantations since such crop is considered sacred by the Q'eqchi' and plays a central role in their diet and culture. In conclusion, we argue that while working for an oil palm cultivation can increase specific elements of the basic material conditions for a good life, other aspects such as food security, health, freedom of choice, and social relationships can become deteriorated. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of enhancing the activity of iron-reducing bacteria (IRBs) to increase the biomethanation rate of waste activate sludge (WAS). The effects of biostimulation by ferric oxyhydroxide (Phase 2) and bioaugmentation with an enriched IRB consortium (Phase 3) were examined in a continuous anaerobic reactor treating WAS. Compared to the control operation (Phase 1), significant rises in methane yield (10.8-59.4%) and production rate (24.5-52.9%) were demonstrated by the biostimulation and bioaugmentation treatments. Visible structural changes were observed in bacterial community with the phases while not in archaeal community. Acinetobacter- and Spirochaetales-related populations were likely the major players driving anaerobic iron respiration and thus leading to enhanced biomethanation performance, in Phases 2 and 3, respectively. Our results suggest an interesting new potential for enhancing biomethanation of WAS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Some ecologists and environmentalists have asked whether existing plant invaders could be used as sources of lignocellulosic ethanol, as an alternative to the introduction of potentially invasive non-native energy crops. Although the idea is tempting and could theoretically motivate the control or eradication of large invasive populations, we recognize that a number of major economic, logistic, and legal barriers currently prevent adoption of this plan. Here, we enumerate these barriers in detail, but conclude with an idealistic vision for the role of invasive biomass in the bioenergy industry. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The effects of land-use change (LUC) on soil carbon (C) balance has to be taken into account in calculating the CO2 savings attributed to bioenergy crops1-3. There have been few direct field measurements that quantify the effects of LUC on soil C for the most common land-use transitions into sugar cane in Brazil, the world's largest producer 1-3. We quantified the C balance for LUC as a net loss (carbon debt) or net gain (carbon credit) in soil C for sugar-cane expansion in Brazil. We sampled 135 field sites to 1 m depth, representing three major LUC scenarios. Our results demonstrate that soil C stocks decrease following LUC from native vegetation and pastures, and increase where cropland is converted to sugar cane. The payback time for the soil C debt was eight years for native vegetation and two to three years for pastures. With an increasing need for biofuels and the potential for Brazil to help meet global demand4, our results will be invaluable for guiding expansion policies of sugar-cane production towards greater sustainability. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Switchgrass produces high amounts of biomass that can be used for solid biofuel production. In this study, the dry biomass yield vs. N-P-K nutrient uptake relations as well as the N-mineralization and the N-fertilization recovery fraction for switchgrass (cv. Alamo) were determined under field conditions for three N-fertilization (0, 80 and 160kgha-1) and for two irrigation (0 and 250mm) levels, in two soils in central Greece with rather different moisture status over the period 2009-2012. It was found that dry biomass yield on the aquic soil may reach 27-30tha-1 using supplemental irrigation, and remain at high levels (19-24tha-1) without irrigation. In the xeric soil, however, lower biomass yields of 14-15tha-1 may be produced with supplemental irrigation. The average N-concentration varies between 0.23% in stems and 1.10% in leaves, showing the very low needs in N. P-content varies between 0.16% in leaves and 0.03% in stems, whereas K-content fluctuates between 0.67% and 0.78%. Linear biomass yield-nutrient uptake relationships were found with high R2, pointing to nutrient use efficiencies of 240 and 160kgkg-1, for N and K respectively. The base N-uptake ranged 70-84kgha-1 in the aquic to 60kgha-1 or less in the xeric soil. N-recovery fraction was about 30% in the aquic soil and lower in the xeric. Therefore, switchgrass is very promising for biomass production and its introduction in land use systems (especially in aquic soils of similar environments) should be seriously taken into consideration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bio-oils and bio-chars were obtained from sewage sludge (SS) by liquefaction with ethanol (or acetone) as the solvent at the temperature of 280, 320 and 360. °C. The migration and transformation of HMs as Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni during liquefaction were thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the environmental risk of HMs in the bio-oils and bio-chars was assessed according to the risk assessment code (RAC). The results showed that the liquefaction solvent and temperature significantly affected the redistribution of HMs. HMs distributed mainly into the bio-chars, with less than 10% into the bio-oils. Increasing liquefaction temperature would promote a higher HM content in bio-oils. The environmental risk of HMs in bio-chars was mitigated compared to SS, especially for Ni. However, the environmental risk of Zn and Ni in bio-oils was undesirably high in comparison with bio-chars. It was suggested that the bio-oil should be pretreated before utilization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pine chemicals are the oldest and largest renewable chemicals industries, and pine monoterpenes are excellent feedstocks for advanced biofuels. The available supply of pine terpenes constrains expansion of the pine chemicals and biofuel industry, creating a market opportunity for recovery of additional pine terpenes. Tapping live pine trees to recover pine terpenes, oleoresin, is an important economic activity in many parts of the world. In this study, the economic benefits to landowners of borehole oleoresin tapping for different planted slash pine management regimes in the southern U.S. were analyzed. The results show that landowners can diversify outputs and benefit economically from inclusion of oleoresin recovery from live trees without compromising wood for traditional markets. The greatest relative contribution of oleoresin to total returns is from stands with the improved genetic potential to double oleoresin yield. Stands with faster tree growth, due to increased genetic or site potential, produce the second highest present value of oleoresin primarily because these stands can be tapped at earlier ages. The relative contribution of oleoresin benefits to total economic revenues is the same from stands planted with one-third fewer trees per ha, again because borehole tapping can start at earlier ages. Importantly, the additional revenue from oleoresin tapping offset losses in value from timber that occurs when rotations are extended 3-4 years beyond optimal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When net deforestation declines in the tropics, attention will be drawn to the composition and structure of the retained, restored, invaded, and created forests. At that point, the seemingly inexorable trends toward increased intensities of exploitation and management will be recognized as having taken their tolls of biodiversity and other forest values. Celebrations when a country passes this 'forest transition' will then be tempered by realization that what has been accepted as 'forest' spans the gamut from short-rotation mono-clonal stands of genetically engineered trees to fully protected old growth natural forest. With management intensification, climate change, species introductions, landscape fragmentation, fire, and shifts in economics and governance, forests will vary along gradients of biodiversity, novelty of composition, stature, permanence, and the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces. Management intensity will increase with the increased availability of financial capital associated with economic globalization, scarcity of wood and other forest products, demand for biofuels, improved governance (e.g., security of property rights), improved accessibility, and technological innovations that lead to new markets for forest products. In a few places, the trend toward land-use intensification will be counterbalanced by recognition of the many benefits of natural and semi-natural forests, especially where forest-fate determiners are compensated for revenues foregone from not intensifying management. Land-use practices informed by research designed and conducted by embedded scientists will help minimize the tradeoffs between the financial profits from forest management and the benefits of retention of biodiversity and the full range of environmental services. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - This paper connects the biofuels literature with the genetic modifications literature by considering the potential of genetic modifications for increasing the efficiency of the cellulosic biofuels production. This is done for one particular case through analyzing the effect of genetically modified corn adoption on the overall yields of corn for silage. Our econometric model confirms that the use of genetically modified corn with the inserted MON810 gene increases the overall corn biomass yield in the production and environmental conditions of the Central Europe, in particular in the Czech Republic.

AB  - Many economically important crops have large and complex genomes that hamper their sequencing by standard methods such as whole genome shotgun (WGS). Large tracts of methylated repeats occur in plant genomes that are interspersed by hypomethylated gene-rich regions. Gene-enrichment strategies based on methylation profiles offer an alternative to sequencing repetitive genomes. Here, we have applied methyl filtration with McrBC endonuclease digestion to enrich for euchromatic regions in the sugarcane genome. To verify the efficiency of methylation filtration and the assembly quality of sequences submitted to gene-enrichment strategy, we have compared assemblies using methyl-filtered (MF) and unfiltered (UF) libraries. The use of methy filtration allowed a better assembly by filtering out 35% of the sugarcane genome and by producing 1.5× more scaffolds and 1.7× more assembled Mb in length compared with unfiltered dataset. The coverage of sorghum coding sequences (CDS) by MF scaffolds was at least 36% higher than by the use of UF scaffolds. Using MF technology, we increased by 134× the coverage of gene regions of the monoploid sugarcane genome. The MF reads assembled into scaffolds that covered all genes of the sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), 97.2% of sugarcane expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 92.7% of sugarcane RNA-seq reads and 98.4% of sorghum protein sequences. Analysis of MF scaffolds from encoded enzymes of the sucrose/starch pathway discovered 291 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the wild sugarcane species, S. spontaneum and S. officinarum. A large number of microRNA genes was also identified in the MF scaffolds. The information achieved by the MF dataset provides a valuable tool for genomic research in the genus Saccharum and for improvement of sugarcane as a biofuel crop. © 2014 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Although recent nucleotide sequencing technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of microbial genomes, the function of ~35% of genes identified in a genome currently remains unknown. To improve the understanding of microbial genomes and consequently of microbial processes it will be crucial to assign a function to this "genomic dark matter." Due to the urgent need for additional carbohydrate-active enzymes for improved production of transportation fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, we screened the genomes of more than 5,500 microorganisms for hypothetical proteins that are located in the proximity of already known cellulases. We identified, synthesized and expressed a total of 17 putative cellulase genes with insufficient sequence similarity to currently known cellulases to be identified as such using traditional sequence annotation techniques that rely on significant sequence similarity. The recombinant proteins of the newly identified putative cellulases were subjected to enzymatic activity assays to verify their hydrolytic activity towards cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass. Eleven (65%) of the tested enzymes had significant activity towards at least one of the substrates. This high success rate highlights that a gene context-based approach can be used to assign function to genes that are otherwise categorized as "genomic dark matter" and to identify biomass-degrading enzymes that have little sequence similarity to already known cellulases. The ability to assign function to genes that have no related sequence representatives with functional annotation will be important to enhance our understanding of microbial processes and to identify microbial proteins for a wide range of applications. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Microalgae are highly efficient primary producers that can be grown in most types of water on non-arable land as a promising source of biofuel. However, large-scale microalgal biofuel production is currently uneconomical due to slow growth of high-percentage oleaginous algae and large harvesting costs. Here we present a new strategy, using a small dose of externally applied UV-C radiation, that significantly increases lipid contents of fast growing microalgae and that at higher doses also results in rapid settling. The procedure essentially separates biomass growth from lipid accumulation and harvesting which was tested in several microalgal strains and optimized to be completed within 48 h for Tetraselmis sp. using pilot-scale outdoor cultivation. This process resulted in a significant increase of both volumetric and areal lipid productivity with higher polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, while considerably reducing harvesting costs. Other benefits include control of co-cultured microbes and sanitized water for recirculation. UV-C-mediated lipid induction and settling (LIS) may contribute to commercial microalgal biofuel production. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

AB  - The volatility of petroleum reserves and prices coupled with concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has created worldwide interest in renewable fuels. Little is known, however, about the impact on natural resources of growing oilseed crops for biofuel. This study examined the impact of growing oilseed crops in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations on wind erosion and emissions of particles ≤10 mm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) in eastern Washington, where atmospheric PM10 is an acute environmental concern. Wind erosion and PM10 emissions were measured immediately after sowing winter wheat in a winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) rotation, a winter wheat-camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz]-summer fallow (WW-C-SF) rotation, and a winter wheat-safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)-summer fallow (WW-S-SF) rotation. Best management practices were implemented during the 13-mo fallow phase of the rotation, which included undercutting and fertilizing the soil in spring and rodweeding during summer to control weeds. A wind tunnel was used to assess horizontal sediment and PM10 flux after sowing wheat because this is the time when the soil is most susceptible to wind erosion. Horizontal sediment and PM10 flux were as much as 250% higher after sowing winter wheat in the WW-C-SF and WW-S-SF rotations than the WW-SF rotation. Vertical PM10 flux was higher in the WW-C-SF and WW-S-SF rotations, in part due to the aerodynamically smoother surface of these rotations compared with the WW-SF rotation. Farmers must be especially judicious in protecting the soil from wind erosion during the fallow phase of the WW-C-SF and WW-S-SF rotations. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Increasing interest for use of biomass both for biofuels and materials replacing fossil resources gives increasing reason to make sure that we optimally use available bioresources. Biomass resources should preferably be converted to a maximum of beneficial products with a minimum of harm to the environment. From the second law of thermodynamics we might conclude that the most efficient, and therefore perhaps the most sustainable, utilization of available resources should be the one generating the least amount of entropy. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the entropy production of a process could be used for performance assessment of biomass conversion processes and to explore its implications as a possible aggregated measure for sustainability assessment of such processes. The investigated methodology includes calculation of entropy generation due to both material and energy dispersal and also due to mixing effect of emissions in the environment. The methodology is tested in a case study of the Integrated Biomass Utilization System (IBUS) in Denmark and its different process routes for bioethanol production with several co-products. The impact of energy integrating the IBUS plant with a coal power plant is also assessed to investigate how the assessment outcome is changed by such system changes. The entropy assessment results are compared with an evaluation using traditional LCA methodology. The results from the case study highlight the importance of well integrated and well optimized systems for utilization of biomass. The correlation between the results of entropy generation and weighted environmental load in this case suggest that entropy generation as assessment tool is worth further exploration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine the social desirability of renewable diesel production from imported palm oil in the EU when greenhouse gas emissions are taken into account. Using a partial market equilibrium model, we also study the sectoral social welfare effects of a biofuel policy consisting of a blend mandate in a small EU country (Finland), when palm oil based diesel is used to meet the mandated quota for biofuels. We develop a market equilibrium model for three cases: i) no biofuel policy, ii) biofuel policy consisting of socially optimal emission-based biofuel tax credit and iii) actual EU biofuel policy. Our results for the EU biofuel market, Southeast Asia and Finland show very little evidence that a large scale use of imported palm oil in diesel production in the EU can be justified by lower greenhouse gas emission costs. Cuts in emission costs may justify extensive production only if low or negative land-use change emissions result from oil palm cultivation and if the estimated per unit social costs of emissions are high. In contrast, the actual biofuel policies in the EU encourage the production of palm oil based diesel. Our results indicate that the sectoral social welfare effects of the actual biofuel policy in Finland may be negative and that if emissions decrease under actual biofuel policy, the emission abatement costs can be high regardless of the land use change emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is a bacterium that can produce ethanol by fermentation. Due to its unique metabolism and efficient ethanol production, Z. mobilis has attracted special interest for biofuel energy applications; an important area of study is the regulation of those specific metabolic pathways. Small RNAs (sRNAs) have been studied as molecules that function as transcriptional regulators in response to cellular stresses. While sRNAs have been discovered in various organisms by computational prediction and experimental approaches, their discovery in Z. mobilis has not yet been reported. In this study, we have applied transcriptome analysis and computational predictions to facilitate identification and validation of 15 novel sRNAs in Z. mobilis. We furthermore characterized their expression in the context of high and low levels of intracellular ethanol. Here, we report that 3 of the sRNAs (Zms2, Zms4, and Zms6) are differentially expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, when low and high ethanol productions are observed, respectively. Importantly, when we tested the effect of ethanol stress on the expression of sRNAs in Z. mobilis, Zms2, Zms6, and Zms18 showed differential expression under 5% ethanol stress conditions. These data suggest that in this organism regulatory RNAs can be associated with metabolic functions involved in ethanol stress responses. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Discourses on the fast-track land reform programme in Zimbabwe have produced multiple and contested knowledge. Current debates have addressed the increase in biofuel production, which has been pioneered by different state and non-state actors. This has led to debates about understanding who wields more power in terms of the regulation of the agro-based fuel industry at a time of land redistributive reforms in Zimbabwe. Little attention, however, has been given to the issue of water resources in the current biofuel production projects. By examining the large-scale production of Jatropha and sugar cane in Chisumbanje and Mwenezi districts in Zimbabwe, we seek to unravel how the new investors have accumulated land and water resources. We analyse how this lead to water competition between the communities, settled in Chisumbanje and Mwenezi, and the new biofuel actors. In the following discussion, we seek to answer the following questions. What is the configuration of the new politics of water and post-land reform in Zimbabwe and how has it been impacted by biofuel production? How has competing water interests impacted principles of Water Act (1998) in Zimbabwe as biofuel production requires the use of large volumes of water? How are water resources creating conflicts over access and use in these communities? What role do water institutions play in these circumstances? How are different smallholder farmers and new conglomerates sharing water in a tense environment especially after fast-track land reform? We use ethnographic fieldwork in Mwenezi district and archival research in the case of Chisumbanje to outline various debates and viewpoints related to these questions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Cyanobacteria have recently been receiving considerable attention owing to their potential as photosynthetic producers of biofuels and biomaterials. Here, we focused on the production of isoprenoids by cyanobacteria, and aimed to provide insight into metabolic engineering design. To this end, we examined the over-expression of a key enzyme in 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In the DXS-over-expression strain (Dxs_ox), the mRNA and protein levels of DXS were 4-times and 1.5-times the levels in the wild-type (WT) strain, respectively. The carotenoid content of the Dxs_ox strain (8.4mg/g dry cell weight [DCW]) was also up to 1.5-times higher than that in the WT strain (5.6mg/g DCW), whereas the glycogen content dramatically decreased to an undetectable level. These observations suggested that the carotenoid content in the Dxs_ox strain was increased by consuming glycogen, which is a C-storage compound in cyanobacteria. We also quantified the total sugar (145 and 104mg/g DCW), total fatty acids (31 and 24mg/g DCW) and total protein (200 and 240mg/g DCW) content in the WT and Dxs_ox strains, respectively, which were much higher than the carotenoid content. In particular, approximately 54% of the proteins were phycobiliproteins. This study demonstrated the major destinations of carbon flux in cyanobacteria, and provided important insights into metabolic engineering. Target yield can be improved through optimization of gene expression, the DXS protein stabilization, cell propagation depression and restriction of storage compound synthesis. © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

AB  - Although biodiesel is among the most studied biofuels for diesel engines, it is usually produced from edible oils, which gives way to controversy between the use of land for fuel and food. For this reason, residues like olive-pomace oil are considered alternative raw materials to produce biodiesel that do not compete with the food industry. To gain knowledge about the implications of its use, olive-pomace oil methyl ester, straight and blended with diesel fuel, was evaluated as fuel in a direct injection diesel engine Perkins AD 3-152 and compared to the use of fossil diesel fuel. Performance curves were analyzed at full load and different speed settings. To perform the exergy balance of the tested fuels, the operating conditions corresponding to maximum engine power values were considered. It was found that the tested fuels offer similar performance parameters. When straight biodiesel was used instead of diesel fuel, maximum engine power decreased to 5.6%, while fuel consumption increased up to 7%. However, taking into consideration the Second Law of the Thermodynamics, the exergy efficiency and unitary exergetic cost reached during the operation of the engine under maximum power condition for the assessed fuels do not display significant differences. Based on the exergy results, it may be concluded that olive-pomace oil biodiesel and its blends with diesel fuel may substitute the use of diesel fuel in compression ignition engines without any exergy cost increment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hypes about wonder crops raise critical questions about the actors and mechanisms that link optimistic narratives about the crops' potentials to actual production in the field. Jatropha curcas has been such a wonder crop, with a wide discrepancy between plans and reality. While many studies focus on agronomic or technological explanations of discrepancy and how to decrease it, much less is known about the influence of specific actors on creating a gap between high expectations and actual production in the field. This paper highlights the role of commercial brokers, who link potential investors and their capital to land and labor in the production areas. How have such commercial brokers contributed to perpetuating the optimism regarding the potentials of Jatropha plantations? The article presents the results of ethnographic research in a case study of commercial biofuel brokers at work in Sumba, one of the marginal areas in Indonesia targeted by policy makers for Jatropha cultivation. The study indicates that these actors have assembled their own short-term projects, translated narratives about future potential activities into the objects of trade in the present and produced optimistic figures about their projects to attract investors. In the conclusion, the paper warns against the unintended effects of green biofuel policies and discourses, when the latter get translated into a business opportunity for short-term private benefits instead of for the social and environmental goals for which the policies were originally intended. © 2014 by the author.

AB  - When the Canadian company Bedford Biofuels (BB) started talks with local ranch owners in Tana Delta district (Kenya) about subleasing their land for a large jatropha plantation, they were not the first ones to come to the region for a large-scale agricultural project. Nor were they the first to explore the possibilities of starting a jatropha plantation in Kenya's coastal area. By the time BB arrived, nature conservation and humanitarian NGOs had firmly established themselves as protectors of the ecologically fragile Tana river delta (now Ramsar site) and its residents, who were argued to be (even more) marginalized by large-scale agricultural projects. During the decision-making process, therefore, BB encountered stiffresistance from local NGOs, which had acquired the experience and the mechanisms to oppose or discourage a large-scale plantation. Additionally, BB was faced with a central government which gradually moved from a pro-jatropha stance to a more critical view of large-scale jatropha cultivation. Nevertheless, most of the local residents as well as the local government administration and the county council supported BB's plans to establish a large jatropha plantation. Although the deal was struck and the anti-jatropha campaign had ostensibly not prevailed, BB closed its plantation within the year. In the article, we analyze how discursive generalizations about foreign large-scale land acquisitions and in particular about large foreign jatropha plantations gradually undermined the legitimacy of the BB jatropha plantation in Tana Delta. To explore this question, the discussion focuses on analyzing the resources that account for the success of the anti-BB rhetoric and the interests that were involved in its production. These resources have been identified as local to global (I)NGO alliances; the use of e-media as a conduit for opposition rhetoric and the strategic use of rhetorical images and polemic. Each of the three phenomena will be explored for their conceptual dimensions and their rhetorical implications. We argue that the conservationist rhetoric compressed intermediality, the grid where ideologies and practices of different stakeholders intersect. Thus, it effectively narrowed the possibility for non-compatible stakeholders, such as Bedford Biofuels, to avoid conflict. This initiated a gradual erosion of the rationale of the BB jatropha project in Tana Delta, which eventually led to the closure of the jatropha project and the departure of Bedford Biofuels from the area. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - We investigate the hypothesis that the conversion of forest and pasture land to cropland in Brazil decreases yields by 50%. Such hypothesis is being used by the California Air Resource Board to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land use changes due to the expansion of biofuels production. We formulate several econometric models to test such hypothesis. The results from the majority of the models indicate that yields do not decrease under the expansion of cropland area in the country, or the decrease in yields is very small. Therefore, our results indicate the need for revising and correcting the parameters in the Californian low carbon emissions policy.

AB  - The growing interest about wood as fuel regards not only wood chips and pellets but also firewood, especially in mountain and rural areas where domestic heating plants are widely used. Due to the increased demand for firewood, harvesting activities have extended on broadleaved high forests as well as coppice. As a consequence, the diameter of logs has increased requiring larger and larger splitting machines; nowadays it is not uncommon to find on the market splitters able to process logs with diameter up to 50-60 cm. In order to increase the productivity, the effort of machine producers is directed to obtain the complete splitting of the log into firewood in only one step using multiple ways splitting knives. This technical solution may cause some drawbacks especially when the splitting knives are not properly adapted to the log diameter; it happens that the size of firewood is not homogeneous and splinters are produced, which requires using screens to separate them from the main product. In order to evaluate the work quality of a firewood processor, equipped with multiple ways splitting knives, an experimental test has been carried out using a machine in which the log diameter is automatically detected through a laser device; according to the log diameter the multiple ways splitting knives (formed by fixed and mobile knives, the latter hydraulically operated) is properly set up to obtain regularly sized firewood. Furthermore the log is automatically centred on the splitting knife set-up. The results of the experimental test showed that the firewood processor is able to produce firewood with homogeneous size and with a low production of splinters, regardless of log diameter. © R.

AB  - According to the sustainability principles, building should have zero-embodied energy in order to minimize the amount of carbon. In previous practices, construction materials have been composed with non-recyclable materials and after demolition of buildings the debris were put on different landfills. Nowadays, most of the material manufacturers have shifted their concerns to produce materials by using renewable resources, and also gained opportunity in utilizing wasted streams. The proposed biomaterials have been produced using natural fibers which reinforce biodegradable polymeric, in which naturally occurring aliphatic thermoplastic polyesters are produced by microbes via bacterial fermentation in carbon-rich environments. The composite material produced exhibits comparable properties to structural grade wood and is rapidly biodegradable in specific anaerobic conditions, at the end of its useful life. Using anaerobic digester sludge from local wastewater treatment plants as the biodegradation medium, the material decomposes into biogas that consists mostly of inert gases and, of particular interest, methane, which can be captured and used either as a biofuel or as a closed-loop carbon source. This paper documents bio-based composite material development, durability issues, anaerobic biodegradation, and potential industrial applications. © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.

AB  - This is the first article that econometrically estimates the global land-use change impact of bioenergy. Applying time-series analytical mechanisms to fuel, biofuel and agricultural commodity prices and production, we estimate the long-run relationship between energy prices, bioenergy production and the global land-use change. Our results suggest that rising energy prices and bioenergy production significantly contribute to the global land-use change both through the direct and indirect land-use change impact. Globally, the total agricultural area yearly increases by 35 578.1 thousand ha due to increasing oil price, and by 12 125.1 thousand ha due to increasing biofuel production, which corresponds to 0.73% and 0.25% of the total worldwide agricultural area, respectively. Soya land-use change and wheat land-use change have the highest elasticities with respect to both oil price and biofuel production. In contrast, nonbiomass crops (grassland and rice) have negative land-use change elasticities. Region-specific results suggest that South America faces the largest yearly total land-use change associated with oil price increase (+10 600.7 thousand ha), whereas Asia (+8918.6 thousand ha), South America (+4024.9 thousand ha) and North America (+1311.5 thousand ha) have the largest yearly total land-use change associated with increase in biofuel production. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase mediated transformations convert polyunsaturated fatty acids into various oxylipins. First, lipoxygenases catalyze fatty acid oxidation to fatty acid hydroperoxides. Subsequently, breakdown reactions result in a wide array of metabolites with multiple physiological and ecological functions. These fatty acid transformations are highly diverse in marine algae and play a crucial rule in e.g., signaling, chemical defense, and stress response often mediated through polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs). In this study, green tide-forming macroalgae of the genius Ulva (Chlorophyta) were collected at various sampling sites in the lagoon of the Ria Formosa (Portugal) and were surveyed for PUAs. We demonstrated that sea-lettuce like but not tube-like morphotypes produce elevated amounts of volatile C10-polyunsaturated aldehydes (2,4,7-decatrienal and 2,4-decadienal) upon tissue damage. Moreover, morphogenetic and phylogenetic analyses of the collected Ulva species revealed chemotaxonomic significance of the perspective biosynthetic pathways. The aldehydes are derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with 20 or 18 carbon atoms including eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3), arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6), stearidonic acid (C18:4 n-3), and γ-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-6). We present first evidences that lipoxygenase-mediated (11-LOX and 9-LOX) eicosanoid and octadecanoid pathways catalyze the transformation of C20- and C 18-polyunsaturated fatty acids into PUAs and concomitantly into short chain hydroxylated fatty acids. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: India's biofuel programme relies on ethanol production from sugarcane molasses. However, there is limited insight on environmental impacts across the Indian ethanol production chain. This study closes this gap by assessing the environmental impacts of ethanol production from sugarcane molasses in Uttar Pradesh, India. A comparative analysis with south-central Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is also presented to compare the performance of sugarcane molasses-based ethanol with sugarcane juice-based ethanol. Methods: The production process is assessed by a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. The multifunctionality problem is solved by applying two variants of system expansion and economic allocation. Environmental impacts are assessed with Impact 2002+ and results are presented at the midpoint level for greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable energy use, freshwater eutrophication and water use. Furthermore, results include impacts on human health and ecosystem quality at the damage level. Sensitivity analysis is also performed on key contributing parameters such as pesticides, stillage treatment and irrigation water use. Results and discussion: It is found that, compared to Brazilian ethanol, Indian ethanol causes lower or comparable greenhouse gas emissions (0.09-0.64 kgCO 2eq/kgethanolIN, 0.46-0.63 kgCO2eq/kg ethanolBR), non-renewable energy use (-0.3-6.3 MJ/kg ethanolIN, 1-4 MJ/kgethanolBR), human health impacts (3.6·10-6 DALY/kgethanolIN, 4·10 -6 DALY/kgethanolBR) and ecosystem impairment (2.5 PDF·m2·year/kgethanolIN, 3.3 PDF·m2·year/kgethanolBR). One reason is that Indian ethanol is exclusively produced from molasses, a co-product of sugar production, resulting in allocation of the environmental burden. Additionally, Indian sugar mills and distilleries produce surplus electricity for which they receive credits for displacing grid electricity of relatively high CO 2 emission intensity. When economic allocation is applied, the greenhouse gas emissions for Indian and Brazilian ethanol are comparable. Non-renewable energy use is higher for Indian ethanol, primarily due to energy requirements for irrigation. For water use and related impacts, Indian ethanol scores worse due groundwater irrigation, despite the dampening effect of allocation. The variation on greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use of Indian mills is much larger for high and low performance than the respective systems in Brazil. Conclusions: Important measures can be taken across the production chain to improve the environmental performance of Indian ethanol production (e.g. avoiding the use of specific pesticides, avoiding the disposal of untreated stillage, transition to water efficient crops). However, to meet the targets of the Indian ethanol blending programme, displacement effects are likely to occur in countries which export ethanol. To assess such effects, a consequential study needs to be prepared. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Substantial discussion exists concerning the best land use options for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on marginal land. Emissions-mitigating land use options include displacement of fossil fuels via biofuel production and afforestation. Comparing C recovery dynamics under these different options is crucial to assessing the efficacy of offset programs. In this paper, we focus on forest recovery on marginal land, and show that there is substantial inaccuracy and discrepancy in the literature concerning carbon accumulation. We find that uncertainty in carbon accumulation occurs in estimations of carbon stocks and models of carbon dynamics over time. We suggest that analyses to date have been largely unsuccessful at determining reliable trends in site recovery due to broad land use categories, a failure to consider the effect of current and post-restoration management, and problems with meta-analysis. Understanding of C recovery could be greatly improved with increased data collection on pre-restoration site quality, prior land use history, and management practices as well as increased methodological standardization. Finally, given the current and likely future uncertainty in C dynamics, we recommend carbon mitigation potential should not be the only environmental service driving land use decisions on marginal lands. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The production chain of biofuels from agricultural residues in Mexico is analyzed, considering the maximization of the energy produced, the overall costs minimization and the mitigation of CO2 emissions. An analysis tool was developed through a comprehensive MILP model that takes into account all aspects of the supply chain with real data to define robust alternatives to widen the country's energy portfolio. The mathematical model considers different technologies for converting the residues generated throughout the country into three possible products. The results show that an adequate combination of fermentation and gasification technologies, and the selection of appropriate sites to locate processing plants and suitable consumers for the biofuels produced, would result on the net production of around 237PJ per year of energy and enough ethanol to substitute all the Methyl Ter-Butyl Ether (MTBE) used in gasoline in México, while preventing the emission of around 11Tg of CO2 per year to the atmosphere. It is concluded that the use of agricultural residues as an energy source should be considered as a national policy in energy in which the state-owned oil company, PEMEX, can lead the project given its experience in logistics and nationwide presence, diversifying at the same time its portfolio of energy sources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ethanol is the most widely used renewable transportation biofuel in the United States, with the production of 13.3 billion gallons in 2012 [John UM (2013) Contribution of the Ethanol Industry to the Economy of the United States]. Despite considerable effort to produce fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, chemical pretreatment and the addition of saccharolytic enzymes before microbial bioconversion remain economic barriers to industrial deployment [Lynd LR, et al. (2008) Nat Biotechnol 26(2):169-172]. We began with the thermophilic, anaerobic, cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, which efficiently uses unpretreated biomass, and engineered it to produce ethanol. Here we report the direct conversion of switchgrass, a nonfood, renewable feedstock, to ethanol without conventional pretreatment of the biomass. This process was accomplished by deletion of lactate dehydrogenase and heterologous expression of a Clostridium thermocellum bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Whereas wild-type C. bescii lacks the ability to make ethanol, 70% of the fermentation products in the engineered strain were ethanol [12.8 mM ethanol directly from 2% (wt/vol) switchgrass, a real-world substrate] with decreased production of acetate by 38% compared with wild-type. Direct conversion of biomass to ethanol represents a new paradigm for consolidated bioprocessing, offering the potential for carbon neutral, cost-effective, sustainable fuel production.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing an interest in the potential role of perennial C4 grasses, such as switch grass (Panicum virgatum) in the US and miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) in Europe, as promising energy crops. Characteristics making perennial C4 grass attractive for biomass energy production are their high biomass yield potential, high lignocellulosic content, low input demand, and positive environmental impact. In Thailand, the Energy Regulatory Commission has established the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan to reduce fossil fuel usage by 25% over 10 years (2012-2021). One of its targets is to increase alternative energy production to 13,927 MW by 2021 from the present 7,294 MW. To meet this goal, approximately 8,400 MW of electricity is needed, which could be sustainably supplied through 221,760,000 tons of harvestable biomass each year, exploiting current land resources. Of the 221,760,000 tons of available biomass, napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) accounts for the majority. Napier grass originated from Africa where it is called Giant King Grass. This grass was introduced into Thailand over 30 years ago. After evaluating perennial grasses available in Thailand, 'Pakchong 1' napier grass has shown the greatest potential for biofuel production. In irrigated areas, napier grass provided up to 438-500 tons of fresh biomass ha-1 after harvesting 5-6 times per year. One ton of napier grass can produce 90 m3 of biogas. The heating value for compressed biogas (CBG) produced from its biomass is 14-18 MJ kg-1. The Royal Thai Government strengthened its support for renewable power generation from napier grass for two reasons: to generate electricity to feed the grid, and to produce CBG as an alternative for exhausting NGV and as a substitute LPG. However, since research on producing napier grass as a bioenergy source in Thailand is comparatively recent, there are still significant limitations for further development. The key challenges for napier grass production are the unavailability of a water supply source to allow high yield potential, need for the appropriate cultivars for given ecological conditions, and cost-effective management methods.

AB  - Purpose: Plevin et al. (2014) reviewed relevant life cycle assessment (LCA) studies for biofuels and argued that the use of attributional LCA (ALCA) for estimating the benefits of biofuel policy is misleading. While we agree with the authors on many points, we found that some of the arguments by the authors were not presented fairly and that a number of specific points warrant additional comment. The main objective of this commentary is to examine the authors' comparative statements between consequential LCA (CLCA) and ALCA. Methods: We examined the notion that the LCA world is divided into CLCA and ALCA. In addition, we evaluated the authors' notion of "wrong" models. Results: We found that the authors were comparing an idealized, hypothetical CLCA with average (or less than average), real-life ALCAs. Therefore, we found that the comparison alone cannot serve as the basis for endorsing real-life CLCAs for biofuel policy. We also showed that there are many LCA studies that do not belong to either of the two approaches distinguished by the authors. Furthermore, we found that the authors' notion of "wrong" models misses the essence of modeling and reveals the authors' unwarranted confidence in certain modeling approaches. Conclusions: Dividing the LCA world into CLCAs and ALCAs overlooks the studies in between and hampers a constructive dialog about the creative use of modeling frameworks. Unreasonable confidence in certain modeling approaches based on their "conceptual" superiority does not help support "robust decision making" that should ultimately land itself on the ground. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Alongside substantial biofuel development over the past decade, a vast number of assessments have also been produced. These have had an important influence upon biofuel discourse, policy and development, but they also vary in their methods, scope and quality. This makes it difficult to identify and evaluate assessments and to coordinate knowledge in a useful way. We applied a systematic evaluative framework to a set of 'key' assessments and conducted a workshop with expert producers and users to consider the quality and value of biofuel assessments. It was suggested that a more integrated approach to assessment is needed, perhaps with the establishment of a committee to integrate findings. Such a 'findings-level' approach to integration differs from the 'data-level' approach often found in the literature, and may present a more appropriate means of integrating knowledge gained in biofuel assessments to inform policy. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Oil palm plantations in Malaysia are expanding rapidly due to global oil and biofuel demand. This is of particular concern, as the conversion process of forested land to oil palm plantations and the maintenance of a plantation can significantly alter freshwater ecosystems. This is a result of the initial loss of a forested catchment, particularly the riparian vegetation, changes to the bed and banks of streams, sedimentation and changes to detrital inputs. In addition, various chemicals used on the plantations leach into the nearest waterways and can potentially affect freshwater macroinvertebrates. In the Malaysian region, these are largely endemic and generally incompletely known. This study assesses the impact of oil palm plantations on stream macroinvertebrates by comparing four steams flowing through undisturbed rainforest and four streams flowing through oil palm plantations in Sarawak, Malaysia. Freshwater macroinvertebrates were sampled using the standard three-minute kick sample method with accompanying chemical measurements. Although there were no distinct differences between the control and oil palm streams in the chemical data, the invertebrate communities provided a different interpretation of stream quality. Invertebrates were more abundant, species rich and diverse in rainforest streams than in oil palm ones. Most noticeably, two whole orders of insecta, Coleoptera (beetles) and Hemiptera (true bugs), were absent from the oil palm streams. This may be the result of the disappearance of natural bank habitats, the sensitivity to the pesticides targeted at the Rhinocerous beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), or a combination of both. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

In the present study, the effects of process parameters on pellet properties were investigated for the co-pelletization of sludge and biomass materials. The relaxed pellet density and Meyer hardness of pellets were identified. Scanning electron microscopy, FT-IR spectra and chemical analysis were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of inter-particular adhesion bonding. Thermogravimetric analysis was applied to investigate the combustion characteristics. Results showed that the pellet density was increased with the parameters increasing, such as pressure, sludge ratio and temperature. High hardness pellets could be obtained at low pressure, temperature and biomass size. The optimal moisture content for co-pelletization was 10-15%. Moreover, the addition of sludge can reduce the diversity of pellet hardness caused by the heterogeneity of biomass. Increasing ratio of sludge in the pellet would slow down the release of volatile. Synergistic effects of protein and lignin can be the mechanism in the co-pelletization of sludge and biomass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to seek a high-efficient pretreatment path for converting lignocellulosic feedstocks to fermentable sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis, the concentrated H3PO4 plus H2O2 (PHP) was attempted to pretreat different lignocellulosic biomass for evaluating the pretreatment flexibility on feedstocks. Meanwhile, the responses of pretreatment to particle sizes were also evaluated. When the PHP-pretreatment was employed (final H2O2 and H3PO4 concentration of 1.77% and 80.0%), 71-96% lignin and more than 95% hemicellulose in various feedstocks (agricultural residues, hardwood, softwood, bamboo, and their mixture, and garden wastes mixture) can be removed. Consequently, more than 90% glucose conversion was uniformly achieved indicating PHP greatly improved the pretreatment flexibility to different feedstocks. Moreover, when wheat straw and oak chips were PHP-pretreated with different sizes, the average glucose conversion reached 94.9% and 100% with lower coefficient of variation (7.9% and 0.0%), which implied PHP-pretreatment can significantly weaken the negative effects of feedstock sizes on subsequent conversion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Duckweed (Landoltia punctata) is widely distributed and has the capacity to remediate wastewater and produce tremendous biomass. Many studies have demonstrated that duckweed is a candidate feedstock for bioethanol production because of its relatively high starch and low lignin percentage. Nutrient starvation contributes to elevating starch content in duckweed, but the mechanism is so far unclear. In the research, the responses of Landoltia punctata to nutrient starvation were investigated using proteomics approach with iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS technology. A total of 2015 unique proteins were identified, with 172 proteins observed to be up-regulated and 43 down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) categorization analysis revealed that the biological process was significantly enriched (76.7%) in the metabolic process. Notably, in starch metabolism, the expression levels of enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis were up-regulated, whereas those involved in starch degradation showed no significant difference. The result was consistent with the transcriptomics data, enzymatic assay, and composition characterization. Importantly, in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, several key enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis showed up-regulated expression, but almost no enzyme related to the lignin biosynthetic branch exhibited sufficient expression abundance for detection. Proteomic analysis directly and powerfully demonstrated that high starch and low lignin percentage resulted from regulated expression of enzymes and alternation of metabolism flux in the relevant pathways. The proteomic results help us to understand the molecular mechanism of high starch accumulation and low lignin percentage, and promote the development of duckweed as a bioenergy crop. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Unproductive saline and waterlogged (WT) wastelands could be beneficially transformed into agroforestry systems using trees tolerant to these stresses. We studied the salinity and waterlogging tolerance of five Australian tree species (Acacia salicina, Casuarina glauca, Casuarina obesa, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus occidentalis) during seedling stage and their relationships with root and leaf ion concentrations. 8-month old plants were exposed for 5 months to five irrigation water salinity treatments (EC values between 2 and 22 dS m-1) and two waterlogging treatments (drained or WT). The salinity tolerance of the five species was high, although decreased in WT conditions. Irrespective of salinity, the two Casuarina species were more tolerant and the other three species were less tolerant to WT than drained conditions. In all species, salinity and waterlogging increased leaf Cl- and Na+ and decreased leaf Ca2+, but not leaf K+. Root Cl- and Na+ increased with salinity but not with waterlogging. Salinity tolerance was negatively correlated with Cl- and Na+ leaf accumulation rates per unit increase in salinity. Waterlogging reduced the ability of the seedlings to exclude Cl- and Na+ from the leaves. The two most salt tolerant Casuarina species under both drained and WT conditions showed the highest leaf Cl- and Na+ exclusion and the highest root Cl- and Na+ accumulation, suggesting that sequestration of these toxic ions in their roots was a significant salt-tolerant mechanism. Revegetation of saline and WT wastelands with these tolerant Casuarina species could be profitably used for biomass, biofuel and renewable energy production. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - There is growing interest in using switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) as a biofuel intercrop in forestry systems. However, there are limited data on the longevity of intercropped bioenergy crops, particularly with respect to light availability as the overstory tree canopy matures. Therefore, we conducted a greenhouse study to determine the effects of shading on switchgrass growth. Four treatments, each with different photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels, were investigated inside the greenhouse: control (no shade cloth, 49% of full sunlight), low (under 36% shade cloth), medium (under 52% shade cloth), and heavy shade (under 78% shade cloth). We determined the effect of shading from March to October 2011 on individually potted, multi-tillered switchgrass transplants cut to a stubble height of 10 cm. In the greenhouse, there was a reduction in tiller number, tiller height, gas exchange rates (photosynthesis and stomatal conductance), leaf area, above- and belowground biomass and light-use efficiency with increasing shade. Total (above- and belowground) biomass in the control measured 374 ± 22 compared to 9 ± 2 g pot-1 under heavy shade (11% of full sunlight). Corresponding light-use efficiencies were 3.7 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.2 g MJ-1, respectively. We also compared PAR levels and associated aboveground switchgrass biomass from inside the greenhouse to PAR levels in the inter-row regions of a range of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands from across the southeastern United States (U.S.) to estimate when light may limit the growth of intercropped species under field conditions. Results from the light environment of loblolly pine plantations in the field suggest that switchgrass biomass will be significantly reduced at a loblolly pine leaf area index between 1.95 and 2.25, which occurs on average between ages 6 and 8 years across the U.S. Southeast in intensively managed pine plantations. These leaf area indices correspond to a 60-65% reduction in PAR from open sky. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In recent years, conflicts related to tenure, management and utilization of natural resources, in particular bioenergy conflicts, are becoming increasingly common. Many bioenergy conflicts are related to plantation projects seeking to capitalize on the opportunity to profit from a combination of factors, centred on the enabling environment for biofuel plantation establishment found in many developing countries. This study analyses these and other related issues in a conflict in the Tana Delta in Kenya. The conflict is centred on a proposed 65,000. ha Jatropha curcas plantation for biodiesel by the Canadian company Bedford. Ethical Analysis, a conflict management and research tool, was employed to better understand the underlying conflict causes. Shortcomings in the technical feasibility studies and participatory planning processes were revealed, including a poor understanding of the different interests and values with regard to land tenure and traditional rights. While the adoption of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is proposed, also capacities and the regulatory framework need to be strengthened to improve transparency, coordination, impact assessment and investment security. The study proposes ways to manage the ongoing conflict and discusses its implications for bioenergy governance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Successful development of a large-scale microalgae-based biofuels industry requires comprehensive analysis and understanding of the feedstock supply chain-from facility siting and design through processing and upgrading of the feedstock to a fuel product. The evolution from pilot-scale production facilities to energy-scale operations presents many multi-disciplinary challenges, including a sustainable supply of water and nutrients, operational and infrastructure logistics, and economic competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels. These challenges are partially addressed by applying the Integrated Assessment Framework (IAF) - an integrated multi-scale modeling, analysis, and data management suite - to address key issues in developing and operating an open-pond microalgae production facility. This is done by analyzing how variability and uncertainty over space and through time affect feedstock production rates, and determining the site-specific "optimum" facility scale to minimize capital and operational expenses. This approach explicitly and systematically assesses the interdependence of biofuel production potential, associated resource requirements, and production system design trade-offs. To provide a baseline analysis, the IAF was applied to a set of sites in the southeastern U.S. with the potential to cumulatively produce 5 billion gallons per year. The results indicate costs can be reduced by scaling downstream processing capabilities to fit site-specific growing conditions, available and economically viable resources, and specific microalgal strains. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - More than 60% of the arable cropped area in Wallonia is dedicated to cereals. Cereal chains were initially aimed at ensuring food security but are now progressively oriented towards new non-food uses. Walloon cereal chains are now having to face up to new global challenges: to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of vegetal and animal chains, to match society's expectations and to meet the biomass needs for energy uses and bio-based products. Within this framework, this research aims to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of future scenarios of current and potential food and non-food uses for Walloon cereals. This paper, the first in a series of two, presents the current picture of Walloon cereal crops and their uses. Various steps are analyzed: production, collection, wholesale and processing. Four main uses characterize cereal processing: the so-called "4Fs", representing Food (human food uses), Feed (animal feed uses), Fuel (energy uses) and Fiber (material uses). Data collected from stakeholders in the Walloon cereal chain enabled us to assess cereal flows for the "4Fs", drawing a qualitative and a quantitative picture of Walloon cereal resources including the key elements of the cereal chains. This approach serves as a basis for a prospective exercise, described in a companion paper, which develops potential uses for Walloon cereal resources at the 2030 horizon.

AB  - Recently, the increasing demand for biofuels triggered a new phase for the sugar-alcohol sector. In Brazil, as well as in other tropical countries, this process raised worries regarding the possible direct and indirect effects of the crop's expansion on the conversion of native vegetation coverings. Therefore, the modeling of spatial-economic surfaces, representing the potential rent variation in its spatial component, for economic activities, may be a useful tool in the decision-making process. Hence, here we propose and present the results of a combined framework composed of two modules using the modeling platform Dinamica EGO. The first module simulates sugarcane's growth, calculating the daily response of the crop to environmental conditions during the stages of the plant's development. The second module estimates rents for sugarcane cultivation in Brazil, identifying areas where this activity would bring higher economic return, looking at simulated productivity, production costs and selling prices in a way that is spatially explicit for Brazil. Two different scenarios for production costs were tested, and results ranged from negative values to maxima of R$/ha 929 and R$/ha 1176 for standard and efficient costs of production, respectively. The model successfully indicated non-profitable and profitable areas, and regions where high expected economic return overlaps endangered ecosystems. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Traditional crop varieties are adapted to low inputs of fertilizers, pesticides, and water. In addition, biofuel from local vegetal biomass stimulates the economy in depressed rural areas. Biofuels also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we tested the suitability of traditional maize varieties as solid biofuel. We cultivated traditional maize varieties without pesticides and irrigation. Four varieties were cropped in two locations, with two fertilization levels, and harvested at three different dates. For each trait, we measured the heating value, the ash content, and the elemental composition. Results show that plants harvested at physiological maturity, 150 days after sowing, have about 10 % more biomass and 20-30 % less ash, N, K, and Cl than plants harvested 115 days after sowing. Moreover, reducing standard N input by 40 % did not reduce the biomass yield. Calculations show that traditional maize varieties can produce an energy of 15-23∈·∈104 MJ/ha. These findings demonstrate that traditional maize cultivation can be optimized to increase the efficiency of biomass production and to reduce the environmental impact. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - A method for synthesizing augmented biofuel processes, which improve biomass carbon conversion to liquid fuel (ηcarbon) using supplemental solar energy as heat, H2, and electricity is presented. For a target ηcarbon, our method identifies augmented processes requiring the least solar energy input. A nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming model allowing for simultaneous mass, heat, and power integration, is built over a process superstructure and solved using global optimization tools. As a case study, biomass thermochemical conversion via gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and fast-hydropyrolysis/hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is considered. The optimal process configurations can be categorized either as standalone (ηcarbon≤54%), augmented using solar heat (54%≤ηcarbon≤74%), or augmented using solar heat and H2 (74≤ηcarbon≤95%). Importantly, the process H2 consumption is found to be close to the derived theoretical minimum values. To accommodate for the intermittency of solar heat/H2, we suggest processes that can operate at low and high ηcarbon. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The present investigation evaluates the potential of an endolithic cyanobacterium isolated from marble rock to utilize sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as carbon source for prospective recycling of CO2 into biodiesel. Microalgae thriving on marble were cultured and subjected to increasing NaHCO3 concentration. The most competent isolate was identified and characterized in terms of growth, lipid content and fatty acid profile. A semicontinuous mesh incubator was designed for biofilm development. Isolate ISTCY101 was identified as Leptolyngbya sp. by 16S rRNA sequencing. Leptolyngbya ISTCY101 efficiently used BG-11 (50mM NaHCO3) and artificial seawater medium (25gL-1 NaCl) with biomass productivity 78.9 and 75.74mgL-1d-1, respectively. Maximum areal biomass productivity of 2.01gm-2d-1 was recorded in the mesh incubator, with complete exclusion of centrifugation for harvesting. Lipid content varied from 16% to 21%, consisting predominantly of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1 fatty acids (&gt;60%) making promising feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study is to increase biogas production and methane yield from landfill leachate in anaerobic batch reactors by using low frequency ultrasound as a pretreatment step. In the first part of the study, optimum conditions for solubilization of organic matter in leachate samples were investigated using various sonication durations at an ultrasound frequency of 20. kHz. The level of organic matter solubilization during ultrasonic pretreatment experiments was determined by calculating the ratio of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) to total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD). The sCOD/tCOD ratio was increased from 47% in raw leachate to 63% after 45. min sonication at 600. W/l. Non-parametric Friedman's test indicated that ultrasonic pretreatment has a significant effect on sCOD parameter for leachate (p<. 0.05). In the second part of the study, anaerobic batch reactors were operated for both ultrasonically pretreated and untreated landfill leachate samples in order to assess the effect of sonication on biogas and methane production rate. In anaerobic batch reactor feed with ultrasonically pretreated leachate, 40% more biogas was obtained compared to the control reactor. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare biogas and methane production rates for raw and pretreated leachate samples and it has been found that ultrasonic pretreatment significantly enhanced biogas and methane production rates from leachate (p<. 0.05) in anaerobic batch reactors. The overall results showed that low frequency ultrasound pretreatment can be potentially used for wastewater management especially with integration of anaerobic processes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concerns over global climate change have led many jurisdictions to implement strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas levels. One example is the replacement of coal with dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass and miscanthus. The yields and costs of these potentially valuable bio-energy crops have been evaluated in only a few cases, and previous studies have not focused on climate change effects. This article assesses the potential yields and costs of growing switchgrass and miscanthus on the agricultural land base in Ontario, Canada, under different climate assumptions, using a GIS-based integrated biophysical and economic simulation model. The model shows that miscanthus has a mean peak yield that is 88.5% (29.6 t ha-1 compared with 15.7 t ha-1) higher and a mean farm gate break-even price that is 25.9% ($58.20 per tonne compared with $73.29 per tonne) lower than switchgrass. The impact of climate change on the yield and break-even price of switchgrass and miscanthus is dependent upon the climate model. CGCM3.1 predicts that mean peak yields of switchgrass and miscanthus could drop by 17.8% and 14.9%, whereas CCSM3.0 predicts that mean yields could increase to 41.4% and 44.9%, from 2071 to 2100, in the A2 climate scenario respectively. Both crops show promise as biomass sources for bio-energy production, but a changing global climate, along with cultivar and planting technology developments, could affect crop choices. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biomass from dedicated crops is expected to contribute significantly to the replacement of fossil resources. However, sustainable bioenergy cropping systems must provide high biomass production and low environmental impacts. This study aimed at quantifying biomass production, nutrient removal, expected ethanol production, and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of six bioenergy crops: Miscanthus × giganteus, switchgrass, fescue, alfalfa, triticale, and fiber sorghum. Biomass production and N, P, K balances (input-output) were measured during 4 years in a long-term experiment, which included two nitrogen fertilization treatments. These results were used to calculate a posteriori 'optimized' fertilization practices, which would ensure a sustainable production with a nil balance of nutrients. A modified version of the cost/benefit approach proposed by Crutzen et al. (2008), comparing the GHG emissions resulting from N-P-K fertilization of bioenergy crops and the GHG emissions saved by replacing fossil fuel, was applied to these 'optimized' situations. Biomass production varied among crops between 10.0 (fescue) and 26.9 t DM ha-1 yr-1 (miscanthus harvested early) and the expected ethanol production between 1.3 (alfalfa) and 6.1 t ha-1 yr-1 (miscanthus harvested early). The cost/benefit ratio ranged from 0.10 (miscanthus harvested late) to 0.71 (fescue); it was closely correlated with the N/C ratio of the harvested biomass, except for alfalfa. The amount of saved CO2 emissions varied from 1.0 (fescue) to 8.6 t CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 (miscanthus harvested early or late). Due to its high biomass production, miscanthus was able to combine a high production of ethanol and a large saving of CO2 emissions.

AB  - Miscanthus × giganteus is often regarded as one of the most promising crops to produce sustainable bioenergy. This perennial crop, renowned for its high productivity associated with low input requirements, in particular regarding fertilizers, is thought to have low environmental impacts, but few data are available to confirm this. Our study aimed at assessing nitrate leaching from Miscanthus × giganteus crops in farmers' fields, thus including a wide range of soil and cropping system conditions. We focused on the first years of growth after planting as experimental studies have suggested that Miscanthus × giganteus, once established, results in low nitrate leaching. We combined on-farm measurements and modeling to estimate drainage, leached nitrogen, and nitrate concentration in drainage water in 38 fields located in Center-East France during two winters (November 2010 to March 2011, November 2011 to March 2012). Nitrate leaching and nitrate concentration in drainage water were on average very low. Nitrate leaching averaged 6 kg N ha-1 whereas nitrate concentration averaged 12 mg l-1. These low values are attributable to the low estimates of drainage water (mean = 166 mm) but also to the low soil mineral nitrogen contents measured at the beginning of winter (mean = 37 kg N ha-1). Our results were, however, very variable, mainly due to the crop age: nitrate leaching and nitrate concentration were critically higher during the winter following the first growth year of Miscanthus × giganteus, reflecting the low development of the crop. This variability was also explained by the range of soil and cropping conditions explored in the on-farm design: shallow and/or sandy soils as well as fields where establishment failed had a higher risk of nitrate leaching. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bioenergy has to meet increasing sustainability criteria in the EU putting conventional bioenergy crops under pressure. Alternatively, perennial bioenergy crops, such as Miscanthus, show higher greenhouse gas savings with similarly high energy yields. In addition, Miscanthus plantations may sequester additional soil organic carbon (SOC) to mitigate climate change. As the land-use change in cropland to Miscanthus involves a C3-C4 vegetation change (VC), it is possible to determine the dynamic of Miscanthus-derived SOC (C4 carbon) and of the old SOC (C3 carbon) by the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C. We sampled six croplands and adjacent Miscanthus plantations exceeding the age of 10 years across Europe. We found a mean C4 carbon sequestration rate of 0.78 ± 0.19 Mg ha-1 yr-1, which increased with mean annual temperature. At three of six sites, we found a significant increase in C3 carbon due to the application of organic fertilizers or difference in baseline SOC, which we define as non-VC-induced SOC changes. The Rothamsted Carbon Model was used to disentangle the decomposition of old C3 carbon and the non-VC-induced C3 carbon changes. Subsequently, this method was applied to eight more sites from the literature, resulting in a climate-dependent VC-induced SOC sequestration rate (0.40 ± 0.20 Mg ha-1 yr-1), as a step toward a default SOC change function for Miscanthus plantations on former croplands in Europe. Furthermore, we conducted a SOC fractionation to assess qualitative SOC changes and the incorporation of C4 carbon into the soil. Sixteen years after Miscanthus establishment, 68% of the particulate organic matter (POM) was Miscanthus-derived in 0-10 cm depth. POM was thus the fastest cycling SOC fraction with a C4 carbon accumulation rate of 0.33 ± 0.05 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Miscanthus-derived SOC also entered the NaOCl-resistant fraction, comprising 12% in 0-10 cm, which indicates that this fraction was not an inert SOC pool. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biochar and hydrochars (HC) are emerging soil fertility amendments; however, their ability to improve fertility levels in soils possessing vastly different pedogenic characteristics has not been well investigated. In this study, several plant and manure biochars and two blended HC applied at 3.84 g/kg (ca.10 t/ha) were incubated in pots containing a highly fertile-Mollisol (Waukegan series; Sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludoll) and an infertile Entisol (Margate series; Siliceous, hyperthermic, Mollic Psammaquent). During the 124-125 day laboratory incubations, pots were leached four times with deionized H2O with the leachates analysed for the concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (DP) and potassium (DK). After the incubations, both soils were analysed for fertility characteristics (i.e. pH, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and extractable P and K). In both soils after biochar additions, there were mixed pH and CEC responses. Both the Mollisol and Entisol treated with swine solid biochar had greater plant extractable P and K contents, which was reflective of the elevated P and K contents in the swine solid biochar. However, most biochars and HC additions to the Mollisol and Entisol had minimal impact on soil fertility characteristics indicating a low direct fertilization potential. These nutrient contents could be altered through feedstock blending to target a particular fertilizer requirement. Published 2014.

AB  - Perennial grasslands play an important role as an extensive CO2 sink. Fodder and biofuels can be produced in an ecologically acceptable manner on such sites. Projected future climate-change scenarios suggest that Central Europe's grasslands will be increasingly affected by drought. In order to determine whether there is potential for some alternative drought-adapted grass species to contribute to herbage production for either forage or biomass, we tested the agronomic performance of ten grass species (Agropyron elongatum, Agropyron intermedium, Agropyron desertorum, Agropyron trachycaulum, Elymus hoffmannii, Elymus junceus, Bromus inermis, Bromus marginatus, Festuca arundinacea and Panicum virgatum) in comparison to four reference grasses (Dactylis glomerata, Arrhen-atherum elatius, Agrostis gigantea and Agropyron repens). Experiments were conducted in small-plot cutting trials at two sites across two growing seasons with either one or multiple cuts per season. In the one-cut system, P. virgatum provided the highest average annual dry matter (DM) yield (14 258 kg ha-1), followed by A. elongatum (13 086 kg ha-1). The multi-annual persistence of these two species under the experimental conditions was given only when P. virgatum was not harvested before freezing off and A. elongatum was harvested only once per year. Moreover, both species are susceptible to lodging. In the multiple-cut system, F. a run-dinacea showed a high yield (12 533 kg DM ha-1 average annual yield) and a low presence of associated weeds (only 0.1% surface area). Cultivating this grass species requires considering its only moderate competitiveness during the establishment phase. Based on the rapid establishment of A. trachycaulum, this species is expected to be best suited as a cover crop in seed mixtures. The yields of A. desertorum, A. trachycaulum, A. repens, E. junceus and B. marginatus were below the experimental average (9255 kg DM ha-1 at multiple cuttings).

AB  - Among the insects reported in biofuel crops, the yellow sugarcane aphid, Sipha flava (Forbes), is a potential pest of giant miscanthus, Miscanthus × giganteus Greef et Deu ex Hodkinson et Renvoize (M×g) and energy cane "L79-1002", Saccharum spp. L. We studied the biology of S. flava on M×g and energy cane and estimated the development period, fecundity, longevity, intrinsic rate of increase, doubling time, reproductive value, and survivorship curves. To demonstrate the host suitability in a susceptible species, we studied the aphid life table on sorghum 'PL 18200,' Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. Life-table information was recorded under greenhouse conditions on the host plants. Our results suggested that both M×g and energy cane are suitable hosts for S. flava. We observed similar aphid development period on both hosts. Life-table estimates including longevity and fecundity suggested that M×g is a more suitable host for the aphid than energy cane. The intrinsic rate of increase for S. flava was lower on energy cane (0.231) than on M×g (0.258). © 2014 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - Background: Methane production as biofuels is a fast and strong growing technique for renewable energy. Substrates like waste (e.g. food, sludge fromwaste water treatment plants (WWTP), industrial wastes) can be used as a suitable resource for methane gas production, but in some cases, with elevated toxicity in the digestion residue. Former investigations have shown that co-digesting of contaminated waste such as sludge together with other substrates can produce a less toxic residue. In addition, wetlands and reed beds demonstrated good results in dewatering and detoxifying of sludge. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the toxicity may alter in industrial sludge co-digested with oat and post-treatment in reed beds. In this study, digestion of sludge from Bjorkborn industrial area in Karlskoga (reactor D6) and co-digestion of the same sludge mixed with oat (reactor D5) and post-treatment in reed beds were investigated in parallel. Methane production as well as changes in cytotoxicity (Microtox(R); ISO 11348-3), genotoxicity (Umu-C assay; ISO/13829) and AhR-mediated toxicity (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay using RTW cells) were measured. Results: The result showed good methane production of industrial sludge (D6) although the digested residue was more toxic than the ingoing material measured using microtox30min and Umu-C. Co-digestion of toxic industrial sludge and oat (D5) showed higher methane production and significantly less toxic sludge residue than reactor D6. Furthermore, dewatering and treatment in reed beds showed low and non-detectable toxicity in reed bed material and outgoing water as well as reduced nutrients. Conclusions: Co-digestion of sludge and oat followed by dewatering and treatment of sludge residue in reed beds can be a sustainable waste management and energy production. We recommend that future studies should involve co-digestion of decontaminated waste mixed with different non-toxic material to find a substrate mixture that produce the highest biogas yield and lowest toxicity within the sludge residue.

AB  - Biofuel crops as an alternative to fossil fuels are a component of the energy mix in many countries. Many of them are introduced plants, so they pose a serious threat of biological invasions. Production of allelopathic compounds can increase invasion success by limiting co-occurring species in the invaded environment (novel weapons hypothesis). In this study, we focused on plant chemistry and production of allelopathic compounds by biofuel crops (hybrid sorrel Rumex tianschanicus x Rumex patientia and miscanthus Miscanthus sinensis) in comparison with invasive knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis) and cultural meadow species. First, we tested the impact of leachates isolated from hybrid sorrel, miscanthus, knotweed and cultural meadow species compared to deionized water, used as a control, on seed germination of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivated on sand and soil. Secondly, we studied the effect of leachates on the growth of soil fungal pathogens Fusarium culmorum, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia solani and Cochliobolus sativus. Finally, we tested the effect of litter of hybrid sorrel, miscanthus, knotweed and cultural meadow litter mixed with soil on population growth of Enchytraeus crypticus and Folsomia candida. Miscanthus and knotweed litter had a higher C:N ratio than the control meadow and hybrid sorrel litter. Miscanthus and hybrid sorrel litter had a higher content of phenols than knotweed and cultural meadow litter. Leachates from hybrid sorrel, miscanthus and knotweed biomass significantly decreased seed germination of wheat and mustard in both substrates. Soil fungal pathogens grew less vigorously on agar enriched by leachates from both biofuel crops than on agar enriched by knotweed and leachates. Litter from hybrid sorrel, miscanthus and knotweed significantly altered (both ways) the population growth of the soil mesofauna. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The world is facing many global challenges, such as sustainable production methods, and adapting to climate change. As a result of the climate change and the developing of the living standard of the people, the pressure on energy and water resource is increasing, and pollution of the air and water as well as the degradation of land are increasing in a tremendous way and will continue to grow. In Jordan, as a poor water country, a low quantity of rainfall, especially in southern Jordan, is a major cause of drought. Consequently, producers will face a bigger productivity drop. Cultivating special plants to produce energy and producing biofuel are considered alternative energy sources. Analysing the use of these alternatives is very complex because the technical issue, environmental, social and economic impact should be assessed. Nevertheless, using scare resources, such as water, and the impact on food security are other variables that should be considered. This study focuses on producing biofuel in an agricultural area from an economic point of view, with specific attention on food and water security as well as the environmental impact. The study depended on a case study that applies planting Jatropha to produce biofuel. As a conclusion the producing oil from Jatropha has high potential to be profitable. Socially and environmentally of producing biofuel from Jatropha is will not be on competition in using the resources with other crops, because it could be planted in marginal land and using low quality water. The growing global demand for liquid biofuel has been seen as a way to create new employment opportunities through the work in the farms or in the biofuel factories, thus leading to increase income generation and rural development, in addition to saving the energy from other sources.

AB  - The substitution of forest-derived woody biofuels for fossil fuel energy has garnered increasing attention in recent years, but information regarding the mid- and long-term effects on soil productivity is limited. We investigated 15-yr temporal trends in forest floor and mineral soil (0-30 cm) C and N pools in response to organic matter removal treatments (OMR; stem-only harvest, SOH; whole-tree harvest, WTH; and whole-tree plus forest floor removal, FFR) at three edaphically distinct aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. grandidentata Michx.) forests in the Great Lakes region. The OMR and temporal effects were generally site specific, and both were most evident in the forest floor and combined profile (mineral soil and forest floor) compared with the mineral soil alone. Forest floor and combined profile C and N pools were generally similar in the SOH and WTH treatments, suggesting that slash retention has little impact on soil C and N in this time frame. Temporal changes in C and N at one of the three sites were consistent with patterns documented following exotic earthworm invasion, but mineral soil pools at the other two sites were stable over time. Power analyses demonstrated that significant effects were more likely to be detected for temporal differences than the effects of OMR and in the combined profile than in the mineral soil. Our findings are consistent with previous work demonstrating that OMR effects on soil C and N pools are site specific and more apparent in the forest floor than the mineral soil. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - This paper considers the life cycle environmental sustainability of ethanol produced in integrated biorefineries together with chemicals and energy. Four types of second-generation feedstocks are considered: wheat straw, forest residue, poplar, and miscanthus. Seven out of 11 environmental impacts from ethanol are negative, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, when the system is credited for the co-products, indicating environmental savings. Ethanol from poplar is the best and straw the worst option for most impacts. Land use change from forest to miscanthus increases the GHG emissions several-fold. For poplar, the effect is opposite: converting grassland to forest reduces the emissions by three-fold. Compared to fossil and first-generation ethanol, ethanol from integrated biorefineries is more sustainable for most impacts, with the exception of wheat straw. Pure ethanol saves up to 87% of GHG emissions compared to petrol per MJ of fuel. However, for the current 5% ethanol-petrol blends, the savings are much smaller (<3%). Therefore, unless much higher blends become widespread, the contribution of ethanol from integrated biorefineries to the reduction of GHG emissions will be insignificant. Yet, higher ethanol blends would lead to an increase in some impacts, notably terrestrial and freshwater toxicity as well as eutrophication for some feedstocks. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Herein, a duckweed biocrude produced from the hydrothermal liquefaction of Lemna minor was treated in subcritical water with added H2. Effects of several different commercially available materials such as Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C, Pt/γ-Al2O3, Pt/C-sulfide, Rh/γ-Al2O3, activated carbon, MoS2, Mo2C, Co-Mo/γ-Al2O3, and zeolite on the yields of product fractions and the deoxygenation, denitrogenation, and desulfurization of biocrude at 350°C were examined, respectively. All the materials showed catalytic activity for deoxygenation and desulfurization of the biocrude and only Ru/C showed activity for denitrogenation. Of those catalysts examined, Pt/C showed the best performance for deoxygenation. Among all the upgraded oils, the oil produced with Ru/C shows the lowest sulfur, the highest hydrocarbon content (25.6%), the highest energy recovery (85.5%), and the highest higher heating value (42.6MJ/kg). The gaseous products were mainly unreacted H2, CH4, CO2, and C2H6. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A critical factor in implementing microalgal biofuels for mass production is the nutrient requirements. The current study investigated the fate of macro- and micronutrients and their availability in a sequential phototrophic- heterotrophic production process for the lipid rich microalga Auxenochlorella protothecoides. More than 99 % (by weight) of overall process nutrients were supplied during the initial photoautotrophic stage reflecting its significantly larger volume. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions only 9-35 % of supplied Mn, S, Fe, N, Mg, and Cu and less than 5 % of P, Mo, Co, B, Zn, and Ca were consumed by the algae. The rest of these nutrients remain in the spent growth media during the culture concentration-down from an 800 L phototrophic pond to a 5 L heterotrophic fermenter. In contrast, Zn, Mo, Mn, Mg, Ca, and N were exhausted (90-99 % removal) during the first 25 h of the heterotrophic growth stage. The depletion of these key nutrients may have ultimately limited the final biomass density and/or lipid productivity achieved. Approximately 10-20 % of the total supplied S, Mn, Fe, N, and Cu and 5 % of Ca and Zn were assimilated into algal biomass. Several elements including N, P, Mn, B, Cu, Ca, Mg, S, and Fe were released back into the liquid phase by anaerobic digestion (AD) of the residual biomass after lipid extraction. The nutrients recovered from the AD effluent and remaining in the spent medium should be recycled or their initial concentration to the phototrophic stage decreased to enhance process economics and sustainability for future commercialization of algal-derived biofuels. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The willingness of public authority to delegate social and environmental regulation to the private sector has varied from sector to sector, but has often led to the establishment of 'voluntary' standards and certifications on sustainability. Many of these have taken the form of 'stewardship councils' and 'sustainability roundtables' and have been designed around a set of institutional features seeking to establish legitimacy, fend off possible criticism, and 'sell' certifications to potential users. The concept of 'roundtabling' emphasizes the fitting a variety of commodity-specific sustainability situations into a form that not only 'hears more voices' (as in '. multi-stakeholder'), but also portrays to give them equal standing at the table of negotiations (roundtable), thus raising higher expectations on accountability, transparency and inclusiveness. In this article, I examine to what extent these expectations are being met through the comparative case study of two sustainability certifications in the biofuel industry - in the context of a wider set of experiences in the agro-food and forestry sectors. I show that 'roundtabling' entails an ever more complex web of governance systems and procedures to meet 'good practice' in standard setting and management. This is opening space for competing initiatives that are less democratic, quicker, and more aligned with industry interests to establish substantial presence in the market for sustainability certifications. These tend to more easily discriminate on the basis of size (against small players) and geography (against actors in the South). The article concludes with a reflection on what can be done, through appropriate regulation, to address this situation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Amid a rapid expansion of global investments in biofuels there has been an equally rapid proliferation of concerns about the inadequacies of current governance schemes to mitigate the environmental impacts of growing agroenergy production. Managing the land use practices of small producers in a way that ensures their activities are financially and environmentally sustainable is a particularly pressing issue that has been overlooked in research on biofuel governance. I illuminate these challenges through an ethnographic study on the multiple breakdowns of environmental governance in the Southern Goiás region of Brazil, a major expansion region for sugarcane ethanol production. I focus on one of the most pressing compliance issues among small and medium size sugarcane farmers; their persistent use of federally mandated conservation areas for cattle production. I find that while these transgressions are often perceived by administrators and officials as being the result of a lack of "environmental awareness" among rural farmers, they are better understood as a safety net to protect landowners against perceived risks of sugarcane production. These violations are further enabled by continuing ambiguity in the enforcement structure for conservation legislation in the region. Recalibrating regulatory systems to better address these issues of accountability and risk is a critical step toward improving environmental governance of global biofuel commodity chains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Ghana, the contested concepts of "land grabbing" and "land transaction" are strategically applied by proponents of critical and win-win discourses respectively to describe outcomes of land deals. Using case study methods and discourse analysis, this paper explores four cases of biofuels investments in Ghana and the implications of the choice of concepts used to represent them. Proponents of the critical discourse use the "land grabbing" concept to invoke imageries of "illegality", "theft" and "food insecurity" when describing land deals. Consequently, some biofuels investments have been hampered in their potential to generate profit and local employment. The biofuel investors in this study, whose projects have been labeled "land grabbing", therefore switched to food production to downplay public scepticism. Proponents of the win-win discourse portray biofuels investments as "pro-poor" projects and use the "land transaction" concept to pre-empt possible public criticisms in the media and elsewhere. Such representations of these biofuels investments are therefore mainly intended to pre-empt criticisms or attract public praise. Some projects with potentially promising outcomes have thus been terminated, while others with problematic outcomes have continued to be promoted. In contexts characterized by weak land regulations and ambivalence towards large-scale agriculture, the trajectory and outcomes of biofuels investments are often influenced by land deal representations drawn from global discourses and how they interact with pre-existing local discourses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Miscanthus is an emerging crop with high potential for bioenergy production. Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches have been based on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence at the level of the farmer's block as mapped in the French land parcel identification system. Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of "marginal land" by integrating also the farm management criteria. In conclusion, our approach elicited real farmers' criteria regarding miscanthus location to capture local specificities and explore different miscanthus location probabilities at the farm and landscape levels. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels have been criticized in academic and activist circles not only for their environmental consequences but also for their social impacts on food availability and on small-scale family farming. Meanwhile (global) initiatives and policies have been developed to stimulate "sustainable biofuels". Brazil - a frontrunner in production and use of biofuels - aimed to combine biodiesel production with rural development. The biodiesel policy implemented in 2004 had two main objectives: to advance biodiesel as a transportation fuel and to foster the social inclusion of family farmers through participation in the biodiesel chain. Although participation of family farmers was low in the beginning, it increased substantially after a 2009 policy change that gave cooperatives a more prominent role. We analyze how, why and to what extent cooperatives are involved in integrating family farmers into the biodiesel chain and what this means for the social sustainability of biodiesel, taking the northeast state of Bahia as a case study area. The findings show that through the biodiesel policy, cooperatives-until then a marginal phenomenon in northern Brazil-increased their membership, were empowered and contributed to the economic development of a significant group of family farmers. However, these family farmers have not been substantially included in the biodiesel production chain itself. The biodiesel policy functions as a catalyst for rural (economic) development in which the cooperatives seem to achieve what governments were unable to achieve: the integration of specific categories of family farmers into agrarian development. Subsistence family farmers, in particular, have not been able to profit from this policy-driven, "market-oriented," rural development model. Hence, it can be questioned whether this policy has made biodiesel more socially sustainable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents an adjusted Faustmann Rule for optimal harvest of a forest when there is a social cost of carbon emissions. The theoretical framework takes account of the dynamics and interactions of forests' multiple carbon pools and assumes an infinite time horizon. Our paper provides a theoretical foundation for numerical model studies that have found that a social cost of carbon implies longer optimal rotation periods and that if the social cost of carbon exceeds a certain threshold value the forest should not be harvested. At the same time we show that it could be a net social benefit from harvesting even if the commercial profit from harvest is negative. If that is the case, the optimal harvest age is decreasing in the social cost of carbon. © 2014 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå.

AB  - Cyclic hydrocarbons are a critical component of petroleum fuels. However, biofuels produced by current biochemical and thermochemical processes contain small amounts of cyclic hydrocarbons, and can only provide the requisite performance characteristics with the addition of petroleum fuels to them. Limonene (C10H16) is a cyclic monoterpene that possesses attractive characteristics as a biodiesel and a jet fuel. Current strategies for harvesting limonene from plant biomass require arable land, high energy input, inefficient multiple-step processes, and the release of CO2 as a greenhouse gas. This research focuses on a direct photons-to-product approach for biofuel production by metabolically engineering a cyanobacterium as the cellular machinery to over-produce and secrete valuable compounds using CO 2, mineralized H2O, and light. As a proof of concept, we have engineered the filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 to synthesize and secrete limonene by introducing a plant limonene synthase gene (lims) from Sitka spruce. Our data revealed that limonene produced by the engineered cyanobacterium was secreted across the cell membrane and volatilized into the headspace, allowing for easy separation of the target compound from the culture biomass. Furthermore, a synthetic DXP operon (dxs-ipphp-gpps) encoding three rate-limiting enzymes from the MEP pathway was co-expressed with lims to re-route carbon flux from the Calvin cycle into limonene synthesis. Under higher light (150 μE m-2 s -1), we observed a 6.8-fold increase in limonene yield and an 8.8-fold increase in the maximum limonene production rate when expressing the DXP operon in conjunction with lims, compared to lims alone, and achieved a maximum production rate of 3.6 ± 0.5 μg limonene L-1 O.D.-1 h-1. This limonene-producing Anabaena has about three times higher photosystem II activity than its wild-type. These results demonstrated that increasing the light intensity and metabolic flux improves limonene productivity in the engineered cyanobacterium. We envision that the method of using N2-fixing cyanobacteria as a cellular factory and CO2 and N2 as sustainable feedstock can be applied for the production of a wide range of commodity chemicals and drop-in-fuels.

AB  - In 2011 the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) released a set of indicators for sustainable bioenergy. However, two important issues still remain unresolved. One of them is the definition of "sustainability", and the other is the lack of a holistic assessment tool for drawing conclusions from the indicators. The aim of this paper is to provide clarification on the concept of sustainability in the context of the GBEP indicators, and to develop a holistic assessment tool for assessing the sustainability of bioenergy programmes. The GBEP indicators are diverse in terms of "what to measure", and some of them are not sufficiently directly related to the concept of sustainability. This makes the indicators ambiguous regarding to sustainability assessment. This study identifies whether the GBEP indicators are concerned with strong or weak sustainability, and develops a tool based on Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) which can be used for assessing sustainability of bioenergy programmes using the GBEP indicators. The tool is demonstrated in an example for assessing the sustainability of biofuel production in a case study of Kyoto. We found that the biodiesel production in Kyoto performs well on the environmental pillar, but badly on the economic pillar, and based on the weights applied in this study the overall sustainability is better than diesel fuel. The holistic assessment tool provides practical information to policymakers on both ex-ante and ex-post policy evaluations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Algae can be a viable source for biofuel production, but the source of nitrogen used to cultivate could affect algae yields. Here, we observe how various nitrogen treatments can impact the growth and biovolume of microalga Nannochloropsis salina as well as invasion of undesired organisms. Invading organisms increase the likelihood of crashes of the desired microalgae culture. Experiments were conducted over 28 days in open aquaria in a greenhouse. We used five different nitrogen treatments; ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), urea (CH4N2O), and a mixture of all these sources. Highest values for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), a measure of potential harvest rate based on population productivity, were observed in the urea treatment, but cell size was smaller compared to other treatments. Sodium nitrate and the mixture of nitrogen sources also had high MSY values but larger cell sizes, making them the treatments with highest total biovolume. The highest percentages of lipid by weight, but also highest densities of invading organisms were observed in the mixed treatment. Our results suggest that tradeoffs between biovolume and lipid yields as well as culture success can ultimately decide what nitrogen sources to use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: The development of inexpensive and highly productive biomass sources of biofuel is a priority in global climate change biology. Arundo donax, also known as the giant reed, is recognized as one of the most promising nonfood bioenergy crops in Europe. Despite its relevance, to date no genomic resources are available to support the characterization of the developmental, adaptive and metabolic traits underlying the high productivity of this nonmodel species. We hereby present the first report on the de novo assembly of bud, culm, leaf and root transcriptomes of A. donax, which can be accessed through a customized BLAST server (http://ecogenomics.fmach.it/arundo/) for mining and exploring the genetic potential of this species. Based on functional annotation and homology comparison to 19 prospective biofuel Poaceae species, we provide the first genomic view of this so far unexplored crop and indicate the model species with highest potential for comparative genomics approaches. The analysis of the transcriptome reveals strong differences in the enrichment of the Gene Ontology categories and the relative expression among different organs, which can guide future efforts for functional genomics or genetic improvement of A. donax. A set of homologs to key genes involved in lignin, cellulose, starch, lipid metabolism and in the domestication of other crops is discussed to provide a platform for possible enhancement of productivity and saccharification efficiency in A. donax. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Arundo donax, a perennial grass, is being considered as a renewable-fuel feedstock. A. donax reproduces vegetatively and can produce over 30Mg ha-1 of biomass, making it an ideal candidate for biofuel. There is limited information on the susceptibility of A. donax to pests and pathogens and the implications for biofuel production. This study examined the ability of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) to infect A. donax under controlled conditions using the aphid vector Rhopalosiphum padi, and the impact of BYDV-PAV on A. donax growth. Virus systemicity and the potential for A. donax to serve as a BYDV-PAV inoculum source were also examined. Immunological techniques confirmed BYDV-PAV infection of A. donax, but there were no significant differences in height, number of leaves and number of shoots per rhizome between infected and healthy plants, suggesting A. donax is tolerant to BYDV-PAV. BYDV-PAV infection was determined to be systemic within the host, resulting in virus detection in multiple shoots of the same rhizome. Transmission from infected A. donax to susceptible barley plants was demonstrated using the vector R. padi. These results demonstrate that A. donax is an alternative host to BYDV-PAV. Large A. donax monocultures may provide a perennial inoculum source to neighboring small grain crops, like wheat and barley, as well as turf and forage grasses. Field studies are needed to examine the movement of insect vectors between A. donax, susceptible crops and non-managed ecosystems to assess the ecological and epidemiological implications of these findings. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass from land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is being considered as a biofuel feedstock source. A quick, accurate and nondestructive method to estimate biomass yield would be valuable for land managers to ensure sustainable production. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of regression models to estimate biomass yields using data from satellite and ground based remote sensing platforms. Biomass yields and plant spectral responses were obtained at different phenological stages over two growing seasons (2011-2012) on an 8.1ha CRP pasture in central Montana. Regression models were constructed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and various band combinations from a hand held Crop Circle sensor and from Landsat satellite images. All models showed reasonable accuracy in estimating biomass, with a difference of &lt;276kgha-1 or 8% of measured values. None of the models showed statistically significant differences (p&gt;0.05) between actual and estimated biomass. Results suggest that the usefulness of the spectral regions is a function of phenological growth stage. Red, red edge, and the near-infrared bands are more responsive at boot and peak growth stages while bands in the short-wave infrared increased the accuracy for the dormant stage biomass estimations. Land managers may construct spectral models to more effectively manage biomass resources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Canola meal has been previously demonstrated to be an attractive biomaterial for dehydrating wet ethanol vapours in bioethanol manufacture. Extrusion-spheronisation was employed to prepare reasonably spherical pellets of canola meal for use in dehydration units. Canola meal pastes were prepared at water volume fractions of 57-70% and extruded through single and multi-holed dies with diameters 2, 3.5 and 4.5mm. The pressure required to extrude the pastes, size and shape distribution of pellets and strength of dried pellets were measured. Formulations with a water volume fraction of 70% gave low extrusion pressures and highest pellet strength. Die land diameters of 2mm gave the best combination of specific surface area, size and shape distribution, packing density and ethanol adsorption. Dehydration testing confirmed that the canola meal pellets could dehydrate water/ethanol vapour from an ethanol mass fraction of 92.5% (below the azeotrope at 1 bara) to 99%. The equilibrium water loading of 47.3mg water per g adsorbent is larger than other biomass-based adsorbents reported for this application. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mirroring global trends in biofuel policy making, the Government of India recently enacted a policy restricting feedstock cultivation to 'wastelands', a government designation for marginal lands. This strategy, the government asserts, will help improve the country's energy security, mitigate climate change and reduce rural poverty through job creation. As other critical biofuels scholarship has documented, land categorizations like 'wasteland' are political constructs homogenously applied to indicate 'empty', 'unproductive' land 'available' for development. While claiming that such constructions mask socio-political relations on the ground, little evidence has been offered analyzing the impacts of these omissions or evaluating how wasteland constructions are sustained. This paper provides such an analysis through a case study of Jatropha curcas biodiesel promotion on wastelands in Tamil Nadu, India. I find that Prosopis juliflora on Tamil Nadu's wastelands currently supports a dynamic energy economy servicing both rural and urban consumers. The Prosopis economy provides substantially more energy services, jobs and economic development opportunities than would Jatropha biodiesel. Yet political relations amongst stakeholders obscure the Prosopis economy from biofuel policy dialogs. That Prosopis was originally spread throughout India as part of a wasteland development program of the 1970s underscores the deeply political nature of the concept of wasteland. These findings demonstrate that marginal lands, as currently constructed, do not exist. By extension, locating biofuels on such lands is not the 'win-win' strategy for simultaneously addressing energy security, climate change and rural poverty that advocates suggest. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy conservation has emerged as one of the biggest challenges of the world in the XXI century, and not different from many countries, the US has created plans and policies to stimulate renewable energy alternative. Among the important alternatives for energy conservation is the use of biomass energy. Despite these stimuli production predictions are not confident that production would achieve the planned target for the U.S. Consequently, the predictions raise questions about farmer's willingness to grow bioenergy crops or produce alternative cellulosic feedstocks. In other words, farmers and landholders may not be willing to grow bioenergy crops. With this concerns in mind, the study advances previous research about bioenergy production by evaluating farmer's and landholder's willingness to produce different varieties of biofuel feedstocks. To achieve our goals, we used a mail survey of Kansas farmers conducted from January to April of 2011. The survey contained questions related to how farmers make their land-use decisions covering a wide array of topics. Through this survey, we evaluate the effect of farm characteristics, farm management practices, farmer perceptions (such as risk aversion), physical variables (such as soil, weather, and the availability of water for irrigation) on farmers' willingness to produce value-added feedstocks (e.g., corn stover), dedicated annual bioenergy crops (e.g., energy sorghum), and dedicated perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., switchgrass) for biofuel production in Kansas, though the use of logistic regressions and marginal effects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study was aimed to select productive accessions of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) by screening germplasm collection, as well as to ascertain the influence of grass maturity on quality of the biomass and it convertibility to the methane. In spaced stand trial, according to the dry matter yield (DMY) per plant (sum of 3 cuts per 2 years) the Lithuanian cvs. Aukštuole and Navas DS proved to be the most high-yielding accessions (407.7g and 396.0g) among the cocksfoot, and tall fescue, respectively, while American cv. Palaton (382.1g) - among reed canary grass. In the dense stand trial, the annual DMY of Palaton was 12.79tha-1 and that of the cvs. Navas DS and Aukštuole amounted to 10.32tha-1 and 10.22tha-1. Advancing maturity from the early heading until full flowering increased total solids in the biomass of all the three species by 50.6%-55.6%, the values of NDF digestion by cellulolytic enzymes changed by (-48.0)% to (-58.0) %. The specific methane yields of all grass species and at all development stages varied from 266Lkg-1 VS to 426Lkg-1 VS. The alteration in the bioenergy potential and quality of cocksfoot biomass with advanced maturity stage occurred not as sharply as that of reed canary grass and tall fescue. The dependence of methane yield and energy value of biomass on the chemical composition of herbage was examined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The EU biofuels market is stimulating expansion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia. Little research has yet examined the impacts on water resources arising from this large-scale land use conversion to cultivation of biofuel feedstock or positioned contextual water resource governance in Indonesian locales in a wider political ecology of European climate politics. Through the concept of 'hybrid accountability', we examine primary evidence from an extensive action research process in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesian Borneo, to assess whether the EU's Renewable Energy Directive and existing certification schemes offer a way to improve the accountability of market actors and promote sustainable water resource management. We conclude that these initiatives have had no bearing on safeguarding local livelihoods and the water resources they depend on, with governance mechanisms largely failing to address people's grievances. Rather, the EU's policies on biofuels have supported a de-politicisation of what needs to be seen as 'distributional water politics'. Furthermore, certification schemes such as the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil offer, at present, only cosmetic tools and are insufficient to address deep structural governance issues. We argue that further hybridisation of market-based certification and governmental regulation should be designed with the purpose of providing new transnational recourse mechanisms and remedies for affected communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While much attention has focused on the climate change mitigation potential of biofuels, research from the social sciences increasingly highlights the social and livelihood impacts of their expanded production. Policy and governance measures aimed at improving the social effects of biofuels have proliferated but questions remain about their effectiveness across the value chain. This paper performs three tasks building on emerging insights from social science research on the deployment of biofuel crops. First, we identify livelihood dimensions that are particularly likely to be affected by their cultivation in the global South - income, food security, access to land-based resources, and social assets - revealing that distributional effects are crucial to evaluating the outcomes of biofuel production across these dimensions. Second, we ask how well selected biofuel governance mechanisms address livelihood and equity concerns. Third, we draw insights from literature on non-energy agricultural value chains to provide one set of ideas for improving livelihood outcomes. Our analysis demonstrates that biofuel policies treat livelihoods as a second-degree problem, specifying livelihoods as an afterthought to other goals. We suggest integrating livelihoods into a multi-criteria policy framework from the start - one that prioritizes equity issues as well as overall outcomes. We also show that the instruments with strongest provisions for safeguarding livelihoods and equity appear least likely to be implemented. Together, shifting both the priorities and the relative hierarchy of biofuel governance instruments could help produce strategies that more effectively address livelihood and equity concerns. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Amid debates questioning the social sustainability of ethanol, Brazilian industrialists sought an exportable social verification that could accompany sugarcane ethanol technology transfers to global South countries. Despite an effective national anti-slave labor pact and marketing campaigns promoting the sustainability of ethanol, in 2008, members of the federal government orchestrated a series of meetings between representatives from the state, sugarcane industry, and national labor organizations to discuss labor practices. They created "The National Commitment to Labor Conditions in Sugarcane Activity," a voluntary certification program that they hoped would attest to fair working conditions on plantations and provide acknowledgment for participating businesses. After reports revealed gross violations of labor practices on complying plantations, the certificate was abandoned in 2013.In this paper, I trace the conditions that enabled this certificate to emerge and then fail as a state-sanctioned instrument for governing social justice in the Brazilian ethanol industry. I contend that understanding the emergence of neoliberal governance schemes requires analysis of the historical relationships that intersect with new geopolitical formations. In this case, the state engaged in an experimental form of governance in attempts to export a social certificate alongside technology transfers. This led to the conversion of rights into privileges with no official means for punishing non-complying companies, causing the certificate to lack efficacy and fail. I argue this by connecting the intersecting histories of labor unions, the ethanol industry, and the state to the contemporary factors that led to the need for a mechanism to attest to social sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The sustainability performance of multinational enterprises (MNEs) is often judged from their participation in distinct sustainability standards initiatives. But MNEs interact with a variety of sustainability standards in their value chains. This chapter proposes a partneringintensity continuum to categorize the MNE-standards interactions to explore the benefits of a more firm-based approach for the assessment of MNEs' contributions to sustainability. Methodology/approach - The chapter describes standardization in coffee and biofuels industries and presents the case of a single firm to compose a continuum that reflects how MNEs move between standards attached to operations of single firms, bilateral arrangements with certification schemes, and multistakeholder partnerships. It elaborates this observed continuum by linking international business (IB) literature with the literature on global value chains (GVCs) and partnerships. Findings - Choices about how to partner in and how to handle control over the implementation of standards shape the contributions MNEs make to sustainable development. Specifying how MNEs interact with different standards, with varying degrees of partnering and combined logics, is proposed as a better way to assess how MNEs contribute to sustainable development compared to evaluating standards per se. Originality/value - This chapter draws attention to the phenomenon that international "lead firms" engage with a variety of standards. The chapter proposes that looking at partnering intensity and the subsequent level of influence over the implementation of standards enables assessing how and to what extent lead firms contribute to addressing sustainability problems.

AB  - Main conclusion: Presenting a basic framework for using MLST to characterize Spirodela, Landoltia and in particular Lemna strains at the species level, and to study population genetics and evolution history of natural duckweed populations. Duckweed is widely used in environmental biotechnology and has recently emerged as a potential feedstock for biofuels due to its high growth rate and starch content. The genetic diversity and composition of a natural duckweed population in genera Spirodela, Landoltia and Lemna from Lake Tai, China, were investigated using probabilistic analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The 78 strains were categorized into five lineages, among which strains representing L. aequinoctialis and S. polyrhiza were predominant. Among the five lineages, interlineage transfers of markers were infrequent and no recombination was statistically detected. Tajima's D tests determined that all loci are subject to population bottlenecks, which is likely one of the main reasons for the low genetic diversity observed within the lineages. Interestingly, strains of L. turionifera are found to contain small admixture from L. minor, providing rare evidence of transfer of genetic materials in duckweed. This was discussed with respect to the hypothesis that a cross of these two gave rise to L. japonica. Moreover, the conventional maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis clearly recognized all the species in the three genera with high bootstrap supports. In conclusion, this work offers a basic framework for using MLST to characterize Spirodela, Landoltia and in particular Lemna strains at the species level, and to study population genetics and evolution history of natural duckweed populations. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In urban forestry and greening millions of tons of lignocellulosic waste is produced every year. Although lignocellulosic materials are considered one of the most promising feedstock for the bioethanol production, biomass from urban greening and forestry goes unused. Aim of this research was to investigate the potential of such waste biomass for bioethanol production. Woody and non-woody vegetation from different sources was investigated: old and fresh leaves, and mixed waste from urban greening which contained grass, twigs, and leaves. Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents in the samples were determined using fibre analysis. Dilute acid was used for pre-treatment at temperature of 130°C in order to compare yields from different methods. Thermochemical pre-treatment was followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Produced glucose and ethanol contents were measured using electrochemical analyser. Waste from urban greening had the highest cellulose content of 22.96% and gave the best glucose and ethanol yields, 154.5 g kg-1 and 62.5 g kg-1, respectively when the sample was pre-treated with dilute H2SO4. In addition, map analysis was used to assess the area manageable by urban forestry and greening in the city of Tartu to estimate the potential of greening and forestry waste as a substrate for bioethanol production that could be used as a fuel in city's public transportation system. In conclusion, it was shown that the waste from urban greening and forestry is a very promising raw material for biofuel production considering its localization and high cellulose content.

AB  - The stocks of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and aluminium (Al) in different compartments of the aboveground tree biomass were estimated in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Lithuania. Simulated removals of metals due to the forest biomass extraction in a model Scots pine stands during a 100-year-long rotation period were compared with metals pools in sandy soil and the fluxes through atmospheric deposition. Applying whole tree harvesting, total removal comprised about 20kgha-1 of each Al and Mn, and 5 times lower amount of each Zn and Fe. The metals were mainly removed with stemwood and living branches. However, metal export with aboveground biomass represented relatively small proportion of metals in mineral sandy soil. The annual inputs of Fe and Zn with atmospheric deposition were over 10 times higher than the mean annual removals with total aboveground biomass. The content of metals in forest biomass fuel ash was relatively small to compare with their total removals. The findings of this study have an important implications for future practice, i.e. the recommended maximum forest biomass fuel ash dose for the compensating fertilising could be increased with respect to balanced output - input in Lithuania. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) such as poplar, willow and black locust is a promising option for the sustainable production of biofuels and biomaterials. Provided that production technologies, logistic chains and end user structures are well designed in farmers' regional structures, these cropping systems may provide a secure source of income. One of the key problems at present is the lack of knowledge and powerful harvest machinery at practice. Although a lot of machines were developed and tested during the last 30 years, only a few have exceeded the prototype stage. Analysing the process chain for SRC, chip lines seem to be most cost-efficient for harvest, and the modification of forage harvesters for SRC is a promising option. But the high machine weight of forage harvesters is a serious disadvantage due to the limited trafficability of harvest plots in winter. Furthermore, for economic operation of these expensive harvest systems cultivation areas of more than 300 ha are required. Therefore, ATB has developed a simple and low weight tractor-mounted mower-chipper for medium sized standard tractors (75-150 kW) together with the company JENZ (Germany). The chipper is designed for flexible harvest of wood from SRC and Agroforestry (max. stem diameter 15 cm). The total weight of the harvester (tractor and chipper) is less than 50% of the forage harvester combination resulting in much more flexible field operation and lower harvest costs. The machine has been successfully tested in the last two harvest seasons and is on the market available now.

AB  - A new biodiesel-like biofuel is obtained by the enzymatic ethanolysis reaction of sunflower oil with ethanol, in free solvent media, by using BIOLIPASE-R, a multipurpose alimentary additive from Biocon®-Spain that is a low cost lipase from a strain of Rhizopus oryzae. This biofuel is composed by two parts of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and one of monoglyceride (MG), which in this form integrates glycerol, through the application of the 1,3-selective lipases. Thus, this process minimizes waste generation and maximizes the efficiency of the process because no residual glycerol is produced. Response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to evaluate the main reaction parameters (reaction temperature, oil/ethanol ratio and pH) on the sunflower oil conversion. Water content and amount of lipase were also previously investigated. Regarding the results, we found that it operates optimally with a water content of the reaction medium of 0.15%, 0.05%-0.1% lipase by weight relative to the weight of oil used, OPEN ACCESS 20 °C, volume ratio (mL/mL) oil/ethanol 12/3.5 and pH 12 (by addition of 50 μL of 10 N NaOH solution). These results have proven a very good efficiency of the biocatalyst in the studied selective process. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - This paper provides an analytical framework to examine the relative efficiencies of a revenue-neutral biofuel subsidy and a gas tax in the presence of pre-existing distortions and growing substitutability between fuels. Both policies are set to achieve a targeted reduction in gasoline use at the state level. The model is then calibrated for a small open economy such as Illinois which is one of the largest producers of biofuels such as ethanol in the U.S. The main result of the paper shows that raising the biofuel subsidy use reduces overall welfare by more than a higher gas tax, both aimed to achieve a targeted reduction in pure gasoline. The relative efficiency of the higher gas tax is primarily due to it exacerbating the pre-existing distortion in the biofuel market by less than the subsidy. Moreover, for current parameter estimates welfare improving policy combinations for achieving a targeted amount of energy security are higher gas taxes combined with lower biofuel subsidies and a lower tax on income. However, the preference for a gasoline-labor tax swap shrinks as the elasticity of substitution between the two fuels rises. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conversion of plant residues to biochar is an attractive strategy for mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and enhancement of carbon (C) storage in soil. However, the effect of biochar application on the decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) as well as its mechanisms is not well understood in the sandy loam soil of North China Plain. We investigated how biochar affected the decomposition of native SOC, using stable δ13C isotope analyses by applying biochar produced from corn straw (a C4 plant, δ13C=-11.9 0/00) to a sandy loam soil (δ13C of SOC=-24.5) under a long-term C3 crop rotation. The incubation experiment included four treatments: no amendment (Control), biochar amendment (BC, 0.5% of soil mass), inorganic nitrogen (N) amendment (IN, 100mgNkg-1) and combined biochar and N amendments (BN). Compared with Control, N amendment significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased total soil CO2 emission, even when combined with biochar amendment. In contrast, biochar alone amendment did not affect total soil CO2 emission significantly. However biochar, even when combined with N amendment, significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced CO2 emission from native SOC by 64.9-68.8%, indicating that biochar inhibited the decomposition of native SOC and the stimulation effect of inorganic N on native SOC degradation, a negative priming effect. N addition immediately stimulated the growth of microorganisms and altered microbial community structure by increasing Gram-positive bacteria compared to Control as measured by phospholipid fatty acid. Biochar amendment did not alter microbial biomass during the 720-h incubation period except at 168 and 720h, but significantly (P&lt;0.05) lowered dissolved organic C (DOC) content in soil, primarily due to sorption of DOC by the biochar. Our study suggested that biochar application could effectively reduce the decomposition of native organic C and a potential effective measure for C sequestration in the test soil of the North China Plain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) between tree rows within young pine (Pinus spp.) plantations is a potential method to generate lignocellulosic biofuel feedstocks within intensively managed forests. Intensively managed pine supports a diverse avian assemblage potentially affected by establishment and maintenance of an annual biomass feedstock via changes in plant communities, dead wood resources, and habitat structure. We sought to understand how establishing switchgrass on an operational scale affects bird communities within intercropped plantations as compared to typical intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest. We conducted breeding bird point counts using distance sampling for three years (2011-2013) following establishment of intercropped switchgrass stands (6 replicates), traditionally-managed pine plantations, and switchgrass-only plots (0.1km2 minimum) in Kemper Co., MS. We detected 59 breeding bird species from 11,195 detections. Neotropical migrants and forest-edge associated species were less abundant in intercropped plots than controls the first two years after establishment and more abundant in year three. Short distance migrants and residents were scarce in intercropped and control plots initially, and did not differ between these two treatments in any year. Species associated with pine-grass habitat structure were less abundant initially in intercropped plots, but converged with pine controls in subsequent years. Switchgrass monocultures provided minimal resources for birds. If songbird conservation is a management priority, managers should consider potential reductions of some breeding birds for one to two years following intercropping. It is unclear how these relationships may change outside the breeding season and as stands age. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current discussions of indirect land use change (iLUC) and the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential of bioresources have turned into a rather controversial debate. The scientific robustness and consistency of current iLUC models and data are at least unclear. However, representatives of the scientific community still dare to provide straightforward political advice in their papers - way beyond the factbased 'proof' of their data and on a level that is usually not accepted by scientific journals. But the actual task and challenge for the scientific community is to determine the environmental performance of bioresources as objectively and fact-based as possible - with a clear and sober focus on integrity and soundness, not sense of mission.

AB  - Expectations are high for energy crops. Government policies in the United States and Europe are increasingly supporting biofuel and heat and power from cellulose, and biomass is touted as a partial solution to energy security and greenhouse gas mitigation. Here, we review the literature for yields of 5 major potential energy crops: Miscanthus spp., Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), Populus spp. (poplar), Salix spp. (willow), and Eucalyptus spp. Very high yields have been achieved for each of these types of energy crops, up to 40tha-1y-1 in small, intensively managed trials. But yields are significantly lower in semi-commercial scale trials, due to biomass losses with drying, harvesting inefficiency under real world conditions, and edge effects in small plots. To avoid competition with food, energy crops should be grown on non-agricultural land, which also lowers yields. While there is potential for yield improvement for each of these crops through further research and breeding programs, for several reasons the rate of yield increase is likely to be slower than historically has been achieved for cereals; these include relatively low investment, long breeding periods, low yield response of perennial grasses to fertilizer, and inapplicability of manipulating the harvest index. Miscanthus × giganteus faces particular challenges as it is a sterile hybrid. Moderate and realistic expectations for the current and future performance of energy crops are vital to understanding the likely cost and the potential of large-scale production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work deals with the investigation of the spatiotemporal distribution of the biodiesel producing local industrial units in Greece. For this purpose, a Geographical Information System (GIS) based application was used to interpret the spatiotemporal changes of the biodiesel production units. The number of these units increased from one being established in 2005 to 20 in 2013. Nineteen of them were established in Eastern Greece and only one in the western part. An S-shape equation was adapted to forecast the future biodiesel production. The 'capacity' curve levels off at 950dam3y-1 while 'distributed' biodiesel levels off at 140dam3y-1. The biodiesel 'real production' is expected to become 120dam3y-1. Finally, the externalities, the driving forces and the barriers that influence the penetration of biodiesel in the local market were investigated as well. It was found that, local biodiesel production decreases proportionately to the decreasing of the diesel consumption, keeping the biodiesel:diesel mixing ratio constant. It seems that, the Greek biodiesel market can be used as an example of the European Union (EU) market which also follows an S-shape curve. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports on the production of biodiesel from baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) seed kernel oil, its fuel properties are evaluated which its finding are limited. The transesterification of baobab oil was carried out using sodium methoxide as a homogeneous catalyst. One factor at a time experimental design was used to study the effect of temperature (30-70. °C), time (0.5-2.5. h), catalyst to oil ratio (0.7-3.5. wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (10-50. wt.%) on the transesterification of baobab oil. Optimum biodiesel production conditions were as follows: reaction temperature (60. °C), reaction time (1. h), catalyst to oil ratio (1.4. wt.%) and methanol to oil ratio (30. wt.%). An optimum biodiesel yield of 96. wt.% was obtained. Important fuel properties such kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, cloud point, oxidation stability and cetane number were measured and compared to the biodiesel properties in the European and American biodiesel standards (EN and ASTM standard). Results show that important fuel properties of biodiesel from baobab oil met both EN and ASTM standard. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Violaxanthin-chlorophyll a binding protein (VCP) is the major light harvesting complex (LHC) of the Heterokonta Nannochloropsis gaditana. It binds chlorophyll a, violaxanthin and vaucheriaxanthin, the last in the form of 19′ deca/octanoate esters. Photosynthetic apparatus of algae belonging to this group have been poorly characterized in the past, but they are now receiving an increasing interest also because of their possible biotechnological application in biofuel production. In this work, isolated VCP proteins have been studied by means of advanced EPR techniques in order to prove the presence of the photoprotective mechanism based on the triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET), occurring between chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules. This process has been observed before in several light harvesting complexes belonging to various photosynthetic organisms. We used Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) to identify the triplet states populated by photo-excitation, and describe the optical properties of the chromophores carrying the triplet states. In parallel, time-resolved EPR (TR-EPR) and pulse EPR have been employed to get insight into the TTET mechanism and reveal the structural features of the pigment sites involved in photoprotection. The analysis of the spectroscopic data shows a strong similarity among VCP, FCP from diatoms and LHC-II from higher plants. Although these antenna proteins have differentiated sequences and bind different pigments, results suggest that in all members of the LHC superfamily there is a protein core with a conserved structural organization, represented by two central carotenoids surrounded by five chlorophyll a molecules, which plays a fundamental photoprotective role in Chl triplet quenching through carotenoid triplet formation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since land-based biofuel production competes with conventional food production, a water-based biomass and biofuel production from cyanobacteria offers large potential. This study investigates the application potential of cyanobacteria for fuel production and by-products by mimicking nutrient depleted environmental conditions. Three Baltic cyanobacteria strains (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermannii and Nodularia spumigena) were inoculated in full nutrient levels, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen depleted medium, before being monitored for 14. days. For screening reasons, multiple parameters such as fatty acids, photosynthetic pigments including phycobilins, biovolume, photosynthetic activity, inorganic nutrients, particulate organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous were investigated every seven days. We observed a strong negative relationship between lipid content, growth and nutrient availability, resulting in high lipid and pigment production in combination with a limited growth rate in nutrient depleted treatments. Our results suggest that cultivation and harvest of bloom-forming cyanobacteria for fuel and by-product production are feasible in Scandinavia, but strongly depends on the desired compounds and biomass. Each cyanobacteria species originally has a species-specific chemical fingerprint that may be modified by rearing conditions and harvesting period to meet the needs of the consumer. This leads to important conclusions regarding future culturing conditions and biomass production of the desired compounds. •High potential of cyanobacteria for biofuel production and secondary metabolites•Chemical fingerprint depends on nutrients leading to high biomass or lipid content.•Scandinavian cultivation feasible but strongly depends on desired compounds/biomass. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cost of harvesting is one of the constraints in improving biofuel economics. Adjusting the ground speed of harvesting machines to maximize their throughput rate in relation to yield level is one of the ways to reduce harvesting cost. To control the ground speed of a baler, a real-time sensor that can predict the swathed-biomass yield in front of the baler would be an invaluable tool. It was hypothesized that the swathed-biomass volume is a reliable predictor of the swathed-biomass yield. A light detection and ranging (LIDAR) based sensing system was developed to sense swathed-biomass volume and was field tested. To correlate the sensed swathed-biomass volume with the Miscanthus yield, a new bale-specific method was developed. A linear correlation (R2 = 0.76) was found between Miscanthus yield and sensed swathed-biomass volume at the time of mowing-conditioning. Yield maps were generated using the developed correlation model. The model was also used to predict the harvested plot biomass. The average percent error in predicting the harvested plot biomass was 12.4% for training plots and 10.1% for validation plots. The analysis revealed that a proper control strategy to maximize the baler throughput rate would be to either operate the large square baler at the maximum feasible ground speed (6 km h-1) or at the maximum achievable throughput rate (35 Mg h-1). For the specific case analyzed, the proposed control strategy would result in the following advantages: 38.0% higher field capacity, 35.6% higher throughput rate, and 30.4% lower baling cost. Further studies and field evaluation of the proposed control strategy are needed. Studies are also needed to extend the swathed-biomass volume sensing concept to corn stover, other energy grasses, and forage crops. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - The domestication of non-food salt resistant plants could be helpful for biofuel as well as phyto-remediation of salt-affected lands. Limited eco-physiological studies on halophytes are the major bottleneck in developing such plants as energy crops. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of salt stress on growth, ion homeostasis, water status and photosynthesis of Phragmites karka - a potential biofuel crop. Plants were grown in 0, 100 and 300mM NaCl (equivalent to non-saline, 20 and 60% seawater). Our results indicate that the addition of 100mM NaCl to the growth medium increased plant biomass. Leaf osmotic adjustment was primarily achieved by inorganic solutes (K+ and Na+) while soluble sugars and proline remained unchanged. Higher K+ selectivity and Na+ exclusion from shoots improved photosynthesis and growth under moderately saline conditions. Decreased growth in 300mM NaCl could be attributed to leaf tissue dehydration and turgor loss leading to stomatal closure and decreased CO2 absorption. Our results indicate that P. karka could produce high ligno-cellulosic biomass for ethanol production using brackish water irrigation on saline soils avoiding competition with conventional agriculture. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agrifood sector is one of the most important economic and political areas within the European Union, with key implications for sustainability such as the fulfillment of human needs, the support of employment and economic growth, and its impact on the natural environment. Growing environmental, social and ethical concerns and increased awareness of the impacts of the agrifood sector have led to increased pressure by all involved supply chain stakeholders, while at the same time the European Union has undertaken a number of relevant regulatory interventions. This paper aims to present a methodological framework for the design of green supply chains for the agrifood sector. The framework aims towards the optimization of the agrifood supply chain design, planning and operations through the implementation of appropriate green supply chain management and logistics principles. More specifically, focus is put on the minimization of the environmental burden and the maximization of supply chain sustainability of the agrifood supply chain. The application of such a framework could result into substantial reduction of CO2 emissions both by the additional production of other biofuels from waste, as well as the introduction of a novel intelligent logistics network, in order to reduce the harvest and transportation energy input. Moreover, the expansion of the biomass feedstock available for biofuel production can provide adequate support towards avoidance of food/fuel competition for land use.

AB  - Soil is a natural resource essential to human welfare by virtue of its numerous crucial functions. In the past, soil has been taken for granted because of its widespread, albeit finite, availability. However, now that world's population is projected to exceed ten billion before the end of this century, soil is increasingly perceived as a precious commodity. Consequently, soil is increasingly under pressure by rich private investors and governments within the poorest countries to satisfy appetites for food production and biofuel. A case study is used to explore the plausibility of soil being considered as 'brown gold'. Based on the comparison of land use maps, we estimated the value in terms of resource from raw material, carbon sink and virtual calories of the productive soil lost during the period 2003-2008 in the Emilia-Romagna Plain, one of the most productive areas of Italy. More than fifteen thousand hectares of cropland underwent land use change - in particular urbanization - over the 6-year period with an implied loss of crop production potential equivalent to the daily calorific requirement of more than 440,000 people. Taking into account that Italy is no longer self-sufficient in food production, such a loss appears to be strategically significant. Perhaps more importantly, urbanization and soil sealing has had negative ramifications on environmental sustainability, on both local and broad scales, with increased consumption of public funds. A logical framework of the socio-economic impact of land use change has been compiled and is presented as a possible example of a policy relevant approach to managing productive soils as a finite resource. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microwave heating technique is one of the most attractive alternative applications in the thermal conversion process. In addition, microwave pyrolysis is one of the thermochemical technologies using microwave irradiation heating in order to obtain biofuels and materials from biomass. Microwave pyrolysis not only overcomes the disadvantages of conventional pyrolysis methods such as slow heating, but also improves the quality of final pyrolysis products. Recently, the biomass from oil palm wastes (empty fruit bunch, oil palm shell and oil palm fiber) has been gaining more attention in order to produce the biochar. In addition, biochar is important for sequestering carbon and as an effectively additive to improve soil fertility, aid sustainable production, reduce contamination of water streams. This paper focused on the comparison of biochar characteristics produced from oil palm biomass via microwave heating and conventional heating. Analysis on the characteristics of the biochar includes its physical properties, proximate and elemental analysis, the Brunauer- Emmet- Teller (BET) surface area and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

AB  - Ukraine was once considered the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, its agriculture subject to both extensification and intensification measures. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, both these processes were reversed, giving modern-day Ukraine the image of untapped agricultural potential. Alongside the country's proximity to the European Union and its access to the Black Sea, this has made Ukraine a key candidate as a global supplier of feedstock for biofuel. Demand for the latter is rising noticeably, especially in the wake of current European and international blending targets for liquid biofuels. Ukraine has responded with a number of initiatives to further biofuel feedstock production. We have compiled a material flow account for Ukraine, focusing especially on the development of the agricultural sector since the early 1990s. By complementing this physical account with an in-depth analysis of political and economic developments, we are able to trace the impact of rising demand for biofuel feedstock on Ukraine. We find that the attempt to establish a biofuel sector based largely on rapeseed was not successful but has nonetheless left the country at a cross-road in the development of both its economy and its resource use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Services seem to flow effortlessly from ecosystems to beneficiaries, as free gifts of nature. We integrate such processes, strengthening the model's applicability to non-incremental changes, and to landscape planning. A process analysis shows how use value attribution turns biophysical ecosystem functions into ecosystem service potentials which (except for 'final services') have to be mobilised to provide ecosystem services. Once appropriated, these services generate ecosystem benefits which may be commercialised, or not.The important role of use value attribution for the final (e)valuation of policies, plans and their expected outcome is illustrated by discussing different service potentials attributed to the same function, biomass provision, and the different bioenergy services resulting.For the reverse use of the 'cascade' as 'stairways' for planning processes, the prevailing uncertainty requires legal and participative foundations for decision making, and an awareness of the potentially conflicting private and public interests involved. This reverse application combines with the 'cascade' to form a full cycle of ecosystem services generation and management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sweet sorghum is a multipurpose crop with the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production, human food and animal feed products. Six sweet sorghum varieties were sowed in the Guatemalan Pacific coastal plains for this study. Our goal was to determine which sweet sorghum variety had the combination of higher ethanol productivity from the stem's soluble sugar, and higher nutritional value from the grain. The Top 76-6 variety had the best combined outcome of, higher ethanol productivity and best grain protein quality. The stem and grain average yields obtained were 42.15. Mg of fresh stalk/ha and 2.36. Mg dry grain/ha, respectively. The average ethanol productivity was approximately 220. g ethanol per kg of original dry stem, equivalent to 2465. l of ethanol per ha. The grain had the lowest polyphenol levels and an adequate relative protein quality indicated by a 1.07 protein efficiency ratio value and an 83.2% protein digestibility. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) use in intensive agriculture can degrade groundwater resources. However, considerable time lags between groundwater recharge and extraction complicate source attribution and remedial responses. We construct a historic N mass balance of two agricultural regions of California to understand trends and drivers of past and present N loading to groundwater (1945-2005). Changes in groundwater N loading result from historic changes in three factors: the extent of agriculture (cropland area and livestock herd increased 120 and 800%, respectively), the intensity of agriculture (synthetic and manure waste effluent N input rates increased by 525 and 1500%, respectively), and the efficiency of agriculture (crop and milk production per unit of N input increased by 25 and 19%, respectively). The net consequence has been a greater-than-order-of-magnitude increase in nitrate (NO3-) loading over the time period, with 163 Gg N yr-1 now being leached to groundwater from approximately 1.3 million ha of farmland (not including alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.]). Meeting safe drinking water standards would require NO3- leaching reductions of over 70% from current levels through reductions in excess manure applications, which accounts for nearly half of all groundwater N loading, and through synthetic N management improvements. This represents a broad challenge given current economic and technical conditions of California farming if farm productivity is to be maintained. The findings illustrate the growing tension-characteristic of agricultural regions globally-between intensifying food, feed, fiber, and biofuel production and preserving clean water. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Phytoplankton offer great potential as a bioenergy crop; however, technological advances are needed to intensify their yield and reduce their footprints for water, nutrients and land. One approach to enhance productivity is to grow polycultures of mixed species, which convert abiotic resources into biomass more efficiently than any single taxon. We measured traits related to nutrient and light use, growth rate, biomass production, stoichiometry and neutral lipid concentration in 16 diverse microalgal taxa. Species with large cells (primarily Chlorophyta) showed rapid growth, high asymptotic biomass, low minimum nutrient demands, and high cellular C: N and C: P ratios. These same species also exhibited high minimum demands for light and low lipid concentrations. We grew all 119 possible species pairs and found that biomass yield exceeded the component monocultures in polycultures consisting of species with highly divergent traits. However, underyielding occurred frequently as many pairs produced less biomass than either the mean or the maximum of the two component monocultures. In terms of ecological trade-offs, competitive ability for N and P were positively correlated, but negatively related to ability to grow at low light. In terms of bioenergy production, the species with high cellular lipid concentrations showed both slow growth and high demands for nutrients. Synthesis and applications. Our results identify trade-offs among functional traits that determine the suitability of different algal species as biofuel feedstocks and narrow the search for productive and robust species combinations to maximize bioenergy productivity. An approach based on the ecology of species traits will be more effective in optimizing yield in bioenergy communities than promoting high species diversity per se. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

AB  - To assess the energy potential of different microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana and Monoraphidium were selected for studying the pyrolytic behavior at different heating rates with the analytical method of thermogravimetric analysis (TG), distributed activation energy model (DAEM) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Results presented that Monoraphidium 3s35 showed superiority for pyrolysis at low heating rate. Calculated by DAEM, during the conversion rate range from 0.1 to 0.7, the activation energies of C. sorokiniana 21 were much lower than that of Monoraphidium 3s35. Both C. sorokiniana 21 and Monoraphidium 3s35 can produce certain amount (up to 20.50%) of alkane compounds, with 9-Octadecyne (C18H34) as the primary compound. Short-chain alkanes (C7-C13) with unsaturated carbon can be released in the pyrolysis at 500°C for both microalgal biomass. It was also observed that the pyrolysis of C. sorokiniana 21 released more alcohol compounds, while Monoraphidium 3s35 produced more saccharides. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite criticism, global biofuel production continues to rise, using primarily food crops. Between 2001 and 2012 it increased nearly six-fold, driven primarily by domestic policies, yet raising strong international concerns, eg over impacts on global food prices. Nevertheless, little international biofuel governance has emerged. This article examines the various extraterritorial dimensions of domestic biofuel policies and investigates why international biofuel governance has remained vague, despite its controversial nature. It uses the politics of scale to analyse why countries may wish to frame it as a global or domestic issue. Three extraterritorial dimensions are identified: global environmental impacts, global socioeconomic impacts, and attempts at extraterritorial control over biofuel production abroad. While major producers have successfully avoided liability for impacts by preventing the scaling up of much biofuel governance to the international level, major importers have tried to fill perceived governance gaps using policies aimed at extraterritorial control. We show that both the rise of nationally oriented development policies with extraterritorial impacts and of unilateral sustainability rule making primarily affect weaker countries, making global inequalities more pronounced. It is essential that adaptation governance take into account both environmental and global socioeconomic changes, such as higher agricultural commodity prices. © 2014 © 2014 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method to estimate the future biomass energy potential in countries with domestic markets unable to influence international markets. As a study case, the biomass energy potential in Colombia is estimated for the period 2010-2030.The prediction model is a scenario-based optimization algorithm that maximizes the yearly profit of locally producing and importing commodities in a country subject to certain constraints (domestic demand, limited area, etc.) as well as to demographic, macroeconomic and market data (e.g. domestic and international prices of commodities). The bioenergy potential associated to the production of commodities is calculated according to a methodology presented by the same authors. In order to provide a modeling framework consistent with other state-of-the-art projections, global scenarios for analysis are selected from the literature rather than formulated. Selected global scenarios highlight the influence of global biofuel use on agricultural prices, production and demand.Results predict a theoretical bioenergy potential in Colombia 56%-69% larger in 2030 than in 2010 (1.31-1.41EJ). A sensitivity analysis shows that while a higher global biofuel use leads to a higher local bioenergy potential, its influence is less pronounced than that of agricultural yields, demand and specific energy of biomass resources. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent spikes in commodity prices, the growing appetite for primary commodities among emerging economies, growing interest in biofuels and speculations over future returns to land and its products have led to a renewed interest in farmland in the global South. With highly publicized risks and polarized "win-lose" narratives, so-called "land grabbing" has become an important focus of transnational governance activity. In juxtaposition to those seeing large-scale land acquisitions as inherently risky or undesirable, some argue for the potential opportunities they engender-provided risks can be mitigated through improved governance. This paper explores this argument through a systematic analysis of the formal features of the multi-sited governance mechanisms in place to guide agricultural investment and govern its social and environmental effects. The intent is not to discount the importance of informal norms and practices or the so-called "lived experience of governance," nor the argument that such land acquisitions are inherently flawed irrespective of the "discipline imposed on them." Rather, the paper aims to explore the merits of the arguments advanced by the pro-investment camp, and to explore the extent to which the emerging global governance architecture is set up to deliver on the purported benefits of large-scale agricultural investment. Results suggest that serious weaknesses in the substantive scope, reach and/or implementation mechanisms in all of the reviewed governance mechanisms pose a serious risk to the likely effectiveness of the emerging governance architecture in minimizing risks and leveraging benefits. Addressing these weaknesses is an obvious first step for bolstering the credibility of those advocating that governance is the solution. © 2014 by The Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - Instead of sole nutrient starvation to boost algal lipid production, we addressed nutrient limitation at two different seasons (autumn and spring) during outdoor cultivation in flat panel photobioreactors. Lipid accumulation, biomass and lipid productivity and changes in fatty acid composition of Nannochloropsis oculata were investigated under nitrogen (N) limitation (nitrate:phosphate N:P 5, N:P 2.5 molar ratio). N. oculata was able to maintain a high biomass productivity under N-limitation compared to N-sufficiency (N:P 20) at both seasons, which in spring resulted in nearly double lipid productivity under N-limited conditions (0.21 g L-1 day-1 ) compared to N-sufficiency (0.11 g L-1 day-1). Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased from 76% to nearly 90% of total fatty acids in N-limited cultures. Higher biomass and lipid productivity in spring could, partly, be explained by higher irradiance, partly by greater harvesting rate (∼30%). Our results indicate the potential for the production of algal high value products (i.e., polyunsaturated fatty acids) during both N-sufficiency and N-limitation. To meet the sustainability challenges of algal biomass production, we propose a dual-system process: Closed photobioreactors producing biomass for high value products and inoculum for larger raceway ponds recycling waste/exhaust streams to produce bulk chemicals for fuel, feed and industrial material. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Modern agriculture is causing extensive environmental damage. Arguments have been put forward that a systemic change is needed in agriculture to address the major environmental challenges faced by mankind. This is a case study of a research farm whose aim is to form a farming system that has a minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles while maintaining biodiversity. For the farm to minimise its impact on the global carbon cycle and associated climate change, it is important to reduce fossil energy use. The research farm has minimised all its inputs, but uses a diesel-run tractor. Agriculture's primary function is to provide food of adequate quality. The hypothesis of this study is that using biomass from arable land for tractor work on the farm would reduce the amount of food produced relative to using fossil fuel for tractor work. The objective of this paper was to develop scenarios for biomass-derived tractor work for the study farm chosen and to investigate their impact on food production. Food availability was measured by the number of people the farm could supply, denoted as Np. A farm nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) balance was also applied to the different scenarios. The investigated scenarios for replacing fossil fuel tractor work were draught horsepower combined with cold-pressed rape-seed oil in a tractor, ethanol from wheat produced in a conventional ethanol plant, and farm-made ethanol from potatoes. Using wheat and potato to produce ethanol reduced food production by 23% and 18% respectively, compared to using conventional diesel. Combining a draught horse and on-farm cold-pressed rapeseed oil only reduced the food production by 6%. N is maintained in all scenarios due to the nitrogen-fixing leys. P can be maintained in the fields if bones are recycled, but nutrients, especially K, are moved from meadow to field. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A variety of researchers have constructed and presented lifecycle assessments of the microalgae-to-biofuel process, however, inconsistencies in system boundary definitions and high-level process modeling have led to a wide range of results. This study integrates engineering process models validated through experimental and modeling research to perform an environmental assessment of four microalgae-to-biofuel production scenarios leveraging the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model. The baseline scenario consists of a down flow open pond growth system, three phase de-watering step (settling, dissolved air flotation, and a centrifuge), hexane extraction and nutrient recovery using anaerobic digestion. The net energy ratio (NER), defined as energy consumed over the produced energy, and greenhouse gases (GHG) for the baseline scenario are 0.7MJMJ-1 and -41.7gCO2-eqMJ-1 respectively. Three alternative scenarios are also evaluated: 1) Improved microalgal productivity, 2) supercritical CO2 extraction, and 3) no nutrient recycle. This research shows that supercritical CO2 extraction is neither currently energetically- nor environmentally favorable and that nutrient recycle plays an integral role in achieving favorable NER and GHGs. The study highlights on the systems level, two findings related to the NER; 1) the NER is minimally impacted with increased productivity and 2) increasing microalgae lipid content detrimentally affects the NER which is attributed to the reduction in the total energy that can be captured by the anaerobic digester. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Successful algal biomass cultivation at scale is a key limiting step for the production of algal biofuels and other high-value products, and crop protection against undesirable biomass losses will be a critically important component of commercialization efforts. If algal biomass production occurs in large, open, outdoor ponds, then it can be expected that invasions of these production facilities by multiple species of algae, invertebrate herbivores, and pathogens will only be a matter of time. This review identifies and discusses key aspects of community and ecosystem ecology that have direct relevance to the successful cultivation of algal biomass. We use experiences and examples from commercial agriculture to illustrate core ecological principles of crop cultivation that we believe can successfully be transferred to large-scale algal biomass production. We then discuss the degree to which herbivores and disease can significantly reduce potential yields, and the concepts of biological control. We also discuss the effects of crop species diversity and composition on algal biomass production, and explore the potential benefits of algal polycultures in large-scale algal biomass cultivation systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale cultivation of microalgae for biofuels may avoid competing for agriculture, water, and fertilizer by using wastewater and avoid competing for land by using the Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae (OMEGA) system. Some microalgae thrive in wastewater; however, wastewater also contains a complex mixture of organisms. An algae culture in wastewater from a San Francisco Treatment Facility in a 1600-L OMEGA culture system was monitored by standard methods. Prima facie evidence of a chytrid infection prompted a detailed investigation of the microbiome over a 13-day period using second generation sequencing of hypervariable regions of the small subunit rRNA genes. The observed bacteria, initially dominated by γ-proteobacteria, shifted to Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia after addition of exogenous nutrients. The dominant algae genera introduced with the inoculum, Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus, remained over 70% of the sequence reads on day 13, although the optical density and fluorescence of the culture declined. Nonalgal eukarya, initially dominated by unclassified alveolates, chrysophytes, and heliozoan grazers, shifted to chytrid fungi on day 5 and continued to day 13. The results of this microbiome analysis can facilitate the development of probe or primer based surveillance systems for routine monitoring of large-scale microalgae cultures. © 2013.

AB  - Cereal residues are considered an important feedstock for future biofuel production. Harvesting residues, however, could lead to serious soil degradation and impaired agroecosystem services. Our objective was to evaluate trade-offs of harvesting wheat and barley residues including impacts on soil erosion and quality, soil organic C (SOC), and nutrient removal. We used agricultural data from 369 geo-referenced points on the 37-ha Washington State University Cook Agronomy Farm combined with model simulations to develop straw harvest scenarios for conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) and both 2- and 3-year crop rotations with sequences of wheat, barley, and peas. Site-specific estimates of ethanol production from 2- and 3-year rotation scenarios ranged from 681 to 1,541 L ha-1 yr-1, indicating that both crop rotation and site-specific targeting of residue harvest are important factors. Harvesting straw reduced residue C inputs by 46 % and resulted in levels below that required to maintain SOC under CT. This occurred as a function of both straw harvest and low residue producing crops in rotation. Harvesting straw under CT was predicted to reduce soil quality as Soil Conditioning Indices (SCIs) were negative throughout the field. In contrast, SCIs under NT were positive despite straw harvest. Replacement value of nutrients (N, P, K, S) removed in harvested straw averaged $14.54 Mg-1 dry straw and ranged from $36.04 to $80.30 ha-1, while straw harvesting costs averaged $34.25 Mg-1, and the current (2014) market value of straw is $65 Mg-1. We concluded that substantial trade-offs exist in harvesting straw for biofuel, that trade-offs should be evaluated on a site-specific basis, and that support practices such as crop rotation, reduced tillage, and site-specific nutrient management need to be considered if residue harvest is to be sustainable. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).

AB  - Sustainability assessments of bioenergy production are essential because it can have both positive and negative impacts on society. Human preferences that influence trade-off decisions on the relevant determinants and indicators of sustainability should be taken into account in these assessments. In this paper, we conducted a survey with five groups of respondents including government officials and employees, academic and research professionals, private company managers and workers, farm owners and workers, and others (e.g. students, residents, etc.) to assess their trade-off decisions on bioenergy development in the Philippines. The analyses of the survey results reveal that sustainability of bioenergy production will depend on the choice of biomass feedstock and these choices depend on people's perceptions. Heterogeneous perceptions among the different groups of respondents on the appropriate bioenergy feedstock to achieve economic, social and ecological sustainability suggest that sustainability of bioenergy is not a generic concept. The use of aggregate indices for sustainability assessments that ignore these perceptions on bioenergy production can thus be very misleading. The preference weights from conjoint analysis, which measure human preferences on different determinants and indicators of economic, social and ecological sustainability, can help improve sustainability assessments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper develops an integrated model of the fuel and agricultural sectors to analyze the welfare and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) effects of the existing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and a carbon price policy. The conceptual framework shows that these policies differ in the incentives they create for the consumption and mix of different types of biofuels and in their effects on food and fuel prices and GHG emissions. We also simulate the welfare and GHG effects of these three policies which are normalized to achieve the same level of US GHG emissions. By promoting greater production of food-crop based biofuels, the RFS is found to lead to a larger reduction in fossil fuel use but also a larger increase in food prices and a smaller reduction in global GHG emissions compared to the LCFS and carbon tax. All three policies increase US social welfare compared to a no-biofuel baseline scenario due to improved terms-of-trade, even when environmental benefits are excluded; global social welfare increases with a carbon tax but decreases with the RFS and LCFS due to the efficiency costs imposed by these policies, even after including the benefits of mitigating GHG emissions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Algae's high productivity provides potential resource advantages over other fuel crops. However, demand for land, water, and nutrients must be minimized to avoid impacts on food production. We apply our national-scale open-pond, growth, and resource models to assess several biomass to fuel technological pathways based on Chlorella sp. We compare resource demands between hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and lipid extraction (LE) to meet 1.89E+10 and 7.95E+10Lyr-1 renewable diesel targets. We estimate nutrient demands where post-fuel biomass is consumed as co-products and recycling by anaerobic digestion (AD) or catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG). Sites are prioritized based on fuel value relative to a set of site-specific resource costs. The highest priority sites are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast, but potential sites exist nationwide. Compared to LE, HTL reduces land requirements at least 50%, freshwater consumption at least 33%, and saline groundwater by 85%. Without recycling, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) demand is reduced 44%, but remains significant relative to current U.S. agricultural consumption. The most nutrient-efficient pathways are LE+CHG for N and HTL+CHG for P (by 52%). Resource gains for HTL+CHG are offset by a 284% increase in N consumption relative to LE+CHG (with potential for further recycling). Nutrient recycling is essential to effective use of alternative nutrient sources. While modeling of availability and costs remains, for HTL+CHG at the 7.95E+10Lyr-1 production target, municipal sources can offset up to 20% of N and 49% of P demand and animal manure could potentially satisfy demands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy cane varieties are high-fiber sugarcane clones which represent a promising feedstock in the production of alternative biofuels and biobased products. This study explored the crop establishment and whole farm production costs of growing energy cane as a biofuel feedstock in the southeastern USA. More specifically, total production costs on a feedstock dry matter biomass basis were estimated for five perennial energy cane varieties over alternative crop cycle lengths. Variable production costs for energy cane production were estimated to be in the $63 to $76 Mg-1 range of biomass dry matter for crop cycles through harvest of fourth through sixth stubble crops. Total production costs, including charges for fixed equipment costs, general farm overhead, and land rent, were estimated to range between $105 and $127 Mg-1 of feedstock biomass dry matter material. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - The growing interest in the use of alternative biomass products for fuel production requires a thorough understanding of the environmental impacts associated with the production of these bioenergy crops. Corn silage is a potential bioenergy feedstock; however, water quality implications for its utilization as a biofeedstock are not understood. The objective of this work was to evaluate water quality impacts associated with corn silage production. The GLEAMS-NAPRA model was used to quantify runoff, percolation, erosion, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and pesticide losses attributed to the production of corn silage with and without winter cover crops for two tillage options (conventional tillage and no till) on three Indiana soils. Results revealed that corn silage would generate greater annual surface runoff (1 to 6 mm) and percolation (1 to 20 mm) compared with corn grain and grain plus stover cropping systems. Silage/winter cereal rye cover crop reduced annual surface runoff and percolation and was strongly influenced by increases in evapotranspiration, when compared with continuous silage production. Silage managed with winter cereal rye cover crop influenced water quality by reducing annual nitrate losses with runoff from a low of 14 % to a high of 27 %, with relatively no effect because of tillage management. No-till practice on silage system produced significantly greater phosphorus losses (7.46 to 18.07 kg/ha) in comparison to silage/cereal rye, corn grain, and grain plus stover harvest (p < 0.05). For every 1,000 l of ethanol produced from corn silage, erosion losses ranged from 0.07 to 0.95 t/ha for conventional tillage practices and from 0.06 to 0.83 t/ha for no-till practices. The feasibility of cropping systems such as corn silage/cereal rye could contribute to large-scale biomass production but should be further investigated. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Jatropha is a potential biofuel crop suitable for growth on degraded lands. There is no conflict between food and fuel with the use of this plant. Against this backdrop, the research of our institute has been focused on cultivation on wastelands, where conventional crops cannot thrive. If merely neglected, wastelands are further degraded and eventually become deserts. These barren lands naturally sustain low diversity of flora and fauna and can support only abysmal ecosystem services. Jatropha cultivation has been shown to improve the soil properties of such lands. This article documents different flora and fauna frequently observed in the transformed ecosystem brought about by the resultant land use change. The article also discusses the ecosystem services gained in the process. Thus, economic and climate change benefits result from Jatropha cultivation in wastelands. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Corn (Zea mays L.) cobs are being evaluated as a potential bioenergy feedstock for combined heat and power generation (CHP) and conversion into a biofuel. The objective of this study was to determine corn cob availability in north central United States (Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota) using existing corn grain ethanol plants as a proxy for possible future co-located cellulosic ethanol plants. Cob production estimates averaged 6.04Tg and 8.87Tg using a 40km radius area and 80km radius area, respectively, from existing corn grain ethanol plants. The use of CHP from cobs reduces overall GHG emissions by 60%-65% from existing dry mill ethanol plants. An integrated biorefinery further reduces corn grain ethanol GHG emissions with estimated ranges from 13.9g CO2equivMJ-1 to 17.4g CO2equivMJ-1. Significant radius area overlap (53% overlap for 40km radius and 86% overlap for 80km radius) exists for cob availability between current corn grain ethanol plants in this region suggesting possible cob supply constraints for a mature biofuel industry. A multi-feedstock approach will likely be required to meet multiple end user renewable energy requirements for the north central United States. Economic and feedstock logistics models need to account for possible supply constraints under a mature biofuel industry. © 2014.

AB  - Calluna vulgaris can and does grow in areas considered unsuitable for production of biomass crops. In the UK, Calluna vegetation is regularly controlled by burn management and if instead the lost biomass could be harvested would it represent a viable energy crop? This study used established techniques for other energy crops to assess the energy yield, energy efficiency and the greenhouse gas savings represented by cropping of Calluna under two scenarios; only harvested on the area currently under burn management; and harvested on the present total area of Calluna in the UK. The study can consider biomass potential across the UK and can include altitude changes. The study can show that Calluna would represent an efficient energy crop in areas where it would not be possible to revert to functioning peat bogs. The energy efficiency was 65±19GJoutputGJinput-1 with GHG savings of up to 11tonnes CO2eq ha-1 yr-1. When considered across the UK the potential energy production was up to 40.7PJ yr-1 and the potential greenhouse gas saving was upto -2061ktonnes CO2eq yr-1 if the all Calluna could be brought into production and substituted for coal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmentally benign, economically viable, and socially acceptable agronomic strategies are needed to launch a sustainable lignocellulosic biofuel industry. Our objective was to demonstrate a landscape planning process that can ensure adequate supplies of corn (Zea mays L.) stover feedstock while protecting and improving soil quality. The Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) was used to develop land use strategies that were then scaled up for five U.S. Corn Belt states (Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota) to illustrate the impact that could be achieved. Our results show an annual sustainable stover supply of 194 million Mg without exceeding soil erosion T values or depleting soil organic carbon [i.e., soil conditioning index (SCI) > 0] when no-till, winter cover crop, and vegetative barriers were incorporated into the landscape. A second, more rigorous conservation target was set to enhance soil quality while sustainably harvesting stover. By requiring erosion to be <1/2 T and the SCI-organic matter (OM) subfactor to be > 0, the annual sustainable quantity of harvestable stover dropped to148 million Mg. Examining removal rates by state and soil resource showed that soil capability class and slope generally determined the effectiveness of the three conservation practices and the resulting sustainable harvest rate. This emphasizes that sustainable biomass harvest must be based on subfield management decisions to ensure soil resources are conserved or enhanced, while providing sufficient biomass feedstock to support the economic growth of bioenergy enterprises. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study quantifies the profit-maximizing supply of corn stover per unit of land under alternative crop rotations in irrigated cropland with and without limits to irrigation. The model is parameterized based on growing conditions in Nebraska, USA. Our analysis quantifies a trilemma between stover supply, groundwater consumption, and food/feed supply per unit of land. In the absence of water conservation policies, higher stover prices are associated with higher supply and increased irrigation application. If an upper limit is imposed on irrigation at the baseline level (for groundwater conservation purposes), an increase in net revenue from stover sale from $15 to $25/metric ton is associated with an increase in stover supply of 5 metric tons/ha and a 2-metric ton reduction in corn yield under continuous corn. Under corn/soybean rotation, such an increase in net revenue is associated with an increase in stover supply of 10 metric tons/ha, and reductions of 0.5 metric tons in corn yield and 0.7 metric tons in soybean yield. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - As energy crop production on European croplands expands, driven by accelerating consumption of bioenergy, there is a pressing need to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with this production. The present study considers on-going yield increases as a means of boosting agricultural output which results in a limited need to convert nature areas and grasslands to additional cropland. For nine land-use variants, the study evaluates cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, net organic carbon fluxes from the soil, and abated emissions achieved by replacing fossil fuels for transport with biofuels. The main finding is that, in European agriculture, it is possible to combine large-scale biomass production with food production sustained at current levels, with limited direct or indirect land-use changes and while accomplishing significant net greenhouse gas mitigation. Maintaining the current (business as usual) agricultural system results in 4.9 GtCO2-eq. of cumulative emissions by 2030. Intensified food production and energy crop production on freed cropland combined with mitigation measure implementation significantly reduces cumulative emissions for the annual crop groups of oil, starch and sugarbeet to 1.9, 1.5 and 2.1 GtCO2-eq., respectively. By 2030, perennial energy crop production can mitigate cumulative emissions to a large extent, reaching negative emissions (i.e. net sequestration) for grass and wood crops of -3.3 and -4.5 GtCO2-eq., respectively. For the variants compared to the baseline, nitrous oxide emissions will increase modestly due to higher fertilizer-application rates, though at improved efficiencies per unit crop quantity produced. Emission mitigation results partly from the temporary increase in SOC sequestration though mainly from replacement of fossil resources by biomass resources. The results indicate that research and policy efforts aimed at further increasing productivity can raise the output from existing European croplands while being able to reduce or mitigate emissions significantly. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - For the biofuel markets and related commodities, we study their price transmission, which is in fact equivalent to studying price cross-elasticities. Importantly, we focus on the price dependence of the non-linear price transmission mechanism. We discuss several methodological caveats. Specifically, we combine the memory robust feasible generalized least squares estimation with two-stage least squares to control for endogenity bias and inconsistency. We find that both ethanol and biodiesel prices are responsive to their production factors (ethanol to corn, and biodiesel to German diesel). The strength of transmission between both significant pairs increased remarkably during the food crisis of 2007/2008. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Effects of an algal hydrolyzate on the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses were examined using four bioenergy feedstocks (poplar, corn stover, switchgrass, and anaerobically digested manure fiber). Feedstocks were pretreated using dilute acid or alkali prior to hydrolysis. Hydrolysis reactions were conducted using the neutralized algal hydrolyzate, citrate buffer, or deioinized water as reaction media. Results demonstrated that algal hydrolyzate significantly improved the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignin-rich or structurally recalcitrant biomass such as poplar and anaerobically digested manure fiber. This study showed that algal biomass can be used as not only a biofuel feedstock for direct diesel and ethanol production, but also a supplemental feedstock to enhance the performance of lignocellulosic biorefining. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Acetogenic bacteria use CO and/or CO2 plus H2 as their sole carbon and energy sources. Fermentation processes with these organisms hold promise for producing chemicals and biofuels from abundant waste gas feedstocks while simultaneously reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. The acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum is known to synthesize the pyruvate-derived metabolites lactate and 2,3-butanediol during gas fermentation. Industrially, 2,3-butanediol is valuable for chemical production. Here we identify and characterize the C. autoethanogenum enzymes for lactate and 2,3-butanediol biosynthesis. The putative C. autoethanogenum lactate dehydrogenase was active when expressed in Escherichia coli. The 2,3-butanediol pathway was reconstituted in E. coli by cloning and expressing the candidate genes for acetolactate synthase, acetolactate decarboxylase, and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase. Under anaerobic conditions, the resulting E. coli strain produced 1.1 ±0.2mM2R,3R-butanediol (23 μMh-1 optical density unit-1), which is comparable to the level produced by C. autoethanogenum during growth on COcontaining waste gases. In addition to the 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, we identified a strictly NADPH-dependent primarysecondary alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH) that could reduce acetoin to 2,3-butanediol. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that CaADH accepts a range of 2-, 3-, and 4-carbon substrates, including the nonphysiological ketones acetone and butanone. The high activity of CaADH toward acetone led us to predict, and confirm experimentally, that C. autoethanogenum can act as a whole-cell biocatalyst for converting exogenous acetone to isopropanol. Together, our results functionally validate the 2,3-butanediol pathway from C. autoethanogenum, identify CaADH as a target for further engineering, and demonstrate the potential of C. autoethanogenum as a platform for sustainable chemical production. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Biofuel production from second-generation feedstock has become critical due to environmental concerns and the need for sustainable energy supply. This paper provides a unique optimization approach of quantifying and formulating the economic and environmental benefits of switchgrass production at the farm level. In particular, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model, which maximizes the revenue from harvested switchgrass biomass and the economic value obtained from the positive environmental impacts of switchgrass yield during a ten-year planning horizon. Environmental impacts include soil erosion prevention, sustainability of bird populations, carbon sequestration, and carbon emissions, while economic impacts are analyzed under various budget, yield, and sustainability scenarios. The proposed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Kansas. Results show that given the current market prices, switchgrass cultivation on grassland and cropland is highly profitable. The model results also suggest that if utilized by the government, conservation reserve program (CRP) incentives could make marginal land more favorable over cropland. We perform sensitivity analysis to address the uncertainty in budget, yield, and utilization of cropland, and present insights into the economic and environmental impacts of switchgrass production. This model can also be extended to biomass production from any other types of energy crops to identify the most efficient production planning strategies under various management scenarios. © 2014.

AB  - Biofuels are an attractive alternative for fossil fuels and demand is growing rapidly, however the environmental impacts of biofuel production must be minimized. Replacing conventional fertilizers with biosolids, processed solids from municipal wastewater treatment plants, has the benefit of utilizing a waste stream and avoiding some of the environmental impacts associated with conventional fertilizers, but the impacts of heavy metals in biosolids must be assessed. In a pot trial, we grew two oilseed crop species, Brassica napus and Camelina sativa, in soil amended with two levels biosolids and soil amended with urea. Seed yield and oil content were compared between soil treatments, and effects on soil chemistry, activity of microfauna, and bacterial and fungal community structure were quantified. We also measured the impacts of biosolids addition on the growth, survival and tissue chemistry of earthworms. Seed yield of plants grown in biosolids was comparable to or greater than that of plants fertilized with urea. Biosolids addition increased soil concentrations of plant nutrients, but also heavy metals (e.g. arsenic, lead, chromium and nickel). Microfaunal activity, as well as soil microbial community structure, was impacted by both fertilizer type and oilseed plant species. Earthworm biomass was enhanced by addition of biosolids though earthworms exposed to biosolids had elevated levels of copper. Our results suggest biosolids could effectively fertilize these oilseed crops and may enhance soil health, but impacts of heavy metals should be considered. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Attributed to economic forces and fluctuations, global food insecurity is the result of international spikes in food prices, and drives dynamic changes in global transnational land investments. In the form of private negotiations, government leases and concessions in exchange for the development of agricultural infrastructure, irrigation systems and transportation systems, foreign soil is being exchanged in commerce between countries at an unprecedented pace. Moreover, this trend has been intensified by the increased urban demand from rapidly developing countries in Asia, as well as the transition of crops from foodstuffs to feedstocks for biofuels in Europe and America. Transnational land investments promote the transformation of local national land resources into global resources, and dynamic changes in transnational land use is the inevitable result of this land resource optimization. Food security will be among China's most significant national challenges in this century. The discourse on food security in China is limited to defending the red line of 1.8 million mu of arable land, while the phenomenon of transnational land investments in a global context and its potential environmental impacts, which may also lead to food insecurity, have received relatively less attention. In fact, great international concern has arisen over China' s land acquisitions for agricultural and biofuel production in the past decade. As an increasingly influential member of the international community, China should be aware of and committed to addressing challenges arising in the course of transnational land investment. Therefore, this paper firstly reviews the background and current situation of transnational land use, and identifies the potential environmental impacts of surrogate farming practice on regional ecological systems. While historically not new, the current processes of transnational land acquisition could be viewed as the largest-scale operation of long-distance farming in human history. Modern agricultural technology, which has played an important role in the improvement of agricultural economy, changes conventional modes of land use and causes further dramatic impact on regional ecological systems. Moreover, through a series of case studies, it highlights the fact that industrial agriculture promoting short-term crop yield is prioritized over long-term soil replenishment and ignores the complex ecology of soil. Water basins-ecologically fragile, economically and politically valuable have also now become the target of a new wave of large-scale agriculture projects promoted by transnational land acquisitions. Consequently, the growing international and transnational commodification of soil threatens the longevity of vast sections of the world's arable land, the quantity and quality of fresh water, and the health of essential ecosystems world-wide, if no proper rules are established to prevent the deleterious effects of soil-mining and industrial farming practices. Finally, the paper points out the necessity of comprehensive monitoring and analysis of trends in transnational land use, as well as the establishment of relevant international rules, for the purpose of maintaining sustainable food security and ecological security. It argues that the guidelines should include the following key points:(1) Ensuring food security, which means broad-scale alignment between transnational land investments and national agriculture and food policies;(2) Consultation with and participation of local governments and agencies, ensuring greater linkage of investments with local development plans; (3) Environmental sustainability, which means quantifying and measuring environmental impacts, promoting sustainable resource use and land use policies, and minimizing the risk of negative impacts on ecosystems, natural processes, and societal goals.

AB  - The anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, secretes multi-protein enzyme complexes, termed cellulosomes, which synergistically interact with the microbial cell surface and efficiently disassemble plant cell wall biomass. C. thermocellum has also been considered a potential consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) organism due to its ability to produce the biofuel products, hydrogen, and ethanol. We found that C. thermocellum fermentation of pretreated yellow poplar (PYP) produced 30 and 39% of ethanol and hydrogen product concentrations, respectively, compared to fermentation of cellobiose. RNA-seq was used to analyze the transcriptional profiles of these cells. The PYP-grown cells taken for analysis at the late stationary phase showed 1211 genes up-regulated and 314 down-regulated by more than two-fold compared to the cellobiose-grown cells. These affected genes cover a broad spectrum of specific functional categories. The transcriptional analysis was further validated by sub-proteomics data taken from the literature; as well as by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses of selected genes. Specifically, 47 cellulosomal protein-encoding genes, genes for 4 pairs of SigI-RsgI for polysaccharide sensing, 7 cellodextrin ABC transporter genes, and a set of NAD(P)H hydogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes were up-regulated for cells growing on PYP compared to cellobiose. These genes could be potential candidates for future studies aimed at gaining insight into the regulatory mechanism of this organism as well as for improvement of C. thermocellum in its role as a CBP organism. copy; 2014 Wei, Fu, Magnusson, Baker, Maness, Xu, Yang, Bowersox, Bogorad, Wang, Tucker, Himmel and Ding.

AB  - The present study was aimed to evaluate the soil carbon sequestration and reclamation potential of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) growing in varying soil conditions. For this, a study was conducted during 2008-2012 at four different sites of Jatropha plantations (Banthara, Gajaria, Bakshi ka talab and NBRI) growing in central India. Periodic sampling was done for plant biomass, litter turn over, microbial biomass, soil enzymes and carbon and nutrients stock of JCL plantations. The analytical studies clearly indicate that irrespective of the soil sites, the Jatropha plantations significantly enhanced (α=5%; p≤0.05) the total organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium content n the soil. During the fourth year of plantations, the total plant biomass (including the above and below ground biomass) of JCL growing in various plantation sites has been increased from 15.20±4.60 to 203.00±40.60tha-1year-1 with a subsequent total biomass carbon content of 7.60±2.30 to 101.50±13.52tha-1year-1, respectively. Similarly, the soil carbon stock of the plantation sites varied from 20.59 to 50.45Mgha-1year-1. Furthermore, the microbial biomass carbon content of the four different sites varied from 132.64±9.28 to 641.32±38.48μgg-1 soils. Therefore, the study clearly indicates that JCL plantations can significantly (p≤0.01) enhance the soil quality including the soil carbon pool and microbial biomass carbon and can be used for the concurrent initiatives on biofuel production, soil carbon sequestration and soil reclamation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the biomass production potential from hybrid poplars using marginal lands in the state of Connecticut, US.A. A land-use suitability model was developed to identify and classify marginal lands in the state that could be used for growing hybrid poplars as a biofuel woody energy crop. The model was built on a geographic information system (GIS) platform, consisting of an exclusion area section, an ecological suitability section, and an economic/land-use suitability section. The model then was used to estimate the total biomass of the land-cover forests, annual biomass from forest and agricultural residues, and in particular the production potential of biomass from hybrid poplars over marginal lands in the state at county level. The results indicated that about 50% of the land in this state is unavailable for hybrid poplar cultivation and that less than 5% is highly suitable. The amount of usable area is highly variable on the county level. Without large-scale land use change, it appears that biofuel production in this state can only be a supplemental resource to the current energy supply.

AB  - With fossil fuel sources in limited supply, microalgae show tremendous promise as a carbon neutral source of biofuel. Current microalgae biofuel strategies typically rely on growing high-lipid producing laboratory strains of microalgae in open raceways or closed system photobioreactors. Unfortunately, these microalgae species are found to be sensitive to environmental stresses or competition by regional strains. Contamination by invasive species can diminish productivity of commercial algal processes. A potential improvement to current strategies is to identify high-lipid producing microalgae, which thrive in selected culture conditions that reduce the risk of contamination, such as low pH. Here we report the identification of a novel high-lipid producing microalgae which can tolerate low pH growth conditions. Lig 290 is a Scenedesmus spp. isolated from a low pH waterbody (pH = 4.5) in proximity to an abandoned lignite mine in Northern Ontario, Canada. Compared to a laboratory strain of Scendesmus dimorphus, Lig 290 demonstrated robust growth rates, a strong growth profile, and high lipid production. As a consequence, Lig 290 may have potential application as a robust microalgal species for use in biofuel production. © 2014 Eibl et al.

AB  - This study monetizes the environmental damage and human health risk externalities associated with the life-cycle production and use of ethanol biofuels from corn-based and cellulosic feedstocks. An integrated economic-environmental assessment framework couples the measured emission impacts from the fuels with individuals' preferences regarding each fuel's externalities. This framework allows the welfare values associated with gasoline and ethanol's externalities to be derived and compared. The results of the study reveal that the production and consumption of corn starch ethanol produce declines in environmental and health outcomes of $1.23 per gallon relative to gasoline for an 85% blend. Depending on the feedstock source, cellulosic based ethanol blends produce modest gains in environmental and health outcomes valued at between $0.04 and $0.06 per gallon relative to gasoline. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biofuel programme was promoted around the globe with mandate of decreasing the dependency on petroleum oil, reducing green house gas emissions, increasing agricultural profitability and as option for rural employment and development. There existed acceptable and popular perception that biofuel production is more economical to reduce petroleum oil dependency and green house gas emission primarily. However, this scalar approach is not found to be uniformly applicable across the world. The exploration of political economy of different regions provides varying priorities for promotion of biofuel programme based on the context, type of feedstock under use, technologies employed and the health of the economy. The issue is not very different for India. Policy documents of government of India mentioned that local level institutions would be given responsibility for resources planning and development through the involvement of panchayat, providing first hand right of resources to local user and priority to local energy use and self-sufficiency. However, at the same time policy remained silen t on technology inputs, research and development and institutional support for achieving objectives set for the local level sustenance for resource use and design. Policy became biased toward transport sector with announcement of mixing of biodiesel with petroleum diesel. Based on the meta-analysis of the existing literature this study raised basic questions toward the policy aim and ambition of jatropha-based biodiesel programme in particular for India and biofuel programme across world in general.

AB  - Removal of corn residue for biofuels can decrease soil organic carbon (SOC; refs,) and increase CO 2 emissions because residue C in biofuels is oxidized to CO 2 at a faster rate than when added to soil. Net CO 2 emissions from residue removal are not adequately characterized in biofuel life cycle assessment (LCA). Here we used a model to estimate CO 2 emissions from corn residue removal across the US Corn Belt at 580 million geospatial cells. To test the SOC model, we compared estimated daily CO 2 emissions from corn residue and soil with CO 2 emissions measured using eddy covariance, with 12% average error over nine years. The model estimated residue removal of 6 Mg per ha a ̂'1 yr a ̂'1 over five to ten years could decrease regional net SOC by an average of 0.47-0.66 Mg C ha a ̂'1 yr a ̂'1. These emissions add an average of 50-70 g CO 2 per megajoule of biofuel (range 30-90) and are insensitive to the fraction of residue removed. Unless lost C is replaced, life cycle emissions will probably exceed the US legislative mandate of 60% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with gasoline. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Renewable energy is an option for many countries simultaneously seeking to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change. Forestry can play a role in environmental policies, such as renewable portfolio standards for bioelectricity, renewable fuel standards for biofuels, and forest carbon sequestration. This paper models interactions and interdependencies between bioelectricity and biofuel production, particularly from forest biomass. A global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to measure the economic effects of bioenergy production from forest products, forest residues, and dedicated energy crops. The land use and emissions impacts on the global economy of revenue-neutral GHG mitigation policies are evaluated. Results show that mandated bioenergy production can substantially reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, especially through fossil fuel substitution in the electricity sector. Although emissions reductions from bioenergy production in the transportation fuel sector are less dramatic than those in the electricity sector, biofuels also have lower emissions rates than petroleum-based transportation fuels. © 2014.

AB  - Life cycle analysis method was used to evaluate the energy efficiency and environmental performance of bioethanol production from sweet sorghum stem in China. The scope covers three units, including plant cultivation, feedstock transport, and bioethanol conversion. Results show that the net energy ratio was 1.56 and the net energy gain was 8.37. MJ/L. Human toxicity was identified as the most significant negative environmental impact, followed by eutrophication and acidification. Steam generation in the bioethanol conversion unit contributed 82.28% and 48.26% to total human toxicity and acidification potential, respectively. Fertilizers loss from farmland represented 67.23% of total eutrophication potential. The results were significantly affected by the inventory allocation methods, vinasse reusing approaches, and feedstock yields. Reusing vinasse as fuel for steam generation and better cultivation practice to control fertilizer loss could significantly contribute to enhance the energy efficiency and environmental performance of bioethanol production from sweet sorghum stem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuels represent a valid alternative to traditional fossil fuels, going to suffer in the next future of the complete depletion of fossil sources. In this context, we present a critical survey upon the production of the three commonest biofuels (biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas), analysing the feedstocks and the transformation process by means of the LCA assessment. Actually, a complete evaluation of the environmental footprint for biofuels production should guide the actual and forthcoming lines of massive fuel production worldwide.

AB  - Ethanol is the main biofuel produced and used today, representing almost 80 % of the total liquid biofuels production and use worldwide. Sugarcane is now the second most used feedstock, behind corn, but it is the one that presents the best performance in terms of GHG emissions reduction and land demand, and it is also a crop more adequate to developing countries production as it is cultivated already in more than 100 countries. The fast expansion of bioethanol in the recent past has brought to light several concerns about its sustainability and the discussions have been, mostly, in generic terms and with strong bias especially toward social aspects. It must be born in mind that biofuels are not equal and even the same biofuel, ethanol in our case, can present different sustainability characteristics depending on the production model and local conditions. By production model we mean the feedstock agricultural production system, the processing path and the socio-economic interfaces between ethanol producing enterprise and the local community. To bring the ethanol sustainability discussions to a more scientific and objective level it is interesting to present the alternatives of production models in an organized way and to have sustainability indicators from the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) to evaluate objectively each one. We propose basically three models: High Technology Model (large scale, state of the art technology, verticalized production and processing, maximum efficiency and lowest cost), Medium Technology Model (mixed sugarcane production - independent grower and mill production, scale compatible with agriculture production, balance between profits and social benefits), Social Model (small independent sugarcane producers and outgrowers, integration with food production and energy services for the local community, jobs); a fourth alternative, the Balanced Model, would be the one optimized as a function of the local conditions, driving forces, government policies, local culture and practices, land tenure profile and existing infrastructure, trying to take advantage of the best characteristics of the three basic models. A preliminary approach to evaluate the alternatives of production models is suggested and illustrated considering conditions observed for ethanol production from sugarcane in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa.

AB  - In the last years new renewable energy sources started to be exploited to compensate exhausting fossil fuels and minimize anthropogenic factors on climate change. Microalgae have reemerged as potential next-generation feedstock for biofuels and they are considered very promising on the long term, since they have a potentially high productivity per area and they can be grown on marginal land without competing with food crops. Our work is focused on the seawater microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana, which combines a fast growth rate with a strong accumulation of lipids and therefore yields great potential for these kinds of applications. Solar radiation provides all the energy supporting algae growth and lipids production and for this reason the available radiation must be exploited with the highest possible efficiency to optimize productivity and make their cultivation on a large scale competitive. Investigation of the bases affecting light use efficiency is thus seminal to elucidate the connection between light and the lipids/biomass productivity. To this aim we investigated the influence of different illumination regimes, nutrients availability and batch/ continuous cultivation on N. gaditana cultures productivity and light use efficiency. This information will be exploited for optimization of growing systems but also to design Nannochloropsis gaditana genetic manipulations. Strains with altered composition of the photosynthetic apparatus and modified regulation of photosynthesis are being selected and characterized to increase Nannochloropsis gaditana productivity in photobioreactors.

AB  - Global crop production needs to double by 2050 in order to meet demands from rising populations, diet shifts and biofuels. Production must increase through more efficient use of currently available arable land to prevent encroachment on land that otherwise provides vital services to the earth and its people (i.e. through increased biodiversity and reduced carbon emissions). Significant improvements can be realised through enhanced management of critical diseases of crops that are pivotal to food security and income generation. To achieve this, the dynamic and complex interactions between crops and beneficial or antagonistic organisms that characterise the biological environment, must be understood. For Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) a crop healthcare system is required that encompasses national responsibility and regional cooperation, and which harnesses global excellence in terms of the knowledge and methods that are available for implementation. This system would be able to control crop diseases in a pre-emptive and cost efficient manner and avoid the current scenario of belatedly combating largescale epidemics. Components would include: risk assessment to predict impacts on food and feed value chains; targeted surveillance; fit-for-purpose diagnostics; control intervention packages; extension mechanisms; and enabling policy environments. Each component would be refined, based on practical feedback and results from research targeted to address knowledge gaps. Specific examples are presented for viruses of cassava, viral and bacterial diseases of banana, stem rust of wheat and a new viral disease complex of maize. Finally, the links among disease control and improved crop quality, consumer health and safe trade are discussed through biological control interventions for aflatoxin in SSA. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - This paper highlights the role of a national Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in Indonesia as "pioneer" actor in the jatropha global production network, linking solutions for local problems with narratives concerning global concerns. Analysis of previous activities of the NGO positions their jatropha project as one period in a sequence of donor-funded appropriate technology programs. On the island of Flores in Eastern Indonesia the NGO aimed to establish community based jatropha cultivation exclusively on "degraded land", avoiding threats to food cultivation, and responding to local problems of land degradation and water resources depletion. In contrast with investors interested in jatropha based biofuel production for export, the NGO aimed at developing biofuel for local needs, including jatropha based electricity generation in the regional state-owned power plant. Anticipating progress in international and national regulations concerning the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) the 2008 project's design included carbon credit income as a main source of future project financing. Using methods of socio-legal studies and political ecology, this study indicates that when the economic feasibility of a project is based on the future financial value of a legally constructed commodity like carbon credits, the sustainability of the project outcome can be questionable. The author recommends precaution when it comes to including anticipated income from carbon credits in calculating the economic viability of a project, as price developments can fluctuate when political support and regulations change. © 2014 by the author.

AB  - The 2013 renewable energy policy mandates adopted in twenty-seven countries will increase the need for liquid biofuels. To achieve this, ethanol produced from corn and sugarcane will need to increase from 80 to approximately 200. billion. l in 2021. This could be achieved by increasing the productivity of raw material per hectare, expansion of land into dedicated biofuels, or a combination of both. We show here that appropriate land expansion policies focused on conservationist programs and a scientific basis, are important for sustainable biofuel expansion whilst meeting the increasing demand for food and fiber. The Brazilian approach to biofuel and food security could be followed by other nations to provide a sustainable pathway to renewable energy and food production globally. One sentence summary: Conservationist policy programs with scientific basis are key to drive the expansion of biofuel production and use towards sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study looks at the potential competitiveness of the emerging biomass-based biofuel industry in the current economic environment. A simulation model suggests that a mature biomassbased biofuel industry is potentially competitive with gasoline, and capable of filling a significant fraction of motor fuel supplies. However, the existing land policy has a narrow definition of agricultural land for a biomass-based fuel industry. A broader definition of agricultural land suitable for biomass inputs would reduce biofuel processing costs, relieve the food versus fuel conflict, and increase the net gain to fuel consumers, food consumers, and producers of food and fuel. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae have been promoted as the next frontier of green biotechnology and gained widespread attention as desirable feedstocks for biofuels. Using conservative assumptions for microalgal growth rates (15gm-2d-1) and total lipid content (25%), the entire "pond-to-pump" lifecycle of algal biofuels for 1000bbld-1 of crude algae oil production is modeled with approximately 4875ha of raceway ponds for solar collection and cultivation and 1463MLD (385MGD) of water handling capacity in the current analysis. Technoeconomic analysis based on an array of 6000 modular 0.8ha (2acre) paddlewheel-driven ponds in New Mexico identified several cost barriers and resources challenges (i.e., nutrient and water resources). For 10- and 20-year capital return scenarios, the cost of algal oil production - $4.10L-1 ($15.52gal-1) and $3.21L-1 ($12.14gal-1), respectively - requires substantial capital and facility maintenance investments with principal cost sensitivities attributed to extraction efficiency and lipid content. Baseline conditions result in an energy return on investment (EROI) of 2.73. Uncertainty in energy requirements for paddlewheels as well as water supply and circulation significantly affect the EROI and operating costs. Alternative strategies to address the major cost barriers are needed for algal biofuels to realize their full potential. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - This work evaluated the conversion of sugarcane straw into a glucose-rich hydrolysate using a combined process system (CPS) which consists of pretreatment, delignification and enzymatic hydrolysis. The sugarcane straw, with 38.1%, 29.2% and 24.2% of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin respectively, was submitted to a hydrothermal pretreatment and a delignification process in order to increase the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis. Straw is the residue to be obtained in sugarcane mills without burning the land previously to the harvesting The CPS, with pretreatment at 190. °C, 10. min, showed 95% of hemicellulose solubilization, 78% of lignin removal and 29% of cellulose degradation. The enzymatic hydrolysis of CPS-cellulignins achieved over 60% cellulose conversion. Considering the cellulose content present in the raw sugarcane straw, only 50% was converted into glucose, due to degradation during the CPS and the enzymatic inefficiency in the hydrolysis stage. In addition, the delignification step did not improve the overall cellulose conversion of the sugarcane straw. © 2014 .

AB  - The article focuses on the interplay between two factors giving rise to friction in bioenergy governance: profound value disagreements (e.g. the prioritizing of carbon concerns like worries over GHG emissions savings over non-carbon related concerns) and regulatory complexity (in terms of regulatory measures and options). We present ethical and legal analyses of the current stalemate on bioenergy governance in the EU using two illustrative cases: liquid biofuels for transport and solid biomass-based bioenergy. The two cases disclose some similarities between these two factors, but the remaining differences may partly explain, or justify, contrasting forms of governance. While there seems to be no easy way in which the EU and national governments can deal with the multiple sustainability issues raised by bioenergy, it is argued that failure to deal explicitly with the underlying value disagreements, or to make apparent the regulatory complexity, clouds the issue of how to move forward with governance of bioenergy. We suggest that governance should be shaped with greater focus on the role of value disagreements and regulatory complexity. There is a need for more openness and transparency about such factors, and about the inherent trade-offs in bioenergy governance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. Ammonia has many important applications including fertilizer for crops and for microalgae-derived biofuel systems. Aquatic cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the air and have been mass-cultured for many uses. This study analyzes, on a life cycle basis, a process to culture the cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047, in open ponds; harvest the biomass and exopolysaccharides and convert these to biogas; strip and convert the ammonia from the biogas residue to ammonium sulfate; dry the ammonium sulfate solution to ammonium sulfate crystals; transport the ammonium sulfate and convert it to liquid ammonia and concentrated sulfuric acid. When compared to the ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process, savings of about 1.0 × 105 MJ of non-renewable energy and 3100 kg CO2 equivalent of global warming potential per 1000 kg of liquid ammonia might be possible. The results are robust and are not sensitive to the model parameters. The proposed system, if implemented, might have a significant impact on many important global issues such as global warming, fossil fuel depletion, and food security. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 618-624, 2014 © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) based biofuel supply chain (SC) analysis framework which enables the study of economic, energy and environmental (3E) performances by using multi-objective optimization. The economic objective is measured by the total annual profit, the energy objective is measured by the average fossil energy (FE) inputs per MJ biofuel and the environmental objective is measured by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MJ biofuel. A multi-objective linear fractional programming (MOLFP) model with multi-conversion pathways is formulated based on the framework and is solved by using the ε-constraint method. The MOLFP problem is turned into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem by setting up the total annual profit as the optimization objective and the average FE inputs per MJ biofuel and GHG emissions per MJ biofuel as constraints. In the case study, this model is used to design an experimental biofuel supply chain in China. A set of the weekly Pareto optimal solutions is obtained. Each non-inferior solution indicates the optimal locations and the amount of biomass produced, locations and capacities of conversion factories, locations and amount of biofuel being supplied in final markets and the flow of mass through the supply chain network (SCN). As the model reveals trade-offs among 3E criteria, we think the framework can be a good support tool of decision for the design of biofuel SC. © 2014 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

AB  - Bioethanol is produced from different source, they have their own application and limitation, and their study is related to fermentation process. In this era ethanol production is not a big approach, but when using some renewable source, it may affect in fuel world. This type of studies have revealed to a novel side of innovation world. Bioethanol from algae feedstock are the "third generation" of biofuel to be known as one of the most important renewable energy source. Today, global demand of ethanol generate the opportunity to explore new renewable biomass sources. Microalgae are a promising alternative source of lipid for biodiesel production but certain algae are rich in carbohydrates of various forms. They provide viable feedstock for fermentation to ethanol. Algae have shorter growth cycle as compared to other plant, hence the algae is a very promising source of biomass for the production of biofuels and also reduce in climate change effects. The review mainly focus on researches related to the bioethanol production, where the algae have acted as a most fast growing supporter of bioethanol and also define the bioethanol production potentially higher than other crops.

AB  - Land management of agricultural crops can have impacts on soil hydrology. The objective of our research was to evaluate subsurface drain flow and soil water storage dynamics due to land management practices of select annual- and perennial-based biofuel cropping systems. The cropping systems were continuous corn (Zea mays L.; harvested for both grain and ~50% of the corn stover) with and without a winter cereal rye (Secale cereale L. ssp. cereale) cover crop, mixed prairies (harvested annually for aboveground biomass) with and without N fertilization, and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations harvested only for grain. Subsurface drainage flows and soil water content profiles were continuously monitored when soils were unfrozen during 2010 through 2012. Cropping systems were evaluated based on cumulative drainage and drainage event peak flows, time lags, and total durations. Cropping system influence on soil water storage did affect subsurface drainage flow characteristics and cumulative drainage. Prairies or the use of a winter cereal rye cover crop had greater lag times by 127 to 179%, lower peak flow intensities by 23 to 36%, and lower cumulative drainage by 37 to 46% than either corn-soybean rotations or continuous corn without a cover crop. The lower cumulative drainage was attributed to greater evapotranspiration rates and lower stored soil water that resulted in a decrease in peak flow intensities and increased time lags of both peak flow and drainage initiation. Low antecedent soil moisture resulted in low peak flows and cumulative drainage. Based on these findings, prairie systems or the use of a cover crop may aid in mitigating flood frequency in subsurface-drained landscapes. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Biofuels production has experienced rapid growth worldwide as one of the several strategies to promote green energy economies. Indeed, climate change mitigation and energy security have been frequent rationales behind biofuel policies, but biofuels production could generate negative impacts, such as additional demand for feedstocks, and therefore for land on which to grow them, with a consequent increase in food commodity prices. In this context, this paper examines the effect of biofuels and other economic and financial factors on daily returns of a group of commodity futures prices using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family models in univariate and multivariate settings. The results show that a complex of drivers are relevant in explaining commodity futures returns; more precisely, the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 positively affects commodity markets, while the US/Euro exchange rate brings about a decline in commodity returns. It turns out, in addition, that energy market returns are significant in explaining commodity returns on a daily basis, while monetary liquidity is not. This would imply that biofuel policy should be carefully monitored in order to avoid excessive first-generation subsidization, which would trigger a fuel vs. food conflict. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in a policy context highlights the need for a "consequential" LCA (CLCA), which differs from an "attributional" LCA (ALCA). Although CLCA offers some advantages over ALCA, such as a capacity to account for emissions resulting from both substitution and price effects, it entails additional assumptions and cost and may yield estimates that are more uncertain (e.g., estimates of impact of biofuel policies on greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions). We illustrate how a CLCA that relies on simple partial equilibrium models could provide important insights on the direction and magnitude of price effects while limiting the complexity of CLCA. We describe how such a CLCA, when applied early in the policy life cycle, could help identify policy formulations that reduce the magnitude of adverse price effects relative to the beneficial substitution effect on emissions because-as the experience with biofuel regulations indicates-regulating price effects is costly and controversial. We conclude that the salient contribution of CLCA in the policy process might lie in warning policy makers about the vulnerabilities in a policy with regard to environmental impact and to help modify potentially counterproductive formulations rather than in deriving the precise estimates for uncertain variables, such as the life cycle GHG intensity of product or average indirect emissions. © 2013 by Yale University.

AB  - Fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) biofuel production technologies may offer a means to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of transportation by providing renewable drop-in alternatives to conventional middle distillate (MD) fuels, including diesel and jet fuel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed study of the environmental and economic feasibility of AF technologies. We find that the attributional lifecycle GHG footprint of AF MD from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass ranges from -27.0 to 19.7, 47.5 to 117.5, and 11.7 to 89.8 gCO 2e/MJMD, respectively, compared to 90.0 gCO 2e/MJMD for conventional MD. These results are most sensitive to the co-product allocation method used, the efficiency and utility requirements of feedstock-to-fuel conversion, and the co-generation technology employed. We also calculate the minimum selling price (MSP) of MD fuel produced from sugar cane, corn grain and switchgrass AF as a range from 0.61 to 2.63, 0.84 to 3.65, and 1.09 to 6.30 $ per literMD, respectively, compared to the current price of conventional MD in the United States of approximately 0.80 $ per literMD. The MSP results are most sensitive to feedstock-to-fuel conversion efficiency, feedstock costs, and capital costs. Finally, we demonstrate that emissions from land use change (LUC) directly attributable to the growth of biomass for AF fuel could dominate the GHG footprint of AF MD fuels.

AB  - Miscanthus sinensis is a perennial grass native to Asia, but since its introduction to the United States in the late 19th century, it has become both a major ornamental crop and invasive species. Previous studies of the ecology of M. sinensis in both its introduced and native ranges have suggested that it may be occupying a novel ecological niche in the introduced range. Miscanthus sinensis and its daughter species, Miscanthus × giganteus, are under evaluation as bioenergy crops; therefore, characterization of the ecology and environmental niche of M. sinensis is essential to mitigate the risk of fostering future invasion in the United States. In July 2011, we surveyed 18 naturalized M. sinensis populations spanning the U.S. distribution, covering a 6° latitudinal gradient from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Miscanthus sinensis populations ranged in size from 3 to 181,763 m2 with densities between 0.0012 and 2.2 individuals m-2, and strongly favored highly disturbed and unmanaged habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Population size and individual plant morphology (i.e., tiller height, basal diameter, and tiller number) were not affected by soil characteristics and nutrient availability, though increased tree canopy cover was associated with reduced population size (P&lt;0.0001). Plant size and vigor were not significantly affected by low light availability, which supports previous suggestions of shade tolerance of M. sinensis. In summary, M. sinensis can tolerate a broad range of climatic conditions, light availability, and nutrient availability in the eastern United States, suggesting risk of further invasion beyond its current distribution in the United States. © 2013 Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - The author analyses the state powers steering biofuel development in two European Union (EU) Member States: Finland and Sweden. The different biofuel developments of these countries are approached through the concept of assemblages, which allows analysis of how the spatiality of national development is constituted in relation to the increasingly global development of biofuels. The approach illustrates how national policies implemented by Finland and Sweden are multiscaled in their origins and mediated by the agents of these assemblages. Materials in the study consist of EU and national policy documents, and 16 interviews from the key biofuel agents in Finland and Sweden. The author explains the differentiation of national biofuel assemblages through their distinguishing topologies, advocacy groups, and the properties of national policy instruments. The results demonstrate how Finnish and Swedish policies have influenced national biofuel developments. The EU's biofuel policies have diverging impacts nationally as they are translated into the specific patterns of biofuel production, consumption, and trade. Consequently, the agents of biofuel assemblages affect the transference of biofuel policies that originate from multiple scales into the national policy frameworks of the Member States. © 2014 Norwegian Geographical Society.

AB  - A comprehensive decision-making tool was developed to optimize the use of a fleet of mobile pyrolysis units in the North Central region of the U.S. to produce bio-oil from agricultural feedstocks. The concept is to use mobile pyrolysis units to convert low-density biomass to high-density bio-oil to minimize the cost of feedstock logistics. The feedstocks evaluated in this project included corn stover, energy sorghum, and switchgrass. It was assumed that (1) energy sorghum would replace grain sorghum and (2) switchgrass would be grown on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A Geographic Information System (GIS) program was developed to optimize the movement of mobile pyrolysis units based on an analysis of transportation networks, cropping patterns, feedstock production rates, and oil refinery locations in the North Central region. The locations of existing corn, sorghum, and CRP fields in the North Central region were obtained from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Model Builder, a utility in ArcGIS, was used to automate the GIS procedures. Network Analysis, an extension of ArcGIS, was used to find the best route to move the mobile pyrolysis units to new locations and to identify the nearest refinery to receive the bio-crude oil. The feedstock input rate for each mobile pyrolysis unit was assumed to be 40 tons/day. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - Considerable uncertainties exist on how increased biofuel cropping affects biodiversity. Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Marginal landscapes often feature high biodiversity that is threatened by either intensification or land abandonment. This is particularly the case in mountainous regions with diverse environmental conditions and a mosaic of land use. Frequently, the use of marginal or set-aside farmland for biofuel crops is proposed to meet the increasing demand for biofuels, but avoid conflicts with food production. Potential ecological effects of enhanced bioenergy production in diverse landscapes are, however, still controversial, and a proper assessment requires the consideration of local and regional specifics. We used a yield prediction model to determine the potential yield of Miscanthus on individual fields in a small municipality. Widely available spatial data, conclusions drawn from literature, and local landscape planning data were used to assess the potential ecological effects of Miscanthus cultivation. The specific landscape planning data for the study area provided detailed information on conservation values and land-use-related functional deficits. All information was used to classify each field by suitability for Miscanthus production, considering biodiversity, soil erosion, and landscape structure. A subsequent field-level and landscape-level evaluation of the potential Miscanthus yields in the suitability classes revealed that overall yield would not be reduced if ecological restrictions were considered and only 'suitable' or 'recommended' fields were selected for Miscanthus cultivation. Instead of defining one threshold value for an 'optimal' amount of Miscanthus in a landscape, we developed different scenarios for increasing amounts of Miscanthus. Our scenario maps and recommendations can be used in regional planning processes as the basis for discussions with stakeholders. The methods applied in our case study combine economic and ecological approaches, are based on existing data and methods, and allow effective evaluation of the sustainable landscape potential of an energy crop at a scale relevant for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the importance of bioenergy to potential future energy transformation and climate change management. Using a large inter-model comparison of 15 models, we comprehensively characterize and analyze future dependence on, and the value of, bioenergy in achieving potential long-run climate objectives. Model scenarios project, by 2050, bioenergy growth of 1 to 10 % per annum reaching 1 to 35 % of global primary energy, and by 2100, bioenergy becoming 10 to 50 % of global primary energy. Non-OECD regions are projected to be the dominant suppliers of biomass, as well as consumers, with up to 35 % of regional electricity from biopower by 2050, and up to 70 % of regional liquid fuels from biofuels by 2050. Bioenergy is found to be valuable to many models with significant implications for mitigation and macroeconomic costs of climate policies. The availability of bioenergy, in particular biomass with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS), notably affects the cost-effective global emissions trajectory for climate management by accommodating prolonged near-term use of fossil fuels, but with potential implications for climate outcomes. Finally, we find that models cost-effectively trade-off land carbon and nitrous oxide emissions for the long-run climate change management benefits of bioenergy. The results suggest opportunities, but also imply challenges. Overall, further evaluation of the viability of large-scale global bioenergy is merited. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The cultivation of energy crops can cause land-use conflicts, including loss of biodiversity in farmlands. In our study, we focus on farmland birds and analyse whether the impacts of such bioenergy activities differ for bird species with different ecology. We do this by comparing the impacts on four example species; skylark (Alauda arvensis), yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava), corn bunting (Miliaria calandra) and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus). We used a spatially explicit ecological model, which combines three simplified crop selection criteria (suitability for nesting, suitability for foraging, spatial heterogeneity) that differ between the selected species. We used the model to investigate change in breeding pair density between a baseline and several bioenergy scenarios that differ in intensity and spatial agglomeration. We subsequently simulated scenarios with potential positive habitat effects (maintenance of 10% set-aside or 10% alfalfa) as well as spatial effects (increased crop diversity and reduction of field size) as mitigation strategies to increase the breeding pair density. The four species responded to the bioenergy scenarios with a decrease in breeding pair density that can be divided into roughly three levels: strong (skylark), intermediate (yellow wagtail and corn bunting) and no response (northern lapwing). The intensity of the response depended on the bioenergy scenario. The decrease in breeding pair density under the least intensive bioenergy scenario could be fully mitigated for all the considered bird species through 10% set-aside. However, with increasing dominance or spatial agglomeration of a single energy crop (e.g., maize), impacts cannot or hardly be mitigated and the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies becomes increasingly more dependent on the ecological preferences of the bird species. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The recent growth in bioenergy crop cultivation, stimulated by the need to implement measures to reduce net CO2 emissions, is driving major land-use changes with consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Although the type of bioenergy crop and its associated management is likely to affect biodiversity at the local (field) scale, landscape context and its interaction with crop type may also influence biodiversity on farms. In this study, we assessed the impact of replacing conventional agricultural crops with two model bioenergy crops (either oilseed rape Brassica napus or Miscanthus × giganteus) on vascular plant, bumblebee, solitary bee, hoverfly and carabid beetle richness, diversity and abundance in 50 sites in Ireland. We assessed whether within-field biodiversity was also related to surrounding landscape structure. We found that local- and landscape-scale variables correlated with biodiversity in these agricultural landscapes. Overall, the differences between the bioenergy crops and the conventional crops on farmland biodiversity were mostly positive (e.g. higher vascular plant richness in Miscanthus planted on former conventional tillage, higher solitary bee abundance and richness in Miscanthus and oilseed rape compared with conventional crops) or neutral (e.g. no differences between crop types for hoverflies and bumblebees). We showed that these crop type effects were independent of (i.e. no interactions with) the surrounding landscape composition and configuration. However, surrounding landscape context did relate to biodiversity in these farms, negatively for carabid beetles and positively for hoverflies. Although we conclude that the bioenergy crops compared favourably with conventional crops in terms of biodiversity of the taxa studied at the field scale, the effects of large-scale planting in these landscapes could result in very different impacts. Maintaining ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services will require a greater understanding of impacts at the landscape scale to ensure the sustainable development of climate change mitigation measures. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the use of bioenergy for achieving stringent climate stabilization targets and it analyzes the economic drivers behind the choice of bioenergy technologies. We apply the integrated assessment framework REMIND-MAgPIE to show that bioenergy, particularly if combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a crucial mitigation option with high deployment levels and high technology value. If CCS is available, bioenergy is exclusively used with CCS. We find that the ability of bioenergy to provide negative emissions gives rise to a strong nexus between biomass prices and carbon prices. Ambitious climate policy could result in bioenergy prices of 70 $/GJ (or even 430 $/GJ if bioenergy potential is limited to 100 EJ/year), which indicates a strong demand for bioenergy. For low stabilization scenarios with BECCS availability, we find that the carbon value of biomass tends to exceed its pure energy value. Therefore, the driving factor behind investments into bioenergy conversion capacities for electricity and hydrogen production are the revenues generated from negative emissions, rather than from energy production. However, in REMIND modern bioenergy is predominantly used to produce low-carbon fuels, since the transport sector has significantly fewer low-carbon alternatives to biofuels than the power sector. Since negative emissions increase the amount of permissible emissions from fossil fuels, given a climate target, bioenergy acts as a complement to fossils rather than a substitute. This makes the short-term and long-term deployment of fossil fuels dependent on the long-term availability of BECCS. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - We investigate the economic and employment consequences of introducing a new sugarcane-based biofuel industry into Australia. We model the new biofuel industry on the production recipe of the existing large-scale gasoalcohol and alcohol sectors in the Brazilian economy. To this end we utilise a hybrid IO-LCA (input-output life cycle assessment) approach, which involves inserting data on new processes and/or sectors into an existing IO table. In particular, we develop and test an analytical and a numerical approach for re-balancing an IO table augmented with rows and columns representing large new biofuel industries. We quantify changes in economic output and employment in the Australian economy. We conclude that a future biofuel industry will be employment-positive for Australia. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biomass as feedstock for energy is often associated with increased claims on land, competition with food production and impacts on other ecosystem services. Studies on sustainability aspects of bioenergy production often indicate biodiversity as a key concern. This article presents a first comprehensive review of published impacts of bioenergy crop production on biodiversity, evaluates the drivers and pressures of biodiversity change and summarizes current trends and impacts. The review provides insight into the types of biodiversity indicators applied under a range of conditions and the mitigating measures proposed to minimize negative impacts or realize biodiversity benefits. The 53 selected publications give diverse results that are explained by the various spatial scales, production systems and regions, time horizons, methodologies and biodiversity indicators used. Reported impacts depend on initial land use and are mostly negative, especially in tropical regions. The impacts of second generation bioenergy crops tend to be less negative than first generation ones, and are in some cases positive (at the field level), in particular in temperate regions. Land-use change appears as the key driver of biodiversity change, whereas the associated habitat loss, alterations in species richness and abundance are the main impacts addressed. Such changes are often paired with the (initiation of a) process of biological homogenization. The article confirms that concerns about the expansion of bioenergy crop production not only relate to the direct effects on biodiversity by replacing natural vegetation, but increasingly to indirect effects as well. These effects have, however, shown to be difficult to quantify. At the same time, the land sparing vs. land sharing debate receives growing attention, whereas little evidence exists in bioenergy literature on the impacts of large-scale application of these strategies on (agro)biodiversity. Following the findings of the review, the article finally provides recommendations for future research. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Increasing the use of renewable energies as biomass offers significant opportunities for Europe to reduce greenhouse gas emission and secure its energy supply. To ensure that bioenergy develops in environmentally-compatible way, the availability of crops, such as perennials, adapted to cropping systems based on minimal production inputs and marginal lands with medium-low soil fertility, is strongly needed. To examine the potential ability in terms of biomass, achenes, and energy yield and the possible role in soil fertility conservation of two botanical varieties (cultivated and wild cardoon) of the C3 Asteraceae, Cynara cardunculus L., a long-term experiment (seven cropping seasons) was carried out in a marginal farmland of Sicily (Southern Italy), with low soil fertility and without external inputs as fertilization, irrigation, weed and pest control from the second season onward. Under these conditions C. cardunculus improved soil fertility by increasing the soil organic matter content, organic C content, total nitrogen, assimilable P2O5 and exchangeable K, giving an annual harvestable biomass and energy yield of 14.6tha-1 and 275GJha-1 (cultivated cardoon) and 7.4tha-1 and 138GJha-1 (wild cardoon). The harvest time, in the third 10-day of August, allowed a very low biomass moisture, about 11% in cultivated cardoon and 7% in wild cardoon. Cultivated cardoon was capable of producing high yields until fifth season, therefore is indicated for medium long-time cropping systems. Wild cardoon showed a most stable yield pattern and plant survival over seasons, suggesting its particular suitability for perennial cropping systems of Mediterranean marginal areas. For these reasons, we have undertaken a breeding program aimed to improve the crop performances in terms of both biomass and energy yield (wild cardoon) and to stabilize the biomass production characteristics during crop ageing (cultivated cardoon). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In an effort to decrease the land disposal of sewage sludge biosolids and to recover energy, gasification has become a viable option for the treatment of waste biosolids. The process of gasification involves the drying and devolatilization and partial oxidation of biosolids, followed closely by the reduction of the organic gases and char in a single vessel. The products of gasification include a gaseous fuel composed largely of N2, H2O, CO2, CO, H2, CH4, and tars, as well as ash and unburned solid carbon. A mathematical model was developed using published devolatilization, oxidation, and reduction reactions, and calibrated using data from three different experimental studies of laboratory-scale fluidized-bed sewage sludge gasifiers reported in the literature. The model predicts syngas production rate, composition, and temperature as functions of the biosolids composition and feed rate, the air input rate, and gasifier bottom temperature. Several data sets from the three independent literature sources were reserved for model validation, with a focus placed on five species of interest (CO, CO2, H2, CH4, and C6H6). The syngas composition predictions from the model compared well with experimental results from the literature. A sensitivity analysis on the most important operating parameters of a gasifier (bed temperature and equivalence ratio) was performed as well, with the results of the analysis offering insight into the operations of a biosolids gasifier. As gasification becomes a more prominent waste disposal option, understanding the effects of feedstock composition and gasifier parameters on the production of syngas (rate and quality) becomes increasingly important. A model has been developed for the gasification of dried sewage sludge that will allow for prediction of changes in syngas quality (and energy recovery from the waste), and should be helpful in assessing the benefits of new gasification projects. © 2014 Copyright 2013 A&amp;WMA.

AB  - Lignocellulosic hydrolysate (LCH) inhibitors are a large class of bioactive molecules that arise from pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation of plant biomass. These diverse compounds reduce lignocellulosic biofuel yields by inhibiting cellular processes and diverting energy into cellular responses. LCH inhibitors present one of the most significant challenges to efficient biofuel production by microbes. Development of new strains that lessen the effects of LCH inhibitors is an economically favorable strategy relative to expensive detoxification methods that also can reduce sugar content in deconstructed biomass. Systems biology analyses and metabolic modeling combined with directed evolution and synthetic biology are successful strategies for biocatalyst development, and methods that leverage state-of-the-art tools are needed to overcome inhibitors more completely. This perspective considers the energetic costs of LCH inhibitors and technologies that can be used to overcome their drain on conversion efficiency. We suggest academic and commercial research groups could benefit by sharing data on LCH inhibitors and implementing "translational biofuel research." © 2014 Piotrowski, Zhang, Bates, Keating, Sato, Ong and Landick.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the most significant uncertainties for bioenergy applications, in order to identify factors determining the success of introducing bioenergy into the current energy system. Design/methodology/approach: A framework is built for identifying the most significant uncertainties based on studies exploring the positive potentials as well as possible negative effects of bioenergy. The framework is applied to explore uncertainties of bioenergy-based transport fuels and heat and power generation through two real life case studies. Findings: The results indicate that the most significant uncertainties are environmental and economic. Bioenergy applications have potential to mitigate climate change, but also come with negative environmental effects. Case studies show that operations in developing nations contain higher political/institutional and social uncertainty than those in developed countries, due to weaker regulations and enforcement. Research limitations/implications: The paper is part of an on-going research project. Results will be verified with stakeholder interviews and analysis. Further institutional analysis of the country settings is necessary. Practical implications: The use of a feedstock with high environmental, social and institutional uncertainties will lower public acceptance. Acting in accordance to the law is not sufficient to ensure sustainability and additional, voluntary measures should be undertaken. Originality/value: The paper identifies the most significant uncertainties for bioenergy. Uncertainties from social acceptance and institutional settings are higher in developing countries and acceptability requires more than following regulations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the perspective of the production of energy and the satisfaction of different forms of energy requirements (electricity, thermal power, fuels), the possibility of using biomass in different forms is yet to be largely applied, but in the future there are very significant possibilities that this solution can be utilized a lot more. In fact it is important to consider these new possibilities in relation to the conversion of marginal agricultural areas to the production of energy crops, the destination of residues for treatment by conversion in energy factors (biogas, thermal gasification) or in energy (thermoelectric plants, co-generation, boilers), and new solutions for biofuels. With the aim to verify these aspects it is important to define the inventories of biomass that are at our disposition or that could be produced in the future, in connection with different hypotheses of development within this field. From these inventories it is possible to establish a potential percentage of the required energy that could be obtained from this type of feedstock. Besides the energy aspect, it is also necessary to evaluate the meaning, the positive aspects and the potential criticisms of these forms of energy production: these evaluations concern an assessment of the requirement for feedstock production, transport and transformation, the positive aspects of the right destination for residues, the effect on greenhouse production and climate change, the potential definition of environmental impacts originating from atmospheric emissions and residuals destination. It is also important to consider the consequences in terms of social and employment aspects; and obviously also aspects concerning the industrial costs, political prices for feedstock and fuels and carbon taxes. On the basis of the defined potential feedstock, it is necessary to evaluate the different technological schemes that can be utilised. In the present paper, all the previously indicated aspects will be reviewed, with reference to the actual and future situations in developed countries and in emerging economies. © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - One of the greatest problems in the production of bioenergy is related to the cultivation of high-quality perennials having a particular chemical content. The yield and chemical content thereof is largely influenced by fertilisers: their types and norms, especially by ones used during the growing period. The production of heat requires plants bringing high biomass yield, having high combustion ability, high heat output and low ash content. Perennial grasses are essential for the agricultural production sector in Latvia. The nature and extent of winter damage on grasslands highly depends upon the climatic conditions, moreover it influences both persistency and yield. Scientists have found out that plant biomass is one of the best sources that may be used for the production of solid biofuels. Ash is one of the main indicators in heat production, since higher content thereof causes problems in the automatic combustion process. Analysis of the ash content among all the three grass plants shows the lowest indicator in timothy, followed by meadow fescue, and festulolium. Analysis of the ash content depending on the fertiliser applied was conducted as well, and it indicated that festulolium, timothy, and meadow fescue effectively react on the treatment with fertilisers. The data acquired shows that biomass has a high ash content; therefore it could be useful to produce pellets from grass plant biomass, mixing it with wood, which would reduce ash content (one of the key problems in the combustion process causing problems for the heating system). © 2014 WIT Press.

AB  - Various crops have been used for energy production while striving to maintain C storage derived from roots in soils. To better understand and document the rates of root decomposition in biofuel cropping systems, we compared the evolution of CO2 from roots incubated with samples of two Iowa Mollisols (Clarion and Nicollet). Root samples were collected from experimental plots for four cropping systems: a multispecies reconstructed prairie, grown with and without N fertilization, and continuous corn, grown with and without a ryegrass cover crop. Major structural components of the root samples (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) as well as chemical composition (total C and N) were assessed. The root materials were incubated for 30 days at room temperature (22 °C) by using an incubation apparatus with continuous airflow. The decomposition rates and half-lives of rapidly and slowly decomposable C fractions were calculated by fitting a two-component first-order kinetic model to the data. Mineralizable C ranged from 7 to 13 % of the added C. When the data for the two soils were combined, the CO2-C evolved was positively correlated with both the C/N ratio (r = 0.88**, p &lt; 0.01) and the lignin/N ratio (r = 0.89**, p &lt; 0.01) of the roots. For the Clarion soil, first-order decomposition rate constants for the rapid fraction ranged from 0.07 to 0.69 day-1, whereas for the Nicollet soil they ranged from 0.09 to 0.66 day-1. For both soils, the half-lives of the rapidly decomposable fraction ranged from 1 to 10 days, and half-lives of 204 to 770 days were observed for the slowly decomposable fractions. Among the cropping systems studied, the rapidly decomposable fraction of roots derived from the unfertilized prairie treatment was the largest. Those root residues also had the highest hemicellulose index and higher concentrations of arabinose, galactose, glucose, and xylose sugars than did roots of the other crops. Other decomposition parameters, such as the decomposition rates and half-lives obtained from the two-component model, were not correlated with the root composition parameters studied. Our results suggest that lignin did not inhibit the early rate of root C mineralization in mixed perennial crops. That information could be useful in refining models of root C dynamics in daily time steps or at the scale of a single growing season. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Remote sensing methods have been used to evaluate vegetative growth patterns for many applications, though relatively little work has focused on tracking mine reclamation progress. For coal mines in Central Appalachia, reclamation approaches that include production of biofuel feedstocks are increasingly attractive, as these may yield significant post-mining land values and contribute to carbon-neutral energy supplies. To optimize biomass productivity, the influence of reclamation practices on biomass production must be well understood, which necessitates tracking biomass production over long time periods. Satellite-based estimations may offer low-cost alternatives to conventional biomass estimations and, also, the potential to provide critical input for carbon accounting at varied spatial scales. In this paper, experimental biomass production plots on reclaimed mine sites established in Wise County, VA, are used for a comparative study of satellite spectral derivatives, which are evaluated against groundbased biomass estimates. Metrics based on four spectral derivatives, band ratios and spectral transforms were regressed against biomass measured in situ for different species. The results demonstrate that greenness and principal component 2 (PC2) were more efficient than the other spectral derivatives for monitoring the biomass of this reclaimed area. Also, it is shown that Landsat-5 TM has provided promising results for monitoring of the biomass changes occurring from 2008 to 2010 over the study area.

AB  - Bioenergy from energy plants is an alternative fuel that is expected to play an increasing role in fulfilling future world energy demands. Because cultivated land resources are fairly limited, bioenergy development may rely on the exploitation of marginal land. This study focused on the assessment of marginal land resources and biofuel potential in Asia. A multiple factor analysis method was used to identify marginal land for bioenergy development in Asia using multiple datasets including remote sensing-derived land cover, meteorological data, soil data, and characteristics of energy plants and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A combined planting zonation strategy was proposed, which targeted three species of energy plants, including Pistacia chinensis (P. chinensis), Jatropha curcas L. (JCL), and Cassava. The marginal land with potential for planting these types of energy plants was identified for each 1 km2 pixel across Asia. The results indicated that the areas with marginal land suitable for Cassava, P. chinensis, and JCL were established to be 1.12 million, 2.41 million, and 0.237 million km 2, respectively. Shrub land, sparse forest, and grassland are the major classifications of exploitable land. The spatial distribution of the analysis and suggestions for regional planning of bioenergy are also discussed. © 2014 Jingying Fu et al.

AB  - The utilization of Jerusalem artichoke in a biorefinery context was not investigated so far. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of this plant as feedstock for production of bioethanol, protein and inulin. We investigated the biomass productivity and chemical composition of 11 different clones, harvested on three occasions during the fall and early winter of 2011. The results obtained showed that cellulose production per hectare was at least double compared to corn stover, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse and wheat straw, showing high bioethanol production potential of Jerusalem artichoke. Although not high (in total <6% of dry matter), protein and lipid levels could be of importance when biomass is utilized in a biorefinery concept. Harvest occasion determined the biomass productivity and chemical composition to a higher degree than the choice of clone. The average biomass productivity was 88% higher in September than in December. Fresh tuber biomass productivity showed large variations between harvests, where the maximum average productivity in December was 3.4 times higher than in September. Inulin content in dry tubers was between 76 and 85% making the plant an excellent crop, for e.g. inulin extraction, production of high fructose syrup or fermentations. Less mature plants were shown to have degree of polymerization (DP) up to 14, which makes biomass useful as dietary fibre, while the inulin DP in tubers harvested later became as low as 6, showing lower potential with respect to plant utilization for dietary purposes. Results obtained clearly demonstrated that crop harvesting time was an important factor affecting biomass productivity and composition. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When a new crop is being promoted as a pro-poor, like in the case of Jatropha curcas (J. curcas) in Zambian rural communities, it is pertinent to explore factors that might affect its adoption, on not only homogenous groups but also heterogeneous wealth categories. This is because poorer farmers may be reluctant to invest in any untried innovations mainly due to their limited factors of production. Evidence from a household survey of 249 randomly selected farmers in eastern Zambia indicates that some factors that affect the farmers in embracing J. curcas seed production and exchange activities differ according to wealth. While factors related to household labour availability were crucial to involvement in J. curcas collection and exchange activities among poorest farmers, it was gender of the household heads and access to off-farm income that significantly influenced these activities among the well endowed farmers. Results further indicate that the farmers who are relatively well endowed are the ones most likely to benefit more from J. curcas collection and selling activities. Well endowed households harvested more seed from hedges because they have more labour and currently harvesting of seed is not restricted to private hedges. Further evidence show that even with fewer household members, the poorly endowed could be involved in planting of hedges. This is an avenue that can help the poorest farmers especially when property rights over J. curcas hedges are secured. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil is expected to increase its sugarcane production in the coming years. Almost 60% of the Brazilian sugarcane production in 2012 was situated in the state of São Paulo, where production is expected to increase further. This paper reports estimated direct land use changes and greenhouse gas balances (including soil carbon stock changes) associated with expanding production of sugarcane-based ethanol in São Paulo state. Geographic information about the location of existing and planned sugarcane mills and existing land use in these locations is used. Almost all of the sugarcane expansion in 2004-2008 took place on roughly equal shares of cropland or pasture land. The locations of the planned mills indicate that most new sugarcane might be planted on cropland unless the sugarcane is sourced from longer distances than has typically been the case. These results confirm that sugarcane expansion does not cause much direct deforestation but contrast with the view that direct competition for prime cropland is generally avoided since sugarcane is mostly planted on extensively used pasture lands. Analyses of greenhouse gas emissions and savings support the view that expansion of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil will likely bring about substantial savings - unless the expansion causes significant emissions associated with indirect land use change. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work aimed to better understand how aerosol particles from sugar cane burning contribute to the chemical composition of the lower troposphere in an agro-industrial region of São Paulo State (Brazil) affected by sugar and ethanol fuel production. During a period of 21 months, we collected 105 samples and quantified 20 saccharides by GC-MS. The average concentrations of levoglucosan (L), mannosan (M), and galactosan (G) for 24-h sampling were 116, 16, and 11ngm-3 respectively. The three anhydrosugars had higher and more variable concentrations in the nighttime and during the sugar cane harvest period, due to more intense biomass burning practices. The calculated L/M ratio, which may serve as a signature for sugar cane smoke particles, was 9±5. Although the total concentrations of the anhydrosugars varied greatly among samples, the relative mass size distributions of the saccharides were reasonably constant. Emissions due to biomass burning were estimated to correspond to 69% (mass) of the sugars quantified in the harvest samples, whereas biogenic emissions corresponded to 10%. In the non-harvest period, these values were 44 and 27%, respectively, indicating that biomass burning is an important source of aerosol to the regional atmosphere during the whole year. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Treatment and/or disposal of metal contaminated biomass are still an unsolved problem. Knowledge of the metal distribution is of prime importance concerning the application of pyrolysis product streams. Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench was cultivated in a semi-hydroponic system to assess its potential use in phytoremediation and biomass production. Plants were grown in a greenhouse using perlite as substrate, half-strength Hoagland's solution as control (CTR) and the same solution supplemented with a mixture of Ni and Zn (CTM; 10gm-3 each). Shoot and root biomass were determined and analyzed for their metals content. Flash and slow pyrolysis were performed on S. bicolor shoots at 450°C. Biomass and pyrolysis products were analyzed focusing on metal distribution. Mass and energy balances were determined. S. bicolor delivered good shoot biomass with relatively moderate concentrations of Ni and Zn. Metal concentrations in the pyrolysis oils were below detection limits and almost all metals accumulated in the char. In fact, 99% of Ni and 98% of Zn were recovered in the char when a slow pyrolysis process was applied, while in flash pyrolysis conditions both metals were found back in the char and in the heating transfer medium. Furthermore, the percentages of char and oil were higher in slow pyrolysis compared to flash pyrolysis. Energy recovery in the char from slow pyrolysis was higher than flash pyrolysis. Flash and slow pyrolysis can likely offer a valuable processing method for metal contaminated biomass, thus limiting the waste disposal problem associated with phytoremediation of metals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A partial solution to problems associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could be the development and deployment of carbon-negative technologies, i.e., producing energy while reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Biofuels have been considered a possibility but have faced limitations due to competition with food production and GHG emissions through indirect land-use change (ILUC). In this article, we show how emissions from ILUC can potentially be reduced by producing food and bioenergy from biochar amended soils. The possibility of yield improvements from biochar would reduce the land requirement for crop production and thus, lead to a reduction in emissions from ILUC. In our application, biochar and bio-oil are produced via fast pyrolysis of corn stover. Bio-oil is subsequently upgraded into a fuel suitable for use in internal combustion engines. Applying the U.S. regulatory method used to determine biofuel life cycle emissions, our results show that a biochar-induced yield improvement in the U.S. Midwest ranging from 1% to 8% above trend can lead to an ILUC credit between 1.65 and 14.79tCO2-equivalentha-1year-1 when future emissions are assessed over the next 30 years. The model is generalizable to other feedstocks and locations and illustrates the relationship between biochar and crop production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although perennial grasses show considerable potential as candidates for lignocellulosic bioenergy production, these crops exhibit considerable variation in regional adaptability and yield. Giant miscanthus (Miscanthus×giganteus Greef &amp; Deuter), Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. 'Gracillimus' and MH2006, plume grass (Saccharum arundinaceum Retz.), ravenna grass (Saccharum ravennae (L.) L.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. 'Alamo'), and giant reed (Arundo donax L.) field plots were established in 2008, treated with four nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates (0, 34, 67, 134kgha-1y-1), and harvested annually in winter from 2008 to 2011. Giant reed, 'Gracillimus', switchgrass, MH2006, giant miscanthus and ravenna grass at the Mountain site produced mean dry matter yields of 22.8, 21.3, 20.9, 19.3, 18.4, and 10.0Mgha-1y-1, respectively (averaged over the last two years). Dry matter yields at the Coastal site for giant reed, giant miscanthus, switchgrass, ravenna grass, and 'Gracillimus' were 27.4, 20.8, 20.1, 14.3, and 9.4Mgha-1y-1, respectively (averaged over the last two years). Increasing N rates up to 134kgNha-1 did not have a consistent significant effect on biomass production. High yields coupled with high mortality for plume grass at both sites indicates its potential as a bioenergy crop and need for continued improvement. Overall, the perennial grasses in this study had low nutrient removal, although giant reed and plume grass often removed significantly more N, P, K and S compared with Miscanthus spp. and switchgrass. Our results indicate that giant reed, giant miscanthus, and switchgrass are productive bioenergy crops across geographic regions of North Carolina. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the carbon footprint of renewable diesel (RD) production from palm oil, jatropha oil and rapeseed oil. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use change (LUC), feedstock cultivation processes, and RD production and delivery are studied from a life-cycle assessment perspective. The goal of the paper is to calculate the carbon footprint of RD and recommend ways of decreasing it. Our findings indicate that the key contributors to the carbon footprint of RD are found in the GHG emissions of LUC, feedstock cultivation and oil extraction processes. In the case of palm oil, methane collection from palm oil mill effluent (POME) is one of the main contributors to the carbon footprint. Our calculations demonstrate that the RD production and distribution stages generate relatively low GHG emissions compared to the other life-cycle stages; therefore, attention should be focused on the contributing role of LUC and cultivation processes to the RD carbon footprint. If cultivation requires a land use conversion from forest to cultivated land, the resultant GHG emissions exceed emission levels from fossil fuels. If feedstock cultivation is done with no LUC or if grasslands are the feedstock cultivation site, then cultivation GHG emission reductions are achieved. In some cases, RD production may even act as a sink for GHGs. Due to its quality RD can be used without blend-wall limitations in vehicles; therefore, it offers a higher biofuel potential for the diesel sector than does traditional biodiesel. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for RD in light of GHG emission reductions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alfalfa presents a huge potential biofuel source in the Prairie Provinces of Canada. However, it remains a challenge to find an ideal single satellite sensor to monitor the regional spatial distribution of alfalfa on an annual basis. The primary interest of this study is to identify alfalfa spatial distribution through effectively differentiating alfalfa from grasslands, given their spectral similarity and same growth calendars. MODIS and RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR narrow mode were selected for regional-level grassland and alfalfa differentiation in the Prairie Provinces, due to the high frequency revisit of MODIS, the weather independence of ScanSAR as well as the large area coverage and the complementary characteristics SAR and optical images. Combining MODIS and ScanSAR in differentiating alfalfa and grassland is very challenging, since there is a large spatial resolution difference between MODIS (250 m) and ScanSAR narrow (50 m). This study investigated an innovative image fusion technique for combining MODIS and ScanSAR and obtaining a synthetic image which has the high spatial details derived from ScanSAR and the colour information from MODIS. The field trip was arranged to collect ground truth to label and validate the classification results. The fusion classification result shows significant accuracy improvement when compared with either ScanSAR or MODIS alone or with other commonly-used data combination methods, such as multiple files composites. This study has shown that the image fusion technique used in this study can combine the structural information from high resolution ScanSAR and colour information from MODIS to significantly improve the classification accuracy between alfalfa and grassland. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha seed yield prediction is one of the most important influencing factors for developing a supply chain modelling of Jatropha seed. The oil from this Jatropha seed is used to blend with diesel to obtain biofuel (Hiromi, Yamamoto, Junichi Fujino, and Kenji Yamaji. 2001. "Evaluation of Bioenergy Potential with a Multi-regional Global-Land-Use-and-Energy Model." Biomass and Bioenergy 21: 185-203). The Jatropha plant is easy to cultivate and produces high yield if properly maintained. The main focus of this study is to utilize uncultivable wastelands for cultivating Jatropha seeds. As suggested by Liu et al. (Liu, Xiaohong, David B. Grant, Alan C. McKinnon, and Yuanhua Feng. 2010. "An Empirical Examination of the Contribution of Capabilities to the Competitiveness of Logistics Service Providers: A Perspective from China." International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management 40 (10): 847-866), the effectiveness of prediction affects the functional characteristics of a supply chain network design. The yield prediction of Jatropha seeds has two important roles which include (i) the identification of external parameters that affects the yield and (ii) the detection of internal attributes that changes the growth characteristics of the Jatropha plant. The development of the fuzzy inference system is characterized by a large number of input variables (Dobrila Petrovic. 2001. International Journal of Production Economics 71: 429-438). A Matlab programming software was used to integrate an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. This approach gave the numerical as well as graphical output that was used to interpret the final result. The root mean square error values were identified for the given inputs which were then compared with the trained input variables to select the best input among the given alternative variables. © 2014 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of HidroBioDiésel (HBD) was carried out. This partly renewable diesel fuel is obtained from the co-processing of soybean vegetable oil with conventional fossil fuel in hydrotreating facilities of crude oil refineries. The environmental profile of HBD was assessed for the fossil energy use and climate change impact categories. The production systems of equivalent fuels -blends of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME, a biofuel obtained by means of transesterification of vegetable oil) and mineral diesel with sulphur content below 10ppm were also assessed for comparison purposes. The environmental performance of HBD systems compares favourably to those of FAME and diesel blends for the selected impact categories. The estimated environmental benefits of HBD (assuming a 13% renewable blend) include reductions of up to 2% in fossil energy use and 9% in climate change impacts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interconnections within food, biofuel and fossil fuel markets are first described in the context of biofuels technologies and economic policy framework. Consequently, the econometric analysis consisting of Johansen cointegration, error correction model, vector autoregression and Granger causality is applied to price series of 12 biofuel related commodities. While a number of equilibrium relationships are found across the examined markets suggesting their interconnection, we do not obtain a persuasive confirmation of the thesis that biofuels clearly lead to food shortages via the increase in prices of basic food commodities used in the production of biofuels.

AB  - We analysed aerosol optical and physical properties in an urban environment (Kolkata) during winter monsoon pollution transport from nearby and far-off regions. Prevailing meteorological conditions, viz. low temperature and wind speed, and a strong downdraft of air mass, indicated weak dispersion and inhibition of vertical mixing of aerosols. Spectral features of WinMon aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed larger variability (0.68-1.13) in monthly mean AOD at short-wavelength (SW) channels (0.34-0.5 μm) compared to that (0.28-0.37) at long-wavelength (LW) channels (0.87-1.02 μm), thereby indicating sensitivity of WinMon AOD to fine aerosol constituents and the predominant contribution from fine aerosol constituents to WinMon AOD. WinMon AOD at 0.5 μm (AOD 0. 5) and Angstrom parameter (α) were 0.68-0.82 and 1.14-1.32, respectively, with their highest value in December. Consistent with inference from spectral features of AOD, surface aerosol loading was primarily constituted of fine aerosols (size 0.23-3 μm) which was 60-70 % of aerosol 10- μm (size 0.23-10 μm) concentration. Three distinct modes of aerosol distribution were obtained, with the highest WinMon concentration at a mass median diameter (MMD) of 0.3 μm during December, thereby indicating characteristics of primary contribution related to anthropogenic pollutants that were inferred to be mostly due to contribution from air mass originating in nearby region having predominant emissions from biofuel and fossil fuel combustion. A relatively higher contribution from aerosols in the upper atmospheric layers than at the surface to WinMon AOD was inferred during February compared to other months and was attributed to predominant contribution from open burning emissions arising from nearby and far-off regions. A comparison of ground-based measurements with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data showed an underestimation of MODIS AOD and α values for most of the days. Discrepancy in relative distribution of fine and coarse mode of MODIS AOD was also inferred. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Purpose: Biomass waste can be used as fuel in biomass power plants to generate electricity. It is a type of renewable energy widely available in Malaysia because 12 million tons of the biomass waste is produced every year. At present, only 5 per cent of the total biomass waste in Sabah, one of the states in Malaysia, is used to generate electricity for on-site consumption. The remaining 95 per cent of the biomass waste has not been utilized because the transportation cost for shifting the waste from the plantations to the power plants is substantial, hence making the cost of the biomass generated electricity to be high. Therefore, a methodology is developed and presented in this paper to determine the optimum geographic distribution and capacities of the biomass power plants around a region so that the cost of biomass generated electricity can be minimized. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is able to identify the potential locations of biomass power plants on any locations on a region taking into account the operation and capital costs of the power plants as well as the cost of connecting the power plants to the national grid. The methodology is programmed using Fortran. Findings: This methodology is applied to Sabah using the real data. The results generated from the methodology show the best locations and capacities of biomass power plants in Sabah. There are 20 locations suitable for biomass power plants. The total capacity of these biomass power plants is 4,996 MW with an annual generation of 35,013 GWh. This is sufficient to meet all the electricity demand in Sabah up to 2030. Originality/value: The methodology is an effective tool to determine the best geographic locations and sizes of the biomass power plants around a region. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The present investigation aimed to induce shoot multiplication and callus cultures of jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis Link (Schneider)) distinguished clone. To investigate the induction of callus culture, in vitro leaves of jojoba clone (with two different sizes) were cultured on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog) supplemented with NAA alone or combined with BAP. Various growth regulators (NAA, IBA+BAP, 2, 4 D+BAP or NAA+BAP) were used to proliferate callus cultures. Clusters of jojoba clone derived from in vitro cultures were also cultured on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of BAP to enhance shoot multiplication. In addition, low levels of diluted seawater (0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm) were investigated on callus and shoot multiplication. Results indicated that NAA with BAP induced callogenesis, while NAA alone enhanced proliferation. Furthermore, multiplication of in vitro jojoba shoots could be highly achieved by 4.0 mg/L BAP. Increasing seawater levels in proliferation medium increased callus fresh weight as well as shoot multiplication. Oil content of callus cultures was affected by growth regulators and seawater levels. In addition, leaf chlorophyll a, b and carotinoids, total indoles, phenols, sugars and proline content of resulted plantlets could explain the results obtained. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - Miscanthus species are tall perennial rhizomatous grasses with C4 photosynthesis originating from East Asia, and they are considered as important bioenergy crops for biomass production. In this study, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for M. sinensis was developed using embryogenic calli derived from mature seeds. In order to establish a stable system, optimum conditions to obtain highly regenerable and transformation-competent embryogenic calli were investigated, and embryogenic calli were efficiently induced with callus induction medium containing 3 mg L-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 25 mM l-proline, at pH 5.7 with an induction temperature of 28 °C. In addition, the embryogenic callus induction and regeneration potentials were compared between seven M. sinensis germplasms collected from several sites in Korea, which revealed that the germplasm SNU-M-045 had superior embryogenic callus induction and regeneration potentials. With this germplasm, the genetic transformation of M. sinensis was performed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 carrying pCAMBIA1300 with a green fluorescence protein gene as a reporter. After putative transgenic plants were obtained, the genomic integration of transgenes was confirmed by genomic PCR, transgene expression was validated by Northern blot analysis, and the number of transgene integration was confirmed by DNA gel blot analysis. Furthermore, the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of M. sinensis was also performed with pCAMBIA3301 which contains an herbicide resistance gene (BAR), and we obtained transgenic M. sinensis plants whose herbicide resistance was confirmed by spraying with BASTA®. Therefore, we have established a stable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for M. sinensis, and also successfully produced herbicide-resistant Miscanthus plants by introducing BAR gene via the established method. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - In light of the perspectives of ethanol from sugar cane industry in Brazil and the biofuelscurrent international debate, certain questions ought to be examined. The framework for future expansion of ethanol production, to meet with supply needs at national and international levels using the current production model, does not take into consideration the prospect of Brazil's regional and rural development. Although currently there are no impediments to the culture of sugar cane in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil's largest producer of biodiesel, it imports 98% of its demand for ethanol from São Paulo and other regions. The promotion of ethanol market in that State might pass for a productive model different from the practice in industrial monocultures, given their cultural and agricultural characteristics. The IFES (Integrated Food and Energy System) from COOPERBIO -n Cooperativa Mista de Produção, Industrialização e Comercialização de Biocombustíveis do Brasil Ltda., established on an experimental basis in the State, presents multiple economic, social and environmental benefits, potentializing the present food procuction by smallholders and favoring a sugar cane ethanol greater consumption in the inland of RS State. With a few tweaks and adequate governmental policies and instruments, the expansion of this model may even cover the current demand in the State. In addition to the production of energy and foods less dependent on fossil fuels, this model contributes for preservation of ecosystem services and for climate smart rural sustainable development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre, a fast-growing oil-seed-producing tree legume, has the ability to grow on wastelands. It can be utilized for biofuel plantation on such lands. Te preconditioning of young seedlings during the early stage of development with efficient arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) confers several benefits enhancing the possibility of their establishment in fields after outplanting from nurseries. However, before recommending these fungi for inoculation, the suitable AMF species must be identified. Therefore, to determine the potential AMF species, 9 purified fungi (isolated from different sites) were tested for their growth promotion activity. Te inoculated fungi were not able to increase seedling growth. Some fungi reduced growth, which was attributed to more utilization of carbon by fungal symbiont. Development of fine roots was delayed up to 30 days after sowing and hence their colonization by AMF inoculants. Tis could be due to the large amount of nutrients stored in cotyledons of large P. pinnata seeds. Removal of cotyledons significantly reduced seedling growth and plants showed some extent of dependency on AMF inoculants. Thus, it was concluded that AMF inoculations should enhance biomass of P. pinnata only after depletion of metabolic reserves in its cotyledons and such mycorrhizal seedlings can be utilized for biofuel plantation. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - The effect of γ-alumina as a fermentation advancing tool and as carrier for culture immobilisation, regarding VFAs and ethanol production during acidogenic fermentation of glucose, was examined at various process conditions (sugar concentration, pH) and operation modes (continuous with and without effluent recirculation and batch). The results showed that at high initial pH (8.9) the continuous acidogenic fermentation of glucose led to high yields of VFAs and favoured the accumulation of butyric acid. The batch process on the other hand at pH 6.5, favoured the ethanol-type fermentation. The results indicate that in the frame of technology development for new generation biofuels, using γ-alumina as a process advancing tool at optimum process conditions (pH, initial glucose concentration and mode of operation), the produced VFAs profile and ethanol concentration may be manipulated. © 2014.

AB  - While feeding food-producing animals with microalgae was investigated several decades ago, this research has been reactivated by the recent exploration of microalgae as the third generation of feedstocks for biofuel production. Because the resultant defatted biomass contains high levels of protein and other nutrients, it may replace a portion of corn and soybean meal in animal diets. Our laboratory has acquired 4 types of full-fat and defatted microalgal biomass from biofuel production research (Cellana, Kailua-Kona, HI) that contain 13.9 to 38.2% crude protein and 1.5 to 9.3% crude fat. This review summarizes the safety and efficacy of supplementing 2 types of the biomass at 7.5 to 15% in the diets of weanling pigs, broiler chicks, and laying hens. Based on their responses of growth performance, egg production and quality, plasma and tissue biochemical indicators, and/or fecal chemical composition, all 3 types of animals were able to tolerate the microalgal biomass incorporation into their diets at 7.5% (on as-fed basis). Holistic analysis is also provided to explore the global potential of using the defatted microalgal biomass as a new feed ingredient in offsetting the biofuel production cost, reducing the dependence on staple crops such as corn and soybeans, decreasing greenhouse gas production of animal agriculture, and developing health value-added animal products. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - The effluents from molasses-based distilleries after biomethanation are beset with problems of intensified dark brown color, high residual COD, low biodegradability index (BOD/COD ratio <0.2) and toxicity issues for possible land application as a potential fertilizer. Wet air oxidation (WAO) pretreatment of biomethanated distillery effluent resulted in substantial enhancement in the biodegradability index (BI) (up to 0.8). WAO pretreated effluent on anaerobic digestion indicated favorable biogas generation with methane content up to 64% along with concomitant COD reduction up to 54.75%. The HPLC analysis indicated that the pretreatment facilitated degradation of major color containing compounds-namely melanoidins, up to 97.8%. The pretreated effluent with enhanced biodegradability along with substantially reduced color also indicated positive effect on seed germination (up to 100%), implying toxicity reduction of the effluent post WAO pretreatment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lifecycle analysis is a tool widely used to evaluate the climate impact of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the production and use of biofuels. In this paper we employ an augmented lifecycle framework that includes climate impacts from changes in surface albedo due to land use change. We consider eleven land-use change scenarios for the cultivation of biomass for middle distillate fuel production, and compare our results to previous estimates of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for the same set of land-use change scenarios in terms of CO2e per unit of fuel energy. We find that two of the land-use change scenarios considered demonstrate a warming effect due to changes in surface albedo, compared to conventional fuel, the largest of which is for replacement of desert land with salicornia cultivation. This corresponds to 222 gCO2e/MJ, equivalent to 3890% and 247% of the lifecycle GHG emissions of fuels derived from salicornia and crude oil, respectively. Nine of the land-use change scenarios considered demonstrate a cooling effect, the largest of which is for the replacement of tropical rainforests with soybean cultivation. This corresponds to - 161 gCO2e/MJ, or - 28% and - 178% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuels derived from soybean and crude oil, respectively. These results indicate that changes in surface albedo have the potential to dominate the climate impact of biofuels, and we conclude that accounting for changes in surface albedo is necessary for a complete assessment of the aggregate climate impacts of biofuel production and use. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The provision, use and trade of bioenergy differ significantly between countries. This chapter provides an overview of bioenergy trade worldwide and presents case studies of four national biomass markets - Brazil, Canada, Finland and Germany - showing diverging degrees of biomass use for energy provision and biomass potentials. Since energy policy is considered to be a main driver for the use of biomass for energy generation, an overview of bioenergy policy making in different countries and the resulting impact on trade is given. Today, dedicated solid biomass and liquid biofuels are the most relevant traded commodities. The expected stronger demand for biomass resources in particular in IEA Bioenergy Task 40 countries by 2020 may induce further trade activities. The majority of the OECD countries has implemented different support schemes primarily for liquid biofuels and power generation from biomass and has set ambitious political targets for bioenergy for the coming decade. Data availability regarding the resource situation is one precondition for a clear target definition for the development of the bioenergy sector. However, this information is often difficult to obtain. The role of trade in the different countries depends especially on the political support and the specific resource situation, taking into account the overall biomass potential and the expected domestic demand. Hence, for some countries resource limitations can be expected to become relevant when implementing the set national targets for bioenergy. Consequently, this might lead to a comparable higher future import demand for biomass in many OECD countries. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - Particularly in the UK, there is potential for use of large-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) plants to treat food waste, possibly along with other organic wastes, to produce biogas. This paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impacts of AD with energy and organic fertiliser production against two alternative approaches: incineration with energy production by CHP and landfill with electricity production. In particular the paper investigates the dependency of the results on some specific assumptions and key process parameters. The input Life Cycle Inventory data are specific to the Greater London area, UK. Anaerobic digestion emerges as the best treatment option in terms of total CO2 and total SO2 saved, when energy and organic fertiliser substitute non-renewable electricity, heat and inorganic fertiliser. For photochemical ozone and nutrient enrichment potentials, AD is the second option while incineration is shown to be the most environmentally friendly solution. The robustness of the model is investigated with a sensitivity analysis. The most critical assumption concerns the quantity and quality of the energy substituted by the biogas production. Two key issues affect the development and deployment of future anaerobic digestion plants: maximising the electricity produced by the CHP unit fuelled by biogas and to defining the future energy scenario in which the plant will be embedded. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The UK Water Industry currently generates approximately 800. GW. h pa of electrical energy from sewage sludge. Traditionally energy recovery from sewage sludge features Anaerobic Digestion (AD) with biogas utilisation in combined heat and power (CHP) systems. However, the industry is evolving and a number of developments that extract more energy from sludge are either being implemented or are nearing full scale demonstration. This study compared five technology configurations: 1 - conventional AD with CHP, 2 - Thermal Hydrolysis Process (THP) AD with CHP, 3 - THP AD with bio-methane grid injection, 4 - THP AD with CHP followed by drying of digested sludge for solid fuel production, 5 - THP AD followed by drying, pyrolysis of the digested sludge and use of the both the biogas and the pyrolysis gas in a CHP.The economic and environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) found that both the post AD drying options performed well but the option used to create a solid fuel to displace coal (configuration 4) was the most sustainable solution economically and environmentally, closely followed by the pyrolysis configuration (5). Application of THP improves the financial and environmental performance compared with conventional AD. Producing bio-methane for grid injection (configuration 3) is attractive financially but has the worst environmental impact of all the scenarios, suggesting that the current UK financial incentive policy for bio-methane is not driving best environmental practice. It is clear that new and improving processes and technologies are enabling significant opportunities for further energy recovery from sludge; LCA provides tools for determining the best overall options for particular situations and allows innovation resources and investment to be focused accordingly. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The dramatic growth in the production and use of liquid biofuels has led to concerns about associated impacts on human health. To date however, there has been no attempt to comprehensively synthesize the literature on this topic, despite a wealth of new research published over the past few years. We searched the Medline and Embase databases, as well as Google Scholar, in order to review the state of evidence linking liquid biofuels to human health, to characterize the magnitude of potential impacts, and to identify areas in need of more empirical research. The search results indicate that the key pathways to health associated with liquid biofuels consist of four sets of exposures: occupational hazards; water/soil pollution; air pollution relating both to the production and use of the fuel; and the price of food (affecting nutrition). Of these, only air pollution and food price seem likely to meaningfully influence health at the population level: liquid biofuels may improve air quality - at least in urban environments - but could have serious adverse effects on nutrition in food-insecure populations. However, much more work is needed in both areas. Very few studies have explored more indirect pathways to health, such as those relating to land-use change, climate change and economic factors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an attempt to anticipate possible futures of drylands of West Africa in the face of rapid socio-economic and environmental changes, we developed four scenarios based on recent survey data, the literature and our knowledge of the region. The four scenarios are inspired by those developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: (1) 'downward spiral' characterized by rapid climate change, expansion of agriculture and chaotic urban growth; (2) 'integrated economy' with integrated land management, food production for local markets and rural-urban exchanges; (3) 'open doors' characterized by large-scale out-migrations, land grabbing by foreign companies and development aid and (4) 'climate change mitigation' with an increase in biofuel crops, land management for carbon capture and development of off-farm activities. We conclude that the Sahel region is most likely moving away from being a highly climate-dependent region based on agriculture towards a more open and diversified economy. West African countries have to find a balance between the new opportunities and risks created by economic globalization. © 2014 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.

AB  - Algae offer a multiple-benefit opportunity as the products that can result from algal cultivation are numerous and diverse. However, commercial production of algal-derived materials is scarce and in Queensland Australia is virtually non-existent, partly due to challenges around readily available resources. In this work, the potential to regionally recycle waste nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and CO2 to support algal production is considered. A feature of the work is mapping the availability of the three resources for algal cultivation (N, P and CO2) together with climatic and land use considerations. Mapping resolution is defined by the boundaries of Queensland's (Australia) regional authorities. Layering the maps enables identification of regional hotspots for growing algae. Waste resources are shown to be most abundant in Mackay, Burdekin, Toowoomba, Cassowary and Bundaberg; regions which also have favourable eco-climatic conditions. Waste nitrogen is the limiting waste stream, in these and most other regions however additional requirements can be fixed atmospherically, whereas waste CO2 is shown to be abundant relative to waste nutrients. It is found that, based on the availability of waste phosphorus, the top 5 most suitable regions have sufficient resources to produce around 1.1 million t/y of algal biomass. This could potentially produce 309 ML of biodiesel which is 5% of Queensland's 2011 diesel oil sales. The outcomes of this work highlight new opportunities for industrial ecology in non-urban regions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conversion of land from existing uses to biofuel cultivation is expected to increase given concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuel supplies. Nonetheless, research into the environmental impacts of biofuel crops, primarily the hydrological impacts of their cultivation, is in its infancy. To investigate such issues, the response of a 1,649 km2 semiarid basin to the incremental substitution of the widely discussed biofuel candidate switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for native land uses was modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Median discharges decreased by 5.6-20.6% during the spring and by 6.4-31.2% during the summer, depending on the quantity of acreage converted. These were driven by an increased spring and summer evapotranspiration of 3.4-32.0% and 1.5-18.9%, respectively, depending on the quantity of switchgrass biomass produced. The substitution of switchgrass also resulted in larger quantities of water stress days than in baseline scenarios. The authors encourage the exploration of alternative biofuel crops in semiarid areas to mitigate such negative impacts. © IWA Publishing 2014.

AB  - Rhazya stricta Decne (R. stricta) is a hardy, drought-resistant, and arid land plant that is widely distributed from the Middle East to South Asia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of R. stricta seed oil as an alternative source of triacylglycerols that may be suitable for the synthesis of biodiesel. The oil content of the seeds was approximately 14% and was mainly composed of the fatty acids linoleic (60.95%) and oleic (25.48%) acid. R. stricta methyl esters (RSME) were prepared by a base-catalyzed transesterification reaction. The conversion rate of the triacylglycerols to the corresponding methyl esters was determined by 1H-NMR to be approximately 97%. This study showed that the fuel properties of the RSMEs are comparable to other vegetable oil methyl esters that are commonly used as biodiesels. R. stricta plantations will therefore be suitable for promoting sustainable agriculture and for producing biodiesel with viable prices in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Water Research Commission (WRC) has launched a series of investigations following it concerns over the impact of biofuels on South Africa's scarce water resources. The focus of the strategy is the promotion of farming in areas previously neglected by the apartheid system and areas that did not have market access for their produce. The Department of Water Affairs (DWA) has noted that impacts on water quality are as important a concern as impacts on available volumes available to other users and the reserve, and that best practice management for both land and water will have to be applied to all biofuels cropping, both irrigated and dryland. Consequently, the WRC launched a scoping study on the water use of crops and trees for biofuel production, which provided initial results on the water use and growing conditions of some biofuel crops.

AB  - The US Renewable Fuel Standard contains a policy bias that undermines the three-broad policy goals of rural development, energy security, and greenhouse gas reductions. This policy bias, wherein a narrow range of options is expected to address broad societal objectives, contributes to a persistence of first-generation biofuels and limits technical variation. Renewable fuel content requirements have helped to expand the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the short term. However, long-term changes will require greater technological variation to stimulate innovation for the development of sustainable renewable fuel pathways. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the environmental consequences and energy requirements of a biogas production system and its further conversion into bioenergy by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. To do so, an Italian biogas plant operating with pig slurry and two energy crops (maize and triticale silages) as feedstock was assessed in detail in order to identify the environmental hotspots. The environmental profile was estimated through six impact categories: abiotic depletion potential (ADP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ozone layer depletion potential (ODP) and photochemical oxidation potential (POFP). An energy analysis related to the cumulative non-renewable fossil and nuclear energy demand (CED) was also performed, considering this indicator as an additional impact category. According to the results, the biomass production subsystem was identified as the main environmental key issue in terms of ADP, AP, EP, ODP and CED, with contributions ranging from 26% to 61% of the total impact. Regarding ADP, ODP and CED, these results are mainly related with diesel requirements in agricultural machinery, derived combustion emissions and mineral fertilizers production. Concerning AP and EP the production field emissions derived from fertilizers application was observed as the main contributor. Concerning GWP, this step presents an environmental credit due to the uptake of CO2 during crop growth, which contributes to offset the GHG emissions. The bioenergy production plant significantly contributes to the environmental impact in categories such as GWP (43%) and POFP (59%), mostly related with emissions produced in the gas engine and biogas losses. Emissions derived from digestate storage contribute to AP (52%) and EP (41%). The use of the digestate as an organic fertilizer has a beneficial role because this action avoids the production and use of mineral fertilizers.A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the influence of variations in important parameters of biogas systems. The environmental profile of the biogas system turned out to be highly dependent on the selection of system boundaries and the allocation method.To sum up, this study aims to assess the environmental performance of a biogas technology available not only in Italy but also in other European countries. The environmental analysis of the process under study highlights the environmental benefits of the co-digestion processes, which not only produces biofuel but also reduces the disposal of solid wastes and produces digestate, with special value in the fertilization of agricultural soil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Initially hailed as a miracle crop for biofuel production, Jatropha has recently attracted criticism for competing with food production, causing adverse biodiversity impacts, and jeopardizing land access by rural populations in tropical countries. This article analyzes the contested development of Jatropha biofuel sector in Tanzania by anchoring two new concepts of "organizational models" and "institutional arrangements" to the sectoral systems of innovation perspective. The notion of "organizational models" brings into relief the heterogeneity of actors in an innovation system and the ways in which the actors form networks, within and across national borders, to organize innovative activities. The concept of "institutional arrangements" refers to the ensemble of formal and informal institutions assembled during Tanzania's colonial and postcolonial eras, which directly govern innovative activities in specific organizational models. Based on a location-specific and historically grounded institutional analysis within the innovation system framework, implications are drawn for the future development of Tanzania's Jatropha sector including its links with European markets and for the regulation of "next-generation" biofuels. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Deconstruction of polysaccharides into fermentable sugars remains the key challenge in the production of inexpensive lignocellulosic biofuels. Typically, costly enzymatic saccharification of the pretreated biomass is used to depolymerize its cellulosic content into fermentable monomers. In this work, we examined the production of lignocellulosic recovery, a process that does not require the use of enzymes to produce fermentable sugars. In the base case, the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) was $8.05/gal, but with improved performance of the hydrolysis, extraction, and sugar recovery, the MESP can be lowered to $4.00/gal. Additionally, two scenarios involving lignin recovery were considered. Although the results based on current assumptions indicate that this process is expensive compared to more established technologies, improvements in the hydrolysis yield, the sugar extraction efficiency, and the sugar recovery were shown to result in more competitive processes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integration of wastewater treatment with algae cultivation is one of the promising ways to achieve an economically viable and environmentally sustainable algal biofuel production on a commercial scale. This study focused on pilot-scale algal biomass production system development, cultivation process optimization, and integration with swine manure wastewater treatment. The areal algal biomass productivity for the cultivation system that we developed ranged from 8.08 to 14.59 and 19.15-23.19 g/m2×day, based on ash-free dry weight and total suspended solid (TSS), respectively, which were higher than or comparable with those in literature. The harvested algal biomass had lipid content about 1.77-3.55 %, which was relatively low, but could be converted to bio-oil via fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis system developed in our lab. The lipids in the harvested algal biomass had a significantly higher percentage of total unsaturated fatty acids than those grown in lab conditions, which may be attributed to the observed temperature and light fluctuations. The nutrient removal rate was highly correlated to the biomass productivity. The NH 3-N, TN, COD, and PO4-P reduction rates for the north-located photo-bioreactor (PBR-N) in July were 2.65, 3.19, 7.21, and 0.067 g/m2×day, respectively, which were higher than those in other studies. The cultivation system had advantages of high mixotrophic growth rate, low operating cost, as well as reduced land footprint due to the stacked-tray bioreactor design used in the study. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Renewable and carbon neutral, marine algal biomass could be an attractive alternative substrate for the production of biofuel and various biorefinery products. Thus, the feasibility of brown seaweed (Laminaria japonica) hydrolysate as a carbon source was investigated here for l-lactate production. This work reports the homofermentative route for l-lactate production by introducing Streptococcus bovis/equinus l-lactate dehydrogenase in an engineered Escherichia coli strain where synthesis of the competing by-product was blocked. The engineered strain utilized both glucose and mannitol present in the hydrolysate under microaerobic condition and produced 37.7 g/L of high optical purity l-lactate at 80 % of the maximum theoretical value. The result shown in this study implies that algal biomass would be as competitive with lignocellulosic biomass in terms of lactic acid production and that brown seaweed can be used as a feedstock for the industrial production of other chemicals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Ettlia oleoabundance (formerly known as Neochloris oleoabundance) is an attractive candidate for biodiesel production because of its high lipid accumulation, and it's taking the majority of the attention among the strains of Ettlia genus; however, potential of the other genus members is unknown. An indigenous strain from Salda Lake (South West Turkey) identified by 18S rDNA sequencing as Ettlia texensis (GenBank accession no: JQ038221), and its fatty acid and carotenoid compositions under phototrophic and mixotrophic conditions was investigated to evaluate the potential of the strain for commercial uses. A threefold increase was observed in total lipid content (total fatty acids; from 13 % to 37 %) in mixotrophic culture respect to the phototrophic growth conditions. The oleic acid (C18:1) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) were the major unsaturated fatty acids accounting for 40 % and 13.2 % of total fatty acids in mixotrophic culture, respectively. Carotenoid analyses of the mixotrophic culture revealed the metabolite canthaxanthin, a commercially valuable carotenoid used mainly for food coloring, was the major constituent among other pigments. The possible use of E. texensis in biotechnological applications is discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - Microalgal biodiesel production has been investigated for decades, yet it is not commercially available. Part of the problem is that the production process is energy and chemical intensive due, in part, to the high portion of microalgal biomass left as residues. This study investigated cradle-to-gate life-cycle environmental impacts from six different scenarios of microalgal biodiesel and its co-products. Ozone depletion, global warming, photochemical smog formation, acidification and eutrophication potentials were assessed using the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI). Monte Carlo Analysis was conducted to investigate the processes with major contribution in each impact category. The market opportunity for each co-product was examined based on supply, demand and prices of the products that could potentially be substituted by the co-products. The results indicated that the scenario with the least life-cycle environmental impacts in all the five impact categories with the highest net energy ratio was the scenario utilizing a multitude of co-products including bioethanol from lipid-extracted microalgae (LEA), biomethane (to produce electricity and heat) from simultaneous saccharification-fermentation (SSF) residues, land-applied material from SSF residue anaerobic digestion (AD) solid digestate, recycling nutrients from SSF residue AD liquid digestate and CO2 recovered from SSF process contributed. Decreasing the energy consumption of the centrifuge in the land-applied material production process and increasing the lipid content of microalgae can reduce environmental footprints of the co-products. The same scenario also had the highest total income indicating their potential as co-products in the market. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Excessive nitrate loads in surface waters are a major cause of hypoxia and eutrophication. In many places, agriculture is the single largest source of nitrogen entering receiving waters. Perennial energy grass crops have the potential to reduce nitrogen loads from agricultural areas, while sequestering carbon and offering new economic opportunities for farmers. This study analyzes farm system-scale cropping and fertilizer application decisions, and resulting nitrate loads, as driven by prices for the bioenergy crop miscanthus, as well as investigates reductions of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen fertilizer use. An economic model of farm-system-scale decisions is coupled to a hydrologic-agronomic model of the physical stream system to obtain nitrate loading and crop yield results for varying combinations of prices and policies for a typical Midwestern agricultural watershed. For the scenarios examined, a large reduction in stream nitrate load depends on a high price for miscanthus relative to competing crops. A price for miscanthus that exceeds 50% of the average of corn and soybean prices, per unit weight, is estimated to lead to nitrate load reductions of 25% or more. Though significant, these reductions are still less than the recommended 45% reduction in stream nitrogen flux entering the Gulf of Mexico needed to mitigate the hypoxia problem in the gulf. Miscanthus prices are unlikely ever to reach such levels. However, nitrate load reductions could still be achieved by implementing a nitrogen fertilizer reduction subsidy alongside a miscanthus market. The results also show that carbon trading is unlikely to result in any significant reduction in nitrate load. The results are useful for improving understanding of the potential of these incentives, individually and concurrently, to reduce pollution from Midwestern crop agriculture. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been targeted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an exemplary bioenergy crop, however it requires a significant amount of water and experiences reduced yields in water-stressed conditions. To avoid competition for prime agricultural areas, lands that receive adequate rainfall but are marginal due to highly variable timing of rain are potentially ideal locations to grow drought-tolerant biofuels. As scientists develop a modified variety of switchgrass that can withstand periods of drought while not substantially affecting overall yield, it is important to identify the potential geographical niche for this xerophytic crop to maximize its environmental and economic sustainability. This project uses a spatial suitability modeling approach that incorporates fuzzy logic and utilizes both physical and economic variables. We assess several fuzzy overlay techniques to identify and synthesize tradeoffs between suitability criteria. Our results highlight the Great Plains region of the United States as a suitable region, and within this area we focus on Kansas for a more detailed analysis to calculate land areas within varying dryness index thresholds. For this we develop a specialized dryness index using high resolution (spatial & temporal) weather and soil data to provide a spatially explicit measure of dry spell severity for switchgrass across a landscape. We estimate that 80% of the suitable land area in Kansas falls within a dryness index equivalent to about four 22-day long dry stretches, or one 45-day long dry stretch. By identifying the dryness threshold where land area is maximized, the results of this analysis inform the development of drought-tolerant varieties of switchgrass and identify marginal areas where efforts to plant such a species may prosper. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maps of energy demand from buildings in Great Britain have been created at 1 km square resolution. They reveal the spatial variation of demand for heat and electricity, of importance for energy distribution studies and particularly for bioenergy research given the significant distance-based restrictions on the viability of bioenergy crops. Maps representing the spatial variation of energy demand for the year 2009 were created using publicly available sub-national gas and electricity consumption data. A new statistical model based on census data was used to increase the spatial resolution. The energy demand was split into thermal energy (the heat energy required for space heating and hot water) and electricity used for purposes other than heating (nonheating electricity or NHE) and was determined separately for the domestic and nondomestic sectors. 'Scenario factors,' representing the fractional change at national level in the demand for heat and NHE, were derived from scenarios constructed by UKERC. These scenarios represent a range of pathways from the present day to 2050. The present work focused on the two cases of greatest relevance, the 'low carbon' and 'additional policies' scenarios, and factors for both were derived, for the demand types described, for every 5 years between 2000 and 2050. Approximately, future spatial energy demands can be obtained by applying the scenario factors to the base mapping data for 2009. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper evaluates the optimal composition of annual and perennial biomass feedstocks for a biorefinery. A generic optimization model is built to minimize costs-harvest, transport, storage, seasonal, and environmental costs-subject to various constraints on land availability, feedstock availability, processing capacity, contract terms, and storage losses. The model results are demonstrated through a case study for a midwestern U.S. location, focusing on bioethanol as the likely product. The results suggest that high-yielding energy crops feature prominently (70 to 80%) in the feedstock mix in spite of the higher establishment costs. The cost of biomass ranges from 0.16 to 0.20 $ l-1 (US$ 0.60 to $0.75 per gallon) of biofuel. The harvest shed shows that high-yielding energy crops are preferably grown in fields closer to the biorefinery. Low-yielding agricultural residues primarily serve as a buffer crop to meet the shortfall in biomass requirement. For the case study parameters, the model results estimated a price premium for energy crops (2 to 4 $ t-1 within a 16 km (10-mile) radius) and agricultural residues (5 to 17 $ t-1 in a 16 to 20 km (10 to 20 mile) radius.

AB  - 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) is considered to be an attractive biomass based platform chemical with high potential as a biofuel compound and as a green solvent. 2-MTHF can be synthesised from bio-based levulinic acid (LA) and γ-valerolactone (GVL). Herein the optimum reaction conditions for the hydrogenation of GVL over Ru/C have been studied. A full conversion of GVL has been obtained under solvent free conditions with a maximum yield of 2-MTHF of 43%. The optimized conditions have been employed in a mechanistic study of the synthesis of 2-MTHF. Several side reactions have been investigated to explore the full reaction network of this heterogeneously catalysed system and to elucidate the factors influencing product selectivity. Additionally an efficient solvent-free hydrogenation reaction of LA into 2-MTHF could be achieved delivering 90% conversion of LA with a yield of 2-MTHF of 61% by removing water from the system in a two-step approach. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - After three years' monitoring of the concentration of Al, Fe, Zn, Ni, Pb, As, Cd, Cr and Se in soil, Fe, Pb and As in Pittsburgh's vacant lots were found sometimes to exceed the residential maximum soil contaminant concentrations set by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Heavy metal uptake by sunflowers was insignificant at the soil metal concentrations observed in Pittsburgh, indicating that sunflowers produced on marginal urban land could be a safe biofuel feedstock. However, there was a risk that sunflowers grown on more contaminated spoils could be unsafe. Calculations of the energy balance of the total biofuel production system suggested that lots in Pittsburgh of over 0.2. ha would be able to produce an energy gain, particularly if community volunteers were involved in the process. Using marginal urban land for biofuel production can be a worthwhile strategy to replace costly traditional vacant lot management methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use change is a complex response to changing environmental and socioeconomic systems. Historical drivers of land use change include changes in the natural resource availability of a region, changes in economic conditions for production of certain products and changing policies. Most recently, introduction of policy incentives for biofuel production have influenced land use change in the US Midwest, leading to concerns that bioenergy production systems may compete with food production and land conservation. Here we explore how land use may be impacted by future climate mitigation measures by nesting a high resolution agricultural model (EPIC - Environmental Policy Indicator Climate) for the US Midwest within a global integrated assessment model (GCAM - Global Change Assessment Model). This approach is designed to provide greater spatial resolution and detailed agricultural practice information by focusing on the climate mitigation potential of agriculture and land use in a specific region, while retaining the global economic context necessary to understand the far ranging effects of climate mitigation targets. We find that until the simulated carbon prices are very high, the US Midwest has a comparative advantage in producing traditional food and feed crops over bioenergy crops. Overall, the model responds to multiple pressures by adopting a mix of future responses. We also find that the GCAM model is capable of simulations at multiple spatial scales and agricultural technology resolution, which provides the capability to examine regional response to global policy and economic conditions in the context of climate mitigation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is generally described as a tool for environmental decision making. Results from attributional LCA (ALCA), the most commonly used LCA method, often are presented in a way that suggests that policy decisions based on these results will yield the quantitative benefits estimated by ALCA. For example, ALCAs of biofuels are routinely used to suggest that the implementation of one alternative (say, a biofuel) will cause an X% change in greenhouse gas emissions, compared with a baseline (typically gasoline). However, because of several simplifications inherent in ALCA, the method, in fact, is not predictive of real-world impacts on climate change, and hence the usual quantitative interpretation of ALCA results is not valid. A conceptually superior approach, consequential LCA (CLCA), avoids many of the limitations of ALCA, but because it is meant to model actual changes in the real world, CLCA results are scenario dependent and uncertain. These limitations mean that even the best practical CLCAs cannot produce definitive quantitative estimates of actual environmental outcomes. Both forms of LCA, however, can yield valuable insights about potential environmental effects, and CLCA can support robust decision making. By openly recognizing the limitations and understanding the appropriate uses of LCA as discussed here, practitioners and researchers can help policy makers implement policies that are less likely to have perverse effects and more likely to lead to effective environmental policies, including climate mitigation strategies. © 2013 by Yale University.

AB  - One of the most important concerns facing Taiwan is lack of energy security. The study examines to what extent the Taiwan energy security can be enhanced through bioenergy production and how bioenergy affects net greenhouse gases emissions. Ethanol, conventional bioelectricity and pyrolysis based electricity are analyzed and emissions from fertilizer use and land use change are also incorporated. The study employs the Modified Taiwan Agricultural Sector Model (MTASM) for economic and environmental analysis. The results indicate that Taiwan indeed increases its energy security from bioenergy production but net greenhouse gases emissions are also increased. Emissions from fertilizer use and land use change have significant impacts on emissions reduction and pyrolysis does not always provide net greenhouse emissions offset. Some policy implications including goal determination, land availability and emissions trading systems are also provided for potential policy decision making. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Agriculture is under pressure to produce greater quantities of food, feed and biofuel on limited land resources. Current over-reliance on a handful of major staple crops has inherent agronomic, ecological, nutritional and economic risks and is probably unsustainable in the long run. Wider use of today's underutilized minor crops provides more options to build temporal and spatial heterogeneity into uniform cropping systems and will enhance resilience to both biotic and abiotic stress. Many traditional vegetables and underutilized legume crops are an essential source of vitamins, micronutrients and protein and, thus, a valuable component to attain nutritional security. Vegetables in general are of considerable commercial value and therefore an important source of household income. Significant research, breeding and development efforts are needed for a range of promising crops to convert existing local landraces into competitive varieties with wide adaptation and promising commercial potential. Access to genetic diversity of these selected crops is a pre-condition for success. Three underutilized minor crops-amaranth, drumstick tree, and mungbean-are highlighted and briefly described. All three crops are well-represented in AVRDC's genebank with substantial inter- and intra-specific genetic diversity, and already have demonstrated their potential for wider adoption and commercial exploitation. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The present study deals with a major summertime dust storm event that occurred over the Arabian Desert, Saudi Arabia (SA), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and spread to Pakistan, the Arabian Sea, and Western India (in particular over Alibaug and Pune), using multi-satellite- and ground-based measurements. Analysis of the aerosol parameters retrieved over Alibaug and Pune from the ground-based MICROTOPS-II Sunphotometer, seven Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET) stations, including Pune, and satellite (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument ((OMI-Aura)) measurements shows significant changes on dusty days as compared with non-dusty days prior to and after the dust storm event. A large increase in aerosol optical depths (AODs) and decrease in Angstrom exponent (AE, α440-870 nm), showing the presence of a larger fraction of coarser particles comparable to those of other intense dust outbreak episodes worldwide, have been found at all these sites during the dust storm event. Higher observed AODs are considered to be the combined effect of desert dust and burning biomass/biofuel-induced aerosols. AERONET-retrieved mean aerosol volume size distributions (AVSDs) on non-dusty and dusty days are bimodal in nature at the stations of Pune, Kanpur, Jaipur, Karachi, and Lahore, while at the stations of KAUST_Campus (SA) and Mezaira (UAE), AVSDs are monomodal. This indicates that at the first five stations, the aerosol system is a complex mixture of fine- and coarse-mode aerosols with coarse mode exerting a strong influence on the system. Dust-induced turbid conditions triggered significant extinction of 30-40%, in shortwave (SW) global solar irradiance, resulting in an increase of 57% and 74% in aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) at Alibaug and Pune, respectively, causing perturbation in the radiation budget. The space-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO)-retrieved aerosol vertical profiles reveal the presence of polluted dust (a mixture of fine- and coarse-mode aerosols), corroborating well with the aerosol behaviour captured by the MICROTOPS/AERONET measurements and MODIS retrievals over the study areas. The Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (BSC-DREAM8b) predictions are also found to be consistent with satellite retrievals, implying the ability of the model to monitor dust transport over the study region. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.

AB  - The Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE) in Papua, Indonesia, is a state-led mega-project to transform local agriculture through large-scale corporate investment in food crops and biofuels for foreign markets. The project has led to extensive land dispossession, accompanied by devastating social and ecological impacts. This contribution analyzes how discourse regarding food and energy crises has been employed to release land from customary tenure to a coalition of state, corporate and local elite actors. The interests of these actors have converged on the state-led mega-project to transform local agriculture through large-scale corporate investment in food crops and biofuels in the name of national food security. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Recent rapid changes in global scale drivers of desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) have two important consequences for drylands. First, changes in these drivers, for example in food and energy prices, make improving interventions in drylands more urgent because of their potential impacts. Second, these changes introduce new knowledge gaps regarding both the potential impacts on social-ecological dryland systems and the design of options to take advantage of opportunities. This paper identifies the most salient research needs in DLDD in drylands brought on by global drivers. The question was addressed through an iterative stakeholder consultative forum. First, relevant global scale drivers were identified through a literature review and preliminary consultation. Next, stakeholders and experts were further consulted to identify research priorities given rise to by these drivers. Identified research priorities were as follows: (i) assessing impacts of rising prices on DLDD in mixed market and subsistence production contexts; (ii) assessing options and limits of agricultural modernisation on fragile lands; (iii) developing methods for assessing land-use trade-offs and mapping productive lands; (iv) modelling and participatory methods for monitoring and evaluating soil carbon sequestration; (v) developing policy frameworks to regulate impacts of investment on the environment and local livelihoods; (vi) participatory modelling for regional and local adaptation planning; and (vii) valuation of non-market land degradation outcomes including biodiversity loss. Concluding, we call for a forward-looking interdisciplinary drylands research agenda with an increased emphasis on governance to address these priorities. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Bio-based products are often considered sustainable due to their renewable nature. However, the environmental performance of products needs to be assessed considering a life cycle perspective to get a complete picture of potential benefits and trade-offs. We present a life cycle assessment of the global commodity ethanol, produced from different feedstock and geographical origin. The aim is to understand the main drivers for environmental impacts in the production of bio-based ethanol as well as its relative performance compared to a fossil-based alternative. Methods: Ethanol production is assessed from cradle to gate; furthermore, end-of-life emissions are also included in order to allow a full comparison of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assuming degradation of ethanol once emitted to air from household and personal care products. The functional unit is 1 kg ethanol, produced from maize grain in USA, maize stover in USA, sugarcane in North-East of Brazil and Centre-South of Brazil, and sugar beet and wheat in France. As a reference, ethanol produced from fossil ethylene in Western Europe is used. Six impact categories from the ReCiPe assessment method are considered, along with seven novel impact categories on biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). Results and discussion: GHG emissions per kilogram bio-based ethanol range from 0.7 to 1.5 kg CO 2 eq per kg ethanol and from 1.3 to 2 kg per kg if emissions at end-of-life are included. Fossil-based ethanol involves GHG emissions of 1.3 kg CO 2 eq per kg from cradle-to-gate and 3.7 kg CO 2 eq per kg if end-of-life is included. Maize stover in USA and sugar beet in France have the lowest impact from a GHG perspective, although when other impact categories are considered trade-offs are encountered. BES impact indicators show a clear preference for fossil-based ethanol. The sensitivity analyses showed how certain methodological choices (allocation rules, land use change accounting, land use biomes), as well as some scenario choices (sugarcane harvest method, maize drying) affect the environmental performance of bio-based ethanol. Also, the uncertainty assessment showed that results for the bio-based alternatives often overlap, making it difficult to tell whether they are significantly different. Conclusions: Bio-based ethanol appears as a preferable option from a GHG perspective, but when other impacts are considered, especially those related to land use, fossil-based ethanol is preferable. A key methodological aspect that remains to be harmonised is the quantification of land use change, which has an outstanding influence in the results, especially on GHG emissions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The paper presents a model system, which consists of a partial equilibrium model and process-based terrestrial biogeochemistry models, to determine the optimal distributions of both Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and short rotation coppice willow (SRC) (Salix. viminalis L. x S. viminalis var Joruun) in Great Britain (GB), as well as their potential contribution to meet heat and electricity demand in GB. Results show that the potential contribution of Miscanthus and SRC to heat and electricity demand is significant. Without considering farm-scale economic constraints, Miscanthus and SRC could generate, in an economically competitive way compared with other energy generation costs, 224 800 GWh yr-1 heat and 112 500 GWh yr-1 electricity, with 8 Mha of available land under Miscanthus and SRC, accounting for 66% of total heat demand and 62% of total electricity demand respectively. Given the pattern of heat and electricity demand, and the relative yields of Miscanthus and SRC in different parts of GB, Miscanthus is mainly favoured in the Midlands and areas in the South of GB, whereas SRC is favoured in Scotland, the Midlands and areas in the South of GB. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Land area planted to row crops has expanded globally with increased demand for food and biofuels. Agricultural expansion in the Dakota Prairie Pothole Region (DPPR), USA affects a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, including grasslands and wetlands that provide critical wildlife habitat and other ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to quantify recent changes in rural land cover/land use, analyze trends, and interpret results in relation to climate, agronomic practice, and ethanol production. The primary data sources were 1980-2012 statewide cropland data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the USDA Cropland Data Layer, produced annually for the DPPR from 2006 through 2012. Area planted to corn or soybean row crops increased, and small grain (e.g., wheat, barley) area decreased significantly over the analysis period. Corn and soybean expanded by 27 % in the DPPR between 2010 and 2012 alone, an areal increase (+15,400 km2) larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut. This expansion displaced primarily small grains and grassland (e.g., pastures, haylands, remnant prairies). Grassland regularly exchanged land with corn and soybean, small grains, and wetlands and water. Corn and soybean had high inter-annual self-replacement values (68-80 %), and continuous corn/soy row cropping was the second most common combination over a three-year period, ranking after continuous grassland. Small grain self-replacement values were only 22-35 %, indicating frequent relocation in the landscape. Temporary gains in wetland and grassland area were attributed to unusually wet climatic conditions and late snowfalls that prevented crop planting. Nearly all of the region's ethanol refineries were located where corn and soybean crops constituted 50 % or more of the land area. Quantification of grassland losses in the U.S. Northern Plains requires evaluation of all land uses that interact with grasslands, and a longer term perspective that incorporates grassland as part of a normal land-use rotation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Rapeseed pellet - crushed seed residue from oil extraction is a by-product of fatty acid methyl esters production process. As other types of biomass, it can either be burned directly in furnaces or processed to increase its energetic value. Biomass is renewable, abundant and has domestic usage; the sources of biomass can help the world reduce its dependence on petroleum products, fossil coal and natural gas. Energetically effective utilization of rapeseed pellet could substantially improve the economic balance of an individual household in which biodiesel for fulfilling the producer's own energetic demand is obtained. In this article, the experimental results of combusting rapeseed pellet in a calorimeter, combustion in a boiler heater and the analysis of the emissions level of different pollutants in exhaust fumes during different stages of biomass boiler operation are presented. It has been proved that the pellet, a by-product of biodiesel production, is not only a valuable substitute of animal fodder, but also an excellent renewable and environmentally friendly energy source, viable for use in household tap water heating installations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Algae offer many advantages as biofuel sources including: high growth rates, high lipid content, the ability to grow on non-agricultural land, and the genetic versatility to improve strains rapidly and produce co-products. Research is ongoing to make algae biofuels a more financially attractive energy option; however, it is becoming evident that the economic viability of algae-based fuels may hinge upon high-value co-products. This work evaluated the feasibility of using a co-product, algae extract, as a nutrient source in cell culture media. Results: Algae extract prepared from autolysed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was found to contain 3.0% protein, 9.2% total carbohydrate, and 3.9% free α-amino acid which is similar to the nutrient content of commercially available yeast extract. The effects of algae extract on the growth andmetabolism of laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested by substituting algae extract for yeast extract in LB and YPAD growth media recipes. Complex laboratory media supplemented with algae extract instead of yeast extract showed markedly improved effects on the growth andmetabolismof common laboratorymicroorganisms in all cases except ethanol production rates in yeast. Conclusions: This study showed that algae extract derived fromC. reinhardtii is similar, if not superior, to commercially available yeast extract in nutrient content and effects on the growth and metabolism of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Bacto™yeast extract is valued at USD $0.15-0.35 per gram, if algae extract was sold at similar prices, it would serve as a high-value co-product in algae-based fuel processes. © 2014 Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.

AB  - The performance of a 118-kW tractor fuelled by pure biodiesel was monitored during a long-term field experiment with approximately 800 h of engine function. The objective was to demonstrate that B100, a pure biodiesel fuel, is a viable alternative to traditional diesel oil in terms of long-term mechanical reliability. A bench test on the new engine, performed by attaching a test stand to the power take-off of the tractor, showed an expected reduction in power (-9%) and torque (-7%) and an increase in specific consumption (+13%) when biodiesel was used as a complete substitute to diesel oil. Furthermore, with the same setup, the exhaust gas had a Bosch smoke index equal to 50% of the value for the same engine fuelled with diesel oil. After these initial tests, the tractor was set up for normal field operations, in which both the engine curves and lubricant quality were periodically monitored. These surveys indicated no significant reduction in engine performance; however, the lubricant was consequently diluted and contaminated by biodiesel, which caused the lubricant properties to considerably worsen. However, on the basis of the chemical-physical analysis, reducing the oil change interval from 200 h (manufacturer's indications for the engine when operating with diesel oil) to 100 h would compensate for this progressive quality decline. At the end of the trials, the engine was disassembled to check the condition of its components; wear and lacquer-like coating phenomena were observed, and their levels were acceptable. The obtained results demonstrated that B100 can effectively substitute for diesel oil in a standard compression-ignition engine: the power change is not perceptible during normal operation of a tractor, and no particular problem will arise in the engine during its life if the lubricant is changed every 100 h. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - This paper investigated a novel hydrothermal liquefaction process of Chlorella pyrenoidosa catalyzed by Ce/HZSM-5. The chemical groups and components of the residues of C. pyrenoidosa were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer. The crystal structure and micro surface topography of C. pyrenoidosa before and after catalytic liquefaction were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The experimental results showed that the catalytic cracking effects of Ce/HZSM-5 were superior to that of HZSM-5 as a liquefaction catalyst of C. pyrenoidosa. Compared with HZSM-5, Ce/HZSM-5 has a significantly enhanced Lewis acid active center, smaller particle size, larger specific surface, and highly dispersed Ce4O7 with trivalent and tetravalent cerium in the zeolite skeleton channel that accelerate the catalytic liquefaction of C. pyrenoidosa. The rare earth modified zeolite Ce/HZSM-5 exhibits good potential and a beneficial nature for the preparation of bio-oil from microalgae with high efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, we evaluate and compare results from three integrated assessment models (GCAM, IMAGE, and ReMIND/MAgPIE) regarding the drivers and impacts of bioenergy production on the global land system. The considered model frameworks employ linked energy, economy, climate and land use modules. By the help of these linkages the direct competition of bioenergy with other energy technology options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, based on economic costs and GHG emissions from bioenergy production, has been taken into account. Our results indicate that dedicated bioenergy crops and biomass residues form a potentially important and cost-effective input into the energy system. At the same time, however, the results differ strongly in terms of deployment rates, feedstock composition and land-use and greenhouse gas implications. The current paper adds to earlier work by specific looking into model differences with respect to the land-use component that could contribute to the noted differences in results, including land cover allocation, land use constraints, energy crop yields, and non-bioenergy land mitigation options modeled. In scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10-18 % of total cropland by 2100 across the different models, and boosts cropland expansion at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Therefore, associated emissions from land-use change and agricultural intensification as a result of bio-energy use range from 14 and 113 Gt CO2-eq cumulatively through 2100. Under climate policy, bioenergy cropland increases to 24-36 % of total cropland by 2100. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - What role does scientific claims-making play in the worldwide promotion of biofuels for transport, which continues despite serious concerns about its potentially adverse social and environmental effects? And how do actors with very different and conflicting viewpoints on the benefits and drawbacks of biofuels enrol scientific authority to support their positions? The sociological theory of functional differentiation combined with the concept of advocacy coalition can help in exploring this relationship between scientific claims-making and the policy stance of different actors in public debates about biofuels. In Denmark two distinct scientific perspectives about biofuels map onto the policy debates through articulation by two competing advocacy coalitions. One is a reductionist biorefinery perspective originating in biochemistry and neighbouring disciplines. This perspective works upwards from the molecular level and envisions positive synergies in the use of biomass. The other is a holistic bioscarcity perspective originating in life-cycle analysis and ecology. This perspective works downwards from global resource scope conditions, and envisions negative consequences from an increased reliance on biomass. Understanding how these scientific perspectives and policy stances are coupled sheds light on three contentious policy questions: how Denmark should include biomass in its energy provision, what role Denmark might play in the global development of biofuels and what kind of subsidy schemes should be implemented. © 2013 © 2013 Process Press.

AB  - Estimates on impacts of biofuel production often use models with limited ability to incorporate changes in land use, notably cropping intensity. This review studies biofuel expansion between 2000 and 2010 in Brazil, the USA, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Mozambique, South Africa plus 27 EU member states. In 2010, these countries produced 86 billion litres of ethanol and 15 billion litres of biodiesel. Land use increased by 25 Mha, of which 11 Mha is associated with co-products, i.e. by-products of biofuel production processes used as animal feed. In the decade up to 2010, agricultural land decreased by 9 Mha overall. It expanded by 22 Mha in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mozambique, some 31 Mha was lost in the USA, the EU, and South Africa due to urbanization, expansion of infrastructure, conversion into nature, and land abandonment. Increases in cropping intensity accounted for 42 Mha of additional harvested area. Together with increased co-product availability for animal feed, this was sufficient to increase the net harvested area (NHA, crop area harvested for food, feed, and fiber markets) in the study countries by 19 Mha. Thus, despite substantial expansion of biofuel production, more land has become available for non-fuel applications. Biofuel crop areas and NHA increased in most countries including the USA and Brazil. It is concluded that biofuel expansion in 2000-2010 is not associated with a decline in the NHA available for food crop production. The increases in multiple cropping have often been overlooked and should be considered more fully in calculations of (indirect) land-use change (iLUC). © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transition to a bio-based economy will create new demand for biomass, e.g. the increasing use of bioenergy, but the impacts on existing markets are unclear. Furthermore, there is a growing public concern on the sustainability of biomass. This study proposes a methodological framework for mapping national biomass flows based on domestic production-consumption and cross-border trade, and respective share of sustainably-certified biomass. A case study was performed on the Netherlands for 2010-2011, focusing on three categories: (i) woody biomass, (ii) oils and fats, and (iii) carbohydrates. Between 2010-2011 few major shifts were found, besides the increasing biofuel production. The share of sustainably-certified feedstock is growing in many categories. Woody biomass used for energy amounted to 3.45 MT, including 1.3 MT imported wood pellets (>85% certified). About 0.6 MT of oils and fats and 1.2 MT (estimation) of carbohydrates were used for biofuel production. It is assumed that only certified materials were used for biofuel production. For non-energy purpose, more than 50% of woody biomass used was either certified or derived from recycled streams. Certified oils has entered the Dutch food sector since 2011, accounted for 7% of total vegetable oils consumption. It is expected that carbohydrates will also be certified in the near future. Methodological challenges encountered are: inconsistency in data definitions, lack of coherent cross-sectorial reporting systems, low reliability of bilateral trade statistics, lack of transparency in biomass supply chains, and disparity in sustainability requirements. The methodology may be expanded for future projection in different scenarios. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The fermentation of lignocellulose-derived sugars, particularly xylose, into ethanol by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to be inhibited by compounds produced during feedstock pretreatment. We devised a strategy that combined chemical profiling of pretreated feedstocks, high-throughput phenotyping of genetically diverse S. cerevisiae strains isolated from a range of ecological niches, and directed engineering and evolution against identified inhibitors to produce strains with improved fermentation properties. We identified and quantified for the first time the major inhibitory compounds in alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP)-pretreated lignocellulosic hydrolysates, including Na+, acetate, and p-coumaric (pCA) and ferulic (FA) acids. By phenotyping these yeast strains for their abilities to grow in the presence of these AHP inhibitors, one heterozygous diploid strain tolerant to all four inhibitors was selected, engineered for xylose metabolism, and then allowed to evolve on xylose with increasing amounts of pCA and FA. After only 149 generations, one evolved isolate, GLBRCY87, exhibited faster xylose uptake rates in both laboratory media and AHP switchgrass hydrolysate than its ancestral GLBRCY73 strain and completely converted 115 g/liter of total sugars in undetoxified AHP hydrolysate into more than 40 g/liter ethanol. Strikingly, genome sequencing revealed that during the evolution from GLBRCY73, the GLBRCY87 strain acquired the conversion of heterozygous to homozygous alleles in chromosome VII and amplification of chromosome XIV. Our approach highlights that simultaneous selection on xylose and pCA or FA with a wild S. cerevisiae strain containing inherent tolerance to AHP pretreatment inhibitors has potential for rapid evolution of robust properties in lignocellulosic biofuel production. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Between 2004 and 2007, NGOs, community based organisations and private investors promoted jatropha in Kenya with the aim of generating additional income and producing biofuel for rural development. By 2008 it became gradually evident that jatropha plantations (both mono- and intercropping) are uneconomical and risky due to competition for land and labour with food crops. Cultivation of jatropha hedges was found to have better chances of economic success and to present only little risks for the adopting farmers. Still, after 2008 a number of farmers went on adopting jatropha in plots rather than as hedges. It is hypothesised that lack of awareness about the low economic prospects of jatropha plantations was the main reason for continued adoption, and that smallholder farmers with higher resource endowments mainly ventured into its cultivation.In this study we provide an empirical basis for understanding the role of households' capital assets in taking up new livelihood strategies by smallholder farmers in three rural districts in Kenya. For that purpose, we assess the motivation and enabling factors that led to the adoption of jatropha as a new livelihood strategy, as well as the context in which promotion and adoption took place. A household survey was conducted in 2010, using a structured questionnaire, to collect information on household characteristics and capital asset endowment. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests.We established that access to additional income and own energy supply were the main motivation for adoption of jatropha, and that financial capital assets do not necessarily have a positive influence on adoption as hypothesised. Further, we found that the main challenges that adopting farmers faced were lack of access to information on good management practices and lack of a reliable market. We conclude that continued adoption of on-farm jatropha after 2008 is a result of lacking awareness about the low economic value of this production type. We recommend abandoning on-farm production of jatropha until improved seed material and locally adapted agronomic knowledge about jatropha cultivation becomes available and its production becomes economically competitive. © 2013 .

AB  - The increasing demands placed on natural resources for fuel and food production require that we explore the use of efficient, sustainable feedstocks such as brown macroalgae. The full potential of brown macroalgae as feedstocks for commercial-scale fuel ethanol production, however, requires extensive re-engineering of the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways in the standard industrial microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the discovery of an alginate monomer (4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate, or DEHU) transporter from the alginolytic eukaryote Asteromyces cruciatus. The genomic integration and overexpression of the gene encoding this transporter, together with the necessary bacterial alginate and deregulated native mannitol catabolism genes, conferred the ability of an S. cerevisiae strain to efficiently metabolize DEHU and mannitol. When this platform was further adapted to grow on mannitol and DEHU under anaerobic conditions, it was capable of ethanol fermentation from mannitol and DEHU, achieving titres of 4.6% (v/v) (36.2 g l-1) and yields up to 83% of the maximum theoretical yield from consumed sugars. These results show that all major sugars in brown macroalgae can be used as feedstocks for biofuels and value-added renewable chemicals in a manner that is comparable to traditional arable-land-based feedstocks. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Driven by the growing numbers of intensified pig farms around cities in China, there are problems of nutrient surplus and shortage of arable land for utilising the manure. Hence, sustainable livestock systems with effective manure management are needed. The objective of this study is to compare the existing manure treatment of a typical pig farm in Beijing area (separate collection of faeces; 'Gan qing fen' system) with an alternative system and to identify the nutrients flow of the whole farm in order to quantify environmental burdens and to estimate the arable land required for sustainable nutrients recycling. Life cycle assessment is used for this purpose. Acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) are analysed in detail; the functional unit is the annual production of the pig farm. The results show that the cropland area demand for sustainable land application of the effluent can be reduced from 238 to 139 ha with the alternative system. It is possible to transfer 29% of total nitrogen, 87% of phosphorus, 34% of potassium and 75% of magnesium to the compost, and to reduce the total AP, EP and GWP of manure management on the farm by 64.1%, 96.7% and 22%, respectively, compared with the current system. Besides an effective manure management system, a full inventory of the regional nutrients flow is needed for sustainable development of livestock systems around big cities in China. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Twelve European habitat types were investigated to determine the influence of the IFBB technique (integrated generation of biogas and solid fuel from biomass) on the fate of organic compounds and energy yields of semi-natural grassland biomass. Concentration of organic compounds in silage and IFBB press cake (PC), mass flows within that system and methane yields of IFBB press fluids (PF) were determined. The gross energy yield of the IFBB technique was calculated in comparison to hay combustion (HC) and whole crop digestion (WCD). The IFBB treatment increased fibre and organic matter (OM) concentrations and lowered non-fibre carbohydrates and crude protein concentrations. The PF was highly digestible irrespective of habitat types, showing mean methane yields between 312.1 and 405.0 LN CH4 kg-1 VS. Gross energy yields for the IFBB system (9.75-30.19MWhha-1) were in the range of HC, outperformed WCD and were influenced by the habitat type. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With the objective to offer contributions to resolve ecological, social and economic problems in Amazonia, Brazil's sustainable production of palm oil legislation has the specific goal of mobilising public administrations, private business, social aid agencies and family farmers with the following overall objectives: create employment and increase income by means of palm cultivation; reforest degraded lands in the Amazon (Margulis, 2004); contribute to carbon storage with the goal of reducing greenhouse gases; and induce family farmers to participate in the programme and thus favour their social inclusion. The study is based on information from documentary research undertaken to identify and a series of regionally-based interviews. Our research reveals that the national programme has mobilised a range of stakeholders (governments, firms, universities and NGOs) and small farmers' associations.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the physical and ecological limits of biofuels (in particular, ethanol). To this end, three aspects are discussed. First of all, the territorial element, i.e., the real productivity of energy crops (in particular, ethanol), to show that, in general, the productivity is much lower than most of the literature on the subject suggests. Similarly, we then stress the high total territorial impact (the Ecological Footprint) associated with this kind of energy production. Thirdly, we offer data concerning the very modest nature of the energy balance of biofuels (EROEI) and their real power density, considering the productivity of the crops grown for biofuel. As a comparison, these three aspects are estimated for other forms of energy, in particular, photovoltaic energy. We conclude that when the set of estimated parameters has been analysed, there exist reasonable doubts concerning the use of biofuels on a regional and global scale, so they should not, in principle, be promoted as a renewable energy source, nor is it desirable on such a scale. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study integrates material based Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) with welfare economic Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) to evaluate resource and environmental consequences as well as welfare consequences for society of introducing biofuels in the Danish road transport sector. The integrated method focus on fossil energy consumption, CO2 emissions and total welfare economic changes within the whole LCA flow chain comprising both production of biomass and subsequent conversion into biofuel and combustion in vehicles. With regard to consequences for fossil energy consumption a global delimitation is used whereas only CO2 emissions and welfare economic consequences within Danish borders are included in the analysis. Consequently, calculated emission and welfare economic consequences can be interpreted as the consequences for Denmark of producing and using biofuels from biomass grown on Danish farm land. The method is applied with regard to production of rape diesel (rape methyl ester, RME), 1st generation ethanol from wheat and 2nd generation ethanol based on straw. Advantages and disadvantages of the LCA based material flow approach and the welfare economic based CBA approach are discussed. The influence of uncertainties on the results is evaluated illustrating the importance of paying attention to assumptions with regard to substitution of other products and resources and with regard to their relative prices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel crops are an accepted alternative to fossil fuels, but little is known about the ecological impact of their production. The aim of this contribution is to study the effect of native ( Salix viminalis and Phalaris arundinacea) and introduced ( Helianthus tuberosus, Reynoutria sachalinensis and Silphium perfoliatum) biofuel crop plantations on the soil biota in comparison with cultural meadow vegetation used as control. The study was performed as part of a split plot field experiment of the Crop Research Institute in the city of Chomutov (Czech Republic). The composition of the soil meso- and macrofauna community, composition of the cultivable fraction of the soil fungal community, cellulose decomposition (using litter bags), microbial biomass, basal soil respiration and PLFA composition (incl. F/. B ratio) were studied in each site. The C:N ratio and content of polyphenols differed among plant species, but these results could not be considered significant between introduced and native plant species. Abundance of the soil meso- and macrofauna was higher in field sites planted with S. viminalis and P. arundinacea than those planted with S. perfoliatum, H. tuberosus and R. sachalinensis. RDA and Monte Carlo Permutation Test showed that the composition of the faunal community differed significantly between various native and introduced plants. Significantly different basal soil respiration was found in sites planted with various energy crops; however, this difference was not significant between native and introduced species. Microbial biomass carbon and cellulose decomposition did not exhibit any statistical differences among the biofuel crops. The largest statistically significant difference we found was in the content of actinobacterial and bacterial (bacteria, G+ bacteria and G- bacteria) PLFA in sites overgrown by P. arundinacea compared to introduced as well as native biofuel crops. In conclusion, certain parameters significantly differ between various native and introduced species of biofuel crops; however, the functional importance of these differences requires further research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the carbon chemistry of twenty-six biochars produced from eleven different feedstocks at production temperatures ranging from 350°C to 600°C. Carbon-13 NMR spectra were acquired using both cross-polarisation (CP) and direct polarisation (DP) techniques. Overall, the corresponding CP and DP spectra were similar, although aromaticity was slightly higher and observability much higher when DP was used. The relative size and purity of the aromatic ring structures (i.e. aromatic condensation) were also gauged using the ring current technique. Both aromaticity and aromatic condensation increased with increasing production temperature, regardless of the feedstock source. However, there were clear differences in these two measures for biochars produced at the same temperature but from different feedstocks. Based on a relationship previously established in a long-term incubation study between aromatic condensation and the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar, the MRT of the biochars was estimated to range from &lt;260 years to &gt;1400 years. This study demonstrates how the combination of feedstock composition and production temperature influences the composition of aromatic domains in biochars, which in turn is likely to be related to their recalcitrance and ultimately their carbon sequestration value. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study compares a traditional agricultural approach to minimise N pollution of groundwater (incorporation of crop residues) with applications of small amounts of biodiesel co-product (BCP) to arable soils. Loss of N from soil to the aqueous phase was shown to be greatly reduced in the laboratory, mainly by decreasing concentrations of dissolved nitrate-N. Increases in soil microbial biomass occurred within 4 days of BCP application - indicating rapid adaptation of the soil microbial community. Increases in biomass-N suggest that microbes were partly mechanistic in the immobilisation of N in soil. Straw, meadow-grass and BCP were subsequently incorporated into experimental soil mesocosms of depth equal to plough layer (23 cm), and placed in an exposed netted tunnel to simulate field conditions. Leachate was collected after rainfall between the autumn of 2009 and spring of 2010. Treatment with BCP resulted in less total-N transferred from soil to water over the entire period, with 32.1, 18.9, 13.2 and 4.2 mg N kg-1 soil leached cumulatively from the control, grass, straw and BCP treatments, respectively. More than 99 % of nitrate leaching was prevented using BCP. Accordingly, soils provided with crop residues or BCP showed statistically significant increases in soil N and C compared to the control (no incorporation). Microbial biomass, indicated by soil ATP concentration, was also highest for soils given BCP (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that field-scale incorporation of BCP may be an effective method to reduce nitrogen loss from agricultural soils, prevent nitrate pollution of groundwater and augment the soil microbial biomass. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - A green technology of biodiesel production focuses on the use of enzymes as the catalyst. In enzymatic biodiesel synthesis, suitable solvent system is very essential to reduce the inhibition effects of the solvent to the enzymes. This study produced ethanol-based biodiesel from a low-cost sludge palm oil (SPO) using locally-produced Candida cylindracea lipase from fermentation of palm oil mill effluent (POME) based medium. The optimum levels of ethanol-to-SPO molar ratio and enzyme loading were found to be 4:1 and 10. U/25. g of SPO respectively with 54.4% w/w SPO yield of biodiesel and 21.7% conversion of free fatty acid (FFA) into biodiesel. Addition of tert-butanol at 2:1 tert-butanol-to-SPO molar ratio into the ethanol-solvent system increased the yield of biodiesel to 71.6% w/w SPO and conversion of FFA into biodiesel to 28.8%. The SPO and ethanol have promising potential for the production of renewable biodiesel using enzymatic-catalyzed esterification and transesterification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of the work reported here was to reduce the uncertainty on the greenhouse gas balances of biofuels using agro-ecosystem modeling at a high resolution over the Ile-de-France region in Northern France. The emissions simulated during the feedstock production stage were input to a life-cycle assessment of candidate biofuel pathways: bioethanol from wheat, sugar-beet and miscanthus, and biodiesel from oilseed rape.Compared to the widely-used methodology based on fixed emission factors, ecosystem modeling lead to 55-70% lower estimates for N2O emissions, emphasizing the importance of regional factors. The life-cycle GHG emissions of first-generation biofuels were 50-70% lower than fossil-based equivalents, and 85% lower for cellulosic ethanol. When including indirect land-use change effects, GHG savings became marginal for biodiesel and wheat ethanol, but were positive due to direct effects for cellulosic ethanol. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coarse woody debris is an important biomass pool in forest ecosystems that numerous groups of insects have evolved to take advantage of. These insects are ecologically important and represent useful natural analogs for biomass to biofuel conversion. Using a range of molecular approaches combined with microelectrode measurements of oxygen, we have characterized the gut microbiome and physiology of Odontotaenius disjunctus, a wood-feeding beetle native to the eastern United States. We hypothesized that morphological and physiological differences among gut regions would correspond to distinct microbial populations and activities. In fact, significantly different communities were found in the foregut (FG), midgut (MG)/posterior hindgut (PHG) and anterior hindgut (AHG), with Actinobacteria and Rhizobiales being more abundant toward the FG and PHG. Conversely, fermentative bacteria such as Bacteroidetes and Clostridia were more abundant in the AHG, and also the sole region where methanogenic Archaea were detected. Although each gut region possessed an anaerobic core, micron-scale profiling identified radial gradients in oxygen concentration in all regions. Nitrogen fixation was confirmed by 15 N 2 incorporation, and nitrogenase gene (nifH) expression was greatest in the AHG. Phylogenetic analysis of nifH identified the most abundant transcript as related to Ni-Fe nitrogenase of a Bacteroidetes species, Paludibacter propionicigenes. Overall, we demonstrate not only a compartmentalized microbiome in this beetle digestive tract but also sharp oxygen gradients that may permit aerobic and anaerobic metabolism to occur within the same regions in close proximity. We provide evidence for the microbial fixation of N 2 that is important for this beetle to subsist on woody biomass. © 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Lipids are an increasingly important chemical feedstock for the manufacture of biofuels, bioplastics, care products and as a food source. Developing sustainable sources of lipids, derived from oleaginous microbes, is therefore a key scientific challenge. Methodology: Design of Experiments was used to optimize the lipid production and lipid profile. Results: Here we successfully apply Design of Experiments to optimize the lipid profile in Rhodotorula glutinis to tailor the fatty acid profile. A high culture temperature and high nitrogen ratio yielded a mainly monounsaturated oil, while low temperatures and high glucose loadings gave a more saturated profile. Conclusions: On transesterification, the oil high in monounsaturated esters yielded biodiesel with fuel properties akin to rapeseed methyl ester, whereas the oil high in saturates was found to be suitable as a substitute for palm oil. © 2014 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion figures as a sustainable alternative to avoid discharge of cattle manure in the environment, which results in biogas and biofertilizer. Persistence of potentially pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria during anaerobic digestion of cattle manure was evaluated. Selective cultures were performed for enterobacteria (ENT), non-fermenting Gram-negative rods (NFR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined and a decay of all bacterial groups was observed after 60. days. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were detected both the influent and effluent. GPC, the most prevalent group was highly resistant against penicillin and levofloxacin, whereas resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam and chloramphenicol was frequently observed in the ENT and NFR groups. The data point out the need of discussions to better address management of biodigesters and the implementation of sanitary and microbiological safe treatments of animal manures to avoid consequences to human, animal and environmental health. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seaweed has emerged as an alternative feedstock for the production of a number of renewable fuels. However, the commercialization of seaweed to biofuels requires optimization to improve yields, before scale-up is feasible. The resistance of the algal cell wall to hydrolysis is a limiting factor in fermentation, thus an optimal pretreatment process would enhance the bio-digestibility of the algal biomass, increase accessibility of biomass to hydrolytic enzymes and, ultimately, improve biofuel yields. This study focused on measuring the amount of macromolecules, reducing sugars (RS), total lipids (TL), and total proteins (TP) released from two native seaweed species in Ireland (Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima) in response to a range of chemical, mechanical, and thermal pretreatments. The overall results showed that all pretreatment methods enhanced the release of macromolecules to different extents when compared to untreated controls. Among the set of pretreatments studied, a combination of milling and 4% nitric acid at 130°C for 2 hrs had the greatest effect in releasing RS and TL from both seaweed species. Findings from this study highlight the importance of seaweed pretreatment and its potential use in the optimization of biofuel production. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Nannochloropsis gaditana belongs to Eustigmatophyceae, a class of eukaryotic algae resulting from a secondary endosymbiotic event. Species of this class have been poorly characterized thus far but are now raising increasing interest in the scientific community because of their possible application in biofuel production. Nannochloropsis species have a peculiar photosynthetic apparatus characterized by the presence of only chlorophyll a, with violaxanthin and vaucheriaxanthin esters as the most abundant carotenoids. In this study, the photosynthetic apparatus of this species was analyzed by purifying the thylakoids and isolating the different pigment-binding complexes upon mild solubilization. The results from the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization showed that the photosystem II antenna is loosely bound to the reaction center, whereas the association is stronger in photosystem I, with the antenna-reaction center super-complexes surviving purification. Such a supramolecular organization was found to be conserved in photosystem I from several other photosynthetic eukaryotes, even though these taxa are evolutionarily distant. A hypothesis on the possible selective advantage of different associations of the antenna complexes of photosystems I and II is discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Batch fermentations of waste activated sludge (WAS) at alkaline pH with different inocula were performed. Paper mill anaerobic granular sludge (PAS) and dyeing mill anaerobic sludge (DAS) were used as inocula. At pH 10 the inoculation did not increase the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production compared to the non-inoculated samples fermented in the same conditions, and the maximal VFAs yield of non-inoculated WAS was higher than inoculated WAS. However, at pH 9 the inoculation with PAS increased the sludge hydrolysis and VFAs production was 1.7-fold higher than that in non-inoculated WAS (yield 52.40. mg/g of volatile solid). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that 3 bacterial species, identified as Proteocatella, Tepidibacter, and Clostridium, disappeared when inoculated with PAS at pH 9 or at pH. ≥. 10. The results showed that the inoculation with PAS can be helpful to achieve a relatively high VFAs production from WAS in a moderate alkaline environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increasing cultivation of energy crops for biofuel production has significantly altered the focus of the agricultural sector, but the impact of biofuel production and use is not merely an agricultural one. Even more importantly, it is an issue, which likely promotes inequitable conditions and the social conflict of different (basic) needs. Within this context, the dominant argument criticizes the growing demand for biofuels in the north to compromise food security and sovereignty in the south. In order to address these trade-offs and conflicts, the objective of this paper is the introduction of a conceptual framework of socio-environmental services. By expanding the construct of environmental services to explicitly include the social dimension, it shall accommodate for the fact that the provision of environmental services is often embedded in a complex system of global (economic, ecological as well as social) interdependencies. Recently, the concept of payments for environmental services (PES) has received much attention with respect to its potential contribution to both environmental sustainability and the economic alleviation of poverty. By linking the idea of payments for socio-environmental services (PSES) to the three functions of justice, its beneficial impact may be more fully tapped. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the C4 perennial grasses, Miscanthus × giganteus and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) to be successful for bioenergy production they must maintain high yields over the long term. Previous studies under the less conducive climate for productivity in N.W. Europe found little or no yield decline in M. × giganteus in the long term. This study provides the first analysis of whether yield decline occurs in M. × giganteus under United States. Midwest conditions in side-by-side trials with P. virgatum over 8-10 years at seven locations across Illinois. The effect of stand age was determined by using a linear regression model that included effects of weather. Miscanthus × giganteus produced yields more than twice that of P. virgatum averaging 23.4 ± 1.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1 and 10.0 ± 0.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, averaged over 8-10 years. Relationships of yield with precipitation and growing degree days were established and used to estimate yields corrected for the stochastic effects of weather. Across all locations and in both species, yield initially increased until it reached a maximum during the fifth growing season and then declined to a stable, but lower level in the eighth. This pattern was more pronounced in M. × giganteus. The mean yields observed over this longer term period of 8-10 years were lower than the yields of the first 5 years. However, this decline was proportionately greater in M. × giganteus than in P. virgatum, suggesting a stronger effect of stand age on M. × giganteus. Based on the average yield over the period of this study, meeting the United States Renewable Fuel Standard mandate of 60 billion liters of cellulosic ethanol by 2022, would require 6.8 Mha of M. × giganteus or 15.8 Mha of P. virgatum. These appear manageable numbers for the United States, given the 16.0 Mha in the farmland Conservation Reserve Program in addition to another 13.0 Mha abandoned from agriculture in the last decade. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - The proposed expansion of biofuels production may cause unintended land-use changes and potentially alter ecosystem services. This study evaluated the impact of first-generation (corn) and second-generation (switchgrass and Miscanthus) biofuel crops on production and oviposition site selection by two vector mosquitoes, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus. Larvae of the two species were reared at varying conspecific and heterospecific densities in senescent leaf infusions prepared from one of the three biofuel crops and their survival and development time to adulthood determined. The effects of the three leaf infusions on water chemistry and oviposition site selection by the two mosquito species were also determined. Ae. albopictus females deposited significantly fewer eggs in Miscanthus than in corn infusion while Ae. aegypti females deposited significantly fewer eggs in Miscanthus than in both corn and switchgrass infusion. Survival to adulthood for both mosquito species was significantly lower in corn than in switchgrass and Miscanthus infusions; was consistently lower at high- (0:40 and 20:20) than at low density treatments in both switchgrass and Miscanthus infusions; and significantly lower at high intraspecific density (40:0 and 0: 40) than at high interspecific density (20:20) in Miscanthus infusion. Development time to adulthood was positively related to larval density, but was not influenced by biofuel leaf treatment. Corn infusion had lower pH values and higher salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and temperature values than switchgrass and Miscanthus infusions. These findings demonstrate the potential for biofuel crops to modify the chemistry of aquatic habitats in ways that may influence mosquito production and thereby the risk of exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Biofuel crops may help achieve the goals of energy-efficient renewable ethanol production and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation through carbon (C) storage. The objective of this study was to compare the aboveground biomass yields and soil organic C (SOC) stocks under four crops (no-till corn, switchgrass, indiangrass, and willow) 7 years since establishment at three sites in Ohio to determine if high-yielding biofuel crops are also capable of high levels of C storage. Corn grain had the highest potential ethanol yields, with an average of more than 4100 L ha-1, and ethanol yields increased if both corn grain and stover were converted to biofuel, while willow had the lowest yields. The SOC concentration in soils under biofuels was generally unaffected by crop type; at one site, soil in the top 10 cm under willow contained nearly 13 Mg C ha-1 more SOC (or 29% more) than did soils under switchgrass or corn. Crop type affected SOC content of macroaggregates in the top 10 cm of soil, where macroaggregates in soil under corn had lower C, N and C: N ratios than those under perennial grasses or trees. Overall, the results suggest that no-till corn is capable of high ethanol yields and equivalent SOC stocks to 40 cm depth.

AB  - A global energy crop productivity model that provides geospatially explicit quantitative details on biomass potential and factors affecting sustainability would be useful, but does not exist now. This study describes a modeling platform capable of meeting many challenges associated with global-scale agro-ecosystem modeling. We designed an analytical framework for bioenergy crops consisting of six major components: (i) standardized natural resources datasets, (ii) global field-trial data and crop management practices, (iii) simulation units and management scenarios, (iv) model calibration and validation, (v) high-performance computing (HPC) simulation, and (vi) simulation output processing and analysis. The HPC-Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (HPC-EPIC) model simulated a perennial bioenergy crop, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), estimating feedstock production potentials and effects across the globe. This modeling platform can assess soil C sequestration, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, nonpoint source pollution (e.g., nutrient and pesticide loss), and energy exchange with the atmosphere. It can be expanded to include additional bioenergy crops (e.g., miscanthus, energy cane, and agave) and food crops under different management scenarios. The platform and switchgrass field-trial dataset are available to support global analysis of biomass feedstock production potential and corresponding metrics of sustainability. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Energy production from bioenergy crops may significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through substitution of fossil fuels. Biochar amendment to soil may further decrease the net climate forcing of bioenergy crop production, however, this has not yet been assessed under field conditions. Significant suppression of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions following biochar amendment has been demonstrated in short-term laboratory incubations by a number of authors, yet evidence from long-term field trials has been contradictory. This study investigated whether biochar amendment could suppress soil GHG emissions under field and controlled conditions in a Miscanthus × Giganteus crop and whether suppression would be sustained during the first 2 years following amendment. In the field, biochar amendment suppressed soil CO2 emissions by 33% and annual net soil CO2 equivalent (eq.) emissions (CO2, N2O and methane, CH4) by 37% over 2 years. In the laboratory, under controlled temperature and equalised gravimetric water content, biochar amendment suppressed soil CO2 emissions by 53% and net soil CO2 eq. emissions by 55%. Soil N2O emissions were not significantly suppressed with biochar amendment, although they were generally low. Soil CH4 fluxes were below minimum detectable limits in both experiments. These findings demonstrate that biochar amendment has the potential to suppress net soil CO2 eq. emissions in bioenergy crop systems for up to 2 years after addition, primarily through reduced CO2 emissions. Suppression of soil CO2 emissions may be due to a combined effect of reduced enzymatic activity, the increased carbon-use efficiency from the co-location of soil microbes, soil organic matter and nutrients and the precipitation of CO2 onto the biochar surface. We conclude that hardwood biochar has the potential to improve the GHG balance of bioenergy crops through reductions in net soil CO2 eq. emissions. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study projects future (e.g., 2050 and 2099) grassland productivities in the Greater Platte River Basin (GPRB) using ecosystem performance (EP, a surrogate for measuring ecosystem productivity) models and future climate projections. The EP models developed from a previous study were based on the satellite vegetation index, site geophysical and biophysical features, and weather and climate drivers. The future climate data used in this study were derived from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model 3.0 'SRES A1B' (a 'middle' emissions path). The main objective of this study is to assess the future sustainability of the potential biofuel feedstock areas identified in a previous study. Results show that the potential biofuel feedstock areas (the more mesic eastern part of the GPRB) will remain productive (i.e., aboveground grassland biomass productivity &gt;2750 kg ha-1 year-1) with a slight increasing trend in the future. The spatially averaged EPs for these areas are 3519, 3432, 3557, 3605, 3752, and 3583 kg ha-1 year-1 for current site potential (2000-2008 average), 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2099, respectively. Therefore, the identified potential biofuel feedstock areas will likely continue to be sustainable for future biofuel development. On the other hand, grasslands identified as having no biofuel potential in the drier western part of the GPRB would be expected to stay unproductive in the future (spatially averaged EPs are 1822, 1691, 1896, 2306, 1994, and 2169 kg ha-1 year-1 for site potential, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050, and 2099). These areas should continue to be unsuitable for biofuel feedstock development in the future. These future grassland productivity estimation maps can help land managers to understand and adapt to the expected changes in future EP in the GPRB and to assess the future sustainability and feasibility of potential biofuel feedstock areas. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae can serve as a carbon sink for CO2 sequestration and as a feedstock for liquid biofuel production. Methods for microalgal biomass and biofuel cultivation are progressing, but are still limited in the efficiency of light delivery and gas exchange within cultures. Specifically, current gas exchange methods are very energy intensive since they rely on mixing algal cultures at high flow rates. One method that can improve gas exchange within photobioreactors without excessive mixing is the use of hollow fibre membranes, which enable simultaneous transport of gases deep into the reactor and rapid exchange with the culture media. Here we demonstrate the optimal geometric and operational conditions for CO2 transport to planar cultures of Synechococcus elongatus via hollow fibre membrane arrays. Specifically, we investigated the effects of inter-fibre spacing and active/passive aeration on the growth rate, planar surface density, and total biomass accumulation. We show that spacing in excess of 3 times the fibre diameter lead to significant variations in the uniformity of the surface density and spatially resolved growth rate, whereas spacing of 3 times the fibre diameter supported culture surface densities nearing 90%, which were maintained for 17 days without decreasing. Active aeration with the fibres showed an increase in the specific growth rate and the average surface density with respect to passive aeration by approximately 15% and 35%, respectively, while also eliminating gradients in localized growth rates along the length of the fibres. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Three potential future scenarios of expanded global biofuel production are presented here utilizing the GCAM integrated assessment model. These scenarios span a range that encompasses on the low end a continuation of existing biofuel production policies to two scenarios that would require an expansion of current targets as well as an extension of biofuels targets to other regions of the world. Conventional oil use is reduced by 4-8% in the expanded biofuel scenarios, which results in a decrease of in CO2 emissions on the order of 1-2 GtCO2/year by mid-century from the global transportation sector. The regional distribution of crop production is relatively unaffected, but the biofuels targets do result in a marked increase in the production of conventional crops used for energy. Producer prices of sugar and corn reach levels about 12% and 7% above year 2005 levels, while the increased competition for land causes the price of food crops such as wheat, although not used for bioenergy in this study, to increase by 1-2%. The amount of land devoted to growing all food crops and dedicated bioenergy crops is increased by about 10% by 2050 in the High biofuel case, with concurrent decreases in other uses of land such as forest and pasture. In both of the expanded biofuels cases studied, there is an increase in net cumulative carbon emissions for the first couple of decades due to these induced land use changes. However, the difference in net cumulative emissions from the biofuels expansion decline by about 2035 as the reductions in energy system emissions exceed further increases in emissions from land use change. Even in the absence of a policy that would limit emissions from land use change, the differences in net cumulative emissions from the biofuels scenarios reach zero by 2050, and are decreasing further over time in both cases. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article presents an assessment of the environmental performance of rapeseed-based biodiesel, addressing alternative geographical locations and cultivation systems for rapeseed (in Spain, France, Germany and Canada). Four environmental impact categories have been assessed using the CML 2001 life-cycle impact assessment method: abiotic depletion; global warming; acidification; and eutrophication. Results show that rapeseed cultivation has the highest contribution to all the environmental impact categories evaluated, with a share between 40% (abiotic depletion, Germany) and 98% (eutrophication, Spain). The use of fertilizers and associated soil emissions are the main contributions to the environmental impacts of cultivation. Soil carbon changes due to different agricultural practices are particularly important in terms of the global warming impact of rapeseed-based biodiesel. The use of fossil methanol in biodiesel production has significant impacts in terms of abiotic depletion and the consumption of heavy fuel oil in transoceanic transportation is an important contributor to acidification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We assessed and compared the production-ecological sustainability of first and second generation biofuel production systems in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. Production ecological sustainability was defined by a limited set of sustainability indicators including net energy yield per hectare, GHG emissions, N leaching, soil organic carbon and soil erosion, and several resource use efficiencies. The assessed first generation fuels are biodiesel and bioethanol produced from rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) feedstock, respectively. Assessed second generation systems are based on feedstock from Miscanthus (Miscanthus×. giganteus Greef et. Deu. ex Hodkinson et Renvoize) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.); for both crops conversion into cellulosic ethanol and Fischer Tropsch Diesel was assessed. In the assessment, computer models were used for simulating crop growth, soil organic carbon dynamics and several other relevant biophysical processes. Second generation biofuel production systems based on Miscanthus and black locust perform substantially better than first generation systems based on rapeseed and sugarbeet. They contribute much more to GHG emission reduction, had much higher net energy yields and better resource use efficiencies; soil erosion and N leaching were also lower. Miscanthus performed better than black locust, except for its N use efficiency; it is the most water-efficient species, which is important in a region with declining groundwater tables. However, in Brandenburg, low temperatures during winter and early spring are often threatening to survival of first-year Miscanthus plantings; there have been disastrous experiences in the past. The drawback of black locust is that it has invasive characteristics; this risk may be controllable however (cf. Motta et al., 2009). Of the first generation systems, rapeseed has low net energy yields and large N requirements per unit of energy produced; it also performed poorly for N leaching. Erosion hazard in rapeseed is especially present after the seedbed has been prepared at the end of summer. Greatest erosion risk was calculated for sugarbeet however, due to its late canopy closure. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the potential of giant reed for biomethane production by examining the influence of harvest time and frequency on the Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP), the kinetics of biomethane accumulation in batch reactors and the expected methane yield per hectare. The crop was cut at five different times, regrowths from early cuts were harvested in autumn and BMP of each cut was assessed. The highest BMP (392NLkgVS-1) and the best kinetics of methane production were associated to juvenile traits of the crop. By coupling the early cuts with the corresponding regrowths (double harvest), the dry biomass (from 35 to 40Mgha-1) equaled that obtained by a single cut at end of the season (38Mgha-1), while the methane yield per hectare (11,585-12,981Nm3ha-1) exceeded up to 35% the methane produced with a single harvest at crop maturity (9452Nm3ha-1). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The thermophilic anaerobe Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum JW/SL-YS485 was investigated as a host for n-butanol production. A systematic approach was taken to demonstrate functionality of heterologous components of the clostridial n-butanol pathway via gene expression and enzymatic activity assays in this organism. Subsequently. , integration of the entire pathway in the wild-type strain resulted in n-butanol production of 0.85. g/L from 10. g/L xylose, corresponding to 21% of the theoretical maximum yield. We were unable to integrate the n-butanol pathway in strains lacking the ability to produce acetate, despite the theoretical overall redox neutrality of n-butanol formation. However, integration of the n-butanol pathway in lactate deficient strains resulted in n-butanol production of 1.05. g/L from 10. g/L xylose, corresponding to 26% of the theoretical maximum. © 2013.

AB  - Biofuels are of increasing interest as alternatives to the petroleum-based fuels. In particular, second and third generation advanced biofuels, that could be produced from renewable materials such as agricultural residues appear to be more competitive. In this context, this work has focused on the potential of the potato peel use (PPW), a zero value waste, as feedstock for bioethanol production. First, an economical medium for amylase production from Bacillus sp. UEB-S (amylase UEB-S) was formulated using potato peel (10gL-1) as a carbon source and soy flour (20gL-1) as a nitrogen source. Amylase production reached 15U/mL at flask scale and increased to 87U/mL at fermenter scale. A comparative study between acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis of PPW was investigated. It showed that a combined enzymatic treatment using amylase UEB-S and Amyloglucosidase under optimal conditions gave significant yields of reducing sugars (69gL-1) and ethanol (21gL-1). These results are highly interesting and demonstrate the possibility of substituting commercial enzyme by an onsite produced enzyme as well as the potential of PPW as bioethanol feedstock. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the indirect land use change (ILUC) effects of ethanol production expansion in Brazil through the use of an inter-regional, bottom-up, dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated with the 2005 Brazilian I-O table. A new methodology to deal with ILUC effects is developed, using a transition matrix of land uses calibrated with Agricultural Censuses data. Agriculture and land use are modeled separately in each of 15 Brazilian regions with different agricultural mix. This regional detail captures a good deal of the differences in soil, climate and history that cause particular land to be used for particular purposes.Brazilian land area data distinguish three broad types of agricultural land use, Crop, Pasture, and Plantation Forestry. Between one year and the next the model allows land to move between those categories, or for unused land to convert to one of these three, driven initially by the transition matrix, changing land supply for agriculture between years. The transition matrix shows Markov probabilities that a particular hectare of land used in one year for some use would be in another use next period. These probabilities are modified endogenously in the model according to the average unit rentals of each land type in each region.We ask whether biofuel expansion is consistent with new laws, limiting forest clearing in Brazil. A simulation with ethanol expansion scenario is performed for year 2020, in which land supply is allowed to increase only in states located on the agricultural frontier. Results suggest that each new hectare of sugar cane requires only 0.14. ha of new land, with another 0.47. ha converted from pasture use. Hence policies limiting deforestation are unlikely to prevent greater ethanol production. Finally, regional differences in sugarcane productivity are found to be important elements in ILUC effects of sugar cane expansion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the production stage of a bioenergy crop is essential for evaluating its eco-efficiency. The objective of this study was to calculate the change in GHG emissions for canola (Brassica napus L.) production on the Canadian Prairies from 1986 to 2006. Net GHG emissions in the sub-humid and semi-arid climatic zones were estimated for fallow-seeded and stubble-seeded canola in intensive-, reduced- and no-tillage systems, with consideration given to emissions associated with synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer input, mineralized N from crop residues, N leaching and volatilization, farm operations, the manufacturing and transportation of fertilizer, agrochemicals and farm machinery, and emission and removal of CO2 associated with changes in land use (LUC) and land management (LMC). The GHG emissions on an area basis were higher in stubble-seeded canola than in fallow-seeded canola but, the opposite was true on a grain dry matter (DM) basis. Nitrous oxide emissions associated with canola production, CO2 emissions associated with farm energy use and the manufacturing of synthetic N fertilizer and its transportation contributed 49% of the GHG emissions in 1986 which increased to 66% in 2006. Average CO2 emissions due to LUC decreased from 27% of total GHG emissions in 1986 to 8% in 2006 and soil C sequestration due to LMC increased from 8% to 37%, respectively. These changes caused a reduction in net GHG emission intensities of 40% on an area basis and of 65% on a grain DM basis. Despite the reduction in GHG emission intensities, GHG emissions associated with canola in the Prairies increased from 3.4TgCO2equiv in 1986 to 3.8TgCO2equiv in 2006 because of the more than doubling of canola production. © 2013.

AB  - Several land-based policy options are discussed within the current quest for feasible climate change mitigation options, among them the creation and conservation of forest carbon sinks through mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation also called REDD+ and the substitution of fossil fuels through biofuels, as legislated in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. While those two policy processes face several methodological challenges, there is one issue that both processes encounter: the displacement of land use and the related emissions, which is referred to as carbon leakage in the context of emissions accounting, and indirect land-use change also called ILUC within the bioenergy realm. The debates surrounding carbon leakage and indirect land-use change issues run in parallel but are rather isolated from each other, without much interaction. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences as well as common challenges within these parallel debates by the use of peer-reviewed articles and reports, with a focus on approaches to address and methods to quantify emissions at national and international scale. The aim is to assess the potential to use synergies and learn from the two debates to optimize climate benefits. The results show that the similarities are many, while the differences between carbon leakage and ILUC are found in the actual commodity at stake and to some degree in the policy forum in which the debate is taken. The geographical scale, actors and parties involved also play a role. Both processes operate under the same theoretical assumption and face the same problem of lacking methods to quantify the emissions caused by international displacement. The approach to international displacement is one of the main differences; while US and EU biofuel policymakers acknowledge uncertainties in ILUC accounting but strive to reduce them, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change excludes accounting for international carbon leakage. Potential explanations behind these differences lie in the liability issue and the underlying accounting principles of producer responsibility for carbon leakage and consumer responsibility for ILUC. This is also reflected on the level of lobby activities, where ILUC has reached greater public and policy interest than carbon leakage. Finally, a possible way forward for international leakage accounting in future climate treaties could be the adoption of accounting methods taking a consumer perspective, to be used alongside the existing set-up, which could improve climate integrity of land-based policies. © 2013 .

AB  - Results of gridded ecosystem simulations of bioenergy crops are used for estimating economic viability, environmental impacts, and potential land use change. Gridded model uncertainty propagates through these uses, thus we propose a simple method for estimating regional, spatial model error from sparse field data. We apply this method to the Agricultural-BioGeochemical Cycles (Agro-BGC) model to examine and reduce the model uncertainty associated with grid scale for simulated switchgrass yields in a 6°latitude×5°longitude (~300,000km2) region covering Illinois, United States of America. Based on three evaluation sites, changes in yield with scale result from complex intra-model interactions driven by a combination of meteorological rather than soil or terrain variables. Spatial bias of the regional mean significantly increases with increasing cell size for 11 of 15 measurement dates. This bias is primarily due to grid scale, thus bias correction of output yield reduces the model uncertainty associated with grid scale. The corresponding Root Mean Squared Error and Bias-Corrected RMSE (RMSEBC) have effectively negligible trends with inconsistent signs. The range of RMSEBC for 2-year Average Mature August Yield (AMAY) is 267-285gCm-2 across 3- to 3600-arcsec resolution (~90m-~100km) with biases from 9 to 61gCm-2. AMAY bias significantly increases with increasing cell size. Spatial bias of the regional mean is relatively consistent for resolutions ≤1200arcsec (~33km) (AMAY bias &lt;3%), and larger AMAY biases (4-13%) at coarse resolutions indicate poorly characterized spatial heterogeneity. Including the 68% confidence interval around bias-corrected values, AMAY ranges from 0 to 1116gCm-2 across a 150-arsec grid, which is similar to the range reported for 24 eastern United States field sites. Spatial bias of the regional mean yield can vary across grid resolution by as much as 31% of the observed regional mean and can dramatically affect calculations dependent on the resolution of the estimate. We conclude that grid scale profoundly affects model accuracy such that regional studies must match evaluation and simulation scales and should utilize multi-scale analyses to determine robustness of results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas, an oilseed shrub, raised hopes that it could produce biofuel in a 'sustainable' manner, though early results fell short of these expectations. Drawing on field research from 2009, this paper examines the political economy of jatropha in Kenya using Tsing's 'economy of appearances' concept. Tsing's observation that start-up enterprises perpetuate 'myth' and 'spectacle' to build momentum fits patterns observed in this case. Jatropha's promoters reinforced an optimistic discourse, defended it against dissent and linked jatropha to global, national and local goals. However, the emergence of stronger critiques raises questions about how long its positive appearances can be maintained. © 2014 © 2014 ROAPE Publications Ltd.

AB  - Climate, Energy, Water and Land-use Systems (CLEWS) are closely integrated. Yet, most related decision and policy making occurs in disparate institutional entities, informed by relatively disconnected assessments of the individual resource systems. This paper presents the added value of an integrated analytical assessment approach. In doing so, it explicitly values various interdependencies and interactions between CLEWS primarily from an energy sector perspective. The island state of Mauritius was identified as a useful case study given its diverse climate, its increasing water stresses, and its policy focus on reshaping agricultural land-use and reducing fossil fuel imports. Several scenarios to 2030 were defined and analysed to demonstrate the tensions around the CLEWS nexus. Results from an assessment of the energy system with no modelled interlinkages to land-use, energy and water systems are first presented. Then, these are compared to those from an integrated CLEWS assessment. This serves to highlight important dynamics that would have been overlooked without such a systems approach. As an example, the added value of this approach is clearly demonstrated when rainfall reductions are taken into account, and where future land-use changes might occur. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As the production of biofuels continues to expand worldwide, criticism about, e.g. the energy output versus input and the competition with food has been questioned. However, biofuels have the possibility to be optimized in order to improve the environmental performance. This could be accomplished through the use of concepts from industrial symbiosis. This paper provides a quantification of the environmental performance of industrial symbiosis in the biofuel industry through integration of biogas and ethanol processes using a life cycle approach. Results show that although increasing integration is assumed to produce environmental benefits, not all impact categories have achieved this and the results depend upon the allocation methods, energy system and assumptions chosen. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Second generation biodiesel uses cooking oil wastes, vegetal oils cultivated in marginal lands, or algae-based oils. The quest of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis is motivated by the option of by-passing saponification and neutralization steps, enabling proper catalyst recoveries, and performing esterifications and transesterifications simultaneously, as impure waste oils contain a significant concentration of free fatty acids (FFA). This paper evaluates the use of chitosan-cryogels as catalysts for (trans)esterification reactions of different oils with methanol. Being a worldwide available waste material, the use of chitosan as catalyst for biofuel production might add novel possibilities for the valorization of local areas. Chitosan-cryogels catalyzed successfully the transesterification of triolein and soybean oil with methanol to afford biodiesel yields of up to 90% (FAME) in 8-32 h at 100-150 C. Chitosan beads could be partially recycled by washing them with tert-butanol and methanol to desorb fats and glycerol. To reach a practical use, further opportunities for research and development can be identified at the level of catalyst design, delivering chitosan-based novel catalysts - e.g. aerogels, layers, chitosan-based derivatizations, etc. -, that could enable more efficient catalytic rates and would display largely improved recyclability outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study describes a method for reducing the emissions of toxic organic pollutants from heavy duty diesel engines fueled by biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO). An analytical method was developed to simultaneously measure five pollutants from one exhaust sample, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorined dibenzo-. p-dixins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-. p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). As yet, no data regarding PBDD/F emissions from mobile sources has been reported in the literature. The mass concentrations in the exhaust, in order, were PAHs. ≫. PBDEs. ≫. PBDD/Fs. >. PCBs. >. PCDD/Fs, while for the pollutants having dioxin-like toxicity, their toxicity concentrations, in order, were PCDD/Fs. >. PBDD/Fs. >. PCBs. These concentrations were two to four orders higher than those in the atmosphere. Even though the chlorine content in the WCO-based biodiesel was five times higher than that of fossil diesel, the reduction in the emission factors of the aforesaid pollutants increased along with the percentage of biodiesel. For example, B20 achieved a 49-73% and 61-83% reduction in mass and toxicity, respectively. In conclusion, the use of WCO-based biodiesel not only solves the problem of waste oil disposal, but also reduces the toxic organic pollutant emissions from diesel engines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biotic pollination is an important ecosystem service for the production of many food crops. The supply of pollination is mostly studied at the landscape scale while recent studies on the demand for pollination services provide a global-scale picture based on aggregate national-level data. This paper quantifies both demand and supply of pollination in the European Union (EU) at a relatively high spatial resolution, allowing an analysis of the match between demand and supply. Finally, we evaluate how policies interact with the spatial differences between demand and supply of this ecosystem service. We mapped the crop area requiring pollination for optimal production (demand) and both bee habitat and related visitation probability (supply) using detailed agricultural and landscape data. We compared the maps of demand and supply by visual comparison, descriptive statics and a trend surface generalized additive model to analyze the relation between visitation probability and the presence or absence of pollinator dependent crops. A sensitivity analysis was done to test the robustness of the pollination supply model. Finally, the impact of EU Biodiversity Strategy and Biofuel Directive were evaluated by identifying areas where these policies would influence the demand or supply of pollination. In the EU, 12% of the total cropland area was dependent on pollinators for optimal agricultural production. Pollinator habitat is especially abundant in mosaic landscapes as found in hilly and mountainous areas. Although covering less than 0.5% of the agricultural area, the presence of green linear elements increased the visitation probability by 5-20% while being the sole providers of pollinators in 12% of the croplands. In half of the area with a high pollination demand, the supply of pollination is also high. Irrespective of the different parameterizations, total habitat areas and visitation probability were highest in croplands without pollinator dependent crops and lowest in hotspots of pollination demand. The analysis of the match between pollination supply and demand for this service indicates that for improving or ensuring pollination one must consider both the demand and supply of the process of crop pollination for optimal results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rivers export increasing amounts of dissolved inorganic (DIN, DIP) and organic (DON, DOP) nitrogen and phosphorus to the Black Sea causing coastal eutrophication. The aim of this study is to explore future trends in river export of these nutrients to the sea through a sensitivity analysis. We used the Global NEWS (Nutrient Export from WaterSheds) model to this end. We calculated that between 2000 and 2050 nutrient inputs to the Black Sea may increase or decrease, depending on the assumed environmental management. We analyzed the effects of agricultural and sewage management on nutrient inputs to the sea in 2050 relative to two Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) scenarios, Global Orchestration (GO) and Adaptive Mosaic (AM). In these baselines, total N and P inputs to the Black Sea decrease between 2000 and 2050, but not for all rivers and nutrient forms. Our results indicate that it is possible to reduce nutrient inputs to the sea further between 2000 and 2050 in particular for dissolved inorganic N and P and for many river basins, but not for all. For scenarios assuming combined agricultural and sewage management dissolved inorganic N and P inputs to the Black Sea are reduced by up to two-thirds between 2000 and 2050 and dissolved organic N and P inputs by one-third. River export of DIN is mainly affected by agricultural management and that of DIP by sewage management. On the other hand, in scenarios assuming increased fertilizer use for, for instance bioenergy crops, nutrient inputs to the sea increase. An increase in DIP inputs by southern rivers seems difficult to avoid because of the increasing number of people connected to sewage systems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stronger demand for medium- to long-haul air transport is the main driver of the tourism industry's increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, causing the current development of global tourism to be environmentally unsustainable. Efficiency improvements and biofuel usage are unlikely to maintain pace with the projected growth in transport volume. Therefore, curbing the growing demand for air transport has been suggested as another option for the sustainable development of tourism. However, the political and industry discourse concerning the restriction of air transport tends to label such a restriction as unethical, as such limits would impair the development that tourism brings to poor countries. This paper investigates the possible impacts of air travel restrictions on the least developed countries (LDCs) and non-LDCs by examining global tourism. The impacts on LDCs are found to be 'neutral' on average, with both losses and gains in tourist arrivals. The extent of any losses does not appear to be beyond the scope of possible economic compensation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
